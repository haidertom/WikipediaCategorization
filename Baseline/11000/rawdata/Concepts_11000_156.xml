'''Alternatives to evolution by natural selection''', also described as '''non-Darwinian mechanisms of evolution''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Darwinian mechanisms of evolution and their authors|url=http://darwiniana.com/2012/02/24/non-darwinian-mechanisms-of-evolution-and-their-authors/|publisher=Darwiniana|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been proposed by scholars investigating biology since classical times to explain signs of [[evolution]] and the [[Homology (biology)|relatedness]] of different groups of living things. The alternatives in question do not encompass religious points of view such as young or old earth [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]], but are limited to explanations proposed by biologists, though one was confusingly named 'theistic evolution' by [[Asa Gray]].

Where the fact of evolutionary change was accepted but the mechanism proposed by [[Charles Darwin]], [[natural selection]], was denied, explanations of evolution such as [[Lamarckism]], [[catastrophism]], [[orthogenesis]], [[vitalism]], [[structuralism (biology)|structuralism]] and [[mutationism]] (called saltationism before 1900) were entertained. Different factors motivated people to propose non-[[Darwinism|Darwinian]] mechanisms of evolution. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to some naturalists because they felt it immoral, leaving little room for [[Teleology in biology|teleology]] or the concept of progress in the development of life. Some who came to accept evolution, but disliked natural selection, raised religious objections. Others felt that evolution was an inherently progressive process that natural selection alone was insufficient to explain. Still others felt that nature, including the development of life, followed orderly patterns that natural selection could not explain.

By the start of the 20th century, evolution was generally accepted by biologists but [[eclipse of Darwinism|natural selection was in eclipse]].{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=246–281}} Many alternative theories were proposed, but biologists were quick to discount theories such as orthogenesis, vitalism and Lamarckism which offered no mechanism for evolution. Mutationism did propose a mechanism, but it was not generally accepted. The [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] a generation later claimed to sweep away all the alternatives to Darwinian evolution, though some have been revived as molecular mechanisms for them have been discovered.

==Unchanging forms==
{{main|Hylomorphism|Great chain of being}}

[[Aristotle]] did not embrace either divine creation or evolution, instead arguing [[Aristotle's biology|in his biology]] that each species (''eidos'') was immutable, breeding true to its [[Hylomorphism|ideal eternal form]] (not the same as Plato's [[theory of Forms]]).{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=12–13}}{{sfn|Leroi|2015|p=89}} Aristotle's suggestion in ''[[De Generatione Animalium]]'' of a fixed hierarchy in nature - a ''scala naturae'' ("ladder of nature") provided an early explanation of the continuity of living things.{{sfn|Lloyd|1968|pp=166–169}}{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pp=276–278}}{{sfn|Mayr|1985|pp=201–202}} Aristotle saw that animals were [[teleology|teleological]] (functionally end-directed), and had parts that were [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with those of other animals, but he did not connect these ideas into a concept of evolutionary progress.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=43}}

In the Middle Ages, [[Scholasticism]] developed Aristotle's view into the idea of a [[great chain of being]].{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=21–23}} The image of a ladder inherently suggests the possibility of climbing, but both the ancient Greeks and mediaeval scholastics such as [[Ramon Lull]]{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=21–23}} maintained that each species remained fixed from the moment of its creation.{{sfn|Lovejoy|2011|p=228 and passim}}{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=43}}

By 1818, however, [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] argued in his ''Philosophie anatomique'' that the chain was "a progressive series", where animals like molluscs low on the chain could "rise, by addition of parts, from the simplicity of the first formations to the complication of the creatures at the head of the scale", given sufficient time. Accordingly, Geoffroy and later biologists looked for explanations of such evolutionary change.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=95}}

[[Georges Cuvier]]'s 1812 ''Recherches sur les Ossements Fossiles'' set out his doctrine of the correlation of parts, namely that since an organism was a whole system, all its parts mutually corresponded, contributing to the function of the whole. So, from a single bone the zoologist could often tell what class or even genus the animal belonged to. And if an animal had teeth adapted for cutting meat, the zoologist could be sure without even looking that its sense organs would be those of a predator and its intestines those of a carnivore. A species had an irreducible functional complexity, and "none of its parts can change without the others changing too".{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=18–21}} Evolutionists expected one part to change at a time, one change to follow another. In Cuvier's view, evolution was impossible, as any one change would unbalance the whole delicate system.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=18–21}}

[[Louis Agassiz]]'s 1856 "Essay on Classification" exemplified German philosophical idealism. This held that each species was complex within itself, had complex relationships to other organisms, and fitted precisely into its environment, as a pine tree in a forest, and could not survive outside those circles. The argument from such ideal forms opposed evolution without offering an actual alternative mechanism. [[Richard Owen]] held a similar view in Britain.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=42–43, 111}}

The Lamarckian social philosopher and evolutionist [[Herbert Spencer]], ironically the author of the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]" adopted by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]],{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=239, 342}} used an argument like Cuvier's to oppose natural selection. In 1893, he stated that a change in any one structure of the body would require all the other parts to adapt to fit in with the new arrangement. From this, he argued that it was unlikely that all the changes could appear at the right moment if each one depended on random variation; whereas in a Lamarckian world, all the parts would naturally adapt at once, through a changed pattern of use and disuse.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=149, 253, 259}}

==Alternative explanations of change==
{{further|Eclipse of Darwinism}}

Where the fact of evolutionary change was accepted by biologists but [[natural selection]] was denied, including but not limited to the late 19th century [[eclipse of Darwinism]], alternative scientific explanations such as [[Lamarckism]], [[orthogenesis]], [[structuralism]], [[catastrophism]], [[vitalism]] and theistic evolution&lt;!--don't link, that's a different topic--&gt;{{efn|Not to be confused with the more recent use of the term [[theistic evolution]], which refers to a theological belief in the compatibility of science and religion.}} were entertained, not necessarily separately. (Purely religious points of view such as young or old earth [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]] are not considered here.) Different factors motivated people to propose non-Darwinian evolutionary mechanisms. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to some naturalists because they felt it immoral, leaving little room for [[Teleology in biology|teleology]] or the concept of progress in the development of life.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=197}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=119–120}} Some of these scientists and philosophers, like [[St. George Jackson Mivart]] and [[Charles Lyell]], who came to accept evolution but disliked natural selection, raised religious objections.{{sfn|Quammen|2006|pp=209–210}} Others, such as the biologist and philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]], the botanist [[George Henslow]] (son of Darwin's mentor [[John Stevens Henslow]], also a botanist), and the author [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], felt that evolution was an inherently progressive process that natural selection alone was insufficient to explain. Still others, including the American paleontologists [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], had an idealist perspective and felt that nature, including the development of life, followed orderly patterns that natural selection could not explain.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}

Some felt that natural selection would be too slow, given the estimates of the [[age of the earth]] and sun (10–100 million years) being made at the time by physicists such as [[Lord Kelvin]], and some felt that natural selection could not work because at the time the models for inheritance involved blending of inherited characteristics, an objection raised by the engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] in a review of ''Origin'' written shortly after its publication.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=105–129}} Another factor at the end of the 19th century was the rise of a new faction of biologists, typified by geneticists like [[Hugo de Vries]] and [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], who wanted to recast biology as an experimental laboratory science. They distrusted the work of naturalists like Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], dependent on field observations of variation, adaptation, and [[biogeography]], as being overly anecdotal. Instead they focused on topics like [[physiology]] and [[genetics]] that could be investigated with controlled experiments in the laboratory, and discounted less accessible phenomena like natural selection and [[adaptation]] to the environment.{{sfn|Endersby|2007|pp=143–147,182}}

===Vitalism===
[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis Pasteur]] believed that only living things could carry out [[fermentation]]. Painting by [[Albert Edelfelt]], 1885]]
{{main|Vitalism}}

Vitalism holds that living organisms differ from other things in containing something non-physical, such as a fluid or vital spirit, that makes them live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm |author=Bechtel, William; Robert C. Richardson |date=1998 |title=Vitalism |editor=Craig, E. |work=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory dates to ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jidenu, Paulin |date=1996 |title=African Philosophy |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-21096-8 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|BirchCobb|1985|pp=76–78}}
Since [[Early Modern]] times, vitalism stood in contrast to the mechanistic explanation of biological systems started by [[Descartes]]. Nineteenth century chemists  set out to disprove the claim that forming organic compounds required vitalist influence.&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt; In 1828, [[Friedrich Wöhler]] showed that [[urea]] could be made entirely from inorganic chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kinne-Saffran |first1=E. |last2=Kinne |first2=R. K. H. |title=Vitalism and Synthesis of Urea |journal=American Journal of Nephrology|date=1999 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=290–292 |doi=10.1159/000013463}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Pasteur]] believed that [[fermentation]] required whole organisms, which he supposed carried out chemical reactions found only in living things. The embryologist [[Hans Driesch]], experimenting on [[sea urchin]] eggs, showed that separating the first two cells led to two complete but small [[blastula]]s, seemingly showing that cell division did not divide the egg into sub-mechanisms, but created more cells each with the vital capability to form a new organism. Vitalism faded out with the demonstration of more satisfactory mechanistic explanations of each of the functions of a living cell or organism.&lt;ref name=Bechtel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Bechtel |first1=William |last2=Richardson |first2=Robert C. |title=Vitalism |editor=Craig, E. |work=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=https://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm |publisher=Routledge |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Driesch, Hans |authorlink=Hans Driesch |year=1914 |title=The History and Theory of Vitalism |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1931, biologists had "almost unanimously abandoned vitalism as an acknowledged belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bedau, Mark A.; Cleland, Carol E. |title=The Nature of Life: Classical and Contemporary Perspectives from Philosophy and Science |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=95 |isbn=978-0-521-51775-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theistic evolution===

The American botanist [[Asa Gray]] used the name "theistic evolution"{{efn|Gray, and later historians of science, did not refer to a 20th century usage of [[theistic evolution]] (described in that article), that one can accept Darwinian evolution without being an atheist.}} for his point of view, presented in his 1876 book ''Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gray, Asa |authorlink=Asa Gray |year=1876 |title=Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism |publisher=Appleton |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.19483|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.19483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the deity supplies beneficial mutations to guide evolution. [[St George Jackson Mivart]] argued instead in his 1871 ''On the Genesis of Species'' that the deity, equipped with foreknowledge, sets the direction of evolution by specifying the (orthogenetic) laws that govern it, and leaves species to evolve according to the conditions they experience as time goes by. [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|The Duke of Argyll]] set out similar views in his 1867 book ''The Reign of Law''.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–128}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=George|title=The Reign of Law|date=1867|publisher=Strahan|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/argyll/5rl.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian Edward Larson, the theory failed as an explanation in the minds of late 19th century biologists as it broke the rules of [[methodological naturalism]] which they had grown to expect.{{sfn|Larson|2004|p=126}} Accordingly, by around 1900, biologists no longer saw theistic evolution as a valid theory. In Larson's view, by then it "did not even merit a nod among scientists." Biologists might argue about mechanisms, but they were in no doubt that a mechanistic explanation was needed.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–128}} In the 20th century, theistic evolution could take other forms, such as the orthogenesis of Teilhard de Chardin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Morris, John D.; Morris, Henry M. |title=The Modern Creation Trilogy |year=1998 |publisher=New Leaf |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthogenesis===
[[File:Titanothere Osborn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] claimed in 1918 that [[Titanothere]] horns showed a non-[[adaptation|adaptive]] [[Orthogenesis|orthogenetic]] trend.]]
{{main|Orthogenesis}}

Orthogenesis is the hypothesis that life has an innate tendency to change, developing in a unilinear fashion in a particular direction, or simply making some kind of definite progress. Many different versions have been proposed, some such as that of [[Teilhard de Chardin]] openly spiritual, others such as [[Theodor Eimer]]'s apparently simply biological. These theories often combined orthogenesis with other supposed mechanisms. For example, Eimer believed in Lamarckian evolution, but felt that internal laws of growth determined which characteristics would be acquired and would guide the long-term direction of evolution.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=249}}{{sfn|Quammen|2006|p=221}}

Orthogenesis was popular among paleontologists such as [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]. They believed that the fossil record showed unidirectional change, but did not necessarily accept that the mechanism driving orthogenesis was [[teleological]] (goal-directed). Osborn argued in his 1918 book ''Origin and Evolution of Life'' that trends in [[Titanothere]] horns were both orthogenetic and non-[[adaptation|adaptive]], and could be detrimental to the organism. For instance, they supposed that the large antlers of the [[Irish elk]] had caused its extinction.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=249}}{{sfn|Quammen|2006|p=221}}

===Lamarckism===
{{main|Lamarckism}}
[[File:Jean-baptiste lamarck2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], drawn by [[Jules Pizzetta]], 1893]]

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s 1809 evolutionary theory, [[transmutation of species]], was based on a progressive (orthogenetic) drive toward greater complexity. Lamarck also shared the belief, common at the time, that [[inheritance of acquired characteristics|characteristics acquired during an organism's life could be inherited]] by the next generation, producing adaptation to the environment. Such characteristics were caused by the use or disuse of the affected part of the body. This minor component of Lamarck's theory became known, much later, as [[Lamarckism]].{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=86–95}} Darwin included ''Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection'' in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', giving examples such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the [[ostrich]], they could not fly at all.{{sfn|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F391&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=136 108]}} In the late 19th century, [[neo-Lamarckism]] was supported by the German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]], the American [[paleontologist]]s [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], and the American [[entomology|entomologist]] [[Alpheus Spring Packard|Alpheus Packard]]. Butler and Cope believed that this allowed organisms to effectively drive their own evolution.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=236}} Packard argued that the loss of vision in the blind cave insects he studied was best explained through a Lamarckian process of atrophy through disuse combined with inheritance of acquired characteristics.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=236}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–129}}{{sfn|Quammen|2006|p=217}} Meanwhile, the English botanist [[George Henslow]] studied how environmental stress affected the development of plants, and he wrote that the variations induced by such environmental factors could largely explain evolution; he did not see the need to demonstrate that such variations could actually be inherited.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=239–240}} Critics pointed out that there was no solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Instead, the experimental work of the German biologist [[August Weismann]] resulted in the germ plasm theory of inheritance, which Weismann said made the inheritance of acquired characteristics impossible, since the [[Weismann barrier]] would prevent any changes that occurred to the body after birth from being inherited by the next generation.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–129}}{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=253–255}}

In modern [[epigenetics]], biologists observe that [[phenotype]]s depend on heritable changes to [[gene expression]] that do not involve changes to the [[DNA sequence]]. [[Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance|These changes can cross generations]] in plants, animals, and [[prokaryote]]s. This is not identical to traditional Lamarckism, as the changes do not last indefinitely and do not affect the germ line and hence the evolution of genes.&lt;ref name=Heard&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heard, E.; Martienssen, R.

===Catastrophism===
{{main|Catastrophism}}

Catastrophism is the [[hypothesis]], argued by the French [[anatomist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Georges Cuvier]] in his 1812 ''Recherches sur les ossements fossiles de quadrupèdes'', that the various [[extinction]]s and the patterns of [[faunal succession]] seen in the [[fossil]] record were caused by large-scale natural catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions and, for the most recent extinctions in Eurasia, the inundation of low-lying areas by the [[sea]]. This was explained purely by natural events: he did not mention [[Noah's flood]],{{sfn|McGowan|2001|pp=3–6}} nor did he ever refer to divine creation as the mechanism for repopulation after an extinction event, though he did not support evolutionary theories such as those of his contemporaries Lamarck and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire either.{{sfn|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–134}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |year=1996 |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/cuvier.html |title=Georges Cuvier (1769–1832) |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier believed that the [[stratigraphic]] record indicated that there had been several such catastrophes, recurring natural events, separated by long periods of stability during the history of life on earth. This led him to believe the Earth was several million years old.{{sfn|Rudwick|1972|p=131}}

Catastrophism has found a place in modern biology with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period, as proposed in a paper by 
[[Walter Alvarez|Walter]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] in 1980. It argued that a {{convert|10|km|mi}} [[asteroid]] [[Alvarez hypothesis|struck Earth 66 million years ago]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period.

[[File:Darcythompson.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4&lt;!--width for low image--&gt;|In his 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]'', [[D'Arcy Thompson]] illustrated the [[Transformation (geometry)|geometric transformation]] of [[Argyropelecus|one fish's]] body form into [[Sternoptyx|another]] with a 20° [[shear mapping]].

Biological structuralism objects to an exclusively Darwinian explanation of natural selection, arguing that other mechanisms also guide evolution, and sometimes implying that these supersede selection altogether.{{sfn|Ruse|2013|pp=419}} Structuralists have proposed different mechanisms that might have guided the formation of [[body plan]]s.

It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was popular with early geneticists such as [[Hugo de Vries]], who along with [[Carl Correns]] helped rediscover [[Gregor Mendel]]'s laws of inheritance in 1900, [[William Bateson]], a British zoologist who switched to genetics, and early in his career, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]. These ideas developed into [[mutationism]], the mutation theory of evolution.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=265–270}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=127–129, 157–167}} This held that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation, based on de Vries's experiments with the evening primrose, ''[[Oenothera]]'', from 1886. The primroses seemed to be constantly producing new varieties with striking variations in form and color, some of which appeared to be new species because plants of the new generation could only be crossed with one another, not with their parents.{{sfn|Endersby|2007|pp=148–162}} However, [[Hermann Joseph Muller]] showed in 1918 that the new varieties de Vries had observed were the result of [[polyploid]] hybrids rather than rapid genetic mutation.{{sfn|Endersby|2007|pp=202–205}}

Initially, de Vries and Morgan believed that mutations were so large as to create new forms such as subspecies or even species instantly. Morgan's 1910 fruit fly experiments, in which he isolated mutations for characteristics such as white eyes, changed his mind. He saw that mutations represented small [[Mendelian]] characteristics that would only spread through a population when they were beneficial, helped by natural selection. This represented the germ of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], and the beginning of the end for mutationism as an evolutionary force.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=310–311}}

However this does not cause [[phenotype|phenotypic]] evolution.]]
{{main|Neutral theory of molecular evolution}}

The [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]], proposed by [[Motoo Kimura]] in 1968, holds that at the [[DNA sequence|molecular level]] most [[evolution]]ary changes and most of the variation within and between species is not caused by [[natural selection]] but by [[genetic drift]] of [[mutation|mutant]] [[allele]]s that are neutral. A [[neutral mutation]] is one that does not affect an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. The neutral theory allows for the possibility that most mutations are deleterious, but holds that because these are rapidly purged by natural selection, they do not make significant contributions to variation within and between species at the molecular level. Mutations that are not deleterious are assumed to be mostly neutral rather than beneficial.&lt;ref name=Kimura83/&gt;

The theory was controversial as it sounded like a challenge to Darwinian evolution; controversy was intensified by a 1969 paper by [[Jack Lester King]] and [[Thomas H. Jukes]], provocatively but misleadingly titled "[[Non-Darwinian Evolution (paper)|Non-Darwinian Evolution]]". It provided a wide variety of evidence including [[protein sequence]] comparisons, studies of the Treffers mutator gene in ''[[E. coli]]'',  analysis of the genetic code, and comparative [[immunology]], to argue that most protein evolution is due to neutral mutations and genetic drift.&lt;ref name=KingJukes1969&gt;{{cite journal |volume=164 |issue=3881 |pages=788–798 |last=King |first=Jack Lester |author2=Thomas H.

==Combined theories==
[[File:Alternatives to Darwinism.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Multiple explanations have been offered since the 19th century for how evolution took place, given that many scientists initially had objections to natural selection (dashed orange arrows). Many of these theories led (blue arrows) to some form of directed evolution ([[orthogenesis]]), with or without invoking [[theistic evolution|divine control]] (dotted blue arrows) directly or indirectly. For example, evolutionists like [[Edward Drinker Cope]] believed in a combination of theistic evolution, Lamarckism, vitalism, and orthogenesis,{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261–262}} represented by the sequence of arrows on the extreme left of the diagram.]]

The various alternatives to Darwinian evolution by natural selection were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist [[Edward Drinker Cope]] is a case in point. Cope, a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during the growth of the embryo - that [[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]], which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both in [[embryology]] and [[palaeontology]]. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to Lamarckism to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, "bathmism", to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop at the expense of the rest. Cope's complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, Lamarckism, and vitalism.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261–262}} Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and Lamarckism until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|p=264}}

==Rebirth of natural selection, with continuing alternatives==
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

By the start of the 20th century, during the [[eclipse of Darwinism]], biologists were doubtful of natural selection, but equally were quick to discount theories such as orthogenesis, vitalism and Lamarckism which offered no mechanism for evolution. Mutationism did propose a mechanism, but it was not generally accepted.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=128–129}} The [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] a generation later, roughly between 1918 and 1932, broadly swept away all the alternatives to Darwinism, though some including forms of orthogenesis,&lt;ref name=Stoltzfus/&gt;  [[transgenerational epigenetic inheritance|epigenetic mechanisms]] that resemble Lamarckian [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]],&lt;ref name=Heard/&gt; catastrophism,&lt;ref name=Alvarez/&gt; structuralism,&lt;ref name=Goodwin/&gt; and mutationism&lt;ref name=Stoltzfus_on_Nei2014/&gt; have been revived, such as through the discovery of molecular mechanisms.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=222–243, 284–286}}

Biology has become Darwinian, but belief in some form of progress (orthogenesis) remains both in the public mind and among biologists. Ruse argues that evolutionary biologists will probably continue to believe in progress for three reasons. Firstly, the [[anthropic principle]] demands people able to ask about the process that led to their own existence, as if they were the pinnacle of such progress. Secondly, scientists in general and evolutionists in particular believe that their work is leading them progressively closer to [[philosophical realism|a true grasp of reality]], as knowledge increases, and hence (runs the argument) there is progress in nature also. Ruse notes in this regard that [[Richard Dawkins]] explicitly compares cultural progress with [[meme]]s to biological progress with genes. Thirdly, evolutionists are self-selected; they are people, such as the entomologist and sociobiologist [[E. O. Wilson]], who are interested in progress to supply a meaning for life.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=536–539}}

[[File:Edvard Munch - The Scream - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Edvard Munch]] tried to represent "an infinite scream passing through nature" in ''[[The Scream]]'' (1893).]]

'''Angst''' means [[fear]] or [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] (''[[anguish]]'' is its [[Romance languages|Latinate]] [[cognate|equivalent]], and ''anxious,'' ''anxiety'' are of similar origin). The word ''angst'' was introduced into English from the [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''angst'' and the [[German language|German]] word ''Angst''. It is attested since the 19th century in English translations of the works of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/angst|title=Angst - Definition of Angst by Merriam-Webster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/angst|title=Angst - Define Angst at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=angst&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in English to describe an intense feeling of apprehension, anxiety, or inner turmoil.

In other languages, having the meaning of the Latin word ''pavor'' for "fear", the derived words differ in meaning; for example, as in the French ''anxiété'' and ''peur''. The word ''angst'' has existed since the 8th century, from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European root]] ''*anghu-'', "restraint" from which [[Old High German]] ''angust'' developed.&lt;ref name=Collins &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/angst|title=Angst - definition of angst by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is pre-cognate with the Latin ''[[wikt:angustia#Latin|angustia]]'', "tensity, tightness" and ''[[wikt:angor#Latin|angor]]'', "choking, clogging"; compare to the [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:ἄγχω|ἄγχω]] (''ankho'') "strangle".

== Existentialist angst ==
{{See also|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Dread or anxiety}}
In [[Existentialism|Existentialist]] [[philosophy]], the term ''angst'' carries a specific conceptual meaning. The use of the term was first attributed to [[Denmark|Danish]] [[philosopher]] [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813&amp;ndash;1855). In ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'' (also known as ''The Concept of Dread'', depending on the translation), Kierkegaard used the word ''Angest'' (in common Danish, ''angst'', meaning "dread" or "anxiety") to describe a profound and deep-seated condition. Where non-human animals are guided solely by [[instinct]], said Kierkegaard, human beings enjoy a freedom of choice that we find both appealing and terrifying.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news|first=Gordon|last=Marino|title=The Danish Doctor of Dread|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/the-danish-doctor-of-dread/|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|date=March 17, 2012|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the anxiety of understanding of being free when considering undefined possibilities of one's life and one's power of choice over them.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Backhouse|first1=Stephen|title=Kierkegaard: A Single Life|date=2016|publisher=HarperCollins Christian Publishing|isbn=9780310520894|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=MLTxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT176|accessdate=17 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard's concept of angst reappeared in the works of existentialist [[philosopher]]s who followed, such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Martin Heidegger]], each of whom developed the idea further in individual ways. While Kierkegaard's angst referred mainly to ambiguous feelings about moral freedom within a [[religion|religious personal belief system]], later existentialists discussed conflicts of personal principles, cultural norms, and [[existential despair]].
[[File:Marl Gerdes.JPG|thumb|[[Ludger Gerdes]], ''Angst'', 1989]]

== Music ==
Existential angst makes its appearance in classical [[musical composition]] in the early twentieth century as a result of both philosophical developments and as a reflection of the war-torn times. Notable composers whose works are often linked with the concept include [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]] (operas ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' and ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]''), [[Claude-Achille Debussy]] (opera ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelleas et Melisande]]'', ballet ''[[Jeux]]'', other works), [[Jean Sibelius]] (especially the Fourth Symphony), [[Arnold Schoenberg]] ''([[A Survivor from Warsaw]]'', other works), [[Alban Berg]], [[Francis Poulenc]] (opera ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites]]''), [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (opera ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', symphonies and chamber music), [[Béla Bartók]] (opera ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'', other works), and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] (especially ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]'').
 
Angst began to be discussed in reference to popular music in the mid- to late 1950s amid widespread concerns over [[Cold War|international tensions]] and [[nuclear proliferation]]. [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s book ''[[Bomb Culture]]'' (1968) traced angst in popular culture to [[Hiroshima]]. Dread was expressed in works of [[folk rock]] such as [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Masters of War]]'' (1963) and ''[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]''. The term often makes an appearance in reference to [[punk rock]], [[grunge]], [[nu metal]], and works of [[emo]] where expressions of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], [[existential despair]], or [[nihilism]] predominate.

{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}
[[File:ASMR Map.png|thumb|An illustration of the route of ASMR's tingling sensation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barratt|first=Emma L.|last2=Davis|first2=Nick J.|date=2015|title=Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR): a flow-like mental state|journal=PeerJ|volume=3|pages=e851|doi=10.7717/peerj.851|issn=2167-8359|pmc=4380153|pmid=25834771}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Autonomous sensory meridian response''' ('''ASMR''') is an experience characterized by a static-like or tingling sensation on the skin that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. It has been compared with [[Synesthesia#Auditory-tactile synesthesia|auditory-tactile synesthesia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simner|first1=Julia|last2=Mulvenna|first2=Catherine|last3=Sagiv|first3=Noam|last4=Tsakanikos|first4=Elias|last5=Witherby|first5=Sarah A.|last6=Fraser|first6=Christine|last7=Scott|first7=Kirsten|last8=Ward|first8=Jamie|title=Synaesthesia: the prevalence of atypical cross-modal experiences|journal=Perception|date=2006|volume=35|issue=8|doi=10.1068/p5469|url=http://pec.sagepub.com/content/35/8/1024|accessdate=25 November 2016|pages=1024–1033|pmid=17076063}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Banissy|first1=Michael J.|last2=Jonas|first2=Clare|last3=Cohen Kadosh|first3=Roi|title=Synesthesia: an introduction|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=15 December 2014|volume=5|issue=1414|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01414|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01414/full|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may overlap with [[frisson]].

ASMR signifies the subjective experience of "low-grade euphoria" characterized by "a combination of positive feelings and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin". It is most commonly triggered by specific auditory or visual stimuli, and less commonly by intentional attention control.&lt;ref name="PMID25834771"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barratt Emma, Davis Nick | year = 2015 | title = Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR): a flow-like mental state | url = | journal = [[PeerJ]] | volume = 3 | issue = | page = e851 | doi = 10.7717/peerj.851 | pmid = 25834771 | pmc=4380153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID24375123"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ahuja Nitin | year = 2013 | title = It feels good to be measured: clinical role-play, Walker Percy, and the tingles | url = | journal = [[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]] | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 442–451 | pmid = 24375123 | doi=10.1353/pbm.2013.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Prior to the subsequent social [[consensus]] that led to what is now the ubiquitous adoption of that term, other names were proposed and discussed at a number of locations including the Steady Health forum, the Society of Sensationalists Yahoo! group and the Unnamed Feeling Blog.{{who|date=October 2018}}

Proposed formal names included "auditory induced head orgasm", "attention induced euphoria" and "attention induced observant euphoria", while [[colloquialism|colloquial]] terms in usage included "brain massage", "head tingle", "brain tingle", "spine tingle" and "brain orgasm".&lt;ref&gt;Lively, Daniel (19 April 2012). [http://www.corvallisadvocate.com/2012/that-tingling-feeling-first-international-asmr-day/ 'That tingling feeling: first international ASMR day']. The Corvallis Advocate. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.konbini.com/us/lifestyle/asmr-relaxation-trend-interview/|title=What Is ASMR And Can It Really Give You Brain Orgasms?|last=Eustache|first=Louis|date=22 November 2016|website=Konbini United States|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many colloquial and formal terms used and proposed between 2007 and 2010 included reference to [[orgasm]], there was during that time a significant majority objection to its use among those active in online discussions, many of whom have continued to persist in differentiating the euphoric and relaxing nature of ASMR from [[sexual arousal]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} However, by 2015, a division had occurred within the ASMR community over the subject of sexual arousal, with some creating videos categorized as ASMRotica (ASMR [[erotica]]), which are deliberately designed to be sexually stimulating.&lt;ref name="broadly.vice.com"&gt;Lindsay, Kathryn (15 August 2015).

The initial consensus among the ASMR community was that the name should not pose a high risk of the phenomenon being perceived as sexual. Given that consensus, Jennifer Allen proposed "autonomous sensory meridian response". Allen chose the words intending or assuming them to have the following specific meanings:
* Autonomous – spontaneous, self-governing, with or without control 
* Sensory – pertaining to the senses or sensation
* Meridian – signifying a peak, climax, or point of highest development
* Response – referring to an experience triggered by something external or internal
Allen verified in a 2016 interview that she purposely selected these terms because they were more objective, comfortable, and clinical than alternative terms for the sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Jennifer (17 May 2016). [https://asmruniversity.com/2016/05/17/jennifer-allen-interview-coined-asmr/ 'Interview with Jennifer Allen, the woman who coined the term, 'Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response’ (ASMR)'] ASMR University Website. Retrieved 19 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Allen explained she selected the word meridian to replace the word orgasm due to its meaning of point or period of greatest prosperity.{{clarify|reason=Is this really the definition of the word meridian?|date=April 2018}} {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The term "autonomous sensory meridian response" and its [[acronym]] ASMR were adopted by both the community of contributors to online discussions and those reporting and commentating on the phenomenon.

==Sensation and triggers==
{{synthesis|section|date=January 2017}}

===Sensation===
The [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[experience]], [[Sensory system|sensation]], and [[Perception|perceptual phenomenon]] now widely identified by the term 'autonomous sensory meridian response' is described by some of those susceptible to it as 'akin to a mild electrical current...or the carbonated bubbles in a glass of champagne'.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahuja | first1 = Nitin | year = 2013 | title = 'It Feels Good to Be Measured: clinical role-play, Walker Percy, and the tingles' | url = | journal = [[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]] | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 442–451 | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2013.0022 | pmid=24375123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triggers===
{{Original research|list paragraph|date=November 2018}}
ASMR is usually precipitated by [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] referred to as 'triggers'.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; ASMR triggers, which are most commonly auditory and visual, may be encountered through the [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] interactions of daily life. Additionally, ASMR is often triggered by exposure to specific audio and video. Such media may be specially made with the specific purpose of triggering ASMR or originally created for other purposes and later discovered to be effective as a trigger of the experience.&lt;ref name="PMID25834771"/&gt;

[[Stimulus (physiology)|Stimuli]] that can trigger ASMR, as reported by those who experience it, include the following:
* Listening to a softly spoken or whispering voice.
* Listening to quiet, repetitive sounds resulting from someone engaging in a mundane task such as turning the pages of a book.
* Watching somebody attentively execute a mundane task such as preparing food.
* Loudly chewing, crunching, slurping or biting foods, drinks, or gum.
* Receiving altruistic tender personal attention.
* Initiating the stimulus through conscious manipulation without the need for external video or audio triggers.
* Listening to a person explain a concept, describe an object or system.

Watching and listening to an audiovisual recording of a person performing or simulating the above actions and producing their consequent and accompanying sounds is sufficient to trigger ASMR for the majority of those who report susceptibility to the experience.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

====Whispering triggers====

Psychologists Nick Davis and Emma Barratt discovered that whispering was an effective trigger for 75% of the 475 subjects who took part in an experiment to investigate the nature of ASMR,&lt;ref name="PMID25834771"/&gt; and that statistic is reflected in the popularity of intentional ASMR videos that comprise someone speaking in a whispered voice.&lt;ref name="Intimate with strangers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASMR videos - soothing or creepy?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="I have ASMR, do you?"/&gt;

====Auditory triggers====
Many of those who experience ASMR report that some specific non-vocal [[ambient noise]]s are also effective triggers of ASMR, including those like the sound of rain, fingers scratching or tapping a surface, the crushing of eggshells, the crinkling and crumpling of a flexible material such as paper, or writing. Many [[YouTube]] videos that are intended to trigger ASMR responses capture a single person performing these actions and the sounds that result.&lt;ref name="Why music gives you the chills"/&gt;

====Personal attention role play triggers====

In addition to the effectiveness of specific auditory stimuli, many subjects report that ASMR is triggered by the receipt of tender personal attention, often comprising combined physical touch and vocal expression, such as when having their hair cut, nails painted, [[mimikaki|ears cleaned]], or back massaged, whilst the service provider speaks quietly to the recipient.  Furthermore, many of those who have experienced ASMR during these and other comparable encounters with a service provider report that watching an "ASMRtist" simulate the provision of such personal attention, acting directly to the camera as if the viewer were the recipient of a simulated service, is sufficient to trigger it.&lt;ref name="PMID24375123"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Carolyn (2 September 2014). [http://www.themarysue.com/what-the-hell-is-asmr/ 'Brain Orgasms, Spidey Sense, and Bob Ross: A Look Inside The World Of ASMR']. [[Dan Abrams|The Mary Sue]]. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists Nick Davis and Emma Barratt discovered that personal attention was an effective trigger for 69% of the 475 subjects who participated in a study conducted at [[Swansea University]], second in popularity only to whispering.&lt;ref name="PMID25834771"/&gt;

Some roleplays also incorporate fantasy or science fiction elements in a way that allows "escape" for the viewers. Some also incorporate legitimate stories into the roleplays in a way that could be considered entertainment in its own right, outside of the ASMR phenomenon.

====Clinical role play triggers====

Among the category of intentional ASMR videos that simulate the provision of personal attention is a subcategory of those specifically depicting the "ASMRtist" providing clinical or medical services, including routine general medical examinations. The creators of these videos make no claims to the reality of what is depicted, and the viewer is intended to be aware that they are watching and listening to a simulation, performed by an actor. Nonetheless, many subjects attribute therapeutic outcomes to these and other categories of intentional ASMR videos, and there are voluminous anecdotal reports of their effectiveness in inducing sleep for those susceptible to [[insomnia]], and assuaging a range of symptoms including those associated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[panic attack]]s.&lt;ref name="vice.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="well.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;Fairyington, Stephanie (28 July 2014).

In the first peer-reviewed article on ASMR, published in ''Perspectives in Biology'' in summer 2013, Nitin Ahuja, who was at the time of publication a medical resident at the [[University of Virginia]], invited conjecture on whether the receipt of simulated medical attention might have some tangible therapeutic value for the recipient, comparing the purported positive outcome of clinical role play ASMR videos with the themes of the novel ''[[Love in the Ruins]]'' by author and physician [[Walker Percy]], published in 1971.&lt;ref name="PMID24375123"/&gt;

The story follows Tom More, a psychiatrist living in a dystopian future who develops a device called the Ontological Lapsometer that, when traced across the scalp of a patient, detects the neurochemical correlation to a range of disturbances. In the course of the novel, More admits that the 'mere application of his device' to a patient's body 'results in the partial relief of his symptoms'.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, Walker (2011).

Open Road Media; {{ISBN|9781453216200}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahuja alleges that through the character of Tom More, as depicted in ''Love in the Ruins'', Percy 'displays an intuitive understanding of the diagnostic act as a form of therapy unto itself'. Ahuja asks whether similarly, the receipt of simulated personal clinical attention by an actor in an ASMR video might afford the listener and viewer some relief.&lt;ref name="Ahuja, Nitin 2013 pp442-451"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahuja | first1 = Nitin | year = 2013 | title = 'It feels good to be measured: clinical role-play, Walker Percy, and the tingles' | url = | journal = [[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]] | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 442–51 | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2013.0022 | pmid = 24375123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and history==

===Contemporary history===
The contemporary history of ASMR began on 19 October 2007 when a 21-year-old registered user of a discussion forum for health-related subjects at a website called 'Steady Health',&lt;ref&gt;LifeForm Inc. (4 June 2014). [http://www.steadyhealth.com/polices/aboutus 'About' the Steady Health Website]. LifeForm Inc. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; with the username 'okaywhatever', submitted a post in which they described having experienced a specific sensation since childhood, comparable to that stimulated by tracing fingers along the skin, yet often triggered by seemingly random and unrelated [[Haptic communication|non-haptic]] events, such as 'watching a puppet show' or 'being read a story'.&lt;ref name="Steady Health"&gt;[http://www.steadyhealth.com Steady Health] (19 October 2007).

Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Replies to this post, which indicated that a significant number of others experienced the sensation to which 'okaywhatever' referred, also in response to witnessing mundane events, precipitated the formation of a number of web-based locations intended to facilitate further discussion and analysis of the phenomenon for which there was plentiful [[anecdotal account]]s,&lt;ref name="Intimate with strangers"&gt;Manduley, Aida (February 2013).

===Earlier history===
[[File:Virginia Woolf 1927.jpg|thumb|upright|Virginia Woolf's novel ''Mrs. Dalloway'' contains a passage describing something that may be comparable to ASMR.]]

[[Austria]]n writer [[Clemens J. Setz]] suggests that a passage from the [[novel]] ''[[Mrs. Dalloway]]'' authored by [[Virginia Woolf]] and published in 1925, describes something distinctly comparable.&lt;ref&gt;Setz, Clemens (6 April 2015). [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/gastbeitrag-das-namenlose-gefuehl-1.2423469 'High durch sich räuspernde Menschen']. [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maslen, Hannah and Roache, Rebecca (30 July 2015). [http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/07/asmr-and-absurdity/ 'ASMR and absurdity']. Practical Ethics. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the passage from ''Mrs. Dalloway'' cited by Setz, a nursemaid speaks to the man who is her patient 'deeply, softly, like a mellow organ, but with a roughness in her voice like a grasshopper's, which rasped his spine deliciously and sent running up into his brain waves of sound'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virginia Woolf|Woolf, Virginia]] (2007) [1925]. "Mrs. Dalloway". ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SsaVkD_4DpkC&amp;pg=PA141 The Selected Works]''; {{ISBN|978-1-84022-558-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Setz, this citation generally alludes to the effectiveness of the [[human voice]] and soft or whispered vocal sounds specifically as a trigger of ASMR for many of those who experience it, as demonstrated by the responsive comments posted to [[YouTube]] videos that depict someone speaking softly or whispering, typically directly to camera.&lt;ref name="Intimate with strangers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASMR videos - soothing or creepy?"&gt;[[The Young Turks]] (17 February 2013).

===Evolutionary history===
{{stack|[[File:Grooming monkeys PLW edit.jpg|thumb|Animal grooming has often been interpreted as a form of bonding.]]}}
Nothing can currently be definitively known about any evolutionary origins for ASMR since the perceptual phenomenon itself has yet to be clearly identified as having biological correlations. Even so, a significant majority of descriptions of ASMR by those who experience it compare the sensation to that precipitated by receipt of tender physical touch, providing examples such as having their hair cut or combed. This has led to the conjecture that ASMR might be related to the act of grooming.&lt;ref name="978-1615648184"&gt;Young, Julie, and Blansert, Ilse (2015). Idiot's Guides: ASMR.  Idiot's Guides: ASMR. Penguin. {{ISBN|978-1615648184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[David Huron]], Professor in the School of Music at [[Ohio State University]], states: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[The 'ASMR effect' is] clearly strongly related to the perception of non-threat and altruistic attention [and has a] strong similarity to physical grooming in primates [who] derive enormous pleasure (bordering on euphoria) when being groomed by a grooming partner...not to get clean, but rather to bond with each other."&lt;ref name="Why music gives you the chills"&gt;Collins, Sean T. (2012-09-10). 'Why music gives you the chills'. [[BuzzFeed]], 10 September 2012. Retrieved on 2016-01-20 from https://www.buzzfeed.com/theseantcollins/why-music-gives-you-the-chills-7ahd&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Imaging subjects' brains with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] as they reported experiencing ASMR tingles suggests support for this hypothesis, because brain areas such as the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (associated with social behaviors including grooming), and the [[secondary somatosensory cortex]] (associated with sensation of touch) were activated more strongly during tingle periods than control periods.&lt;ref name="BioImpacts 2018-09-23" /&gt;

==Categories==
While little scientific research has been conducted into potential neurobiological correlates to the perceptual phenomenon known as 'autonomous sensory meridian response' (ASMR), with a consequent dearth of data with which to either explain or refute its physical nature, there is voluminous [[anecdotal account|anecdotal]] literature comprising personal commentary and intimate disclosure of subjective experiences distributed across forums, blogs, and YouTube comments by hundreds of thousands of people. Within this literature, in addition to the original consensus that ASMR is euphoric but non-sexual in nature, a further point of continued majority agreement within the community of those who experience it is that they fall into two broad categories of subjects.

One category depends upon external triggers in order to experience the localized sensation and its associated feelings, which typically originates in the head, often reaching down the neck and sometimes the upper back. The other category can intentionally augment the sensation and feelings through [[attentional control]], without dependence upon external stimuli, or 'triggers', in a manner compared by some subjects to their experience of [[meditation]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Media==

===Videos===
[[File:Short ASMR - 시원한 탄산주스 솨악~ drinking a nice cold soda.webm|thumb|An ASMR video]]
The most popular source of stimuli reported by subjects to be effective in triggering ASMR is video. Videos reported being effective in triggering ASMR fall into two categories, identified and named by the community as 'Intentional' and 'Unintentional'. Intentional media is created by those known within the community as 'ASMRtists' with the purpose of triggering ASMR in viewers and listeners. Unintentional media is that made for other purposes, often before attention was drawn to the phenomenon in 2007, but which some subjects discover to be effective in triggering ASMR. One early unintentional example is the [[Art Bears]] song 'The Bath of Stars.' Another example of unintentional media several journalists have noted is of famed painter [[Bob Ross]]. In episodes of his popular television series ''[[The Joy of Painting]]'' both broadcast and on YouTube, his soft, gentle, altruistic speaking mannerisms and the sound of him painting and his tools trigger the effect on many of his viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2014/10/10/soothing-sounds-bob-ross-274466.html |title=The Soothing Sounds of Bob Ross |website=Newsweek.com |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmessitte/2015/03/31/is-there-any-money-to-be-made-in-asmr/#770fee36ee62|title=Is There Any Money To Be Made In ASMR?|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work of stop-motion filmmaker [[PES (director)|PES]] is also often noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_uk/article/kbn84x/5-stop-motion-meditations-from-pes-reddit-ama|title=5 Stop-Motion Meditations From PES's Reddit AMA|website=Creators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Binaural recording===
{{main|Binaural recording}}
[[File:Examen des oreilles - Role Play ear exam - Binaural ASMR FR.webm|thumb|A binaural roleplay ASMR video from YouTube]]
Some ASMR video creators use [[binaural recording]] techniques to simulate the acoustics of a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional environment]], reported to elicit in viewers and listeners the experience of being in close proximity to actor and vocalist.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"&gt;Lalwani, Mona (12 February 2015). [https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/12/8021733/3d-audio-3dio-binaural-immersive-vr-sound-times-square-new-york ' Surrounded by sound: how 3D audio hacks your brain. A century-old audio technology is making a comeback thanks to VR'], theverge.com, 12 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Binaural recordings are made usually made using two microphones, just like stereo recordings. However, in binaural recordings the two microphones tend to be more specially designed to mimic ears on humans. In many cases, microphones are separated the same distance as ears are on humans, and microphones are surrounded by ear shaped cups to get similar reverb as human ears.

Viewing and hearing such ASMR videos that comprise ambient sound captured through [[binaural recording]] has been compared to the reported effect of listening to [[binaural beats]], which are also alleged to precipitate pleasurable sensations and the subjective experience of calm and equanimity.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, Patricia (28 November 2012).[http://kotaku.com/5963533/this-drug-is-legal-its-digital-and-its-supposed-to-improve-how-you-game-i-put-it-to-the-test 'This drug is legal. it's digital. and it's supposed to improve how you game. I put it to the test']. [http://kotaku.com Kotaku Website]; retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Binaural recordings are made specifically to be heard through headphones rather than loudspeakers. When listening to sound through loudspeakers, the left and right ear can both hear the sound coming from both speakers. By distinction, when listening to sound through headphones, the sound from the left earpiece is audible only to the left ear, and the sound from the right ear piece is audible only to the right ear. When producing binaural media, the sound source is recorded by two separate microphones, placed at a distance comparable to that between two ears, and they are not mixed, but remain separate on the final medium, whether video or audio.&lt;ref&gt;Binaural.com (April 1998) [http://www.binaural.com/binfaq.html 'Binaural for beginners']. [http://Binaural.com Binaural.com]. Retrieved 20 January 2016. [[The Verge]]; retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Listening to a binaural recording through headphones simulates the [[binaural hearing]] by which people listen to live sounds. For the listener, this experience is characterised by two perceptions. Firstly, the listener perceives being in close proximity to the performers and location of the sound source. Secondly, the listener perceives what is often reported as a three dimensional sound.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"/&gt; This means the listener can perceive both the position and distance of the source of sound relative to them.

==Academic commentary==

===Peer-reviewed articles===
Several [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] articles about ASMR have been published.

The first, by the physician Nitin Ahuja, is titled "It Feels Good to Be Measured: clinical role-play, Walker Percy, and the tingles". It was published in ''[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]]'' during 2013 and focused on a conjectural cultural and literary analysis.&lt;ref name="Ahuja, Nitin 2013 pp442-451"/&gt;

Another article, published in the journal ''Television and New Media'' in November 2014, is by Joceline Andersen, a doctoral student in the Department of Art History and Communication Studies at [[McGill University]],&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Joceline (1 December 2015). [https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/people/phd-students/joceline-andersen Joceline Andersen's Profile at McGill University]. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that ASMR videos comprising whispering 'create an intimate sonic space shared by the listener and the whisperer'. Andersen's article proposes that the pleasure jointly shared by both an ASMR video creator and its viewers might be perceived as a particular form of 'non-standard intimacy' by which consumers pursue a form of pleasure mediated by video media. Andersen suggests that such pursuit is private yet also public or publicized through the sharing of experiences via online communication with others within the 'whispering community'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1527476414556184 | volume=16 | title=Now You’ve Got the Shiveries | year=2014 | journal=Television &amp; New Media | pages=683–700 | last1 = Andersen | first1 = Joceline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another article, "Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR): a flow-like mental state", by Nick Davis and Emma Barratt, lecturer and post-graduate researcher respectively in the Department of Psychology at [[Swansea University]], was published in [[PeerJ]]. This article aimed to 'describe the sensations associated with ASMR, explore the ways in which it is typically induced in capable individuals ... to provide further thoughts on where this sensation may fit into current knowledge on atypical perceptual experiences ... and to explore the extent to which engagement with ASMR may ease symptoms of depression and chronic pain'&lt;ref name="PMID25834771" /&gt; The paper was based on a study of 245 men, 222 women, and 8 individuals of non-binary gender, aged from 18 to 54 years, all of whom had experienced ASMR, and regularly consumed ASMR media, from which the authors concluded and suggested that 'given the reported benefits of ASMR in improving mood and pain symptoms...ASMR warrants further investigation as a potential therapeutic measure similar to that of meditation and mindfulness.'

An article titled "An examination of the default mode network in individuals with autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR)"&lt;ref name="Social Neuroscience 2015-08-14"&gt;{{cite journal |title=An examination of the default mode network in individuals with autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) |journal=Social Neuroscience |date=14 August 2015 |last=Smith |first=Stephen |last2=Fredborg |first2=Beverley Katherine |last3=Kornelsen|first3=Jennifer|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17470919.2016.1188851 |accessdate=13 August 2016 |quote=In the current study, the default mode network (DMN) of 11 individuals with ASMR was contrasted to that of 11 matched controls. |doi=10.1080/17470919.2016.1188851 |pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Stephen D. Smith, Beverley Katherine Fredborg, and Jennifer Kornelsen, looked at the [[default mode network]] (DMN) in individuals with ASMR. The study, which used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), concluded that there were significant differences in the DMN of individuals who have ASMR as compared to a control group without ASMR.

The first study to perform actual brain imaging (fMRI) on subjects currently experiencing ASMR tingles (as opposed to individuals who were merely able to experience the phenomenon) was published in ''[[BioImpacts]]'' in September 2018.&lt;ref name="BioImpacts 2018-09-23"&gt;{{cite journal |title=An fMRI investigation of the neural correlates underlying the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) |journal=BioImpacts |date=2018-09-23 |last=Lochte |first=Bryson |url=http://bi.tbzmed.ac.ir/Abstract/bi-17613 |accessdate=2018-10-04 |doi=10.15171/bi.2018.32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects viewed several ASMR videos with a screen and headphones while inside the MRI scanner. The study found a significant difference in brain activation between time periods when the subject reported tingling (communicated by pressing a button), as compared to time periods when they were watching a video but not reporting tingling (communicated by pressing a different button, to control for brain activation effects caused by merely pressing a button). They concluded that "the brain regions found most active during the tingling sensations were the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[prefrontal cortex|mPFC]], [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[secondary somatosensory cortex]]", and suggested that these were similar to "activation of brain regions previously observed during experiences like social bonding and musical [[frisson]]".

==Scientific commentary==
A number of scientists have published or made public their reaction to and opinions of ASMR.

On 12 March 2012, [[Steven Novella]], Director of General Neurology at the [[Yale School of Medicine]], published a post about ASMR on his blog ''Neurologica''. Regarding the question of whether ASMR is a real phenomeonon, Novella said "in this case, I don't think there is a definitive answer, but I am inclined to believe that it is. There are a number of people who seem to have independently experienced and described" it with "fairly specific details. In this way it's similar to migraine headaches – we know they exist as a syndrome primarily because many different people report the same constellation of symptoms and natural history." Novella tentatively posited the possibilities that ASMR might be either a type of pleasurable seizure, or another way to activate the "pleasure response". However, Novella drew attention to the lack of scientific investigation into ASMR, suggesting that [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] technologies should be used to study the brains of people who experience ASMR in comparison to people who do not, as a way of beginning to seek scientific understanding and explanation of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Novella|Novella, Steven]] (12 March 2012).

Four months after Novella's blog post, Tom Stafford, a lecturer in [[psychology]] and cognitive sciences at the [[University of Sheffield]], was reported to have said that ASMR "might well be a real thing, but it's inherently difficult to research...something like this that you can't see or feel" and "doesn't happen for everyone". Stafford compared the current status of ASMR with development of attitudes toward [[synesthesia]], which he said "for years...was a myth, then in the 1990s people came up with a reliable way of measuring it".&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Rhodri (21 July 2012).

==Comparisons and associations with other phenomena==

===Comparison with synesthesia===
{{main|Synesthesia}}
Integral to the subjective experience of ASMR is a localized tingling sensation that many describe as similar to being gently touched, but which is stimulated by watching and listening to video media in the absence of any physical contact with another person.

These reports have precipitated comparison between ASMR and synesthesia – a condition characterised by the excitation of one sensory modality by stimuli that normally exclusively stimulates another, as when the hearing of a specific sound induces the visualization of a distinct color, a type of synesthesia called [[chromesthesia]]. Thereby, people with other types of synesthesia report for example 'seeing sounds' in the case of auditory-visual synesthesia, or 'tasting words' in the case of lexical-gustatory synesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;Cytowic, Richard E. (2002). Synesthesia: a union of the senses (2nd edition). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-03296-1}}. {{OCLC|49395033}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cytowic, Richard E. (2003).

In the case of ASMR, many report the perception of 'being touched' by the sights and sounds presented on a video recording, comparable to visual-tactile and auditory-tactile synesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Naumer MJ, van den Bosch JJ |title=Touching sounds: thalamocortical plasticity and the neural basis of multisensory integration |journal=J.

===Comparison with misophonia===

{{main|Misophonia}}
Some commentators and members of the ASMR community have sought to relate ASMR to [[misophonia]], which literally means the 'hatred of sound', but manifests typically as 'automatic negative emotional reactions to particular sounds – the opposite of what can be observed in reactions to specific audio stimuli in ASMR'.&lt;ref name="PMID25834771"/&gt;

For example, those who suffer from misophonia often report that specific human sounds, including those made by breathing or whispering with any loudness can precipitate feelings of anger and disgust, in the absence of any previously learned associations that might otherwise explain those reactions.&lt;ref name="Schröder2013"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Schröder A, Vulink N, Denys D|editor=Fontenelle L |title=Misophonia: Diagnostic Criteria for a New Psychiatric Disorder|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=1|year=2013|pages=e54706|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0054706|pmid=23372758|pmc=3553052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are plentiful anecdotal reports by those who claim to have both misophonia and ASMR at multiple web-based user-interaction and discussion locations. Common to these reports is the experience of ASMR to some sounds, and misophonia in response to others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pennsylvania State University]] (2015).

===Comparison with frisson===
{{main|Frisson}}
The tingling sensation that characterises ASMR has been compared and contrasted to 'frisson', which is a French word for 'shiver'.&lt;ref name="nme.com"&gt;Jones, Lucy (12 September 2012). [http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/which-moments-in-songs-give-you-chills 'Which moments in songs give you chills?'] [[NME|New Musical Express]]. Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the English word 'shiver' signifies the rhythmic involuntary contraction of skeletal muscles which serves the function of generating heat in response to low temperatures, has variable duration, and is often reported subjectively as unpleasant. By distinction, the French word 'frisson', signifies a brief sensation usually reported as pleasurable and often expressed as an overwhelming emotional response to stimuli, such as a piece of music. Frisson often occurs simultaneously with [[piloerection]], colloquially known as 'goosebumps', by which tiny muscles called [[Arrector pili muscle|arrector pili]] contract, causing body hair, particularly that on the limbs and back of the neck, to erect or 'stand on end'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/frisson Define Frisson at Dictionary.com].

Few legitimate studies have been done on ASMR, and even fewer have discussed the link between it and frisson specifically. At this time{{when|date=October 2018}}, much of the data on ASMR comes from primarily anecdotal sources.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Although ASMR and frisson are "interrelated in that they appear to arise through similar physiological mechanisms", individuals who have experienced both describe them as qualitatively different, with different kinds of triggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) and frisson: Mindfully induced sensory phenomena that promote happiness|journal=International Journal of School &amp; Educational Psychology|date=2016-02-26|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21683603.2016.1130582|last=del Campo|first=Marisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] study showed that the major brain regions already known to be activated in frisson are also activated in ASMR,&lt;ref name="BioImpacts 2018-09-23" /&gt; and suggests that "the similar pattern of activation of both ASMR and frisson could explain their subjective similarities, such as their short duration and tingling sensation".

===Association with sexuality===
There have been persistent efforts by many of those who form the 'ASMR community' to distinguish the euphoric sensation that characterizes ASMR from sexual arousal, and to differentiate video media created with intent to trigger it from pornography.&lt;ref name="mashable.com"&gt;[[Mashable]] (26 January 2015) [http://mashable.com/2015/01/26/asmr-youtube/#cPx9p.mAOkqw 'All the feels.

Retrieved 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, some journalists and commentators have drawn attention to the way in which many videos made as triggers are susceptible to being perceived as sexually provocative in a number of ways. Firstly, the use of objects as acoustic instruments and points of visual focus, accompanied by a softly spoken voice has been described as fetishistic. Secondly, ASMR's potential appeal is further allegedly sexualized by their use of a whispered vocal expression and gentleness of simulated touch purportedly associated exclusively with intimacy. There are both popular male and female 'ASMRtists'.&lt;ref name="Intimate with strangers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madrigal,  Alexis C. (28 March 2015).

'''Branko Cvetkovic''' (born 1951), a Slovenian [[photographer]] known for his philosophically conceptualized approach to photography. Working mostly with [[Large format (photography)|large-format cameras]], his architecture photography is minimalistically structured. From symmetry he opens up the space perspective to [[deconstructivism]], and in art there is a transition to a non-perspective suprematist plane, thus coinciding with [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dejan Sluga, director and curator of Photon Gallery {{cite web|url=http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}, in his opinion of Cvetkovic`s artwork&lt;/ref&gt; Besides space, his main concern is the phenomenon of light itself, the two basic postulates in photography.

==Biography==

Branko Cvetkovic was born on April 15, 1951 in [[Novo Mesto]], Slovenia, former [[Yugoslavia]]. He graduated in political economics under the mentorship of one of the best known Yugoslavian economists, France Cerne, at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Ljubljana. After working for various research institutions he served as an expert for manpower   for the government of the Republic of  [[Seychelles]].  He was also appointed as an expert for the United Nations organization Habitat.

He started to become involved with photography in 1986 and 1987 in the Seychelles. This coincidental beginning and later obsession was triggered by his fascination with light – a reminiscence of a childhood awareness of the light on the houses of his birthplace – and an emerging sensitivity to fine art, dating from his student years.  Nevertheless, his first two independent, and still amateur, projects were the [[Creole House|Creole houses]] and a continuous conceptual recording of the light above the [[Silhouette Island|island Silhouette]]. After his return home he abandoned his work as an economist and went on to work as an artist, a profession in his belief of greater importance and of greater and lasting value. He started to work professionally in photography; upgrading his technical skills and perception of fine art. Since 1990 he has been a free-lance photographer working mainly in architecture, industry and art; in the early years he also dealt with creative and artistic management and design.

In the years 1992 – 98 the several works were awarded, where Cvetkovic played a role as creative, conceptual or art director, co-designer and photographer.&lt;ref name="Golden MM for the 1992 calendar for UBK Bank entitled The Rocks" &gt;(from the cycle "The rocks and the sea").

Branko Cvetkovic resides in Ljubljana.

==Artistic work==

Initially, his approaches had evolved intuitively, then there was a [[Cognition|cognition process]] of photography and art, involving analyses of [[conceptual art]] and minimalistic expression in [[Bauhaus]] modernism and avant-garde upgraded by [[Constructivism (art)|Russian constructivism]]. In architectural photography he radicalized certain conceptual and functionalist approaches which can be compared with or are similar to those of the Bechers’ Düsseldorf school. He  worked conceptually and was particularly devoted to defining spatial light and transmitting and upgrading the form or architecture of space. In spite of his highly objective aspirations in this period he could be considered a constructivist.

In his late period he established a philosophical idea of Non-Space as a totality of abstract space. In the fine art sense he transformed space into an abstract expressive image of the (suprematist) plane as the ultimate transformation of three-dimensional space into nil or zero dimension. Therefore, he discovered his artistic ambitions in the field of abstract expressionism.

==Bauhaus period==

In his early studies Cvetkovic found himself mainly occupied with the issue of the complexity of light and image, its disintegration into layers with various depths of field, in order to envisage a new image and to formulate or to frame it on the Bauhaus modernist plane.

In this period (1990-1995) he dealt with minimalistic and conceptual topics summed up in projects: Rocks and Water, Light within Seashells, Waves and Series of Seawater Abstractions.  His projects continued with almost abstract cycles in the Bauhaus constructivist manner: Lux  Plantarum (1997) and Light of Shadow – Drawing of Form (1998), both exhibited in Ljubljana.

This was the introduction leading to his most complex  opus of industrial photography, still defined  by the Bauhaus spirit and undertaken at the industrial premises of the Akrapovic firm in the years 1997 and 1998, continuing in 2002 and 2003: Tubes, Chinese Cosmos, Abstractions and Bauhaus . His final creation in this field was in 8x10 inches LF and was named Locomotives (2005).

==Architecture: from minimalist structuralism to deconstructivism==

In architectural photography Cvetkovic has made his  way from [[structuralism]] to [[deconstructivism]]. At his early stage of involvement in photography, Cvetkovic had been posing himself the  question of the construction  of  the constructivist frame  on the one hand and on the other  the problem of defining or constructing light within space.&lt;ref&gt;Cvetkovic develops his concept in his text for the catalogue "The Construction of Light – Sequential Constructions of the Space Planes: the Spaces of Spaces" publisher Mestna galerija, {{COBISS|ID=214121984}}{{cite web|url=http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, his architectural photography is minimalistic, rationalized and architecturally schematic. A reading of light is defined by the architectural shell itself. With this approach he autonomously developed modernist functionalist architectural photography and only in this way did he find himself side by side with the developing Düsseldorf school.

===Old industrial architecture – archeology of light===

His first exhibition The Old Power Station in Ljubljana in 1992, was the first in this series, as well as the continuation of his project of old industrial buildings, namely Rog and the old brick factory of Ljubljana, which were exhibited in 1997 under the title Past Spaces. In the old power station Cvetkovic did not only make a so-called archeological inventory of the building, he also introduced the archeology of spatial light. He had researched light, as one of the critics &lt;ref&gt;Catalogue for the Fine Arts Exhibitions "Past Spaces", European Cultural Month, Ljubljana 1997, {{COBISS|ID=1679470}}&lt;/ref&gt; put it. In Past Spaces (1997), he had already presented architecture by sequencing the framing and "new" construction of the perspective by overturning the areas or planes of a picture similar to Russian constructivism.

===Concept of symmetry and minimalism – Plecnik˙s Marketplace===

Radical in his concept, Cvetkovic was presented as an architectural photographer in the full complexity of his work in 1996, with his exhibition of [[Ljubljana Central Market|Plecnik`s Marketplace]]. In this exhibition he broke with the contemporary [[Postmodernism|post-modernist]] tradition of representing architecture in Slovenia by replacing it with a functionalist overview. The scheme and the structure of the photographic work were outlined by him during the period of the renovation of Plecnik’s buildings. He shaped the Plecnik’s architecture in doctrinaire typology by using the symmetrical minimalist concept, perspective-corrected images of the architectural structures, consistently outlined only by a diffused non-shadow light, which became the light of an object itself. This was the method the photographer strictly implemented during the period coinciding with the emerging Düsseldorf school. The whole exhibition took place at the Municipal Gallery of Ljubljana and was accompanied by the artist’s monograph.&lt;ref&gt;Artist monograph "The market in Ljubljana designed by the architect Joze Plecnik", Ljubljana 1996, Rokus, {{ISBN|961-209-033-5}}. Text on photography "Multifaceted photographs of Branko Cvetkovic" written by Aleksander Bassin. Other texts on architecture by Asja Krecic, Peter Krecic.&lt;/ref&gt; It paved the way for him to the most important cultural and professional Slovenian institutions, whilst he became distinguished with his interpretation of the architecture of their home buildings, their reconstructions and renovations. The collections of his photographs are represented as the core of the archives of the National University Library, Cankar Cultural Centre, Slovenian Philharmonic Hall, Slovenian National Opera and Ballet, Municipal Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana, the Institution for Public Health, House of Constitutional Law, etc.

===Plecnik˙s National University Library in Ljubljana===

Cvetkovic completed extensive work on Plecnik`s architecture of the [[National and University Library of Slovenia]] (NUK) in the years 1998–1999 and 2003. The originals were taken by large format 4x5 inch and 13x18 cm [[Sinar]] P2 and [[Hasselblad]] 6x6. The lead and the principle of the photography and composition are based on the Düsseldorf school doctrine. In some cases sequential photographing was also taken into account. Truly exceptional is the photograph of the main entrance façade; for the first time in the history of the NUK this is seen and established in one perspective-corrected picture, actually amalgamated from three vertically positioned originals in 13x18 cm format. Because of the narrow street and the extent of the façade, this had hitherto been an unattainable, a constant enigmatic frustration never to be overcome.

Cvetkovic has approached Plecnik not only in his creative aspiration, but also ethically in his unconditional aspiration to perfection. In each of the photographed spaces his interest was also in its symbolic meaning. For him, in his picturing the Plecnik`s architecture, the basic message was the fine art transmittance of architecture with the sequential construction of the planes with the typical reduction of the light and the maximal objectivistic and plastic construction of the space, thus positioning the Plecnik`s sequencing of the classical, almost renaissance architectural space.&lt;ref name="The review on the exhibition En Face"/&gt;

===Opera House in Ljubljana===

Almost the contrary has been achieved with Cvetkovic`s architectural photography in his introspective survey of the [[Slovenian National Opera and Ballet Theatre]] in Ljubljana as a paradigmatic amphitheatric space. This extensive work was accomplished in the years 2002, 2003, 2007, 2007-2011.

===deKons===

In 2004 Cvetkovic exhibited his new de-constructivist series entitled Deconstruction of Light – Sequential Constructions of the Space Planes: the Spaces of Spaces, shortly deKons.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksander Bassin, director of the City Art Museum Ljubljana, Catalogue of the exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; The oeuvre started to emerge during the renovation of the Auersperg palace Turjaska palaca. The author departed from the Düsseldorf school presentation. He radicalized the classical upright perspective; he controlled the architectural image by framing it in the sense of Russian constructivism, thus opening up the way to abstraction. This transformation enabled Cvetkovic to be liberated from the classical principle.

Indirect recording of light within the shell of the architecture as an analytical tool necessarily makes it possible to create a new abstract quality – the quality of the light as a means of the sequential decomposition of spatial framings. The author gives the explanation himself: "Therefore we do not only achieve the effect of constructing the perspective by overturning planes in two-dimensional space (in constructivist sense) but deconstruction of perspective and disintegration of planes by the act of deconstruction of light. Inversely that means creation or construction of a new abstract deconstructed space." &lt;ref&gt;Branko Cvetkovic in his conceptual guideline in "The Construction of Light – Sequential Constructions of the Space Planes: the Spaces of Spaces", publisher Ljubljana City Museum (Mestni muzej Ljubljana) 2004 {{cite web|url=http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backstage===

Another constructivist project entitled Backstage was recorded in [[Cankar Hall|Cankar Cultural Centre]] (Cankarjev dom) in 2004 and 2005. Cvetkovic develops his idea of abstract space as a dynamic construction never defined, yet firmly built on its groundwork base, but varied in its contingency forms upon the physical optics of various projects. These are the spaces of Backstage, which  both serve and  model the creativity. The static picture of a construction-based form is varied to a dynamic deconstructed space, decomposed into planes; the planes that host the people as creative figures and momentary actors.

Beside the main opus, there are two special series in Backstage, denoting solely the Stage as a Podium and as a Hall. The first is designed to comply with the idea of Stage as [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]]’s fine art image plane. Cvetkovic’s photographic plane is marked by unnumbered timeless coloured traces that physically mark and embody human action on the stage for ever. The other series denotes a hall as a deconstructed space of a [[Suprematism|suprematist Malevich square]] plane. Each is determined and sponsored by the unique colour of the square plane. Both series are initiated and denoted by a black square – seven minutes exposure in the totally dark space of the stage – as a prelude to an abstract image of indefinable expectation on the part of the spectator.

===En Face===

According to several art critics, Cvetkovic reached the heights in the programmed course with the En Face exhibition in the  [[National Gallery of Slovenia]] (Narodna galerija) in 2005, accompanied with the monograph – catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;Artist monograph – catalogue "En Face", Branko Cvetkovic, 2005, {{ISBN|961-236-952-6}}. Texts by Peter Gulic, Boris Gorupic&lt;/ref&gt; 
Large format photographs with substantial enlargements, some of them digitally composed into one unified frame enlargement, speak of the façade and its embodying the technical, cultural, social and historical artefact. The façade shows itself as a connotation and determiner of the place. Quoting the author, "the only one building of certain space is the unicum of that place and that place alone becomes the only one place of that certain building". From this intentionally prefixed [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] it may be established that in his work, Cvetkovic, who has been constantly loyal to his conceptual reasoning in the photographic sense of the matter, wider in the fields of fine art and theory, has approached the Düsseldorf school most closely.&lt;ref name="The review on the exhibition En Face"&gt;written by Ph.D. Peter Krecic for the author`s nomination for the National Artist Award – [http://www.krecic.si/predlog-za-presernovo-nagrado-za-leto-2014-fotograf-branko-cvetkovic.html/ Presernova nagrada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Dejan Sluga, curator, for the catalogue of the exhibition City Perspectives, Photon Gallery, Ankerbrotfabrik, Vienna, 2014, {{ISBN|978-961-92744-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To finalize the representation of Cvetkovic oeuvre attention should be drawn to his outstanding management of space and perspective correction and his ability to impart to the image   in his photography the archetypes, the timelessness and  the entireness of the structured  spaces as a whole or things as architectures by themselves.&lt;ref name="The review on the exhibition En Face"/&gt;

==The field of abstract expressionism==

===Non-Space / ZeroSpace===

In the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 Cvetkovic concluded his complex and extensive project entitled NON-SPACE / ZeroSPACE. The author goes through abstraction to the field of abstract expressionism, both conceptually and philosophically, both in the elaboration and execution of his work on 5x7 and 8x10 large format film originals.
His philosophical reductionist idea of non-space is presented as an antithesis of real space.&lt;ref&gt;The author`s philosophical and fine art discourse on space and its antithesis non-space - [http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ Photon galerija] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |date=May 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Real space has converged into anti-space, into a totality of absolute abstraction of space which in terms of fine art, after the exclusion of perspective, light and real time, denotes an abstract expressive plane as a final transformation of space. In this way the basic three fine art issues are once again introduced into modernist art discourse. These are: perspective, light and the concept of space.  The transformation of space into plane confirms and challenges the idea of a black and white square plane. Cvetkovic is radical in developing his thesis. He confronts his conception of the basic fine art principles with the most human abstract and universal experience; the human comprehension of death.&lt;ref&gt;"The recipe of work of art...There must be a clear preoccupation with death – intimations of mortality...Tragic art, romantic art, etc. deals with the knowledge of death." Mark Rothko, Address to Pratt Institute, 1958, published by Robert Rosenblum, The Abstraction of Landscape From Northern Romanticism to Abstract Expresionism, Fundacion Juan March, 2007. {{ISBN|978-84-7075-549-1}}. Cvetkovic develops his thesis in elaboration of NON-SPACE / ZeroSPACE in [http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ Photon galerija] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |date=May 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this conceptual context, with utmost consistency and vigorousness, the author elaborates his exceptional frames of vast seascapes, transforming these huge spaces into vast abstract minimalistic planes; the screens and the images are ones that have not yet been encountered in Slovenian art.&lt;ref name="The review on the exhibition En Face"/&gt; 
 
The main idea is the gradual elimination of perspective and sublime transition of space to plane – "screen". Series called Screens, with many derivations, colours and transformations, accentuate abstraction of space to an expressive two-dimensional plane. The last are those of the "Black and white plane" as the final synthesis of denomination to NON-SPACE│ZeroSPACE, concluded as a total abstraction with no dimension.

===White lights as heaven lights===

In spite of total reduction and final darkness, the definitive will towards total liberation, as the idea of huge space in open sky and light, emerges. It could be termed heaven`s light or simply the big magic light, which outlasts and illuminates everything in all its material transformations. This light is the symbol of human mental eternal space.

White lights; open ocean spaces with vast light ruptures and immense light rays, and even bigger light chasms that literally swallow and dematerialize everything by colouring  it into white dazzling lights, are the founding idea for the project that also opens up for the terminating idea of the Heaven Lights.

Much earlier than impressionists, and later abstract expressionists, [[William Turner (artist)|William Turner]] was the first  painter of romantic and symbolic heritage, who was mainly preoccupied with the idea of light. In his paintings: [[Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps]], 1812, Shade and Darkness – the Evening of the Deluge, 1843, Light and Colour – the Morning after the Deluge, 1843, he tried to introspect and consume the light as a spiritual category in its mysticism and abstraction of its highest spiritual elevation. In the first painting, the light and the sun rest under the firmament of clouds shaped like a cathedral vault. Respectively, in other above-mentioned paintings, the light is embodied in the circle that reflects the gaze into a dome. Turner`s approach gave to the phenomenon of light the power for elevation that absorbs the spectator.

In the author’s opinion, these are fantastic grounds for deviation into abstract, non-material, non-objective matter; confrontation of photography with the essential and most basic constitutional matter, Light. This is the reason why his project, based on introspection of sublime light, elevation from darkness into the light, and spiritual absorption, a voyage that is traced by light, could be handled and tracked by photography and its basic tool, Light.

Cvetkovic’s work is based on the movement of the large format 8x10 in. camera which, with its resolution power of 8x10 in. film and long exposures, can absorb the light in its abstract images.

===Reading of photography===

Photography is rigorously objectivistic. Symmetries are their basic orientation points. The notion of expressiveness is accentuated by perspective and the absence of it, respectively. The series of Screen and Plane coincide with abstract expressionism. In addition, the presentiment and sensation of huge minimalistic planes with expressive supernatural connotation have to possess monumental momentum. Their modem is an abstract pattern which we, unawares, inhibit in ourselves. White Lights is mainly based on symmetries and very strong reflective light on the ocean.

{{Islamism sidebar|Concepts}}
The '''Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam''' ('''CDHRI''') is a declaration of the member states of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] adopted in [[Cairo]], Egypt, on 5 August 1990,&lt;ref name = Brems&gt;{{cite book | last = Brems | first = E | isbn = 90-411-1618-4 | title = Human rights: universality and diversity: Volume 66 of International studies in human rights | publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | year = 2001 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=INlkqsHpIFEC&amp;pg=PA241 241–84] | chapter = Islamic Declarations of Human Rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Conference of [[Foreign Minister]]s, 9–14 [[Muharram]] 1411H in the [[Islamic calendar]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/cairodeclaration.html University of Minnesota, Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]&lt;/ref&gt;) which provides an overview on the Islamic perspective on [[human rights]], and affirms [[Islamic]] [[sharia]] as its sole source. CDHRI declares its purpose to be "general guidance for Member States [of the OIC] in the field of human rights".

This declaration is widely acknowledged as an Islamic response to the [[United Nations]]'s [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), adopted in 1948. It guarantees many of the same rights as the UDHR and serves as a living document of human rights guidelines prescribed for all members of the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] (Organization of Islamic Cooperation) to follow, but restricts them explicitly to the limits set by the [[sharia]]. This greatly restricts rights with respect to the Universal Declaration, since for example, women and members of other religions do not have the same rights as men under sharia, and that [[freedom of expression]] can be severely limited for religious reasons: for example, [[blasphemy]] can even now be punishable by death, in clear opposition to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

==History==
Various [[Muslim countries]] had criticized the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights for its failure to take into account the cultural and religious context of non-[[Western world|Western]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;National Review Online, [http://www.nationalreview.com/article/205577/human-rights-and-human-wrongs-david-g-littman Human Rights and Human Wrongs], David G. Littman, January 19, 2003, retrieved 30 May, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Said Rajaie-Khorassani—the post-[[Iranian Revolution|revolutionary]] Iranian representative to the UN—articulated the position of his country regarding the UDHR, by saying that it was a [[Moral relativism|relativistic]] "[[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Midstream"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/205577/human-rights-and-human-wrongs/david-g-littman|title=Universal Human Rights and 'Human Rights in Islam'|publisher='Midstream'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDHRI was adopted in 1990 by members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]]. It has been signed by 45 states so far.&lt;ref&gt;Anver M. Emon, Mark Ellis, Benjamin Glahn: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3hpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 Islamic Law and International Human Rights Law] p. 113. Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the CDHRI was presented to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], where it was strongly condemned by the [[International Commission of Jurists]].

==Contents==
The Declaration starts {{Citation needed|reason=A cursory glance at the source reveals that the document does not start with this sentence, but in fact begins by saying "All human beings form one family whose members are united by their subordination to Allah and descent from Adam."|date=June 2017}} by saying "All human beings form one family whose members are united by their subordination to Allah and descent from Adam." and it forbids "discrimination on the basis of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Skin colour|colour]], [[language]], [[belief]], [[sex]], [[religion]], [[political affiliation]], [[social status]] or other considerations". It goes on to proclaim the [[sanctity of life]], and declares the "preservation of human life" to be "a duty prescribed by the [[Shariah]]". The CDHRI also guarantees non-belligerents—such as old men, [[women and children]], the wounded and sick, and [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]—the [[right to food]], shelter, and access to safety and medical treatment in times of war.

The CDHRI affords women "equal human dignity", "own rights to enjoy", "duties to perform", "own civil entity", "financial independence", and the "right to retain her name and lineage". Both men and women are given the "right to marriage" regardless of their race, colour, or nationality. The Declaration makes it incumbent upon both parents to protect the child, both before and after birth, while stressing that the [[Gender roles in Islam|husband is responsible]] for the social and financial protection of his family, including any children and wives. 

The Declaration recognises the [[Right to property|rights to property]] and [[right to privacy|privacy]] for the individuals.&lt;ref name="RuleGreenleaf2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rule|first1=James B.|last2=Greenleaf|first2=G.

It is not permitted to spy on him, to place him under surveillance or to besmirch his good name. The State shall protect him from arbitrary interference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html |title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It forbids the [[demolition]] and [[confiscation]] of any family's residence and the [[eviction]] of the family.&lt;ref name="Baderin2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baderin|first=Mashood A.|title=International Human Rights and Islamic Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHRCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP141|date=11 September 2003|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-102182-4|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, should the family get separated in times of [[Islam and war|war]], it is the responsibility of the [[Sovereign state|state]] to "arrange visits or reunions of families".

Article 10 of the Declaration states: "Islam is the religion of unspoiled nature. It is [[Haram|prohibited]] to exercise any form of [[Al-Baqara 256|compulsion]] on man or to exploit his [[Islam and poverty|poverty]] or ignorance in order to convert him to another religion or to [[Atheism and Islam|atheism]]." Since in Islamic society all reasons for conversion away from Islam are considered to be essentially{{by whom|date=February 2018}} either compulsion or ignorance, this effectively forbids conversion away from Islam.

The Declaration protects each individual from [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], [[torture]], maltreatment, or indignity. Furthermore, no individual is to be used for medical or scientific experiments without his consent or at the risk of his health or of his life. It also prohibits the taking of hostages of any individual "for any purpose whatsoever". Moreover, the CDHRI guarantees the [[presumption of innocence]]; guilt is only to be proven through a trial in "which he [the defendant] shall be given all the guarantees of defence". The Declaration also forbids the promulgation of "emergency laws that would provide executive authority for such actions". Article 19 stipulates that there are no other crimes or punishments than [[Hudud#Punishments|those mentioned in the sharia]]. Sharia allows [[corporal punishment]] (whipping, amputation) and [[capital punishment]] by [[Stoning#In Islam|stoning]] or [[Beheading in Islam|decapitation]].&lt;ref&gt;There shall be no crime or punishment except as provided for in the Schari’a.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to hold public office can only be exercised in accordance with the sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2003), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration also emphasizes the "full right to freedom and self-determination", and its opposition to [[Slavery in Islam|enslavement]], oppression, [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]], and [[Muslim conquests|colonialism]]. The CDHRI declares the [[rule of law]], establishing "equality and justice for all", [[Fiqh|with the limitations provided under Islamic law]]. The CDHRI also guarantees all individuals the "right to participate, directly or indirectly in the administration of his country's public affairs". The CDHRI also forbids any abuse of authority "subject to the Islamic Shariah."

Article 22(a) of the Declaration states that "Everyone shall have the right to [[Freedom of speech|express his opinion freely]] in such manner as would not be [[Sharia#Freedom of speech|contrary to the principles of the Shariah]]." Article 22(b) states that "Everyone shall have the right to advocate what is right, and propagate what is good, and warn against what is wrong and evil according to the norms of Islamic Shariah." Article 22(c) states: "Information is a vital necessity to society. It may not be exploited or misused in such a way as may violate sanctities and the dignity of Prophets, undermine moral and ethical values or disintegrate, corrupt or harm society, or weaken its faith." This is an explicit restriction on the freedom to make any statement which might be considered blasphemous, the penalty for the making of which might be death and as such the wording of this clause allows the death penalty for blasphemy in clear contravention of the UDHR.     Article 22(d) states that "It is not permitted to arouse nationalistic or doctrinal hatred or to do anything that may be an incitement to any form of racial discrimination."

===Religious features===
{{further information|Human rights in the Quran}}
Although the CDHRI uses a [[Universalism|universalist]] language akin to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, "quite a number of [its] features express an Islamic particularity."&lt;ref name = Brems/&gt; The [[preamble]] is mostly religious [[rhetoric]], and the particulars of the CDHRI contain numerous references to the [[Quran]], sharia, and aspects of the Islamic faith that appear on no other similar international list.&lt;ref name = Brems/&gt; The CDHRI concludes in Articles 24 and 25 that all rights and freedoms mentioned are subject to the Islamic sharia, which is the declaration's sole source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, Aug. 5, 1990, U.N. GAOR], World Conf. on Hum. Rts., 4th Sess., Agenda Item 5, U.N. Doc.
A/CONF.157/PC/62/Add.18 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The CDHRI declares true religion to be the "guarantee for enhancing such dignity along the path to human [[integrity]]". It also places the responsibility for defending those rights upon the entire [[Ummah]].

==Criticism==
{{See also|Criticism of Sharia law|Human rights in Islamic countries|Application of sharia law by country|Islam and violence}}

The CDHRI has been criticized for being implemented by a set of states with widely disparate religious policies and practices who had "a shared interest in disarming international criticism of their domestic human rights record."&lt;ref name = Brems/&gt;

Article 24 of the declaration states: "All the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic Sharia." Article 19 also says: "There shall be no crime or punishment except as provided for in the Sharia."&lt;ref name="Farouh2002"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kazemi | first = F | chapter = Perspectives on Islam and Civil Society | title = Islamic Political Ethics: Civil Society, Pluralism and Conflict | editors = Hashmi SH | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-691-11310-6 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=5LmXFpnp_bMC&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 50] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDHRI has been criticised for failing to guarantee [[freedom of religion]], in particular the right of each and every individual to [[Apostasy in Islam|change their religion]], as a "fundamental and non-derogable right".&lt;ref name="Farouh2002"/&gt; In a joint written statement submitted by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU), a [[non-governmental organization]] in special [[consultative status]], the Association for World Education (AWE) and the Association of World Citizens (AWC), a number of concerns were raised that the CDHRI limits human rights, religious freedom, and freedom of expression. The statement concludes that "The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam is clearly an attempt to limit the rights enshrined in the UDHR and the International Covenants. It can in no sense be seen as complementary to the Universal Declaration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/node/3162|title=The Cairo Declaration and the Universality of Human Rights|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031135736/http://www.iheu.org/node/3162|archivedate=2008-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, in an article to the United Nations, the [[Center for Inquiry]] writes that the CDHRI "undermines equality of persons and freedom of expression and religion by imposing restrictions on nearly every human right based on Islamic Sharia law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/cfi_defends_freedom_of_expression_at_the_un_human_rights_council/|title=CFI Defends Freedom of Expression at the U.N. Human Rights Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhona Smith writes that, because of the CDHRI's reference to Shariah, it implies an inherent degree of superiority of men.&lt;ref name="Smith2003"&gt;Rhona, Smith. ''Textbook on International Human Rights'', Oxford University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84174-301-1}}, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adama Dieng]]—a member of the [[International Commission of Jurists]]—has also criticised the CDHRI. He argued that the declaration gravely threatens the inter-cultural consensus on which the international human rights instruments are based; that it introduces intolerable discrimination against non-Muslims and women. He further argued that the CDHRI reveals a deliberately restrictive character in regard to certain fundamental rights and freedoms, to the point that certain essential provisions are below the legal standards in effect in a number of Muslim countries; it uses the cover of the "Islamic sharia (Law)" to justify the legitimacy of practices, such as corporal punishment, which attack the integrity and dignity of the human being.&lt;ref name="Midstream"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 2009, the journal ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' summarized the criticism of the Cairo Declaration in an editorial: "We are deeply concerned with the changes to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by a coalition of Islamic states within the [[United Nations]] that wishes to prohibit any criticism of religion and would thus protect Islam's limited view of human rights. In view of the conditions inside the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Bangdalesh, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we should expect that at the top of their human rights agenda would be to rectify the legal inequality of women, the suppression of political dissent, the curtailment of free expression, the persecution of ethnic minorities and religious dissenters—in short, protecting their citizens from egregious human rights violations. Instead, they are worrying about protecting Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kurtz, [[Austin Dacey]], and Tom Flynn. "Defaming Human Rights". ''[[Free Inquiry]]''. February/March 2009, Vol. 29, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Creating a '''cellular model''' has been a particularly challenging task of [[systems biology]] and [[mathematical biology]].
It involves developing efficient [[algorithms]], [[data structures]], [[Biological data visualization|visualization]] and communication tools to orchestrate the integration of large quantities of biological data with the goal of [[computer modeling]].

It is also directly associated with [[bioinformatics]], [[computational biology]] and [[Artificial life]].

It involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of the many [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s which comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes.

The complex network of biochemical reaction/transport processes and their spatial organization make the development of a predictive model of a living cell a grand challenge for the 21st century.

==Overview==
The eukaryotic [[cell cycle]] is very complex and is one of the most studied topics, since its misregulation leads to [[cancer]]s.
It is possibly a good example of a mathematical model as it deals with simple calculus but gives valid results. Two research groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpf.biol.vt.edu/lab_website/ |title=The JJ Tyson Lab|publisher=[[Virginia Tech]]|date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cellcycle.bme.hu/ |title=The Molecular Network Dynamics Research Group|publisher=[[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; have produced several models of the cell cycle simulating several organisms. They have recently produced a generic eukaryotic cell cycle model which can represent a particular eukaryote depending on the values of the parameters, demonstrating that the idiosyncrasies of the individual cell cycles are due to different protein concentrations and affinities, while the underlying mechanisms are conserved (Csikasz-Nagy et al., 2006).&lt;br /&gt;
By means of a system of [[ordinary differential equation]]s these models show the change in time ([[dynamical system]]) of the protein inside a single typical cell; this type of model is called a [[deterministic system|deterministic process]] (whereas a model describing a statistical distribution of protein concentrations in a population of cells is called a [[stochastic process]]).&lt;br /&gt;
To obtain these equations an iterative series of steps must be done: first the several models and observations are combined to form a consensus diagram and the appropriate kinetic laws are chosen to write the differential equations, such as [[Reaction rate|rate kinetics]] for stoichiometric reactions, [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics]] for enzyme substrate reactions and [[Goldbeter–Koshland kinetics]] for ultrasensitive transcription factors, afterwards the parameters of the equations (rate constants, enzyme efficiency coefficients and Michaelis constants) must be fitted to match observations; when they cannot be fitted the kinetic equation is revised and when that is not possible the wiring diagram is modified. The parameters are fitted and validated using observations of both wild type and mutants, such as protein half-life and cell size.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to fit the parameters the differential equations need to be studied. This can be done either by simulation or by analysis. &lt;br /&gt;
In a simulation, given a starting [[Array data structure|vector]] (list of the values of the variables), the progression of the system is calculated by solving the equations at each time-frame in small increments.&lt;br /&gt;
In analysis, the properties of the equations are used to investigate the behavior of the system depending of the values of the parameters and variables. A system of differential equations can be represented as a [[vector field]], where each vector described the change (in concentration of two or more protein) determining where and how fast the trajectory (simulation) is heading. Vector fields can have several special points: a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|stable point]], called a sink, that attracts in all directions (forcing the concentrations to be at a certain value), an [[unstable point]], either a source or a [[saddle point]] which repels (forcing the concentrations to change away from a certain value), and a limit cycle, a closed trajectory towards which several trajectories spiral towards (making the concentrations oscillate).&lt;br /&gt; A better representation which can handle the large number of variables and parameters is called a [[bifurcation diagram]] ([[bifurcation theory]]): the presence of these special steady-state points at certain values of a parameter (e.g. mass) is represented by a point and once the parameter passes a certain value, a qualitative change occurs, called a bifurcation, in which the nature of the space changes, with profound consequences for the protein concentrations: the cell cycle has phases (partially corresponding to G1 and G2) in which mass, via a stable point, controls cyclin levels, and phases (S and M phases) in which the concentrations change independently, but once the phase has changed at a bifurcation event ([[cell cycle checkpoint]]), the system cannot go back to the previous levels since at the current mass the vector field is profoundly different and the mass cannot be reversed back through the bifurcation event, making a checkpoint irreversible. In particular the S and M checkpoints are regulated by means of special bifurcations called a [[Hopf bifurcation]] and an [[infinite period bifurcation]].

==Molecular level simulations==
Cell Collective&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cellcollective.org/ | title=Interactive Modeling of Biological Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a modeling software that enables one to house dynamical biological data, build computational models, stimulate, break and recreate models. The development is led by Tomas Helikar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://helikarlab.org/members.html | title=Helikar Lab - Members}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a researcher within the field of computational biology. It is designed for biologists, students learning about computational biology, teachers focused on teaching life sciences, and researchers within the field of life science. The complexities of math and computer science are built into the backend and one can learn about the methods used for modeling biological species, but complex math equations, algorithms, programming are not required and hence won't impede model building.

The mathematical framework behind Cell Collective is based on a common qualitative (discrete) modeling technique where the regulatory mechanism of each node is described with a logical function [for more comprehensive information on logical modeling, see &lt;ref&gt;Morris MK, Saez-Rodriguez J, Sorger PK, Lauffenburger DA.. Logic-based models for the analysis of cell signaling networks. Biochemistry (2010) 49(15):3216–24.10.1021/bi902202q

Model validation
The model was constructed using local (e.g., protein–protein interaction) information from the primary literature. In other words, during the construction phase of the model, there was no attempt to determine the local interactions based on any other larger phenotypes or phenomena. However, after the model was completed, verification of the accuracy of the model involved testing it for the ability to reproduce complex input–output phenomena that have been observed in the laboratory. To do this, the T-cell model was simulated under a multitude of cellular conditions and analyzed in terms of input–output dose–response curves to determine whether the model behaves as expected, including various downstream effects as a result of activation of the TCR, G-protein-coupled receptor, cytokine, and integrin pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Conroy BD, Herek TA, Shew TD, Latner M, Larson JJ, Allen L, et al.

The E-Cell Project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.e-cell.org/ | title=E-Cell project}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims "to make precise whole cell simulation at the molecular level possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.e-cell.org/ecell/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029020449/http://www.e-cell.org/ecell |archive-date=2010-10-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the July 2012 issue of [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']], a team led by [[Markus W. Covert|Markus Covert]] at Stanford published the most complete computational model of a cell to date. The model of the roughly 500-gene ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' contains 28 algorithmically-independent components incorporating work from over 900 sources. It accounts for interactions of the complete [[genome]], [[transcriptome]], [[proteome]], and [[metabolome]] of the organism, marking a significant advancement for the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://covertlab.stanford.edu/publicationpdfs/mgenitalium_whole_cell_2012_07_20.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/july/computer-model-organism-071812.html | title=Stanford researchers produce first complete computer model of an organism| date=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most attempts at modeling cell cycle processes have focused on the broad, complicated molecular interactions of many different chemicals, including several [[cyclin]] and [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] molecules as they correspond to the [[S phase|S]], [[M phase|M]], [[G1 phase|G1]] and [[G2 phase|G2]] phases of the [[cell cycle]]. In a 2014 published article in PLOS computational biology, collaborators at [[University of Oxford]], [[Virginia Tech]] and Institut de Génétique et Développement de Rennes produced a simplified model of the cell cycle using only one cyclin/CDK interaction. This model showed the ability to control totally functional [[cell division]] through regulation and manipulation only the one interaction, and even allowed researchers to skip phases through varying the concentration of CDK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cell Cycle Control by a Minimal Cdk Network|journal = PLoS Comput Biol|date = 2015-02-06|pmc = 4319789|pmid = 25658582|pages = e1004056|volume = 11|issue = 2|doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004056|first = Claude|last = Gérard|first2 = John J.|last2 = Tyson|first3 = Damien|last3 = Coudreuse|first4 = Béla|last4 = Novák}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model could help understand how the relatively simple interactions of one chemical translate to a cellular level model of cell division.

'''Clever Bins Limited''' was UK company that provided [[solar energy|solar]]-powered street [[litter bin]] that displayed digital [[outdoor advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/domestic?domesticnum=2515319 "Clever Bins a trademarked term"], ''Intellectual Property Office'', Published 5 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clever Bin==
The 'Clever Bins' came with [[A2 paper size|A2]] sized display panels that were lit up by directional [[LED]] beams. The panels came with military standard [[Riot shield]]ing. Some models of the bin could broadcast messages to nearby [[mobile device]]s.

The bins used solar power that, even in cloudy conditions, could charge the units for up to 7 hours of illumination. The level of illumination was regulated depending on the power available.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Funding==

In August 2009, Sachiti failed to find an investor on the BBCs TV show [[Dragons' Den (UK TV series)|Dragons' Den]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/entrepreneurs/williamsachiti.shtml "BBC Dragons Den Pitch"]''BBC Dragons Den Pitch '', Broadcast August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognitive science]] and [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistic theory]] have played an important role in providing empirical research into the [[writing process]] and serving the teaching of composition. As composition theories, there is some dispute concerning the appropriateness of tying these two schools of thought together into one theory of [[Composition studies|composition]]. However, their empirical basis for research and ties to the process theory of composition and cognitive science can be thought to warrant  some connection.

==Theoretical construct==
The cognitive theory of composition (hereafter referred to as “cognitive theory”) can trace its roots to psychology and cognitive science. [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s and [[Jean Piaget]]'s contributions to the theories of cognitive development and developmental psychology could be found in early work linking these sciences with composition theory (see [[Ann E. Berthoff]]).  [[Linda Flower]] and [[John Hayes (cognitive scientist)|John Hayes]] published “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing” in 1981, providing the groundwork for further research into how thought processes influence the writing process.

[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] theories of composition found their roots in the debate surrounding [[grammar]]'s importance in composition pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Hartwell, Patrick. "Grammar, Grammars, and the Teaching of Grammar." [[College English]] 47.2 (1985): 105-127. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars, such as [[Janet Emig]], [[Patrick Hartwell]], [[Martha J. Kolln]], Robert Funk, [[Stephen Witte]], and [[Lester Faigley]] continued this line of thought around the same time that a cognitive theory of composition was being developed by Flower and Hayes. These scholars, like scholars researching cognitive-oriented composition theory, focused on research providing insight into the writing process, but were also committed to providing pedagogical advancements addressing deficiencies, trends, and insights gained from their linguistic research.

==Research==

===Cognitive Theory===
A cognitive theory is focused on gaining insight into the writing process through the writer’s thought processes. Composition theorists have attacked the problem of accessing writers’ thoughts in various ways. Flower and Hayes’  essay, “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing” sought to outline the writer’s choice-making throughout the writing process, and how those choices constrained or influenced other choices down the line.&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Linda, and John R. Hayes. "A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing." College Composition and Communication 32.4 (1981): 365-387. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has focused on capturing the cognitive processes of writers during the writing process through note-taking or speaking aloud,&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Anne M., and Barbara M. Sitko. Hearing Ourselves Think: Cognitive Research in the College Writing Classroom. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; while some early research by Birdwell, Nancrow, and Ross was done with computers to record writers’ keystrokes during the writing process.

===Applied Linguistics===
Linguistic composition theory has traditionally focused on sentence and paragraph-level composition, with the goal of providing instructors insights into the way students write at various proficiency levels. Stephen Witte and Lester Faigley&lt;ref&gt;Faigley, Lester, and Stephen P. Witte. "Coherence, Cohesion, and Writing Quality." College Composition and Communication 32.2 (1981): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; utilized detailed [[syntactic]] analysis to redefine the importance of [[cohesion (linguistics)|cohesion]] and [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] in judging writing quality. Paul Rodgers&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, Paul Jr. C. "A Discourse-centered Rhetoric of the Paragraph." College Composition and Communication 17.1 (1966): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Braddock&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, Richard. "The Frequency and Placement of Topic Sentences in Expository Prose." Research in the Teaching of English 8.3 (1974): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; focused on paragraph structure, in separate studies, in order to dispel common misjudgments about the importance of traditional paragraph structure.

Applied linguistics, specifically [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL/ESL]] studies, has played a large role in development linguistic theories of composition. Liz Hamp-Lyons’ research in ESL/EFL [[writing assessment]] is valuable in informing ESL composition pedagogy. [[Paul Kei Matsuda]],&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul Kei. "Composition Studies and ESL Writing: A Disciplinary Division of Labor." College Composition and Communication 50.4 (1999): 699-721.&lt;/ref&gt;  has illustrated the deficiency in ESL composition research, and recent compilations by Matsuda and others&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul Kei, Michelle Cox, and Jay Jordan. Second-language Writing in the Composition Classroom: A Critical Sourcebook. New York: Bedford / St. Martin's, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; have attempted to bridge the gap between ESL instruction and composition theory by presenting pedagogical, theoretical, and assessment frameworks in the ESL composition classroom.

==Pedagogy==
Cognitive and linguistic theories of composition are heavily tied to [[process theory]]. Cognitive and linguistic theories have been instrumental in providing respected empirical research to the field of [[Composition studies|composition theory]], but tend to stay away from making pedagogical suggestions. Instead, research in these fields is typically intended to inform process theory by providing data analysis regarding the writing process, and by bringing scientific research to the field.

The '''Columbia Water Center''' ('''CWC''') was established in January 2008 as a branch of the [[Earth Institute]] at [[Columbia University]]. The center focuses on researching and addressing global water-related challenges, including [[water scarcity]], access, quality and climate risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/articles/view/2125 |title=The Earth Institute Water |publisher=[[Earth Institute]] |author= |date= |accessdate=2009-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center's stated mission is to "creatively tackle water challenges of a rapidly changing world where water and climate interact with food, energy, ecosystems and urbanization," by combining "the rigor of scientific research with the impact of effective policy."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/about-us/|title=Columbia Water Center: About Us |publisher=Columbia Water Center |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbia Water Center takes a multidisciplinary approach to water challenges, employing [[hydrologists]], [[climatologists]], [[environmental engineer]]s, and [[water policy]] analysts. The Director of the center is Upmanu Lall, the Carol Silberstein Professor of Earth and Environmental Engineering and Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2757  |title=The Earth Institute Profiles: Upmanu Lall |publisher=[[Earth Institute]] |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre Gentine, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, also takes a leading role in the center, with his own PhD and Post-doctoral team focusing on the interactions between soil and atmospheric moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~pg2328/Website/Pierre_Gentines_Homepage/Lab.html|title=Gentine Lab website|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earth water and sky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/05/11/earth-water-and-sky-a-conversation-with-pierre-gentine-a-new-columbia-water-center-scientist/|title=Earth, Water and Sky –A Conversation with Pierre Gentine, a new Columbia Water Center Scientist|date=11 May 2011|last=Polycarpou|first=Lakis|publisher=State of the planet|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center currently divides its projects into five themes, America's Water, The Global Floods Initiative, Data Analytics and Multi-Scale Predictions, Risk and Financial Instruments and the Water, Food, Energy Nexus.&lt;ref name="research themes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/  |title=The Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |publisher=Columbia Water Center |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Earth Institute, under the leadership of [[Jeff Sachs]], is a research institution that supports sustainable development from various angles.&lt;ref name="Earth Institute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2021|title=PepsiCo Foundation announces major new grant to the Earth Institute at Columbia University to promote global water sustainability |publisher=[[Earth Institute]]|date=22 January 2008|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[PepsiCo]] Foundation awarded the [[Earth Institute]] $6 million to address these water-related issues. The PepsiCo grant led to the establishment of the Columbia Water Center under the leadership of Columbia University engineering professor Upmanu Lall.  This three-year grant made possible projects in four countries: India, China, Mali, and Brazil.&lt;ref name="Earth Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepsico.com/Purpose/Environmental-Sustainability/Water|title=Our planet sustainability efforts and goals|publisher=PepsiCo|accessdate=5 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001095523/http://www.pepsico.com/Purpose/Environmental-Sustainability/Water|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, CWC has partnered with the [[Federal University of Ceará]] in the northeast to focus on sophisticated climate-based forecasting systems used for water allocation decisions across diverse use sectors.  In addition, the CWC team recently completed a municipal water plan (PAM) for Milhã, a rural area in central Ceará. The project outlines a plan for the municipality to deliver water to all of its 14,000 residents.

As part of the project, the CWC designed and built water infrastructure demonstration projects for Ingá and Pedra Fina, two communities in Milhã. The project provides water to 500 people in the area.&lt;ref name="CWC Article"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/energy-english/2010/June/20100528161751kjleinad0.6077082.html |title=Columbia Water Center at Work Across Globe |publisher=America.gov |author=Carrie Loewenthal Massey |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2010-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the project focuses on reducing water consumption in the agricultural sector by encouraging sustainable crop choice patterns, as well as working with corporations to deploy better [[irrigation]] technologies (and increase reliability) throughout their supply chains.  A key objective is to reduce the [[overdrafting|groundwater stress]] in the region. Primary project locations are in the states of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="Circleofblue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2010/world/qa-upmanu-lall-gives-insight-to-indias-nexus-of-energy-food-and-water?CP.rss=true |title=U.S., India Working Together to Address India’s Water Needs |publisher=Circle of Blue Water News|author=J. Carl Ganter |date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2011-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Punjab, the CWC has partnered with [[Punjab Agricultural University]] to come up with innovative solutions to reduce farmer irrigation. Some of the methods developed (including the use of inexpensive [[Tensiometer (soil science)|tensiometers]] to measure soil moisture and direct seeding of rice) were field tested in the 2010 planting season with over 500 farmers participating.&lt;ref name="India"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/energy-english/2010/May/20100528153333kjleinad0.4795191.html?CP.rss=true |title=U.S., India Working Together to Address India’s Water Needs |publisher=America.gov |author=Carrie Loewenthal Massey |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2010-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Punjab Agricultural University team reports that participating farmers saved 25 to 30 percent of their normal water use by implementing the new approaches. The CWC/PAU team plans to scale up the pilot project in 2011 by recruiting 5,000 rice farmers to use tensiometers.&lt;ref name="tensiometer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2010/11/17/%E2%80%9Csmall-is-also-beautiful%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-appropriate-technology-cuts-rice-famers%E2%80%99-water-use-by-30-percent-in-punjab-india/?CP.rss=true |title=‘Small is Also Beautiful’ – Appropriate Technology Cuts Rice Famers’ Water Use by 30 Percent in Punjab, India |publisher=blogs.ei.columbia.edu |author=Lakis Polycarpou |date=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gujarat, the Columbia Water Center is working with the state government to reform [[subsidies in India|electricity subsidies]] to provide a greater incentive for farmers to conserve water. In conjunction with subsidy reform, the CWC is also piloting water saving technologies among farmers.&lt;ref name="WaterWideWeb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterwideweb.org/incentives-for-water-conservation-in-guajarat.html#comments |title=Incentives for Water Conservation in Gujarat |publisher=WaterWideWeb.org |author=Eryn-Ashlei Bailey |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2011-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502164844/http://www.waterwideweb.org/incentives-for-water-conservation-in-guajarat.html#comments |archivedate=2011-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work in Mali coincides with the [[Millennium Villages Project]]. CWC is focusing on designing irrigation and cropping systems that can be operated and maintained locally in order to provide farmers with higher-value cash crops. The center has installed large pumps that improved the amount of water available.  Projects emphasize bringing together local partners, [[market forces]] and [[public-private partnership]]s.

==Current Research ==

In recent years, the Columbia Water Center has expanded the scope of its initiatives to encompass five broad research themes.&lt;ref name="research themes" /&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/americas-water/ America's Water]===

The America’s Water Initiative is aims to build a network of academic institutions, government agencies, and private industry to inform water infrastructure improvements in the United States and address other water challenges. The initiative focuses on all aspects of water, from policy to drought and flood forecasting and the potential for disruptive water technology to provide distributed water infrastructure that is less expensive than replacing legacy systems.&lt;ref name="America's Water"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/americas-water/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=America's water |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2015, the initiative held its first annual symposium, which brought together water experts from various groups, representing the industry, utilities, policy and non-profit sectors among others. The meeting was intended to be a first step toward a broader working relationship that can help set a water research agenda and develop solutions for national water challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://piscesfoundation.org/partnering-with-academia-to-address-u-s-water-challenges/|title=Partnering with Academia to Address U.S. Water Challenges|date=13 March 2013|accessdate=5 April 2017|last=Stoner|first=Nancy|publisher=Pisces Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2015/03/19/waking-up-to-americas-water-challenges/|title=Waking up to America’s Water Challenges|date=19 March 2015|publisher=State of the Planet|last=Polycarpou|first=Lakis|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/global-floods-initiative/ The Global Floods Initiative]===

The Global Floods Initiative aims to apply cutting-edge and continually evolving  climate forecasting techniques to help helping policymakers, disaster relief agencies, infrastructure designers, financial institutions and others better prepare for, manage and respond to extreme floods.&lt;ref name="Global Floods Initiative 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/global-floods-initiative/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Global floods initiative |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earth water and sky" /&gt;

The initiative builds on almost two decades of research on how the quasi-periodic climate cycles (such as El-Nino/La-Nina and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) interact to increase the risk of flooding in particular locations. More recent research into hydrometerology, which looks at the interaction of land, water and atmosphere at a more local scale, adds additional layers to the potential for flood prediction.&lt;ref name="research themes" /&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/ Data Analytics and Multi-Scale Predictions]===

The Columbia Water Center is a leader in predicting seasonal hydroclimate forecasts and associated risk analyses. These forecasts are used for a variety of applications, including integrating climate forecasts into water allocation procedures for urban, industrial and agricultural consumers.&lt;ref name="Data Analytics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Data analytics and multi-scale predictions |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New ways of representing convection and vegetation response to water stress are also major areas of research, the results of which could offer new understandings of the carbon and hydrological cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/5115-2/|title=Predictions, Surface Energy, Plants: Understanding the Hydrologic Cycle|publisher=Columbia Water Center|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/risk-and-financial-instruments/ Risk and Financial Instruments]===

Climate forecasting can also be used to develop flood and drought risk metrics for companies with global supply chains. These metrics can help companies address challenges through new sourcing strategies, novel regional financial risk management products (e.g., cat bonds, index insurance), pre-emptive maintenance and mitigation, reservoir reallocation agreements and other tools.&lt;ref name="Risk and Financial Instruments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/risk-and-financial-instruments/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Risk and finantial instruments |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/water-food-energy-nexus/ Water, Food, Energy Nexus]===

The Columbia Water Center  studies how the water, food, and energy sectors are interrelated and how climate affects this relationship. Projects include policy research and recommendations to  promote water and energy savings in the agricultural sector in water-stressed farming regions, development of seasonal forecasts to guide decision-making in the water and energy sectors, and testing and implementation of low-cost soil moisture and nitrogen sensors to improve irrigation efficiency, reducing fertilizer use and [[groundwater pollution]] and saving energy from groundwater pumping.&lt;ref name="Water, Food, Energy Nexus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/water-food-energy-nexus/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Water, food, energy nexus |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Circleofblue" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10848">'''Ecological civilization''' is the final goal of social and environmental reform within a given society. It implies that the changes required in response to global [[climate change|climate disruption]] and social injustices are so extensive as to represent another form of human civilization, one based on [[ecological]] principles. Broadly construed, ecological civilization involves a synthesis of economic, educational, political, agricultural, and other societal reforms toward [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"&gt;Zhihe Wang, Huili He, and Meijun Fan, [http://monthlyreview.org/2014/11/01/the-ecological-civilization-debate-in-china/ "The Ecological Civilization Debate in China: The Role of Ecological Marxism and Constructive Postmodernism—Beyond the Predicament of Legislation"], last modified 2014, ''[[Monthly Review]]'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although the term was first coined in the 1980s, it did not see widespread use until 2007, when “ecological civilization” became an explicit goal of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC).&lt;ref name="newblueprint"&gt;Zhang Chun, [http://thediplomat.com/2015/09/chinas-new-blueprint-for-an-ecological-civilization/ "China's New Blueprint for an 'Ecological Civilization'"], last modified September 30, 2015, ''[[The Diplomat]]'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chinaturnstoecology"&gt;James Oswald, [http://asaa.asn.au/china-turns-to-ecology-in-search-of-civilisation/ "China turns to ecology in search of ‘civilisation’"], last modified August 3, 2016, ''Asian Studies Association of Australia'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the [[United Nations Alliance of Civilizations]] and the [[International Ecological Safety Collaborative Organization]] founded a sub-committee on ecological civilization.&lt;ref name="unep"&gt;Zhu Guangyao, [http://web.unep.org/ourplanet/march-2016/articles/ecological-civilization/ "Ecological Civilization: A national strategy for innovative, concerted, green, open and inclusive development"], last modified March 2016, ''[[United Nations Environment Programme]]'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of ecological civilization agree with Pope Francis who writes, "We are faced not with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental. Strategies for a solution demand an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Francis |first1=Pope |title=Laudato Si': On Care for Our Common Home |page=Ch 4, #139}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ecological civilization emphasizes the need for major environmental and social reforms that are both long-term and systemic in orientation.&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt;

==History==

In 1984, former [[Soviet Union]] environment experts proposed the term “Ecological Culture” (экологической культуры) in an article entitled “Ways of Fostering Ecological Culture in Individuals under the Conditions of Mature Socialism" which was published in ''Scientific Communism'', Moscow, vol. 2.&lt;ref name="ecoculture"&gt;Липицкий, В. С., "Пути формирования экологической культуры личности в условиях зрелого социализма," Вестн. Моск. ун-та. Сер. 12, ''Теория научного коммунизма'' 2 1984: p43.&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of this article was published in the Chinese newspaper the [[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]], where the notion of ecological culture was translated into Chinese as 生态文明 (shēngtài wénmíng), or ecological civilization.&lt;ref name="ecocivguang"&gt;张擅, [http://www.cqvip.com/read/read.aspx?id=49988300 “在成熟社会主义条件下培养个人生态文明的途径,”] ''光明日报'', 18th February 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, the concept of ecological civilization was picked up in China, and was first used by [[Ye Qianji]] (1909–2017), an [[agricultural economist]], in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cq.xinhuanet.com/2017-03/01/c_1120547146.htm 中国生态农业奠基人108岁叶谦吉教授在重庆仙逝]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barbarity"&gt;Arran Gare, [https://philpapers.org/archive/GARBCA.pdf], in ''Chromatikon V: Yearbook of Philosophy in Process'', ed. [[Michel Weber]] and Ronny Desmet (Louvain-la-Neuve: [[Presses universitaires de Louvain]], 2009): 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ye defined ecological civilization by drawing from the [[ecology|ecological sciences]] and [[environmental philosophy]].&lt;ref name="chinagoverning"&gt;Jiahua Pan, ''China's Environmental Governing and Ecological Civilization'' (Heidelberg: [[Springer-Verlag]] GmbH, 2016), 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time the phrase “ecological civilization” was used as a technical term in an English-language book was in 1995.&lt;ref name="chinagoverning2"&gt;Jiahua Pan, ''China's Environmental Governing and Ecological Civilization'' (Heidelberg: [[Springer-Verlag]] GmbH, 2016), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Roy Morrison, an environmentalist, coined the phrase in his book ''Ecological Democracy'', writing that “An ecological civilization is based on diverse lifeways sustaining linked natural and social ecologies.”&lt;ref name="ecologicaldemocracy"&gt;Roy Morrison, ''Ecological Democracy'' (Boston: [[South End Press]], 1995), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is found more extensively in Chinese discussions beginning in 2007.&lt;ref name="newblueprint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chinaturnstoecology"/&gt; In 2012, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) included the goal of achieving an ecological civilization in its constitution, and it also featured in its [[Five-year plans of China|five-year plan]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost"&gt;[[John B. Fullerton]], [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-fullerton/china-ecological-civiliza_b_6786892.html "China: Ecological Civilization Rising?"], last modified May 2, 2015, ''[[Huffington Post]]'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Chinese context, the term generally presupposes the framework of a “constructive postmodernism,” as opposed to an extension of [[modernist]] practices or a “[[Postmodernism#Deconstruction|deconstructive postmodernism]],” which stems from the deconstruction of [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt;

Both “ecological civilization” and “constructive postmodernism” have been associated with the [[process philosophy]] of [[Alfred North Whitehead]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Putting Philosophy to Work"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |last2=Scwhartz |first2=Wm.

Beardslee, and Joe Holland, ''Varieties of Postmodern Theology'' (Albany, [[State University of New York Press]], 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest international conference held on the theme “ecological civilization” (''[https://www.ctr4process.org/whitehead2015/ Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization]'') took place at [[Pomona College]] in June 2015, bringing together roughly 2,000 participants from around the world and featuring such leaders in the environmental movement as [[Bill McKibben]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], [[Wes Jackson]], and [[Sheri Liao]].&lt;ref name="conferencereport"&gt;Herman Greene, [http://www.ecozoicsocieties.org/musings/2015/re-imagining-civilization-as-ecological-report-on-the-seizing-an-alternative-toward-an-ecological-civilization-conference/ "Re-Imagining Civilization as Ecological: Report on the 'Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization' Conference"], last modified August 24, 2015, ''Center for Ecozoic Societies'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, the Chinese discussion of ecological civilization is increasingly associated with an “organic” form of [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt; “Organic Marxism” was first used by [[Philip Clayton (philosopher)|Philip Clayton]] and Justin Heinzekehr in their 2014 book, ''Organic Marxism: An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe''.&lt;ref name="organicmarxism"&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-05/01/c_135326965.htm "Spotlight: Organic Marxism, China's ecological civilization drive in spotlight at int'l conference"], last modified May 1, 2016, ''[[Xinhua News Agency]]'', accessed November 1, 2016. See [[Philip Clayton (philosopher)|Philip Clayton]] and Justin Heinzekehr, ''Organic Marxism: An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe'' (Claremont: Process Century Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The book, which was translated into Chinese and published by the People’s Press in 2015, describes ecological civilization as an orienting goal for the global [[ecological movement]].&lt;ref name="chineseorganicmarxism"&gt;[[Philip Clayton (philosopher)|Philip Clayton]] and Justin Heinzekehr, ''Organic Marxism: An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe'', trans. Xian Meng, Guifeng Yu, and Lixia Zhang (Beijing: The People's Press, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

A defence of ecological civilization as the ultimate goal of humanity, has been mounted by Arran Gare in
''The Philosophical Foundations of Ecological Civilization: A Manifesto for the Future'', &lt;ref&gt;https://www.routledge.com/The-Philosophical-Foundations-of-Ecological-Civilization-A-manifesto-for/Gare/p/book/9781138685765&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in 2016.

The programs in more than 27 Florida counties include:
*[[Environmental Lands Acquisition and Protection Program]] (ELAPP), Hillsborough County
*[[Environmentally Endangered Lands]] protection program, Brevard County
*[[Environmentally Sensitive Lands Protection Program]] (ESLPP), Sarasota County
* Environmentally Endangered Lands (EEL) [[Miami-Dade County]]
*[[Environmentally Sensitive Lands]], [[Hernando County]]'s program
*Land Preservation Bond Program, [[Broward County]]
*Palm Beach County land acquisition program

==History==
Miami-Dade County voters approved a tax for Environmentally Endangered Lands in 1990 and $40 million more $40 million in 2004 through the Building Better Communities Bond.&lt;ref name=counties/&gt;

[[Broward County]] approved its Land Preservation Bond Program in 2000 and purchased 83 sites for a totalof 850 acres as of 2007, using $152 million of its $200 million.&lt;ref name=counties/&gt;

Palm Beach County started its land acquisition program in 1991 with a $100 million bond. Through 2006 the country had protected 35,063 acres. A volunteer program helps with restoration and maintenance.&lt;ref name=counties&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/2007/06/17/140849/counties-spend-millions-on-acquiring.html#storylink=cpy Counties spend millions on acquiring land] June 17, 2007Miami Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, voters in Hillsborough County, Florida, overwhelmingly chose to increase taxes and create the Environmental Lands Acquisition and Protection Program (ELAPP)&lt;ref&gt;[https://usflibrary.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=f620c1b74f624fa982414db2391b290a ELAPP History Project]&lt;/ref&gt;. Through this program, environmentally sensitive areas were preserved and/or restored. Again in 1990 and 2008, voters opted to increase taxes in order to expand ELAPP.

On November 6, 2008 Florida voted for an amendment to the [[Florida Constitution]] requiring the state legislature to exempt land permanently set aside for conservation from all property taxes beginning in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/green/Florida_Voters_Lift_Property_Taxes_for_Conservation_Lands.html Florida Voters Lift Property Taxes for Conservation Lands] Janaryu 7, 2010 NBC4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evergreen forest==
Twenty-seven endangered and threatened plants live in the evergreen forests called hammocks. Several species originated in the [[West Indies]] including ''[[Ficus]]'', [[gumbo-limbo]], [[Nectandra coriacea|lancewood]] and [[paradise-tree]]s. Temperate [[live oak]] grows in the forests. [[Hattie Bauer Hammock]] is one preserve with this type of habitat and was acquired in 1996. Vines are a problem outcompeting the native [[goatsfoot]] (''[[Passiflora sexflora]]''). The threatened broad [[halberd fern]] (''[[Tectaria heracleifolia]]'') and [[maidenhair ferns]]. [[Cuban nakedwood]], ''[[Colubrina cubensis]]'' var. ''floridana'' is highly endangered. ''[[Colubrina]]''. It is also known as [[Cuban snakebark]].&lt;ref name=endangered/&gt;

==Southern glade==
Plants protected in Southern glades include wildflowers like ''[[Samolus parviflorus]]'' (water pimpernel), [[yellowtop]], [[lavender thistle]], [[marsh pink]]s, and [[Calopogon tuberosus|grass pink]] orchids (''[[Calapogon tuberosus]]''). Bird inhabitants include [[double-crested cormorant]]s, [[great blue heron]], [[little blue heron]], [[tricolored heron]], [[snowy egret]], [[osprey]], [[kingfisher]] and [[grebe]]. Native [[poisonwood]] grows in these areas. Other species include [[white-crowned pigeon]], [[Spike rush]], [[Cladium|sawgrass]], [[crayfish]], [[marsh rabbit]], [[deer]] and [[Florida panther]]; as well as colicroot (''[[Aletris bracteata]]''), the lavender ground orchid ''[[Bletia purpurea]]'' and ''[[Pinguicula pumila]]'', a dwarf [[butterwort]].&lt;ref name=endangered/&gt;

==Scrub==
Florida's oldest ecosystem is scrub. One area is of it protected in a fenced 15-acre plot called [[County Line Scrub]] on the [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]]/ [[Broward County]] border boundary and at the four acre [[Dolphin Center Park]] Addition. Inhabitants include [[live oak]], [[Chapman's oak]], [[myrtle oak]] and a natural [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] known as [[Rolf's oak]]. [[Winged sumac]], which provides red fruit for small [[warbler]]s and other wildlife in the fall, pawpaws (''[[Asimina]]''), [[Saw palmetto]]s, [[cocoplum]], [[wax myrtle]], [[tarflower]] (''[[Befaria racemosa]]'') as well as the endangered [[quailberry]] (''[[Crossopetalum ilicifolium]]''). [[Blueberry]] and [[rusty lyonia]]. Animals such as [[gopher tortoise]], [[scrub lizard]], [[burrowing owl]] and [[indigo snake]]. Even smaller parcels can host [[coontie]], [[sabal palm]], [[partridge pea]] and a native cactus: ''[[Opuntia humifusa]]''.
These can be seen at [[Arch Creek, Florida|Arch Creek]] or [[Greynolds Park]].&lt;ref name=endangered/&gt;

==Pine Rockland==
Pine rockland is a rare ecosystem, with only about 4,000 acres of the original 185,000 acres, remaining. This type of habitat developed around limestone and fire. [[Scissor-tail kite]], [[osprey]]. [[Rockdale Pineland]] is one preserve, home to endangered [[Redland sandmat]] (deltoid spurge). The land conservation programs have protected an additional 850 acres. [[locustberry]] [[saw palmetto]], [[coontie]], a native [[cycad]] used by pioneers to make starch, [[wild poinsettia]] and [[lantana]].

On a [[differentiable manifold]], the '''exterior derivative''' extends the concept of the [[pushforward (differential)|differential]] of a function to [[differential form]]s of higher degree. The exterior derivative was first described in its current form by [[Élie Cartan]] in 1899; it allows for a natural, metric-independent generalization of [[Stokes' theorem]], [[Gauss's theorem]], and [[Green's theorem]] from vector calculus.

If a {{math|''k''}}-form is thought of as measuring the flux through an infinitesimal {{math|''k''}}-[[Parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]], then its exterior derivative can be thought of as measuring the net flux through the boundary of a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-parallelotope.

== Definition ==
The exterior derivative of a [[differential form]] of degree {{math|''k''}} is a differential form of degree {{math|''k'' + 1.}}

If {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is a [[Smoothness|smooth function]] (a {{math|0}}-form), then the exterior derivative of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is the [[Pushforward (differential)|differential]] of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}. That is, {{math|''df''&amp;thinsp;}} is the unique [[1-form|{{math|1}}-form]] such that for every smooth [[vector field]] {{math|''X''}}, {{math|1=''df''&amp;thinsp;(''X'') = ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}, where {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is the [[directional derivative]] of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} in the direction of {{math|''X''}}.

There are a variety of equivalent definitions of the exterior derivative of a general {{math|''k''}}-form.

===In terms of axioms===
The exterior derivative is defined to be the unique {{math|ℝ}}-linear mapping from {{math|''k''}}-forms to {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-forms satisfying the following properties:

# {{math|''df''&amp;thinsp;}} is the [[Differential_of_a_function|differential]] of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}, for {{math|0}}-forms  ([[Smoothness|smooth functions]]) {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}.
# {{math|1=''d''(''df''&amp;thinsp;) = 0}} for any {{math|0}}-form (smooth function) {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}.
# {{math|1=''d''(''α'' ∧ ''β'') = ''dα'' ∧ ''β'' + (−1){{sup|''p''}} (''α'' ∧ ''dβ'')}} where {{mvar|α}} is a {{math|''p''}}-form. That is to say, {{math|''d''}} is an [[derivation (algebra)|antiderivation]] of degree {{math|1}} on the [[exterior algebra]] of differential forms.

The second defining property holds in more generality: in fact, {{math|1=''d''(''dα'') = 0}} for any {{math|''k''}}-form {{mvar|α}}; more succinctly, {{math|1=''d''{{i sup|2}} = 0}}. The third defining property implies as a special case that if {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is a function and {{mvar|α}} a {{math|''k''}}-form, then {{math|1=''d''(&amp;thinsp;''fα'') = ''d''(&amp;thinsp;''f'' ∧ ''α'') = ''df''&amp;thinsp; ∧ ''α'' + &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; ∧ ''dα''}} because functions are {{math|0}}-forms, and scalar multiplication and the exterior product are equivalent when one of the arguments is a scalar.

===In terms of local coordinates===
Alternatively, one can work entirely in a [[local coordinate system]] {{math|(''x''{{sup|1}}, ..., ''x''{{i sup|''n''}})}}. The coordinate differentials {{math|''dx''{{sup|1}}, ..., ''dx''{{i sup|''n''}}}} form a basis of the space of one-forms, each associated with a coordinate. Given a [[multi-index]] {{math|1=''I'' = (''i''{{sub|1}}, ..., ''i''{{sub|''k''}})}} with {{math|1 ≤ ''i''{{sub|''p''}} ≤ ''n''}} for {{math|1 ≤ ''p'' ≤ ''k''}} (and denoting {{math|''dx''{{i sup|''i''{{sub|1}}}} ∧ ... ∧ ''dx''{{i sup|''i''{{sub|''k''}}}}}} with an [[abuse of notation]] {{math|1=''dx''{{i sup|''I''}}}}), the exterior derivative of a (simple) {{math|''k''}}-form

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = g\,dx^I = g\,dx^{i_1}\wedge dx^{i_2}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;

over {{math|ℝ{{sup|''n''}}}} is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;d{\varphi} =  \frac{\partial g}{\partial x^i} dx^i \wedge dx^I&lt;/math&gt;

(using [[Einstein notation]]).  The definition of the exterior derivative is extended [[linear]]ly to a general {{math|''k''}}-form

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = f_I dx^I,&lt;/math&gt;

where each of the components of the multi-index {{math|''I''}} run over all the values in {{math|{1, ..., ''n''}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}. Note that whenever {{math|''i''}} equals one of the components of the multi-index {{math|''I''}} then {{math|1=''dx''{{i sup|''i''}} ∧ ''dx''{{i sup|''I''}} = 0}} (see [[Exterior product]]).

The definition of the exterior derivative in local coordinates follows from the preceding [[#In terms of axioms|definition in terms of axioms]]. Indeed, with the {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''φ''}} as defined above,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d{\varphi} &amp;= d\left (g\,dx^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k} \right ) \\
                   &amp;= dg  \wedge \left (dx^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k} \right ) + g\,d\left (
                      dx^{i_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k} \right ) \\
                   &amp;= dg \wedge dx^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k} + g \sum_{p=1}^k (-1)^{p-1} dx^{i_1}
                      \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_{p-1}} \wedge d^2x^{i_p} \wedge dx^{i_{p+1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge d
                      x^{i_k} \\
                     &amp;= dg \wedge dx^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k} \\
                     &amp;= \frac{\partial g}{\partial x^i} dx^i \wedge dx^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, we have interpreted {{math|''g''}} as a {{math|0}}-form, and then applied the properties of the exterior derivative.

This result extends directly to the general {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} as

:&lt;math&gt;d{\omega} = \frac{\partial f_I}{\partial x^i} dx^i \wedge dx^I .&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, for a {{math|1}}-form {{math|''ω''}}, the components of {{math|''dω''}} in local coordinates are
:&lt;math&gt;(d\omega)_{ij} = \partial_i \omega_j - \partial_j \omega_i. &lt;/math&gt;

===In terms of invariant formula===
Alternatively, an explicit formula can be given for the exterior derivative of a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}}, when paired with {{math|''k'' + 1}} arbitrary smooth [[vector field]]s {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;d\omega(V_0,...,V_k) = \sum_i(-1)^{i} V_i \left( \omega \left (V_0, \ldots, \hat V_i, \ldots,V_k \right )\right) +\sum_{i&lt;j}(-1)^{i+j}\omega \left (\left [V_i, V_j \right ], V_0, \ldots, \hat V_i, \ldots, \hat V_j, \ldots, V_k \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|[''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''V&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'']}} denotes the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] and a hat denotes the omission of that element:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega \left (V_0, \ldots, \hat V_i, \ldots,V_k \right ) = \omega \left (V_0, \ldots, V_{i-1}, V_{i+1}, \ldots, V_k \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, for {{math|1}}-forms we have: {{math|1=''dω''(''X'', ''Y'') = ''X''(''ω''(''Y'')) − ''Y''(''ω''(''X'')) − ''ω''([''X'', ''Y''])}}, where {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} are vector fields, {{math|''X''(''ω''(''Y''))}} is the scalar field defined by the vector field {{math|''X'' ∈ Γ(''TM'')}} applied as a differential operator ("directional derivative along ''X''") to the scalar field defined by applying {{math|''ω'' ∈ Γ{{sup|∗}}(''TM'')}} as a covector field to the vector field {{math|''Y'' ∈ Γ(''TM'')}} and likewise for {{math|''Y''(''ω''(''X''))}}.

'''Note:''' Some authors (e.g., Kobayashi–Nomizu and Helgason) use a formula that differs by a factor of {{math|{{sfrac|''k'' + 1}}}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}d\omega(V_0,...,V_k) &amp;= {1 \over k+1} \sum_i(-1)^{i} V_i \left( \omega \left (V_0, \ldots, \hat V_i, \ldots,V_k \right )\right) \\
&amp;+ {1 \over k+1}  \sum_{i&lt;j}(-1)^{i+j}\omega \left (\left [V_i, V_j \right ], V_0, \ldots, \hat V_i, \ldots, \hat V_j, \ldots, V_k \right ).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
'''Example 1.''' Consider {{math|1=''σ'' = ''u''&amp;thinsp;''dx''{{i sup|1}} ∧ ''dx''{{i sup|2}}}} over a {{math|1}}-form basis {{math|''dx''{{i sup|1}}, ..., ''dx''{{i sup|''n''}}}}. The exterior derivative is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  d\sigma &amp;= du \wedge dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \\
                    &amp;= \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial u}{\partial x^i} dx^i\right) \wedge dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \\
                    &amp;= \sum_{i=3}^n \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x^i} dx^i \wedge dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The last formula follows easily from the properties of the [[exterior product]]. Namely, {{math|1=''dx''{{i sup|''i''}} ∧ ''dx''{{i sup|''i''}} = 0}}.

'''Example 2.''' Let {{math|1=''σ'' = ''u''&amp;thinsp;''dx'' + ''v''&amp;thinsp;''dy''}} be a {{math|1}}-form defined over {{math|ℝ{{sup|2}}}}. By applying the above formula to each term (consider {{math|1=''x''{{i sup|1}} = ''x''}} and {{math|1=''x''{{i sup|2}} = ''y''}}) we have the following sum,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\sigma 
    &amp;= \left( \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{\partial u}{\partial x^i} dx^i \wedge dx \right) + \left( \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{\partial v}{\partial x^i} dx^i \wedge dy \right) \\
    &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}} dx \wedge dx + \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}} dy \wedge dx\right) + \left(\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}} dx \wedge dy + \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}} dy \wedge dy\right) \\
    &amp;= 0 - \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}} dx \wedge dy + \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}} dx \wedge dy + 0 \\
    &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}} - \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}\right) dx \wedge dy
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Stokes' theorem on manifolds ==
{{main|Stokes' theorem}}

If {{math|''M''}} is a compact smooth orientable {{math|''n''}}-dimensional manifold with boundary, and {{math|''ω''}} is an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form on {{math|''M''}}, then the generalized form of [[Stokes' theorem]] states that:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial{M}} \omega&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, if one thinks of {{math|''M''}} as being divided into infinitesimal regions, and one adds the flux through the boundaries of all the regions, the interior boundaries all cancel out, leaving the total flux through the boundary of {{math|''M''}}.

== Further properties ==

===Closed and exact forms===
{{main article|Closed and exact forms}}
A {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} is called ''closed'' if {{math|1=''dω'' = 0}}; closed forms are the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of {{math|''d''}}. {{math|''ω''}} is called ''exact'' if {{math|1=''ω'' = ''dα''}} for some {{math|(''k'' − 1)}}-form {{math|''α''}}; exact forms are the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of {{math|''d''}}. Because {{math|1=''d''{{i sup|2}} = 0}}, every exact form is closed. The [[Poincaré lemma]] states that in a contractible region, the converse is true.

===de Rham cohomology===
Because the exterior derivative {{math|''d''}} has the property that {{math|1=''d''{{i sup|2}} = 0}}, it can be used as the [[Cochain complex|differential]] (coboundary) to define [[de Rham cohomology]] on a manifold. The {{math|''k''}}-th de Rham cohomology (group) is the vector space of closed {{math|''k''}}-forms modulo the exact {{math|''k''}}-forms; as noted in the previous section, the Poincaré lemma states that these vector spaces are trivial for a contractible region, for {{math|''k'' &gt; 0}}. For [[smooth manifold]]s, integration of forms gives a natural homomorphism from the de Rham cohomology to the singular cohomology over {{math|ℝ}}. The theorem of de Rham shows that this map is actually an isomorphism, a far-reaching generalization of the Poincaré lemma. As suggested by the generalized Stokes' theorem, the exterior derivative is the "dual" of the [[Chain complex#Formal definition|boundary map]] on singular simplices.

===Naturality===
The exterior derivative is natural in the technical sense: if {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is a smooth map and {{math|Ω{{sup|''k''}}}} is the contravariant smooth [[functor]] that assigns to each manifold the space of {{math|''k''}}-forms on the manifold, then the following diagram commutes

:[[Image:Exteriorderivnatural.png|none]]

so {{math|1=''d''(&amp;thinsp;''f''{{i sup|∗}}''ω'') = &amp;thinsp;''f''{{i sup|∗}}''dω''}}, where {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''{{i sup|∗}}}} denotes the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}. This follows from that {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''{{i sup|∗}}''ω''(·)}}, by definition, is {{math|''ω''(&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(·))}}, {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} being the [[Pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}. Thus {{math|''d''}} is a [[natural transformation]] from {{math|Ω{{sup|''k''}}}} to {{math|Ω{{sup|''k''+1}}}}.

== Exterior derivative in vector calculus ==
Most [[vector calculus]] operators are special cases of, or have close relationships to, the notion of exterior differentiation.

===Gradient===
A [[smooth function]] {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f'' : ''M'' → ℝ}} on a real differentiable manifold {{math|''M''}} is a {{math|0}}-form. The exterior derivative of this {{math|0}}-form is the {{math|1}}-form {{math|''df''}}.

When an inner product {{math|{{langle}}·,·{{rangle}}}} is defined, the [[gradient]] {{math|∇''f''&amp;thinsp;}} of a function {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is defined as the unique vector in {{math|''V''}} such that its inner product with any element of {{math|''V''}} is the directional derivative of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} along the vector, that is such that

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \nabla f, \cdot \rangle = df = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\, dx^i .&lt;/math&gt;

That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = (df)^\sharp = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\, (dx^i)^\sharp ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|{{music|sharp}}}} denotes the [[musical isomorphism]] {{math|{{music|sharp}} : ''V''{{sup|∗}} → ''V''}} mentioned earlier that is induced by the inner product.

The {{math|1}}-form {{math|''df''&amp;thinsp;}} is a section of the [[cotangent bundle]], that gives a local linear approximation to {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} in the cotangent space at each point.

===Divergence===
A vector field {{math|1=''V'' = (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} on {{math|ℝ{{sup|''n''}}}} has a corresponding {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\omega_V &amp;= v_1 \left (dx^2 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^n \right) - v_2 \left (dx^1 \wedge dx^3  \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^n \right ) + \cdots + (-1)^{n-1}v_n \left (dx^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{n-1} \right) \\
&amp;=\sum_{p=1}^n (-1)^{(p-1)}v_p \left (dx^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{p-1} \wedge \widehat{dx^{p}} \wedge dx^{p+1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^n \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\widehat{dx^{p}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the omission of that element.

(For instance, when {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}, i.e. in three-dimensional space, the {{math|2}}-form {{math|''ω&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is locally the [[scalar triple product]] with {{math|''V''}}.)  The integral of {{math|''ω&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}} over a hypersurface is the [[flux]] of {{math|''V''}} over that hypersurface.

The exterior derivative of this {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form is the {{math|''n''}}-form

:&lt;math&gt;d\omega _V = \operatorname{div} V \left (dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^n \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

===Curl===
A vector field {{math|''V''}} on {{math|ℝ{{sup|''n''}}}} also has a corresponding {{math|1}}-form

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_V = v_1  dx^1 + v_2 dx^2 + \cdots + v_n dx^n.&lt;/math&gt;,

Locally, {{math|''η&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the dot product with {{math|''V''}}. The integral of {{math|''η&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}} along a path is the [[Mechanical work|work]] done against {{math|−''V''}} along that path.

When {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}, in three-dimensional space, the exterior derivative of the {{math|1}}-form {{math|''η&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the {{math|2}}-form

:&lt;math&gt;d\eta_V = \omega_{\operatorname{curl} V}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Invariant formulations of operators in vector calculus===
The standard [[vector calculus]] operators can be generalized for any [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], and written in coordinate-free notation as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcccl}
      \operatorname{grad} f &amp;\equiv&amp; \nabla f        &amp;=&amp; \left( d f \right)^\sharp \\
      \operatorname{div} F  &amp;\equiv&amp; \nabla \cdot F  &amp;=&amp; {\star d {\star} ( F^\flat )} \\
      \operatorname{curl} F &amp;\equiv&amp; \nabla \times F &amp;=&amp; \left( {\star} d ( F^\flat ) \right)^\sharp \\
      \Delta f              &amp;\equiv&amp; \nabla^2 f      &amp;=&amp; {\star} d {\star} d f \\
                            &amp;      &amp; \nabla^2 F      &amp;=&amp; \left(d{\star}d{\star}(F^{\flat}) - {\star}d{\star}d(F^{\flat})\right)^{\sharp} , \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|⋆}} is the [[Hodge dual|Hodge star operator]], {{music|flat}} and {{music|sharp}} are the [[musical isomorphism]]s, {{mvar|&amp;thinsp;f&amp;thinsp;}} is a [[scalar field]] and {{mvar|F}} is a [[vector field]].

Note that the expression for &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{curl}&lt;/math&gt; makes sense only in three dimensions, since it requires &lt;math&gt;\sharp&lt;/math&gt; to act on &lt;math&gt;{\star} d( F^\flat )&lt;/math&gt;, which is a form of degree &lt;math&gt;n-2&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Condensed matter physics|expanded=States of matter}}
An ideal '''Fermi gas''' is a [[phase of matter]] which is an ensemble of a large number of non-interacting [[fermion]]s. Fermions are [[subatomic particle|particles]] that obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]], like [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, and in general, particles with half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]. These statistics determine the energy distribution of fermions in a Fermi gas in [[thermal equilibrium]], and is characterized by their [[number density]], [[temperature]], and the set of available energy states. The model is named after the Italian physicist [[Enrico Fermi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fermi|first=E.|author-link=Enrico Fermi|date=1926-11-01|title=Zur Quantelung des idealen einatomigen Gases|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01400221|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik|language=de|volume=36|issue=11-12|pages=902–912|doi=10.1007/BF01400221|issn=0044-3328|bibcode=1926ZPhy...36..902F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This physical model can be accurately applied to many systems with a large number of fermions. Some key examples are the behaviour of [[Free electron model|charge carriers in a metal]], [[nucleon]]s in an [[atomic nucleus]], neutrons in a [[neutron star]], and electrons in a [[white dwarf]].

==  Description ==
[[File:FermiZustaendeA.png|left|thumb|350x350px|Illustration of the energy states: Energy-occupation diagram for a system with 7 energy levels, the energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is degenerate ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' times and has an occupancy given by ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', with ''i''=1,2,3,4,5,6,7. By the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], up to ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' fermions can occupy a level of energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''  of the system.]]

An ideal Fermi gas or free Fermi gas is a [[mathematical model|physical model]] assuming a collection of non-interacting fermions in a constant [[potential well]]. It is the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] version of an [[ideal gas]], for the case of fermionic particles.

By the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], no [[quantum state]] can be occupied by more than one fermion with an identical set of [[quantum number]]s. Thus a non-interacting Fermi gas, unlike a [[Bose gas]], concentrates a small number of particles per energy. Thus a Fermi gas is prohibited from condensing into a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]], although weakly-interacting Fermi gases might.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Regal|first=C. A.|last2=Greiner|first2=M.|last3=Jin|first3=D. S.|date=2004-01-28|title=Observation of Resonance Condensation of Fermionic Atom Pairs|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.040403|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=92|issue=4|pages=040403|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.040403|arxiv=cond-mat/0401554|bibcode=2004PhRvL..92d0403R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total energy of the Fermi gas at [[absolute zero]] is larger than the sum of the single-particle [[ground state]]s because the Pauli principle implies a sort of interaction or pressure that keeps fermions separated and moving. For this reason, the [[pressure]] of a Fermi gas is non-zero even at zero temperature, in contrast to that of a classical ideal gas.  For example, this so-called [[degeneracy pressure]] stabilizes a [[neutron star]] (a Fermi gas of neutrons) or a [[white dwarf]] star (a Fermi gas of electrons) against the inward pull of [[gravity]], which would ostensibly collapse the star into a [[black hole]]. Only when a star is sufficiently massive to overcome the degeneracy pressure can it collapse into a singularity.

It is possible to define a Fermi temperature below which the gas can be considered degenerate (its pressure derives almost exclusively from the Pauli principle). This temperature depends on the mass of the fermions and the [[density of states|density of energy states]].

The main assumption of the [[free electron model]] to describe the delocalized electrons in a metal can be derived from the Fermi gas. Since interactions are neglected due to [[screening effect]], the problem of treating the equilibrium properties and dynamics of an ideal Fermi gas reduces to the study of the behaviour of single independent particles. In these systems the Fermi temperature is generally many thousands of [[kelvin]]s, so in human applications the electron gas can be considered degenerate. The maximum energy of the fermions at zero temperature is called the '''Fermi energy'''. The Fermi energy surface in [[Reciprocal lattice|reciprocal space]] is known as the [[Fermi surface]].

The [[nearly free electron model]] adapts the Fermi gas model to consider the [[crystal structure]] of [[metal]]s and [[semiconductor]]s. Where electrons in a crystal lattice are substituted by [[Bloch wave]]s with a corresponding [[crystal momentum]]. As such, periodic systems are still relatively tractable and the model forms the starting point for more advanced theories that deal with interactions, e.g., using the [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]].

==Illustration of the Fermi energy for a one-dimensional well==
The one-dimensional [[Particle in a box|infinite square well]] of length ''L'' is a model for a one-dimensional box. It is a standard model-system in quantum mechanics for which the solution for a single particle is well known. The levels are labelled by a single quantum number ''n'' and the energies are given by
:&lt;math&gt;E_n = E_0 + \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2 m L^2} n^2. \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; is the potential energy level inside the box, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the mass of a single fermion, and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced [[Planck constant]].

Suppose now that instead of one particle in this box we have ''N'' particles in the box and that these particles are fermions with [[spin-½]]. Then not more than two particles can have the same energy, i.e., two particles can have the energy of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;, two other particles can have energy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; and so forth. The reason that two particles can have the same energy is that a  particle can have a spin of ½ (spin up) or a spin of −½ (spin down), leading to two states for each energy level. In the configuration for which the total energy is lowest (the ground state), all the energy levels up to ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''N''/2 are occupied and all the higher levels are empty.

Defining the reference for the Fermi energy to be &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt;, the Fermi energy is therefore given by
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}}^{(\text{1D})}=E_{N^*/2}-E_0=\frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2 m L^2} (N^*/2)^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''N*'' is equal to (''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) when the number of particles ''N'' is odd, and its equal to (N) for an even number of particles.

==Three-dimensional case==
[[File:Nucleus_drawing.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nucleus_drawing.svg|thumb|A model of the atomic nucleus showing it as a compact bundle of the two types of [[Nucleon|nucleons]]: protons (red) and neutrons (blue). As a first approximation, the nucleus can be treated as composed of non-interacting proton and neutron gases.]]
The three-dimensional [[isotropic]] and non-[[Special relativity|relativistic]] case is known as the '''Fermi sphere'''.

Let us now consider a three-dimensional infinite square well, that is, a cubical box that has a side length ''L''. The states are now labelled by three quantum numbers ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;. The single particle energies are
::&lt;math&gt;E_{n_x,n_y,n_z} = E_0 + \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m L^2} \left( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; are positive integers. There are multiple states with the same energy, for example &lt;math&gt;E_{211}=E_{121}=E_{112}&lt;/math&gt;. Now let's put ''N'' non-interacting fermions of spin ½ into this box. To calculate the Fermi energy, we look at the case where ''N'' is large.

If we introduce a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}=(n_x,n_y,n_z)&lt;/math&gt; then each quantum state corresponds to a point in 'n-space' with energy 
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathbf{n}} =  E_0 + \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m L^2} |\mathbf{n}|^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{n}|^2 &lt;/math&gt;denoting the square of the usual Euclidean length &lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{n}|=\sqrt{n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2} &lt;/math&gt;. 
The number of states with energy less than ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ &amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the number of states that lie within a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{n}_{\mathrm{F}}|&lt;/math&gt; in the region of n-space where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; are positive. In the ground state this number equals the number of fermions in the system.
:&lt;math&gt;N =2\times\frac{1}{8}\times\frac{4}{3} \pi n_{\mathrm{F}}^3 \,&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:K-space.JPG|thumb|The free fermions that occupy the lowest energy states form a [[sphere]] in [[Reciprocal lattice|reciprocal space]]. The surface of this sphere is the [[Fermi surface]].]]
the factor of two is once again because there are two spin states, the factor of 1/8 is because only 1/8 of the sphere lies in the region where all ''n'' are positive. We find
:&lt;math&gt;n_{\mathrm{F}}=\left(\frac{3 N}{\pi}\right)^{1/3} &lt;/math&gt;
so the '''Fermi energy''' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m L^2} n_{\mathrm{F}}^2 = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m L^2} \left( \frac{3 N}{\pi} \right)^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt;

Which results in a relationship between the Fermi energy and the [[Particle number density|number of particles per volume]] (when we replace ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with ''V''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;):
::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left( \frac{3 \pi^2 N}{V} \right)^{2/3} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The total energy of a Fermi sphere of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; fermions is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm T} = N E_0 + \int_0^N  E_{\mathrm{F}} \, \mathrm{d}N^\prime = \left(\frac{3}{5} E_{\mathrm{F}} + E_0\right)N&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the average energy per particle is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; E_\mathrm{av} = E_0 + \frac{3}{5} E_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt;

==Related quantities==
Using this definition of Fermi energy, various related quantities can be useful.
The '''Fermi temperature''' is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{E_{\mathrm{F}}}{k_{\rm B}} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. The Fermi temperature can be thought of as the temperature at which thermal effects are comparable to quantum effects associated with Fermi statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physics.usu.edu/torre/3700_Spring_2015/Lectures/08.pdf|title=PHYS 3700: Introduction to Quantum Statistical Thermodyamics|last=Torre|first=Charles|date=2015-04-21|website=Utah State University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fermi temperature for a metal is a couple of orders of magnitude above room temperature.

Other quantities defined in this context are '''Fermi momentum''' 
:&lt;math&gt; p_{\mathrm{F}} = \sqrt{2 m E_{\mathrm{F}}} &lt;/math&gt;,
and '''Fermi velocity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Solids/Fermi.html|title=Fermi level and Fermi function|last=Nave|first=Rod|date=|website=|publisher=[[HyperPhysics]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; v_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{p_{\mathrm{F}}}{m}&lt;/math&gt;.
These quantities are the [[momentum]] and [[group velocity]], respectively, of a [[fermion]] at the [[Fermi surface]]. The Fermi momentum can also be described as &lt;math&gt;p_{\mathrm{F}} = \hbar k_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the Fermi sphere and is called the '''Fermi wave vector'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ashcroft | first = Neil W. | last2 = Mermin | first2 = N. David | title = Solid State Physics | publisher = [[Henry Holt and Company|Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] | year = 1976 | isbn = 0-03-083993-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These quantities are ''not'' well-defined in cases where the Fermi surface is non-spherical.

== Thermodynamic quantities ==
=== Degeneracy pressure ===
As we showed above, a Fermi gas has a non-zero total energy even at zero temperature. By using the [[first law of thermodynamics]], we can associate a pressure to this internal energy, that is
:&lt;math&gt;P = -\frac{\partial E_{\rm T}}{\partial V} = \frac{2}{5}\frac{N}{V}E_{\mathrm{F}}= \frac{(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\hbar^2}{5m}\left(\frac{N}{V}\right)^{5/3},&lt;/math&gt;

where the expression is only valid for temperatures much smaller than the Fermi temperature. This pressure is known as the '''degeneracy pressure'''. In this sense, systems composed of fermions are also referred as [[degenerate matter]].

Standard [[star]]s avoid collapse by balancing thermal pressure ([[plasma (physics)|plasma]] and radiation) against gravitational forces. At the end of the star lifetime, when thermal processes are weaker, some stars may become white dwarfs, which are only sustained against gravity by [[electron degeneracy pressure]]. Using the Fermi gas as a model, it is possible to calculate the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], i.e. the maximum mass any star may acquire (without significant thermally generated pressure) before collapsing into a black hole or a neutron star. The latter, is a star mainly composed of neutrons, where the collapse is also avoided by neutron degeneracy pressure.

For the case of metals, the electron degeneracy pressure contributes to the compressibility or [[bulk modulus]] of the material.

=== Chemical potential ===
{{See also|Fermi level}}
Assuming that the concentration of fermions does not change with temperature, then the [[total chemical potential]] ''µ'' (Fermi level) of the three-dimensional ideal Fermi gas is related to the zero temperature Fermi energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; by a [[Sommerfeld expansion]] (assuming &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm B}T \ll E_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(T) = E_0 + E_{\mathrm{F}} \left[ 1- \frac{\pi ^2}{12} \left(\frac{k_{\rm B}T}{E_{\mathrm{F}}}\right) ^2 - \frac{\pi^4}{80} \left(\frac{k_{\rm B}T}{E_{\mathrm{F}}}\right)^4 + \cdots \right] &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''T'' is the [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uam.es/personal_pdi/ciencias/jgr/pdfs/fermi.pdf|title=Statistical Mechanics of Ideal Fermi Systems|last=Kelly|first=James J.|date=1996|website=Universidad Autónoma de Madrid|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/ugrad/sphys_old/sphys_webct/PHYS3905_SM/TSM12.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919073627/http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/ugrad/sphys_old/sphys_webct/PHYS3905_SM/TSM12.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-19|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2014-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, the [[internal chemical potential]], ''µ''-''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,  is approximately equal to the Fermi energy at temperatures that are much lower than the characteristic Fermi temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. This characteristic temperature is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; [[kelvin|K]] for a metal, hence at room temperature (300 K), the Fermi energy and internal chemical potential are essentially equivalent.

== Density of states ==
[[File:Free-electron_DOS.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Free-electron_DOS.svg|thumb|300x300px|Figure 3: Density of states (DOS) of a Fermi gas in 3-dimensions]]
For the three dimensional case, with fermions of spin-½, we can obtain the number of particles as a function of the energy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;N(E)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting the Fermi energy by a variable energy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;(E-E_0)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;N(E)=\frac{V}{3\pi^2}\left[\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E-E_0)\right]^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;,
which we can use to obtain the [[density of states]] (number of energy states per energy per volume) &lt;math&gt;g(E)&lt;/math&gt;. It can be calculated by differentiating the number of particles with respect to the energy:
:&lt;math&gt;g(E) =\frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial N(E)}{\partial E}= \frac {1}{2\pi^2} \left(\frac {2m}{\hbar^2}\right)^{3/2}\sqrt{E-E_0}&lt;/math&gt;.
=== Arbitrary-dimensional case===
Using a volume integral on &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, we can find the state density:
:&lt;math&gt;g^{(d)}(E)=g_s \int\frac{\mathrm{d}^d\mathbf{k}}{(2\pi)^d}\delta\left(E-E_0-\frac{\hbar^2|\mathbf{k}|^2}{2m}\right)=g_s\ \frac{d}{2}\left(\frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}\right)^{d/2} \frac{(E-E_0)^{d/2-1}}{\Gamma(d/2+1)}  &lt;/math&gt;
By then looking for the [[number density]] of particles, we can extract the Fermi energy:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{N}{V}=\int_{E_0}^{E_0+E_{\mathrm{F}}^{(d)}}g^{(d)}(E) \, \mathrm{d}E&lt;/math&gt;
To get:
: &lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}}^{(d)}=\frac{2\pi\hbar^2}{m}\left(\tfrac{1}{g_s}\Gamma\left(\tfrac{d}{2}+1\right)\frac{N}{V}\right)^{2/d}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding ''d''-dimensional volume,  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g_s&lt;/math&gt; is the dimension for the internal Hilbert space. For the case of spin-½, every energy is twice-degenerate, so in this case &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g_{s}=2&lt;/math&gt;.

A particular result is obtained for &lt;math&gt;d=2&lt;/math&gt;, where the density of states becomes a constant (does not depend on the energy):

:&lt;math&gt;g^{(2\mathrm{D})}(E)=\frac{g_s}{2}\frac{m}{\pi \hbar^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Typical values==

===Metals===
Under the [[free electron model]], the electrons in a metal can be considered to form a Fermi gas. The number density &lt;math&gt;N/V&lt;/math&gt; of conduction electrons in metals ranges between approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; electrons/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is also the typical density of atoms in ordinary solid matter.
This number density produces a Fermi energy of the order:

::&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e} \left( 3 \pi^2 \ 10^{28 \  \sim  \ 29} \ \mathrm{m}^{-3} \right)^{2/3} \approx 2 \  \sim  \ 10 \ \mathrm{eV} &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Electron rest mass|electron mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/fermi.html|title=Fermi Energies, Fermi Temperatures, and Fermi Velocities|last=Nave|first=Rod|date=|website=|publisher=[[HyperPhysics]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Fermi energy corresponds to a Fermi temperature of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; kelvins, much higher than the temperature of the [[sun]] surface. Any metal will boil before reaching this temperature under atmospheric pressure. Thus for any practical purpose a metal, can be considered as a Fermi gas at zero temperature as a first approximation (normal temperatures are small compared to ''T''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;).

===White dwarfs===
Stars known as [[white dwarfs]] have mass comparable to our [[Sun]], but have about a hundredth of its radius.  The high densities mean that the electrons are no longer bound to single nuclei and instead form a degenerate electron gas.  The number density of electrons in a white dwarf is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; electrons/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. 
This means their Fermi energy is:

::&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e} \left( \frac{3 \pi^2 (10^{36})}{1 \ \mathrm{m}^3} \right)^{2/3} \approx 3 \times 10^5 \ \mathrm{eV} = 0.3 \ \mathrm{MeV}&lt;/math&gt;

===Nucleus===
Another typical example is that of the particles in a nucleus of an atom.  The [[Nuclear size|radius of the nucleus]] is roughly:
::&lt;math&gt;R = \left(1.25 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{m} \right) \times A^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''A'' is the number of [[nucleons]].

The number density of nucleons in a nucleus is therefore:
::&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{A}{\begin{matrix} \frac{4}{3} \end{matrix} \pi R^3 } \approx 1.2 \times 10^{44} \ \mathrm{m}^{-3} &lt;/math&gt;

Now since the Fermi energy only applies to fermions of the same type, one must divide this density in two.  This is because the presence of [[neutron]]s does not affect the Fermi energy of the [[proton]]s in the nucleus, and vice versa.

So the Fermi energy of a nucleus is about:

::&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_{\rm p}} \left( \frac{3 \pi^2 (6 \times 10^{43})}{1 \ \mathrm{m}^3} \right)^{2/3} \approx 3 \times 10^7 \ \mathrm{eV} = 30 \ \mathrm{MeV} &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the proton mass.

The [[Nuclear size|radius of the nucleus]] admits deviations around the value mentioned above, so a typical value for the Fermi energy is usually given as 38 [[MeV]].

== Extensions to the model ==

=== Relativistic Fermi gas ===
[[File:ChandrasekharLimitGraph.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ChandrasekharLimitGraph.svg|right|thumb|350x350px|Radius–mass relations for a model white dwarf, relativistic relation vs non-relativistic. The [[Chandrasekhar limit]] is indicated as M&lt;sub&gt;Ch&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
For the whole article, we have only discussed the case where particles have a parabolic relation between energy and momentum, as is the case in non-relativistic mechanics. For particles with energies close to their respective [[rest mass]], we have to use the equations of [[special relativity]]. Where single-particle energy is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;E=\sqrt{(pc)^2+(mc^2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
For this system, the Fermi energy is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}}=\sqrt{(p_{\mathrm{F}}c)^2+(mc^2)^2}-mc^2\approx p_{\mathrm{F}}c&lt;/math&gt; ,
where the &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; equality is only valid in the [[ultrarelativistic limit]], and 
:&lt;math&gt;p_{\mathrm{F}}=\hbar\left(\frac{1}{g_s}6\pi^2\frac{N}{V}\right)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-0827-3_14|title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics|last=Greiner|first=Walter|last2=Neise|first2=Ludwig|last3=Stöcker|first3=Horst|date=1995|publisher=Springer, New York, NY|year=|isbn=9780387942995|series=Classical Theoretical Physics|location=|pages=341–386|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0827-3_14|author-link=Walter Greiner|author-link3=Horst Stöcker}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The relativistic Fermi gas model is also used for the description of large white dwarfs which are close to the Chandresekhar limit. For the ultrarelativistic case, the degeneracy pressure is proportional to &lt;math&gt;(N/V)^{4/3}&lt;/math&gt;.
=== Fermi liquid ===
In 1956, [[Lev Landau]] developed the [[Fermi liquid theory]], where he treated the case of a Fermi liquid, i.e., a system with repulsive, not necessarily small, interactions between fermions. The theory shows that the thermodynamic properties of an ideal Fermi gas and a Fermi liquid do not differ that much. It can be shown that the Fermi liquid is equivalent to a Fermi gas composed of collective excitations or [[quasiparticle]]s, each with a different [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] and [[magnetic moment]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="155769">A '''fuzzy concept''' is a [[concept]] of which the boundaries of application can vary considerably according to context or conditions, instead of being fixed once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic: beyond the formalism''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the concept is [[Vagueness|vague]] in some way, lacking a fixed, precise meaning, without however being unclear or meaningless altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dietz &amp; Sebastiano Moruzzi (eds.), ''Cuts and clouds. Vagueness, Its Nature, and Its Logic.'' Oxford University Press, 2009; Delia Graff &amp; Timothy Williamson (eds.), ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a definite meaning, which can be made more precise only through further elaboration and specification - including a closer definition of the context in which the concept is used. The study of the characteristics of fuzzy concepts and fuzzy language is called ''fuzzy semantics''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Williamson]], ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 124f; [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Quantitative fuzzy semantics". ''Information Sciences'', Vol. 3, No. 2, April 1971, pp. 159-176.&lt;/ref&gt; The inverse of a "fuzzy concept" is a "crisp concept" (i.e. a precise concept). 

A fuzzy concept is understood by scientists as a concept which is "to an extent applicable" in a situation. That means the concept has ''gradations'' of significance or ''unsharp'' (variable) boundaries of application. A fuzzy statement is a statement which is true "to some extent", and that extent can often be represented by a scaled value. The best known example of a fuzzy concept around the world is an amber [[traffic light]], and indeed fuzzy concepts are widely used in traffic control systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sandeep Mehan &amp; Vandana Sharma, "Development of traffic light control system based on fuzzy logic".  ''ACAI '11 Proceedings of the International Conference on Advances in Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2011'', pp. 162–165.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used these days in a more general, popular sense - in contrast to its technical meaning - to refer to a concept which is "rather vague" for any kind of reason.

In the past, the very idea of reasoning with fuzzy concepts faced considerable resistance from academic elites. They did not want to endorse the use of imprecise concepts in research or argumentation. Yet although people might not be aware of it, the use of fuzzy concepts has risen gigantically in all walks of life from the 1970s onward. That is mainly due to advances in electronic engineering, fuzzy mathematics and digital computer programming. The new technology allows very complex inferences about "variations on a theme" to be anticipated and fixed in a program.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Kosko]], ''Fuzzy Thinking: The New Science of Fuzzy Logic.'' New York: Hyperion, 1993; [[Bart Kosko]], ''Heaven in a chip: fuzzy visions of society and science in the digital age''. New York: Three Rivers Press, 1999; Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994.

''IEEE Expert'', August 1994.[https://www.sfu.ca/~jeffpell/papers/ElkanIEEEdiscussion.pdf] A useful overview of the field is provided in: Radim Bělohlávek, [[Joseph W. Dauben]] &amp; [[George J. Klir]], ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new [[neuro-fuzzy]] computational methods make it possible, to identify, to measure and respond to fine gradations of significance, with great precision.&lt;ref&gt;A useful overview is provided in: Enrique Ruspini et al. ''Handbook of fuzzy computation''. Bristol &amp; Philadelphia: Institute of Physics Publishing, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It means that practically useful concepts can be coded and applied to all kinds of tasks, even if, ordinarily, these concepts are never precisely defined. Nowadays engineers, statisticians and programmers often represent fuzzy concepts mathematically, using fuzzy logic, fuzzy values, fuzzy variables and fuzzy sets.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Behlohlavek &amp; George J. Klir (eds.), ''Concepts and fuzzy logic''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Problems of vagueness and fuzziness have probably always existed in human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising et al., ''On fuzziness: homage to Lotfi A. Zadeh'', Vol. 2. Heidelberg: Springer, 2013, p. 656; Ellen Christiaanse, "1.5 million years of information systems; from hunters-gatherers to the domestication of the networked computer". In: David Avison et al., ''The past and future of information systems: 1976-2006 and beyond''. New York: IFIP/Springer, 2006, pp. 165-176.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary between different things can appear blurry. Sometimes people have to think, when they are not in the best frame of mind to do it, or, they have to talk about something out there, which just isn't sharply defined. Across time, however, philosophers and scientists began to reflect about those kinds of problems, in much more systematic ways.

===Sorites paradox===
The ancient [[Sorites paradox]] first raised the logical problem of how we could exactly define the threshold at which a change in quantitative gradation turns into a qualitative or categorical difference.&lt;ref&gt;Rosanna Keefe &amp; Peter Smith, ''Vagueness: a reader.'' Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; With some physical processes this threshold is relatively easy to identify. For example, water turns into steam at 100&amp;nbsp;°C or 212&amp;nbsp;°F (the boiling point depends partly on atmospheric pressure, which decreases at higher altitudes). 

With many other processes and gradations, however, the point of change is much more difficult to locate, and remains somewhat vague. Thus, the boundaries between qualitatively different things may be ''unsharp'': we know that there are boundaries, but we cannot define them exactly. 

According to the modern idea of the [[continuum fallacy]], the fact that a statement is to an extent vague, does not automatically mean that it is invalid. The problem then becomes one of how we could ascertain the kind of validity that the statement does have.

===Loki's wager===
The Nordic myth of [[Loki's wager]] suggested that concepts that lack precise meanings or precise boundaries of application cannot be usefully discussed at all.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Pigliucci &amp; Maarten Boudry (eds.), ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem''. University of Chicago Press, 2013, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 20th century idea of "fuzzy concepts" proposes that "somewhat vague terms" can be operated with, since we can explicate and define the variability of their application, by assigning numbers to gradations of applicability. This idea sounds simple enough, but it had large implications.

===Precursors===
The intellectual origins of the species of fuzzy concepts as a logical category have been traced back to a diversity of famous and less well-known thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Many-Valued Logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; including (among many others) [[Eubulides]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]],&lt;ref&gt;Angelica Nuzzo, "Vagueness and Meaning Variance in Hegel’s Logic". In: Angelica Nuzzo, ''Hegel and the analytical tradition''. New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, pp. 61-82.

Across at least two and a half millennia, all of them had something to say about graded concepts with unsharp boundaries. This suggests at least that the awareness of the existence of concepts with "fuzzy" characteristics, in one form or another, has a very long history in human thought. Quite a few logicians and philosophers have also tried to ''analyze'' the characteristics of fuzzy concepts as a recognized species, sometimes with the aid of some kind of [[many-valued logic]] or [[substructural logic]].

An early attempt in the post-WW2 era to create a theory of sets where set membership is a matter of degree was made by Abraham Kaplan and Hermann Schott in 1951. They intended to apply the idea to empirical research. Kaplan and Schott measured the degree of membership of empirical classes using real numbers between 0 and 1, and they defined corresponding notions of intersection, union, complementation and subset.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Kaplan and Hermann F. Schott, "A calculus for empirical classes", ''Methodos'', Vol. 3, 1951, pp. 165–188.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the time, their idea "fell on stony ground".&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Williamson, ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1996, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Barkley Rosser|J. Barkley Rosser Sr.]] published a treatise on many-valued logics in 1952, anticipating "many-valued sets".&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Barkley Rosser|J. Barkley Rosser Sr.]] and Atwell R. Turquette, ''Many-valued logics''. Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Company, 1952, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Another treatise was published in 1963 by Aleksandr A. Zinov'ev and others&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr A. Zinov'ev, David Dinsmore Comey and Guido Küng, ''Philosophical problems of many-valued logic''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the American philosopher [[William Alston]] introduced the term "degree vagueness" to describe vagueness in an idea that results from the absence of a definite cut-off point along an implied scale (in contrast to "combinatory vagueness" caused by a term that has a number of logically independent conditions of application).&lt;ref&gt;William P. Alston, ''Philosophy of Language''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1964, p. 87; William P. Alston, “Vagueness,” in Paul Edwards (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 8.

===Lotfi Zadeh===
Usually the Iranian-born American computer scientist [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] (1921-2017) is credited with inventing the specific idea of a "fuzzy concept" in his seminal 1965 paper on fuzzy sets, because he gave a formal mathematical presentation of the phenomenon that was widely accepted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Fuzzy sets". In: ''Information and Control'', Vol. 8, June 1965, pp. 338–353.{{cite web|url=http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/Zadeh-1965.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127005930/http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/Zadeh-1965.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-27 |df= See also A. Dumitras, &amp; G. Moschytz, "Understanding Fuzzy Logic: An Interview with Lotfi Zadeh". ''IEEE signal processing magazine'', May 2007, pp. 102-105.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Zadeh who played a decisive role in developing the field of fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets and fuzzy systems, with a large number of scholarly papers.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, Joseph W. Dauben &amp; George J. Klir, ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017. Lotfi A Zadeh with George J. Klir and Bo Yua, ''Fuzzy Sets, Fuzzy Logic, and Fuzzy Systems: Selected Papers''. Singapore and River Edge (N.J.): World Scientific Publishing Company, 1996. This last title includes a bibliography of Zadeh's writings up to 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most philosophical theories of vagueness, Zadeh's engineering approach had the advantage that it could be directly applied to computer programming.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising, "Cybernetics, system(s) theory, information theory and Fuzzy Sets and Systems in the 1950s and 1960s". ''Information Sciences'' No. 180, 2010, pp. 4459-4476.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zadeh's seminal 1965 paper is acknowledged to be one of the most-cited scholarly articles in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013 [http://isdlab.ie.ntnu.edu.tw/ntust/ifsa/files/newsletter/Vol10/IFSAnewsletterV10N1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was placed 46th in the list of the world's 100 most-cited research papers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Van Noorden, Brendan Maher &amp; Regina Nuzzo, "The top 100 papers". ''Nature'', 29 October 2014.[https://www.nature.com/news/the-top-100-papers-1.16224]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1960s, many scholars have contributed to elaborating the theory of reasoning with graded concepts, and the research field continues to expand.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, Joseph W. Dauben &amp; George J. Klir, ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ordinary scholarly definition of a concept as "fuzzy" has been in use from the 1970s onward.

===Criteria===
Radim Bělohlávek explains:

{{Quotation|"There exists strong evidence, established in the 1970s in the psychology of concepts... that human concepts have a graded structure in that whether or not a concept applies to a given object is a matter of degree, rather than a yes-or-no question, and that people are capable of working with the degrees in a consistent way. This finding is intuitively quite appealing, because people say "this product is more or less good" or "to a certain degree, he is a good athlete", implying the graded structure of concepts. In his classic paper, Zadeh called the concepts with a graded structure ''fuzzy concepts'' and argued that these concepts are a rule rather than an exception when it comes to how people communicate knowledge. Moreover, he argued that to model such concepts mathematically is important for the tasks of control, decision making, pattern recognition, and the like. Zadeh proposed the notion of a ''[[fuzzy set]]'' that gave birth to the field of ''[[fuzzy logic]]''..."&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, "What is a fuzzy concept lattice? II", in: Sergei O. Kuznetsov et al. (eds.), ''Rough sets, fuzzy sets, data mining and granular computing.'' Berlin: Springer Verlag, 2011, pp. 19–20.[http://belohlavek.inf.upol.cz/publications/BeVy_Wifcl.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Hence, a concept is generally regarded as "fuzzy" in a logical sense if:
*defining characteristics of the concept apply to it "to a certain degree or extent" (or, more unusually, "with a certain magnitude of likelihood").&lt;ref&gt;The vast majority of scientific or scholarly users of the idea of fuzzy concepts refer to scaled (graded)  characteristics, and not to the variations in the ''likelihoods'' of their applicability.&lt;/ref&gt;
*or, the boundaries of applicability (the truth-value) of a concept can vary in degrees, according to different conditions. 
*or, the fuzzy concept itself straightforwardly consists of a [[fuzzy set]], or a combination of such sets.

The fact that a concept is fuzzy does not prevent its use in logical reasoning; it merely affects the type of reasoning which can be applied (see [[fuzzy logic]]). If the concept has gradations of meaningful significance, it is necessary to specify and formalize what those gradations are, if they can make an important difference. Not all fuzzy concepts have the same logical structure, but they can often be formally described or reconstructed using fuzzy logic or other [[substructural logic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaos Galatos, Peter Jipsen, Tomasz Kowalski &amp; Hiroakira Ono, ''Residuated lattices: an algebraic glimpse at [[substructural logics]].'' Elsevier Science, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this approach is, that numerical notation enables a potentially ''infinite'' number of truth-values between complete truth and complete falsehood, and thus it enables - in theory, at least - the greatest precision in stating the degree of applicability of a logical rule.

===Probability===
[[Petr Hájek]], writing about the foundations of fuzzy logic, sharply distinguished between "fuzziness" and "uncertainty":

{{Quotation|"The sentence "The patient is young" is true to some degree – the lower the age of the patient (measured e.g. in years), the more the sentence is true. Truth of a fuzzy proposition is a matter of degree. I recommend to everybody interested in fuzzy logic that they sharply distinguish fuzziness from uncertainty as a degree of belief (e.g. probability). Compare the last proposition with the proposition "The patient will survive next week". This may well be considered as a crisp proposition which is either (absolutely) true or (absolutely) false; but we do not know which is the case. We may have some probability (chance, degree of belief) that the sentence is true; but probability is not a degree of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petr Hájek]], ''Metamathematics of fuzzy logic''. Dordrecht: Springer, 1998, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[metrology]] (the science of measurement), it is acknowledged that for any measure we care to make, there exists an [[Measurement uncertainty|amount of uncertainty]] about its accuracy, but this degree of uncertainty is conventionally expressed with a magnitude of likelihood, and not as a degree of truth. In 1975, [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] introduced a distinction between "Type 1 fuzzy sets" without uncertainty and "[[Type-2 fuzzy sets and systems|Type 2 fuzzy sets]]" with uncertainty, which has been widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "The Concept of a Linguistic Variable and Its Application to Approximate Reasoning–1", ''Information Sciences'', Vol. 8, pp. 199–249, 1975. Jerry M. Mendel and Robert I. Bob John, "Type-2 Fuzzy Sets Made Simple." ''IEEE transactions on fuzzy systems'', Vol. 10, No. 2, April 2002, pp. 117-127. Jerry M. Mendel, "Advances in type-2 fuzzy sets and systems". In: ''Information Sciences'' 177, 2007, pp. 84–110.[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.466.477&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, in the former case, each fuzzy number is linked to a non-fuzzy (natural) number, while in the latter case, each fuzzy number is linked to another fuzzy number.

==Applications==
===Philosophy===
In philosophical [[logic]] and linguistics, fuzzy concepts are often regarded as vague concepts which in their application, or formally speaking, are neither completely true nor completely false, or which are partly true and partly false; they are ideas which require further elaboration, specification or qualification to understand their applicability (the conditions under which they truly make sense).&lt;ref&gt;[[Delia Graff Fara]], "Shifting Sands: An Interest Relative Theory of Vagueness". ''Philosophical Topics'', Vol. 28 No. 1, 2000, pp. 45-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The "fuzzy area" can also refer simply to a ''residual'' number of cases which cannot be allocated to a known and identifiable group, class or set if strict criteria are used.

===Sciences===
In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], a fuzzy variable (such as "the temperature", "hot" or "cold") is a value which could lie in a probable [[Range (mathematics)|range]] defined by some quantitative limits or [[parameters]], and which can be usefully described with imprecise categories (such as "high", "medium" or "low") using some kind of [[Level of measurement|scale]] or conceptual hierarchy.

===Fuzzy logic===
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}
In mathematics and [[computer science]], the gradations of applicable meaning of a fuzzy concept are described in terms of ''quantitative'' relationships defined by logical operators. Such an approach is sometimes called "degree-theoretic semantics" by logicians and philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;Roy T. Cook, ''A dictionary of philosophical logic''. Edinburgh University Press, 2009, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; but the more usual term is [[fuzzy logic]] or [[many-valued logic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Many-valued logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The novelty of fuzzy logic is, that it "breaks with the traditional principle that [[formal system|formalisation]] should correct and avoid, but not compromise with, vagueness".&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea of fuzzy logic is that a real number is assigned to each statement written in a language, within a range from 0 to 1, where 1 means that the statement is completely true, and 0 means that the statement is completely false, while values less than 1 but greater than 0 represent that the statements are "partly true", to a given, quantifiable extent. [[Susan Haack]] comments:

{{Quotation|"Whereas in classical set theory an object either is or is not a member of a given set, in fuzzy set theory membership is a matter of degree; the degree of membership of an object in a fuzzy set is represented by some real number between 0 and 1, with 0 denoting ''no'' membership and 1 ''full'' membership."&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

"Truth" in this mathematical context usually means simply that "something is the case", or that "something is applicable". This makes it possible to analyze a distribution of statements for their truth-content, identify data patterns, make inferences and predictions, and model how processes operate. 

[[Petr Hájek]] claimed that "fuzzy logic is not just some "applied logic", but may bring "new light to classical logical problems", and therefore might be well classified as a distinct branch of "philosophical logic" similar to e.g. [[Modal logic|modal logics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Petr Hájek]], "Ten questions and one problem on fuzzy logic". ''Annals of Pure and Applied Logic'', Vol. 96, Issues 1-3, March 1999, 157-165, at p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machinery &amp; analytics===

Fuzzy logic offers computationally-oriented systems of concepts and methods, to formalize types of reasoning which are ordinarily approximate only, and not exact. In principle, this allows us to give a definite, precise answer to the question, "To what extent is something the case?", or, "To what extent is something applicable?". Via a series of switches, this kind of reasoning can be built into electronic devices. That was already happening before fuzzy logic was invented, but using fuzzy logic in modelling has become an important aid in design, which creates many new technical possibilities.

Fuzzy reasoning (i.e., reasoning with graded concepts) turns out to have many practical uses.&lt;ref&gt;Kazuo Tanaka, ''An Introduction to Fuzzy Logic for Practical Applications''.

It looks like fuzzy logic will eventually be applied in almost every aspect of life, even if people are not aware of it, and in that sense fuzzy logic is an astonishingly successful invention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goldengooseaward.org/awardees/fuzzy-logic "2017 Golden Goose Awardee: Fuzzy Logic, Clear Impact"]&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific and engineering literature on the subject is constantly increasing.

===Community===
Originally lot of research on fuzzy logic was done by Japanese pioneers inventing new machinery, electronic equipment and appliances (see also [[Fuzzy control system]]).&lt;ref&gt;Michio Sugeno (ed.), ''Industrial applications of fuzzy control''. Amsterdam: North Holland, 1992; Andrew Pollack, "Technology; Fuzzy Logic For Computers". ''New York Times'', 11 October 1984; Andrew Pollack, "Fuzzy Computer Theory: How to Mimic the Mind?" ''New York Times'', 2 April 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea became so popular in Japan, that the English word entered Japanese language (ファジィ概念). "Fuzzy theory" (ファジー理論) is a recognized field in Japanese scientific research.

===Achievements===
[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] estimated around 2014 that there were more than 50,000 fuzzy logic–related, patented inventions. He listed 28 journals at that time dealing with fuzzy reasoning, and 21 journal titles on [[soft computing]]. His searches found close to 100,000 publications with the word "fuzzy" in their titles, but perhaps there are even 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Factual Information about the Impact of Fuzzy Logic".

When he died on 11 September 2017 at age 96, Professor Zadeh had received more than 50 engineering and academic awards, in recognition of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Cade Metz, "Lotfi Zadeh, Father of Mathematical ‘Fuzzy Logic,’ Dies at 96."

==Lattices and big data sets==
The technique of fuzzy concept lattices is increasingly used in programming for the formatting, relating and analysis of fuzzy data sets.

===Concept formalization===
According to the computer scientist Andrei Popescu at [[Middlesex University London]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Popescu, "A general approach to fuzzy concepts". ''Mathematical Logic Quarterly'' Vol. 50, No. 3, 2005, pp. 265–280.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept can be operationally defined to consist of: 
*an ''intent'', which is a description or specification stated in a language, 
*an ''extent'', which is the collection of all the objects to which the description refers, 
*a ''context'', which is stated by: (i) the universe of all possible objects, (ii) the universe of all possible attributes of objects, and (iii) the logical definition of the relation whereby an object possesses an attribute. 

Once the context is defined, we can specify relationships of sets of objects with sets of attributes which they do, or do not share.

===Fuzzy concept lattice===
Whether an object belongs to a concept, and whether an object does, or does not have an attribute, can often be a matter of degree. Thus, for example, "many attributes are fuzzy rather than crisp".&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek and Vilem Vychodil, "What is a fuzzy concept lattice?" Department of Computer Science, Palacky University, Olomouc, 2005.[http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-162/paper2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome this issue, a numerical value is assigned to each attribute along a scale, and the results are placed in a table which links each assigned object-value within the given range to a numerical value denoting a given degree of applicability.

This is the basic idea of a "fuzzy concept lattice", which can also be graphed; different fuzzy concept lattices can be connected to each other as well (for example, in "[[fuzzy clustering|fuzzy conceptual clustering]]" techniques used to group data, originally invented by [http://dblp2.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/r/Ruspini:Enrique_H= Enrique H. Ruspini]). Fuzzy concept lattices are a useful programming tool for the exploratory analysis of [[big data]], for example in cases where sets of linked behavioural responses are broadly similar, but can nevertheless vary in important ways, within certain limits. It can help to find out what the structure and dimensions are, of a behaviour that occurs with an important but limited amount of variation in a large population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compasss.org/index.htm See further the COMPASSS site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big data===
Coding with fuzzy lattices can be useful, for instance, in the [[psephological]] analysis of [[big data]] about voter behaviour, where researchers want to explore the characteristics and associations involved in "somewhat vague" opinions; gradations in voter attitudes; and variability in voter behaviour (or personal characteristics) within a set of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kreiss, ''Prototype Politics: Technology-Intensive Campaigning and the Data of Democracy''. Oxford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic programming techniques for this kind of fuzzy [[concept mapping]] and [[deep learning]] are by now well-established&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Mikael Collan, Mario Fedrizzi, [[Janusz Kacprzyk]], ''Fuzzy Technology: Present Applications and Future Challenges''. Heidelberg: Springer, 2016, p. 65f.; Daniel J. Lewis and Trevor P. Martin, "Managing Vagueness with Fuzzy in Hierarchical Big Data".

[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/google-and-facebook-could-help-decide-2017-german-election-a-1120156.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Very large quantities of data can now be explored using computers with fuzzy logic programming&lt;ref&gt;For example, Kyle C. Longest and Stephen Vaisey, "Fuzzy: A program for Performing Qualitative Comparative Analyses (QCA) in Stata." ''Stata Journal'', Vol. 8 No. 1, 2008: pp. 79–104. Gregory Viot, "Fuzzy logic in C". ''Dr Dobb's journal'', 1 February 1993.[http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/fuzzy-logic-in-c/184408940]&lt;/ref&gt; and open-source architectures such as [[Apache Hadoop]], [[Apache Spark]], and [[MongoDB]]. One author claimed in 2016 that it is now possible to obtain, link and analyze "400 data points" for each voter in a population, using [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] systems (a "data point" is a number linked to one or more categories, which represents a characteristic).&lt;ref&gt;Chris Preimesberger, "Big-Data Analytics Plays Big Role in 2016 Election Campaigns". ''eWeek'', 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[NBC News]] reported in 2016 that the Anglo-American firm [[Cambridge Analytica]] which profiled voters for [[Donald Trump]] ([[Steve Bannon]] was a board member)&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth P. Vogel, "The heiress quietly shaping Trump’s operation." ''Politico.com'', 21 November 2016.[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/rebekah-mercer-donald-trump-231693]&lt;/ref&gt; did not have 400, but 4,000 data points for each of 230 million US adults.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Brannely, "Trump Campaign Pays Millions to Overseas Big Data Firm." NBC News, 4 November 2016.[http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/trump-campaign-pays-millions-overseas-big-data-firm-n677321]&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge Analytica's own website claimed that "up to 5,000 data points" were collected for each of 220 million Americans, a data set of more than 1 trillion bits of formatted data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Cambridge Analytica]] website |url=https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216023554/https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2016-02-16 |title=Cambridge Analytica – About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' later claimed that Cambridge Analytica in fact had, according to its own company information, "up to 7,000 data points" on 240 million American voters.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Cadwalladr, "UK regulator orders Cambridge Analytica to release data on US voter". ''The Guardian'', 5 May 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/05/cambridge-analytica-uk-regulator-release-data-us-voter-david-carroll]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University]] Professor [[Latanya Sweeney]] calculated, that if a U.S. company knows just your [[date of birth]], your [[ZIP code]] and [[sex]], the company has an 87% chance to identify you by name – simply by using linked data sets from various sources.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Tanner, "Nine Things You Don't Know About The Gathering Of Your Personal Data." ''Forbes Magazine'', 4 November 2014.[https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamtanner/2014/11/04/nine-things-you-dont-know-about-the-gathering-of-your-personal-data/#3faf581675b7]&lt;/ref&gt; With 4,000–7,000 data points instead of three, a very comprehensive personal profile becomes possible for almost every voter, and many behavioural patterns can be inferred by linking together different data sets. It also becomes possible to identify and measure gradations in personal characteristics which, in aggregate, have very large effects.

===Human judgement===
Some researchers argue that this kind of big data analysis has severe limitations, and that the analytical results can only be regarded as indicative, and not as definitive.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Lohr and Natasha Singernov, "How Data Failed Us in Calling an Election." ''[[New York Times]]'', 10 November 2016 [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/the-data-said-clinton-would-win-why-you-shouldnt-have-believed-it.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by [[Kellyanne Conway]], [[Donald Trump]]’s campaign advisor and counselor, who emphasized the importance of human judgement and common sense in drawing conclusions from fuzzy data.&lt;ref&gt;"How Trump won the presidency". Interview of Gerald F. Seib with [[Kellyanne Conway]], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (WSJ CEO Council full interview video), 14 November 2016.[https://www.wsj.com/video/how-trump-won-the-presidency/969FC367-31B3-436F-8388-6C9CE7546AC7.html] See also: Jonathan Vanian, "How Bad Polling Data Fooled Everyone Except Donald Trump". ''Fortune'', 10 November 2016.[http://fortune.com/2016/11/10/donald-trump-data-analytics/]&lt;/ref&gt; Conway candidly admitted that much of her own research would "never see the light of day", because it was client confidential.&lt;ref&gt;"How Trump won the presidency".

====Propaganda machine====
In a video interview published by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in March 2018, whistleblower [[Christopher Wylie]] called [[Cambridge Analytica]] a "full-service propaganda machine" rather than a bona fide data science company. Its own site revealed with "case studies" that it has been active in political campaigns in numerous different countries, influencing attitudes and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Jina Moore, "Cambridge Analytica Had a Role in Kenya Election, Too". ''New York Times'', 20 March 2018.[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/world/africa/kenya-cambridge-analytica-election.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Wylie explained, that "we spent a million dollars harvesting tens of millions of [[Facebook]] profiles, and those profiles were used as the basis of the algorithms that became the foundation of Cambridge Analytica itself. The company itself was founded on using Facebook data".&lt;ref&gt;Carole Cadwalladr &amp; Emma Graham-Harrison, "Pressure mounts on Cambridge Analytica and Facebook over data scandal." ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 March 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/18/cambridge-analytica-and-facebook-accused-of-misleading-mps-over-data-breach]&lt;/ref&gt; 
====Audit====
On 19 March 2018, [[Facebook]] announced it had hired the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to conduct a "comprehensive audit" of Cambridge Analytica, while Facebook shares plummeted 7 percent overnight (erasing roughly $40 billion in market capitalization).&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Shieber, "Facebook hired a forensics firm to investigate [[Cambridge Analytica]] as stock falls 7%." ''TC Techcrunch.com'', 19 March 2018.[https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/facebook-hired-a-forensics-firm-to-investigate-cambridge-analytica-as-stock-falls-7/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge Analytica]] had not just used the profiles of [[Facebook]] users to compile data sets. According to [[Christopher Wylie]]'s testimony, the company also harvested the data of each user's network of friends, leveraging the original data set. It then converted, combined and migrated its results into ''new'' data sets, which can in principle survive in some format, even if the original data sources are destroyed. It created and applied algorithms using data to which - critics argue - it could not have been entitled. This was denied by [[Cambridge Analytica]], which stated on its website that it legitimately "uses data to change audience behavior" among customers and voters (who ''choose'' to view and provide information). If advertisers can do that, why not a data company? Where should the line be drawn? Legally, it remained a "fuzzy" area.
====Legal issue====
The tricky legal issue then became, what kind of data [[Cambridge Analytica]] (or any similar company) is actually allowed to have and keep.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Phade, "Who Should Profit From Selling Your Personal Data?". ''Futures Platform'', 27 March 2018.[https://www.futuresplatform.com/blog/your-data-and-profit-data-scraping]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]] itself became the subject of another [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] inquiry, to establish whether Facebook violated the terms of a 2011 consent decree governing its handing of user data (data which was allegedly transferred to Cambridge Analytica without Facebook's and user's knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;David McLaughlin, Ben Brody, and Billy House, "FTC Probing Facebook for Use of Personal Data, Source Says." ''Bloomberg'', 20 March 2018; Tony Romm and Craig Timberg, "FTC opens investigation into Facebook after Cambridge Analytica scrapes millions of users’ personal information." ''Washington Post'', 20 March 2018.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/20/ftc-opens-investigation-into-facebook-after-cambridge-analytica-scrapes-millions-of-users-personal-information/]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' journalist Jessi Hempel commented in a CBNC panel discussion that "Now there is this fuzziness from the top of the company [i.e. Facebook] that I have never seen in the fifteen years that I have covered it."&lt;ref&gt;Sara Salinas, "Facebook hires firm to conduct a 'comprehensive audit' of Cambridge Analytica". ''CNBC news'', 19 March 2018 and squawkbox panel video [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/facebook-to-conduct-a-comprehensive-audit-of-cambridge-analytica.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data privacy====
Interrogating Facebook's CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] before the U.S. [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]] in April 2018, New Mexico Congressman Rep. [[Ben Ray Luján]] put it to him that the Facebook corporation might well have "29,000 data points" on each Facebook user. Zuckerberg claimed that he "did not really know". Lujan's figure was based on [[ProPublica]] research, which in fact suggested that Facebook may even have 52,000 data points for many Facebook users.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Carbone, "Facebook might have 29,000 data points on you, but Mark Zuckerberg doesn't really know." ''Fox News'', 11 April 2018.[http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/04/11/facebook-might-have-29000-data-points-on-but-mark-zuckerberg-doesnt-really-know.html] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA1S5A4Yuxc] Julia Angwin, Surya Mattu and Terry Parris Jr., "Facebook Doesn’t Tell Users Everything It Really Knows About Them." ''ProPublica'', 27 December 2016.[https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-doesnt-tell-users-everything-it-really-knows-about-them]&lt;/ref&gt; When Zuckerberg replied to his critics, he stated that because the revolutionary technology of Facebook (with 2.2 billion users worldwide) had ventured into previously unknown territory, it was unavoidable that mistakes would be made, despite the best of intentions. He justified himself saying that:

{{Quotation|"For the first ten or twelve years of the company, I viewed our responsibility primarily as building tools, that if we could put those tools in people's hands, then that would empower people to do good things. What we have learnt now... is that we need to take a more proactive role and a broader view of our responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerberg's Senate hearings highlights video, 10 April 2018.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgI_KAkSyCw]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 2018, [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] barred access from [[Crimson Hexagon]], a company that advises corporations and governments using one trillion scraped social media posts, which it mined and processed with artificial intelligence and image analysis.&lt;ref&gt; Olivia Solon and Julia Carrie Wong, "Facebook suspends another analytics firm amid questions over surveillance." ''The Guardian'', 20 July 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/20/facebook-crimson-hexagon-analytics-data-surveillance]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrity====
It remained "fuzzy" what was more important to Zuckerberg: making money from user's information, or real corporate integrity in the use of personal information. Zuckerberg implied, that he believed that, on balance, Facebook had done ''more good than harm'', and that, if he had believed that wasn't the case, he would never have persevered with the business. Thus, "the good" was itself a fuzzy concept, because it was a matter of degree ("more good than bad"). He had to sell stuff, to keep the business growing. If people did not like Facebook, then they simply should not join it, or opt out, they have the choice.

After the ''[[New York Times]]'' broke the news on 17 March 2018, that copies of the Facebook data set scraped by Cambridge Analytica could still be downloaded from the Internet, Facebook was severely criticized by government representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Rosenberg, Nicholas Confessore and Carole Cadwalladr, "How [[Donald Trump|Trump]] Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions". ''[[New York Times]]'', 17 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned, Zuckerberg admitted that "In general we collect data on people who are not signed up for Facebook for security purposes" with the aim "to help prevent malicious actors from collecting public information from Facebook users, such as names". &lt;ref&gt;Sarah Frier and Todd Shields, "Zuckerberg Says Facebook Collects Internet Data on Non-Users", ''Bloomberg'', 11 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2018, it was reported that the [[Cambridge Analytica]] company was shutting down and was starting bankruptcy proceedings, after losing clients and facing escalating legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Ballhaus and Jenny Gross, "Cambridge Analytica Closing Operations Following Facebook Data Controversy". ''Wall Street Journal'', 2 May 2018; Munsif Vengattil, "Cambridge Analytica and parent SCL Elections shutting down." ''Reuters'', 2 May 2018.[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-faceboook-privacy/cambridge-analytica-and-parent-scl-elections-shutting-down-idUSKBN1I32L7]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[reputational risk|reputational damage]] which the company had suffered or caused, had become too great.

===Speed===
A traditional objection to big data is, that it cannot cope with rapid change: events move faster that the statistics can keep up with. Yet the technology now exists for corporations like [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] to pump cloud-based data streams from app-users straight into big data analytics programmes, in real time.&lt;ref&gt;Tableau.com, ''Big data: the top 8 trends for 2016''.&lt;/ref&gt; Provided that the right kinds of analytical concepts are used, it is now technically possible to draw definite and important conclusions about gradations of human and natural behaviour using very large fuzzy data sets – and increasingly it can be done very fast. Obviously this achievement has become highly topical in military technology, but military uses can also have spin-offs for medical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Hagan, "From military to medical and commercial applications of neural networks and fuzzy logic: a modern "swords-into-plowshares" play." ''Proceedings of IEEE WESCON '93'' conference, San Francisco, 28-30 Sept. 1993. Republished in ''EEE Xplore'', 6 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
There have been many academic controversies about the meaning, relevance and utility of fuzzy concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, George J. Klir, Harold W. Lewis III, Eileen C. Way, "Concepts and fuzzy sets: Misunderstandings, misconceptions, and oversights". ''International Journal of Approximate Reasoning'', Vol. 51, July 2009), pp. 23–34.[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0888613X09001327/1-s2.0-S0888613X09001327-main.pdf?_tid=7f4bada4-37bd-11e7-9bfe-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1494667448_9f6a0acd8f43577a7af214d56512b12a] Angel Garrido &amp; Piedad Yuste, "controversies about the introduction of non-classical logics". ''Brain'', Vol. 5, No. 1-4, 2014.[http://www.edusoft.ro/brain/index.php/brain/article/view/457]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Fuzzy" label===
[[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] himself confessed that:

{{Quotation|"I knew that just by choosing the label ''fuzzy'' I was going to find myself in the midst of a controversy... If it weren't called ''fuzzy logic'', there probably wouldn't be articles on it on the front page of the ''New York Times''. So let us say it has a certain publicity value. Of course, many people don't like that publicity value, and when they see it in the ''New York Times'', it doesn't sit well with them."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

However, the impact of the invention of fuzzy reasoning went far beyond names and labels. When Zadeh gave his acceptance speech in Japan for the 1989 Honda Foundation prize, which he received for inventing fuzzy theory, he stated that "The concept of a fuzzy set has had an upsetting effect on the established order."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, p. 50. The Honda Foundation judged that Zadeh had taken an "active role in making the future of information society a more humane civilization", with a broad range of contributions in applied logic.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Do they exist===

Some philosophers and scientists have claimed that in reality "fuzzy" concepts do not exist.

====Frege====
According to ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' by the logician [[Gottlob Frege]],

{{Quotation|"A definition of a concept... must be complete; it must unambiguously determine, as regards any object, whether or not it falls under the concept... the concept must have a sharp boundary... a concept that is not sharply defined is wrongly termed a concept. Such quasi-conceptual constructions cannot be recognized as concepts by logic. The [[Law of excluded middle|law of the excluded middle]] is really just another form of the requirement that the concept should have a sharp boundary."&lt;ref&gt;P. Geach and M. Black (eds.), ''Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege'', 3rd edition. Blackwell, 1980, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Kálmán====
Similarly, [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] stated in 1972 that "there is no such thing as a fuzzy concept... We do talk about fuzzy things but they are not scientific concepts".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Is there a need for fuzzy logic?", ''Information Sciences'', No. 178, 2008, p. 2753.&lt;/ref&gt;

The suggestion is that a concept, to qualify as a concept, must always be clear ''and'' precise, without any fuzziness. A vague notion would be at best a prologue to formulating a concept.&lt;ref&gt;For the debate between Zadeh and Kálmán, see: Lotfi A. Zadeh, "The birth and evolution of fuzzy logic". ''International Journal of General Systems'', Vol. 17, No. 2-3, 1990, pp. 95-105. See also: Yücel Yüksel, "On Zadeh’s 'The Birth and Evolution of Fuzzy Logic'". In: Eyke Hüllermeier, Rudolf Kruse &amp; Frank Hoffmann (eds.), ''Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems. Applications''. Proceedings of the 13th International Conference, IPMU 2010, Dortmund, Germany, June 28–July 2, 2010 (Communications in Computer and Information Science, vol 81), Part II. Berlin: Springer, 2010,  pp 350-355. &lt;/ref&gt;

====DIN and ISO standards====
There is no general agreement among philosophers and scientists about how the notion of a "[[concept]]" (and in particular, a scientific concept), should be defined.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang G. Stock, "Concepts and Semantic Relations in Information Science". In: ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'' Vol. 61 No. 10, October 2010, pp. 1951–1969.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220433962_Concepts_and_Semantic_Relations_in_Information_Science]; Eric Margolis &amp; Stephen Laurence, "Concepts". In: ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2011.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/#ProThe]&lt;/ref&gt; A concept could be defined as a mental representation, as a cognitive capacity, as an abstract object, etc. Edward E. Smith &amp; Douglas L. Medin stated that “there will likely be no crucial experiments or analyses that will establish one view of concepts as correct and rule out all others irrevocably.”&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Smith &amp; Douglas L. Medin, ''Categories and concepts''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, scientists also quite often do use imprecise analogies in their models to help understanding an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Pawel Zeidler, ''Models and Metaphors as Research Tools in Science''. Zurich: Lit Verlag, 2013; L. Magnani, N. J. Nersessian &amp; P. Thagard (eds.), Model-based reasoning in scientific discovery. New York : Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 1999; Jonathan Lawry, ''Modelling and reasoning with vague concepts''. New York: Springer, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept can be clear enough, ''but not'' (or not sufficiently) precise.

Rather uniquely, terminology scientists at the German national standards institute (''Deutsches Institut für Normung'') provided an official standard definition of what a concept is (under the terminology standards DIN 2330 of 1957, completely revised in 1974 and last revised in 2013; and DIN 2342 of 1986, last revised in 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Go to [https://standards.globalspec.com/ Standards Library] for info.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official German definition, a concept is a unit of thought which is created through abstraction for a set of objects, and which identifies shared (or related) characteristics of those objects.

The subsequent ISO definition is very similar. Under the ISO 1087 terminology standard of the [[International Standards Organization]] (first published in October 2000, and reviewed in 2005), a concept is defined as a unit of thought or an idea constituted through abstraction on the basis of properties common to a set of objects.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [https://www.iso.org/standard/20057.html] [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:1087:-1:ed-1:v1:en] [http://wiki.julien-roche.fr/tiki-index.php?page=concept+3.2.1+version2+%28en%29&amp;structure=vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is acknowledged that although a concept usually has one definition or one meaning, it may have multiple designations, terms of expression, symbolizations or representations. Thus, for example, the same concept can have different names in different languages. Both verbs and nouns can express concepts. A concept can also be thought of as "a way of looking at the world".

===Corruption===
Reasoning with fuzzy concepts is often viewed as a kind of "logical corruption" or scientific perversion because, it is claimed, fuzzy reasoning rarely reaches a definite "yes" or a definite "no". A clear, precise and logically rigorous conceptualization is no longer a necessary prerequisite, for carrying out a procedure, a project, or an inquiry, since "somewhat vague ideas" can always be accommodated, formalized and programmed with the aid of fuzzy expressions. The purist idea is, that either a rule applies, or it does not apply. When a rule is said to apply only "to some extent", then in truth the rule does ''not'' apply. Thus, a compromise with vagueness or indefiniteness is, on this view, effectively a compromise with error - an error of conceptualization, an error in the inferential system, or an error in physically carrying out a task.
====Kahan====
The computer scientist [[William Kahan]] argued in 1975 that "the danger of fuzzy theory is that it will encourage the sort of imprecise thinking that has brought us so much trouble."&lt;ref&gt;Lotfi A. Zadeh, "The birth and evolution of fuzzy logic". ''International Journal of General Systems'', Vol. 17, No. 2-3, 1990, pp. 95-105, at p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; He said subsequently,

{{Quotation|"With traditional logic there is no guaranteed way to find that something is contradictory, but once it is found, you'd be obliged to do something. But with fuzzy sets, the existence of contradictory sets can't cause things to malfunction. Contradictory information doesn't lead to a clash. You just keep computing. (...) Life affords many instances of getting the right answer for the wrong reasons... It is in the nature of logic to confirm or deny. The fuzzy calculus blurs that. (...) Logic isn't following the rules of Aristotle blindly. It takes the kind of pain known to the runner. He knows he is doing something. When you are thinking about something hard, you'll feel a similar sort of pain. Fuzzy logic is marvellous. It insulates you from pain. It's the [[cocaine]] of science."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
According to Kahan, statements of a degree of probability are usually verifiable. There are standard tests one can do. By contrast, there is no conclusive procedure which can decide the validity of assigning particular fuzzy truth values to a data set in the first instance. It is just assumed that a model or program will work, "if" particular fuzzy values are accepted and used, perhaps based on some statistical comparisons or try-outs.

====Bad design====
In programming, a problem can usually be solved in several different ways, not just one way, but an important issue is, which solution works best in the short term, and in the long term. Kahan implies, that fuzzy solutions may create more problems in the long term, than they solve in the short term. For example, if one starts off designing a procedure, not with well thought-out, precise concepts, but rather by using fuzzy or approximate expressions which conveniently patch up (or compensate for) badly formulated ideas, the ultimate result could be a complicated, malformed mess, that does not achieve the intended goal.

Had the reasoning and conceptualization been much sharper at the start, then the design of the procedure might have been much simpler, more efficient and effective - and fuzzy expressions or approximations would not be necessary, or required much less. Thus, by ''allowing'' the use of fuzzy or approximate expressions, one might actually foreclose more rigorous thinking about design, and one might build something that ultimately does not meet expectations. 

If (say) an entity X turns out to belong for 65% to category Y, and for 35% to category Z, how should X be allocated? One could plausibly decide to allocate X to Y, making a rule that, if an entity belongs for 65% or more to Y, it is to be treated as an instance of category Y, and never as an instance of category Z. One could, however, alternatively decide to change the definitions of the categorization system, to ensure that all entities such as X fall 100% in one category only. 

This kind of argument claims, that boundary problems can be resolved (or vastly reduced) simply by using better categorization or conceptualization methods. If we treat X "as if" it belongs 100% to Y, while in truth it only belongs 65% to Y, then arguably we are really misrepresenting things. If we keep doing that with a lot of related variables, we can greatly distort the true situation, and make it look like something that it isn't.

In a "fuzzy permissive" environment, it might become far too easy, to formalize and use a concept which is itself badly defined, and which could have been defined much better. In that environment, there is always a quantitative way out, for concepts that do not quite fit, or which don't quite do the job for which they are intended. The cumulative adverse effect of the discrepancies might, in the end, be much larger than ever anticipated.

====Counter-argument====
A typical reply to Kahan's objections is, that fuzzy reasoning never "rules out" ordinary binary logic, but instead ''presupposes'' ordinary true-or-false logic. [[Lotfi Zadeh]] stated that "fuzzy logic is not fuzzy. In large measure, fuzzy logic is precise."&lt;ref&gt;A. Dumitras, &amp; G. Moschytz, "Understanding Fuzzy Logic: An Interview with Lotfi Zadeh". ''IEEE signal processing magazine'', May 2007, pp. 102-105, at p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a precise logic of imprecision. Fuzzy logic is not a replacement of, or substitute for ordinary logic, but an enhancement of it, with many practical uses. Fuzzy thinking does oblige action, but primarily in response to a change in quantitative gradation, not in response to a contradiction.

One could say, for example, that ultimately one is ''either'' "alive" ''or'' "dead", which is perfectly true. Meantime though one is "living", which is also a significant truth - yet "living" is a fuzzy concept. It is true that fuzzy logic by itself usually cannot eliminate inadequate conceptualization or bad design. Yet it can at least make explicit, what exactly the variations are in the applicability of a concept which has unsharp boundaries.

If one always had perfectly crisp concepts available, perhaps no fuzzy expressions would be necessary. In reality though, one often does not have all the crisp concepts to start off with. One might not have them yet for a long time, or ever - or, several successive "fuzzy" approximations might be needed, to get there. 

At a deeper level, a "fuzzy permissive" environment may be desirable, precisely because it permits things to be actioned, that would never have been achieved, if there had been crystal clarity about all the consequences from the start, or if people insisted on absolute precision prior to doing anything. Scientists often try things out on the basis of "hunches", and processes like [[serendipity]] can play a role. 

Learning something new, or trying to create something new, is rarely a completely formal-logical or linear process, there are not only "knowns" and "unknowns" involved, but also "''partly'' known" phenomena, i.e. things which are known or unknown "to some degree". Even if, ideally, we would prefer to eliminate fuzzy ideas, we might need them initially to get there, further down the track. Any method of reasoning is a tool. If its application has bad results, it is not the tool itself that is to blame, but its inappropriate use. It would be better to educate people in the best ''use'' of the tool, if necessary with appropriate authorization, than to ''ban'' the tool pre-emptively, on the ground that it "could" or "might" be abused. Exceptions to this rule would include things like computer viruses and illegal weapons that can only cause great harm if they are used. There is no evidence though that fuzzy concepts as a species are intrinsically harmful, even if some bad concepts can cause harm if used in inappropriate contexts.

===Reducibility===

[[Susan Haack]] once claimed that a many-valued logic requires neither intermediate terms between true and false, nor a rejection of bivalence.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Haack, Philosophy of Logics. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Her suggestion was, that the intermediate terms (i.e. the gradations of truth) can always be restated as conditional if-then statements, and by implication, that fuzzy logic is fully reducible to binary true-or-false logic. 

This interpretation is disputed, but even if it was correct, assigning a number to the applicability of a statement is often enormously more efficient than a long string of if-then statements that would have the same intended meaning. That point is obviously of great importance to computer programmers, educators and administrators seeking to code a process, activity, message or operation as simply as possible, according to logically consistent rules.

===Quantification===
It may be wonderful to have access to an unlimited number of distinctions to define what one means, but not all scholars would agree that any concept is equal to, or reducible to, a mathematical [[Set theory|set]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Epstein, "Memory and concepts in reactive learning". ''Proceedings of the Canadian Workshop on Machine Learning 1992''[http://www.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/~epstein/papers/CSCSI92.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Some phenomena are difficult or impossible to quantify and count, in particular if they lack discrete boundaries (for example, clouds).

====Formalization====
Qualities may not be fully reducible to quantities&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Mumford, "Quantities and Qualities", University of Nottingham blog post, September 30, 2012.[https://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/artsmatters/2012/09/30/quantities-and-qualities/]&lt;/ref&gt; – if there are no qualities, it may become impossible to say what the numbers are numbers of, or what they refer to, except that they refer to other numbers or numerical expressions such as algebraic equations. A measure requires a counting unit defined by a category, but the definition of that category is essentially qualitative; a language which is used to communicate data is difficult to operate, without any qualitative distinctions and categories. We may, for example, transmit a text in binary code, but the binary code does not tell us directly what the text intends.

In creating a [[formal system|formalization]] or [[formal specification]] of a concept, for example for the purpose of measurement, administrative procedure or programming, part of the meaning of the concept may be changed or lost.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Wachter, "How Measurement Fails Doctors and Teachers". ''New York Times'', 16 January 2016.[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/opinion/sunday/how-measurement-fails-doctors-and-teachers.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if we deliberately program an event according to a concept, it might kill off the spontaneity, spirit, authenticity and motivational pattern which is ordinarily associated with that type of event.

[[Quantification (science)|Quantification]] is not an unproblematic process.&lt;ref&gt;“A well-known quotation usually attributed to Einstein is “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.” I’d amend it to a less eloquent, more prosaic statement: unless we know how things are counted, we don’t know if it’s wise to count on the numbers. The problem isn’t with statistical tests themselves but with what we do before and after we run them. First, we count if we can, but counting depends a great deal on previous assumptions about categorization. (...) Second, after we’ve gathered some numbers relating to a phenomenon, we must reasonably aggregate them into some sort of recommendation or ranking. This is not easy. By appropriate choices of criteria, measurement protocols and weights, almost any desired outcome can be reached." - John Allen Paulos, "Metric Mania", in ''New York Times'', 10 May 2010.[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/magazine/16FOB-WWLN-t.html] Whether Einstein really did originate the quotation which Paulos mentions, is in dispute. The quote is also credited to William Bruce Cameron, ''Informal Sociology, a casual introduction to sociological thinking''. New York: Random House, 1963, p. 13.[http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/26/everything-counts-einstein/]&lt;/ref&gt; To quantify a phenomenon, we may have to introduce special assumptions and definitions which disregard part of the phenomenon in its totality.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measurement====
Programmers, statisticians or logicians are concerned in their work with the main operational or technical significance of a concept which is specifiable in objective, quantifiable terms. They are not primarily concerned with all kinds of imaginative frameworks associated with the concept, or with those aspects of the concept which seem to have no particular functional purpose – however entertaining they might be. However, some of the qualitative characteristics of the concept may not be quantifiable or measurable at all, at least not directly. The temptation exists to ignore them, or try to infer them from data results.

If, for example, we want to count the number of trees in a forest area with any precision, we have to define what counts as one tree, and perhaps distinguish them from saplings, split trees, dead trees, fallen trees etc. Soon enough it becomes apparent that the quantification of trees involves a degree of abstraction – we decide to disregard some timber, dead or alive, from the population of trees, in order to count those trees that conform to our chosen concept of a tree. We operate in fact with an abstract concept of what a tree is, which diverges to some extent from the true diversity of trees there are. 

Even so, there may be some trees, of which it is not very clear, whether they should be counted as a tree, or not; a certain amount of "fuzziness" in the concept of a tree may therefore remain. The implication is, that the seemingly "exact" number offered for the total quantity of trees in the forest may be much less exact than one might think - it is probably more an estimate or indication of magnitude, rather than an exact description.&lt;ref&gt;What statisticians then often try to do, is to create a model which can predict the magnitude of the difference between the true (accurate and exact) number and the computed number obtained, in this case the true number of trees. Such a model however still relies on imperfect or fallible definitions. Even if fuzzy values are used instead, it is likely that a definite and exact number can never be reached. At most one can say that the number is correct, if the definitions are accepted.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet - and this is the point - the imprecise measure can be very useful and sufficient for all intended purposes.

It is tempting to think, that if something can be measured, it must exist, and that if we cannot measure it, it does not exist. Neither might be true. Researchers try to measure such things as intelligence or gross domestic product, without much scientific agreement about what these things actually are, how they exist, and what the correct measures might be.

When one wants to count and quantify distinct objects using numbers, one needs to be able to distinguish between those separate objects, but if this is difficult or impossible, then, although this may not invalidate a quantitative procedure as such, quantification is not really possible in practice; at best, we may be able to assume or infer indirectly a certain distribution of quantities that must be there. In this sense, scientists often use [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy variables]] to substitute as measures for variables which are known (or thought) to be there, but which themselves cannot be observed or measured directly.

===Vague or fuzzy===
The exact relationship between vagueness and fuzziness is disputed.

====Philosophy====
Philosophers often regard fuzziness as a particular kind of vagueness,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Haack, ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic - beyond the formalism.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and consider that "no specific assignment of semantic values to vague predicates, not even a fuzzy one, can fully satisfy our conception of what the extensions of vague predicates are like".&lt;ref&gt;Matti Eklund, "Vagueness and Second-Level Indeterminacy", in: Richard Dietz &amp; Sebastiano Moruzzi (eds.), ''Cuts and clouds. Vagueness, Its Nature, and Its Logic.'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying recent literature on how to characterize vagueness, Matti Eklund states that appeal to lack of sharp boundaries, borderline cases and “sorites-susceptible" predicates are the three informal characterizations of vagueness which are most common in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Eklund, "Characterizing Vagueness". ''Philosophy Compass'', 2, 2007, pp. 896-909.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zadeh's argument====
However, [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] claimed that "vagueness connotes insufficient [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]], whereas fuzziness connotes unsharpness of [[Class (set theory)|class boundaries]]". Thus, he argued, a sentence like "I will be back in a few minutes" is fuzzy ''but not'' vague, whereas a sentence such as "I will be back sometime", is fuzzy ''and'' vague. His suggestion was that fuzziness and vagueness are logically quite different qualities, rather than fuzziness being a type or subcategory of vagueness. Zadeh claimed that "inappropriate use of the term 'vague' is still a common practice in the literature of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "What is fuzzy logic?". ''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===

In the scholarly inquiry about [[ethics]] and [[meta-ethics]], vague or fuzzy concepts and borderline cases are standard topics of controversy. Central to ethics are theories of "value", what is "good" or "bad" for people and why that is, and the idea of "rule following" as a condition for moral integrity, consistency and non-arbitrary behaviour. 

Yet, if human valuations or moral rules are only vague or fuzzy, then they may not be able to orient or guide behaviour. It may become impossible to operationalize rules. Evaluations may not permit definite moral judgements, in that case. Hence, clarifying fuzzy moral notions is usually considered to be critical for the ethical endeavour as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dougherty, "Vague value", in: ''Philosophy and phenomenological research'', Vol. 89, No. 2, September 2014, pp. 352–372 [https://philpapers.org/archive/DOUVV.pdf]; Tom Dougherty, "Vagueness and Indeterminacy in Ethics". In: Tristram McPherson &amp; David Plunkett, ''The Routledge Handbook of Metaethics''. Oxford: Routledge, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excessive precision====
Nevertheless, [[Scott Soames]] has made the case that vagueness or fuzziness can be ''valuable'' to rule-makers, because "their use of it is valuable to the people to whom rules are addressed".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be more practical and effective to allow for some leeway (and personal responsibility) in the interpretation of how a rule should be applied - bearing in mind the overall purpose which the rule intends to achieve. 

If a rule or procedure is stipulated too exactly, it can sometimes have a result which is contrary to the aim which it was intended to help achieve. For example, "The [[Children and Young Persons Act 2008|Children and Young Persons Act]] could have specified a precise age below which a child may not be left unsupervised. But doing so would have incurred quite substantial forms of arbitrariness (for various reasons, and particularly because of the different capacities of children of the same age)".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rule conflict====
A related sort of problem is, that if the application of a legal concept is pursued too exactly and rigorously, it may have consequences that cause a serious conflict with ''another'' legal concept. This is not necessarily a matter of bad law-making. When a law is made, it may not be possible to anticipate all the cases and events to which it will apply later (even if 95% of possible cases are predictable). The longer a law is in force, the more likely it is, that people will run into problems with it, that were not foreseen when the law was made. 

So, the further implications of one rule may conflict with another rule. "Common sense" might not be able to resolve things. In that scenario, too much precision can get in the way of justice. Very likely a special court ruling wil have to set a norm. The general problem for jurists is, whether "the arbitrariness resulting from precision is worse than the arbitrariness resulting from the application of a vague standard".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===
The definitional disputes about fuzziness remain unresolved so far, mainly because, as anthropologists and psychologists have documented, different languages (or symbol systems) that have been created by people to signal meanings suggest different [[ontology|ontologies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Korzybski]], ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics'' (5th ed.). Forest Hills, N.Y.: Institute of General Semantics, 1995. [[Gregory Bateson]], ''Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology''. Chicago: University Of Chicago Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply: it is not merely that describing "what is there" involves symbolic representations of some kind. How distinctions are drawn, influences perceptions of "what is there", and vice versa, perceptions of "what is there" influence how distinctions are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Vassos Argyrou, "Anthropology of Magic". In: James D. Wright (ed.), ''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioural Sciences''. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2015, 2nd edition, Vol. 14, p. 438. Dominic Hyde, ''Vagueness, Logic and Ontology''. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing Ltd, 2008. See also [[object-oriented ontology]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important reason why, as [[Alfred Korzybski]] noted, people frequently confuse the symbolic representation of reality, conveyed by languages and signs, with reality itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Korzybski]], ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics'' (5th ed.). Forest Hills, N.Y.: Institute of General Semantics, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuzziness implies, that there exists a potentially ''infinite'' number of truth values between complete truth and complete falsehood. If that is the case, it creates the foundational issue of what, in the case, can justify or prove the existence of the categorical absolutes which are assumed by logical or quantitative inference. If there is an infinite number of shades of grey, how do we know what is totally black and white, and how could we identify that?
====Tegmark====
To illustrate the ontological issues, cosmologist [[Max Tegmark]] argues boldly that the universe consists of math: "If you accept the idea that both space itself, and all the stuff in space, have no properties at all except mathematical properties," then the idea that everything is mathematical "starts to sound a little bit less insane."&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Lewis, "What's the Universe Made Of? Math, Says Scientist." ''Live Science'', 30 January 2014.[http://www.livescience.com/42839-the-universe-is-math.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tegmark moves from the ''[[Epistemology|epistemic]]'' claim that mathematics is the only known symbol system which can in principle express absolutely everything, to the ''[[Methodology|methodological]]'' claim that everything is reducible to mathematical relationships, and then to the ''[[Ontology|ontological]]'' claim, that ultimately everything that exists is mathematical (the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]]). The argument is then reversed, so that ''because'' everything is mathematical in reality, mathematics is ''necessarily'' the ultimate universal symbol system.

The main criticisms of Tegmark's approach are that (1) the steps in this argument do not necessarily follow, (2) no conclusive proof or test is possible for the claim that such an exhaustive mathematical expression or reduction is feasible, and (3) it may be that a complete reduction to mathematics cannot be accomplished, without at least partly altering, negating or deleting a non-mathematical significance of phenomena, experienced perhaps as [[qualia]].&lt;ref&gt;See also Raphael van Riel &amp; Robert Van Gulick, "Scientific reduction". In: ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2014.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-reduction/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zalta====
In his [[meta-mathematics|meta-mathematical]] [[metaphysics]], [[Edward N. Zalta]] has claimed that for every set of properties of a concrete object, there ''always'' exists ''exactly'' one abstract object that encodes ''exactly'' that set of properties and no others - a foundational assumption or [[axiom]] for his [[ontology]] of abstract objects&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward N. Zalta]], ''Abstract Objects. An introduction to axiomatic metaphysics''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; By implication, for every fuzzy object there exists always at least one [[defuzzification|defuzzified]] concept which encodes it exactly. It is a modern interpretation of [[Plato]]'s [[Platonic epistemology|metaphysics of knowledge]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman Gulley, ''Plato's theory of knowledge''[1962]. Milton Park: Routledge, 2013, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; which expresses confidence in the ability of science to conceptualize the world exactly.

====Platonism====
The Platonic-style interpretation was critiqued by [[Hartry H. Field]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hartry H. Field]], ''Science without numbers. A defense of nominalism.'' Second edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Balaguer argues that we do not really know whether mind-independent abstract objects exist or not; so far, we cannot prove whether [[Platonic realism]] is definitely true or false.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Balaguer, ''Platonism and Anti-Platonism in Mathematics''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Defending a cognitive realism, [[Scott Soames]] argues that the reason why this unsolvable conundrum has persisted, is because the ultimate constitution of the meaning of concepts and propositions was misconceived.

Traditionally, it was thought that concepts can be truly representational, because ultimately they are related to intrinsically representational Platonic complexes of [[Problem of universals|universals]] and [[particular]]s. However, once concepts and propositions are regarded as cognitive-event types, it is possible to claim that they are able to be representational, because they are constitutively related to intrinsically representational cognitive acts in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike the platonic epistemology required by the classic Frege-Russell account... the epistemology of naturalized propositions sees acquaintance with, and knowledge of, propositions as rooted in acquaintance with, and knowledge of, acts and events that make up one's cognitive life" - Scott Soames, ''What is meaning?''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2010, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; As another philosopher put it, 
{{Quotation|"The question of how we can know the world around us is not entirely unlike the question of how it is that the food our environment provides happens to agree with our stomachs. Either can become a mystery if we forget that minds, like stomachs, originated in and have been conditioned by a pre-existent natural order."&lt;ref&gt;William Ashley, ''Marxism and moral concepts''. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964, pp. 4-5. Similarly, [[Paul Lafargue]] had written in his essay "The Origin of Abstract Ideas" (1900) that "The brain has the property of thinking as the stomach has that of digesting. It cannot think but by the aid of ideas, which it fabricates with the materials furnished it by the natural environment and the social or artificial environment in which man evolves." [https://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1898/xx/abstract.htm]
&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Along these lines, it could be argued that reality, and the human cognition of reality, will inevitably contain some fuzzy characteristics, which can be represented only by concepts which are themselves fuzzy to some or other extent.

==Social science and the media==
The idea of fuzzy concepts has also been applied in the philosophical, sociological and linguistic analysis of human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;John Coates, ''The claims of common sense; Moore, Wittgenstein, Keynes and the social sciences''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology and linguistics===
In a 1973 paper, [[George Lakoff]] analyzed hedges in the interpretation of the meaning of categories.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Lakoff]], "Hedges: A Study in Meaning Criteria and the Logic of Fuzzy Concepts." ''Journal of Philosophical Logic'', Vol. 2, 1973, pp. 458–508.[http://georgelakoff.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/hedges-a-study-in-meaning-criteria-and-the-logic-of-fuzzy-concepts-journal-of-philosophical-logic-2-lakoff-19731.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Ragin]] and others have applied the idea to sociological analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Ragin]], ''Redesigning Social Inquiry: Fuzzy Sets and Beyond''. University of Chicago Press, 2008. Shaomin Li, "Measuring the fuzziness of human thoughts: An application of fuzzy sets to sociological research". ''The Journal of Mathematical Sociology'', Volume 14, Issue 1, 1989, pp. 67–84; Mario Quaranta, "Fuzzy set theory and concepts: a proposal for concept formation and operationalization". ''Comparative Sociology'' Vol. 12, issue 6, 2013, pp. 785-820.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis ("fsQCA") has been used by German researchers to study problems posed by ethnic diversity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Stoiber, Frederik Caselitz, Marie Sophie Heinelt, “How to deal with socio-ethnic conflicts in Latin America?

Applications and Methodological Challenges”, November 22–23, 2013, Goethe University Frankfurt.[https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/conpar/download/stoibercaselitzheinelt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], [[Taiwan]], [[Iran]], [[Malaysia]], the [[European Union]] and [[Croatia]], economists have used fuzzy concepts to model and measure the underground economy of their country.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Draeseke &amp; David E.A. Giles, "A fuzzy logic approach to modelling the New Zealand underground economy." ''Mathematics and Computers in Simulation'', Vol. 59, No. 1, 2002, pp. 115–123.

Mohammad Hossien Pourkazemi, Mohammad Naser Sherafat and Zahra Delfan Azari , "Modeling Iran`s Underground Economy: A Fuzzy Logic Approach". In: ''Iranian Economic Review'', Volume 19, Issue 1, Winter 2015, Page 91-106; Kristina Marsic &amp; Dijana Oreski, "Estimation and Comparison of Underground Economy in Croatia and European Union Countries: Fuzzy Logic Approach". In: ''Journal of Information and organizational Sciences'', Vol. 49, No. 1, 2016, pp.83-104.&lt;/ref&gt; Kofi Kissi Dompere applied methods of fuzzy decision, approximate reasoning, negotiation games and fuzzy mathematics to analyze the role of money, information and resources in a "political economy of rent-seeking", viewed as a game played between powerful corporations and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Kissi Dompere, ''Fuzziness, democracy, control and collective decision choice system: a theory on political economy of rent-seeking and profit-harvesting''. Heidelberg: Springer, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A concept may be deliberately created by sociologists as an [[ideal type]] to understand something imaginatively, without any strong claim that it is a "true and complete description" or a "true and complete reflection" of whatever is being conceptualized.&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Shils &amp; Henry A. Finch (eds.), ''Max Weber on the methodology of the social sciences''. Glencoe, Ill.: The Free Press, 1949, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a more general sociological or journalistic sense, a "fuzzy concept" has come to mean a concept which is meaningful but inexact, implying that it does not exhaustively or completely define the meaning of the phenomenon to which it refers – often because it is too abstract. In this context, it is said that fuzzy concepts "lack clarity and are difficult to test or operationalize".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Markusen, "Fuzzy Concepts, Scanty Evidence, Policy Distance: The Case for Rigour and Policy Relevance in Critical Regional Studies." In: ''Regional Studies'', Volume 37, Issue 6-7, 2003, pp. 701–717.&lt;/ref&gt; To specify the relevant meaning more precisely, additional distinctions, conditions and/or qualifiers would be required.

A few examples can illustrate this kind of usage:
*a handbook of sociology states that "The theory of interaction rituals contains some gaps that need to be filled and some fuzzy concepts that need to be differentiated."&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Rössel and [[Randall Collins]], "Conflict theory and interaction rituals. The microfoundations of conflict theory." In: [[Jonathan H. Turner]] (ed.), ''Handbook of Sociological Theory''. New York: Springer, 2001, p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is, that if finer distinctions are introduced, then the fuzziness or vagueness would be eliminated. 
*a book on youth culture describes [[ethnicity]] as "a fuzzy concept that overlaps at times with concepts of race, minority, nationality and tribe".&lt;ref&gt;Carol Jenkins, "Ethnicity, culture, drugs and sex". In: Peter Aggleton, Andrew Ball and Purnima Mane (eds.), "Sex, Drugs and Young People: International Perspectives." London: Routledge, 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, part of the fuzziness consists in the inability to distinguish precisely between a concept and a different, but closely related concept.
*a book on sociological theory argues that the [[Critical Theory]] of domination faces the problem that "reality itself has become a rather meaningless, fuzzy concept."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Chaplin, ''Sociology and visual representation''. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion here is, that the variations in how theoretical concepts are applied have become so large, that the concepts could mean all kinds of things, and therefore are crucially vague (with the implication, that they are not useful any longer for that very reason).
*A history book states: "[[Sodomy]] was a vague and fuzzy concept in [[medieval]] and [[early modern Europe]], and was often associated with a variety of supposedly related moral and criminal offenses, including [[heresy]], [[witchcraft]], [[sedition]], and [[treason]]. St [[Thomas Acquinas]]... categorized sodomy with an assortment of sexual behaviours "from which generation [i.e. procreation] cannot follow".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lynch (ed.), ''Christopher Marlowe: Edward II, with related texts''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2015, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, because a concept is defined by what it excludes, it remains somewhat vague what items of activity it would specifically ''include''.

===Mass media===
The main reason why the term "fuzzy concept" is now often used in describing human behaviour, is that human interaction has many characteristics which are difficult to quantify and measure precisely (although we know that they have magnitudes and proportions), among other things because they are interactive and reflexive (the observers and the observed mutually influence the meaning of events).&lt;ref&gt;[[Loïc Wacquant]], "The fuzzy logic of practical sense." in: [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Loïc Wacquant]], ''An invitation to reflexive sociology''. London: Polity Press, 1992, chapter I section 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Those human characteristics can be usefully expressed only in an ''approximate'' way (see [[reflexivity (social theory)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ph. Manning "Fuzzy Description: Discovery and Invention in Sociology". In: ''History of the Human Sciences'', Vol. 7, No. 1, 1994, pp. 117–23.[http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049&amp;context=clsoc_crim_facpub]&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper stories frequently contain fuzzy concepts, which are readily understood and used, even although they are far from exact. Thus, many of the meanings which people ordinarily use to negotiate their way through life in reality turn out to be "fuzzy concepts". While people often do need to be exact about some things (e.g. money or time), many areas of their lives involve expressions which are far from exact.

Sometimes the term is also used in a [[pejorative]] sense. For example, a [[New York Times]] journalist wrote that [[Prince Sihanouk]] "seems unable to differentiate between friends and enemies, a disturbing trait since it suggests that he stands for nothing beyond the fuzzy concept of peace and prosperity in Cambodia".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Shenon, "Their prince is back: Cambodians are baffled." ''New York Times'', 6 June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied social science===
The use of fuzzy logic in the social sciences and humanities has remained limited until recently. [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] said in a 1994 interview that:

{{Quotation|"I expected people in the social sciences – economics, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, politics, sociology, religion and numerous other areas to pick up on it. It's been somewhat of a mystery to me why even to this day, so few social scientists have discovered how useful it could be."&lt;ref&gt;Betty Blair, "Interview with Lotfi Zadeh, Creator of Fuzzy Logic". ''Azerbaijan International'', Winter 1994, pp. 46–47.[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_fuzzylogic.html]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Two decades later, after a digital [[information explosion]] due to the growing use of the internet and mobile phones worldwide,  fuzzy concepts and fuzzy logic are being widely applied in [[big data]] analysis of social, commercial and psychological phenomena. Many [[sociometry|sociometric]] and [[psychometrics|psychometric]] indicators are based partly on fuzzy concepts and fuzzy variables.

[[Jaakko Hintikka]] once claimed that "the logic of natural language we are in effect already using can serve as a "fuzzy logic" better than its trade name variant without any additional assumptions or constructions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan van Benthem (logician)|Johan van Benthem]] et al. (eds.), ''The age of alternative logics. Assessing philosophy of logic and mathematics today''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2006, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; That might help to explain why fuzzy logic has not been used much to formalize concepts in the "soft" social sciences. 

[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] rejected such an interpretation, on the ground that in many human endeavours as well as technologies it is highly important to define more exactly "to what extent" something is applicable or true, when it is known that its applicability can vary to some important extent among large populations. Reasoning which accepts and uses fuzzy concepts can be shown to be perfectly valid with the aid of fuzzy logic, because the degrees of applicability of a concept can be more precisely and efficiently defined with the aid of numerical notation.

Another possible explanation for the traditional lack of use of fuzzy logic by social scientists is simply that, beyond basic statistical analysis (using programs such as [[SPSS]] and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]) the mathematical knowledge of social scientists is often rather limited; they may not know how to formalize and code a fuzzy concept using the conventions of fuzzy logic. The standard software packages used provide only a limited capacity to analyze fuzzy data sets, if at all, and considerable skills are required. 

Yet Jaakko Hintikka may be correct, in the sense that it can be much more efficient to use natural language to denote a complex idea, than to formalize it in logical terms. The quest for formalization might introduce much more complexity, which is not wanted, and which detracts from communicating the relevant issue. Some concepts used in social science may be impossible to formalize exactly, even though they are quite useful and people understand their appropriate application quite well.

==Uncertainty==

Fuzzy concepts can generate [[uncertainty]] because they are imprecise (especially if they refer to a process in motion, or a process of transformation where something is "in the process of turning into something else"). In that case, they do not provide a clear orientation for action or decision-making ("what does X really mean, intend or imply?"); reducing fuzziness, perhaps by applying fuzzy logic,&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Kissi Dompere, ''Fuzziness and approximate reasoning; epistemics on uncertainty, expectation and risk in rational behaviour''. Berlin: Springer, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; might generate more certainty.

===Relevance===
However, this is not necessarily always so.&lt;ref&gt;Masao Mukaidono, ''Fuzzy logic for beginners''. Singapore: World Scientific Publishing, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept, even although it is not fuzzy at all, and even though it is very exact, could equally well fail to capture the meaning of something adequately. That is, a concept can be very precise and exact, but not – or insufficiently – ''applicable'' or ''relevant'' in the situation to which it refers. In this sense, a definition can be "very precise", but "miss the point" altogether.

===Security===
A fuzzy concept may indeed provide ''more'' security, because it provides a meaning for something when an exact concept is unavailable – which is better than not being able to denote it at all. A concept such as [[God]], although not easily definable, for instance can provide security to the believer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Armstrong]], ''The Case for God''. New York: Anchor, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observer effect===
In physics, the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] and [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bohm]], ''Wholeness and the implicate order.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul ARK paperback edition, 1983, p. 86f.&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that there is a physical limit to the amount of precision that is knowable, with regard to the movements of subatomic particles and waves. That is, features of physical reality exist, where we can know that they vary in magnitude, but of which we can never know or predict exactly how big or small the variations are. This insight suggests that, in some areas of our experience of the physical world, fuzziness is inevitable and can never be totally removed. Since the [[Universe|physical universe]] itself is incredibly large and diverse, it is not easy to imagine it, grasp it or describe it without using fuzzy concepts.

==Language==
Ordinary language, which uses symbolic conventions and associations which are often not logical, inherently contains many fuzzy concepts – "knowing what you mean" in this case depends partly on knowing the context (or being familiar with the way in which a term is normally used, or what it is associated with). 

This can be easily verified for instance by consulting a [[dictionary]], a [[thesaurus]] or an [[encyclopedia]] which show the multiple meanings of words, or by observing the behaviours involved in ordinary relationships which rely on mutually understood meanings (see also [[Imprecise language]]). [[Bertrand Russell]] regarded ordinary language (in contrast to logic) as intrinsically vague.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell. "Vagueness". In: ''Australasian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy'', Vol. 1, pp. 84–92, 1923. Reprinted in: ''Bertrand Russell Papers'', Vol. 9, pp. 147–54. Nadine Faulkner, "Russell and vagueness." ''Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies'', Summer 2003, pp. 43–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicature===
To communicate, receive or convey a [[message]], an individual somehow has to bridge his own intended meaning and the meanings which are understood by others, i.e., the message has to be conveyed in a way that it will be socially understood, preferably in the intended manner. Thus, people might state: "you have to say it in a way that I understand". Even if the message is clear and precise, it may nevertheless not be received in the way it was intended.

Bridging meanings may be done instinctively, habitually or unconsciously, but it usually involves a choice of terms, assumptions or [[symbols]] whose meanings are not completely fixed, but which depend among other things on how the receivers of the message respond to it, or the [[context (language use)|context]]. In this sense, meaning is often "negotiated" or "interactive" (or, more cynically, manipulated). This gives rise to many fuzzy concepts.

The semantic challenge of conveying meanings to an audience was explored in detail, and analyzed logically, by the British philosopher [[Paul Grice]] - using, among other things, the concept of [[implicature]].&lt;ref&gt;A critique of Grice is provided by Wayne A. Davis, ''Implicature: intention, convention, and principle in the failure of Gricean theory.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. An example of a specific application of Gricean theory is: Penelope Brown &amp; Stephen C. Levinson, ''Politeness: some universals in language use''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Implicature refers to what is ''suggested'' by a message to the recipient, without being either explicitly expressed or logically entailed by its content. The suggestion could be very clear to the recipient (perhaps a sort of code), but it could also be vague or fuzzy.

===Paradoxes===
Even using ordinary [[set theory]] and [[Principle of bivalence|binary logic]] to reason something out, logicians have discovered that it is possible to generate statements which are logically speaking not completely true or imply a [[paradox]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes &amp; George Brecht, ''Vicious Circles and Infinity. An anthology of Paradoxes.'' Penguin Books, 1978. Nicholas Rescher, ''Epistemological Studies''. Frankfurt: Ontos Verlag, 2009, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; even although in other respects they conform to logical rules (see [[Russell's paradox]]). [[David Hilbert]] concluded that the existence of such logical paradoxes tells us "that we must develop a meta-mathematical analysis of the notions of proof and of the axiomatic method; their importance is methodological as well as epistemological".
&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Cantini, "Paradoxes and Contemporary Logic", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 30 April 2012.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradoxes-contemporary-logic/#RusCon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Various different aspects of human experience commonly generate concepts with fuzzy characteristics.
===Human vs. Computer===
The formation of fuzzy concepts is partly due to the fact that the human brain does not operate like a computer (see also [[Chinese room]]).&lt;ref&gt;See further Radim Bělohlávek &amp; George J. Klir (eds.) ''Concepts and Fuzzy Logic''. MIT Press, 2011. [[John R. Searle]], "Minds, brains and programs". ''The behavioral and brain sciences'', Vol. 3, No. 3, 1980, pp. 417–457. [[Robert Epstein]], "The empty brain", ''Aeon'', 18 May 2016.[https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer]&lt;/ref&gt;
*While ordinary computers use strict binary logic gates, the brain does not;  i.e., it is capable of making all kinds of neural associations according to all kinds of ordering principles (or fairly chaotically) in associative patterns which are not logical but nevertheless meaningful. For example, a work of art can be meaningful without being logical. A pattern can be regular, ordered and/or non-arbitrary, hence meaningful, without it being possible to describe it completely or exhaustively in formal-logical terms.
*Something can be meaningful although we cannot name it, or we might only be able to name it and nothing else.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Collins, ''Tacit &amp; explicit knowledge''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Human brains can also interpret the same phenomenon in several different but interacting frames of reference, at the same time, or in quick succession, without there necessarily being an explicit logical connection between the frames (see also [[framing effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]], "The framing of decisions and psychology of choice". ''Science'', Vol. 211, No. 4481, January 1981, pp. 453-458.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[fuzzy-trace theory]], partly inspired by [[Gestalt psychology]], human intuition is a non-arbitrary, reasonable and rational process of cognition; it literally "makes sense" (see also: [[Problem of multiple generality]]).&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Brainerd and V. F. Reyna, “Gist is the grist: fuzzy-trace theory and the new intuitionism”. ''Developmental Review'', Vol. 10, No. 1, March 1990, pp. 3-47, at p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
In part, fuzzy concepts arise also because [[learning]] or the growth of [[understanding]] involves a transition from a vague awareness, which cannot orient behaviour greatly, to clearer insight, which can orient behaviour. At the first encounter with an idea, the sense of the idea may be rather hazy. When more experience with the idea has occurred, a clearer and more precise grasp of the idea results, as well as a better understanding of how and when to use the idea (or not). 

In his study of [[implicit learning]], [[Arthur S. Reber]] affirms that there does not exist a very sharp boundary between the conscious and the unconscious, and "there are always going to be lots of fuzzy borderline cases of material that is marginally conscious and lots of elusive instances of functions and processes that seem to slip in and out of personal awareness".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur S. Reber]], ''Implicit learning and tacit knowledge. An essay on the cognitive unconscious''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus, an inevitable component of fuzziness exists and persists in human consciousness, because of continual variation of gradations in awareness, along a continuum from the [[conscious]], the [[preconscious]], and the [[subconscious]] to the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]]. The hypnotherapist [[Milton H. Erickson]] noted likewise that the conscious mind and the unconscious normally interact.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Havens (ed.), ''The wisdom of Milton H. Erickson, Volume II: human behavior &amp; psychotherapy.'' New York: Irvington Publishers, 1992, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits===
Some psychologists and logicians argue that fuzzy concepts are a necessary consequence of the reality that any kind of distinction we might like to draw has ''limits of application''. At a certain level of generality, a distinction works fine. But if we pursued its application in a very exact and [[rigorous]] manner, or overextend its application, it appears that the distinction simply does not apply in some areas or contexts, or that we cannot fully specify how it should be drawn. An [[analogy]] might be, that zooming a [[telescope]], [[camera]], or [[microscope]] in and out, reveals that a pattern which is sharply focused at a certain distance becomes blurry at another distance, or disappears altogether.

===Complexity===
Faced with any large, complex and continually changing phenomenon, any short statement made about that phenomenon is likely to be "fuzzy", i.e., it is meaningful, but – strictly speaking – incorrect and imprecise.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cornelius Benjamin, "Science and vagueness". In: ''Philosophy of science'', Vol. 6 No. 4, 1939, pp. 422-431.&lt;/ref&gt; It will not really do full justice to the reality of what is happening with the phenomenon. A correct, precise statement would require a lot of elaborations and qualifiers. Nevertheless, the "fuzzy" description turns out to be a useful shorthand that saves a lot of time in communicating what is going on ("you know what I mean").

===Cognition===
In [[psychophysics]], it was discovered that the perceptual distinctions we draw in the mind are often more definite than they are in the real world. Thus, the brain actually tends to "sharpen up" or "enhance" our perceptions of differences in the external world. 
*Between black and white, we are able to detect only a limited number of shades of gray, or colour gradations (there are "[[Absolute threshold|detection thresholds]]").&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Knoblauch, "Color Vision", in: ''Steven's handbook of experimental psychology, Vol 1: sensation and perception'' (3rd ed.). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Motion blur]] refers to the loss of detail when a person looks at a fast-moving object, or is moving fast while the eyes are focused on something stationary. In a movie reel, the human eye can detect a sequence of up to 10 or 12 still images per second. At around 18 to 26 frames per second, the brain will "see" the sequence of individual images as a moving scene.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tarantola, "Why Frame Rate Matters". Gizmodo.com, 14 January 2015.[https://gizmodo.com/why-frame-rate-matters-1675153198]&lt;/ref&gt;

If there are more gradations and transitions in reality, than our conceptual or perceptual distinctions can capture, then it could be argued that how those distinctions will actually apply, must ''necessarily'' become vaguer at some point.

===Novelty===
In interacting with the external world, the human mind may often encounter new, or partly ''new phenomena or relationships'' which cannot (yet) be sharply defined given the background knowledge available, and by known distinctions, associations or generalizations.

{{Quotation|"Crisis management plans cannot be put 'on the fly' after the crisis occurs. At the outset, information is often [[vague]], even contradictory. Events move so quickly that decision makers experience a sense of loss of control. Often denial sets in, and managers unintentionally cut off information flow about the situation" - [[L. Paul Bremer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Paul Bremer]], "Corporate governance and crisis management", in: ''Directors &amp; Boards'', Winter 2002&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Chaos===
It also can be argued that fuzzy concepts are generated by a certain sort of [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] or way of working which evades definite distinctions, makes them impossible or inoperable, or which is in some way chaotic. To obtain concepts which are not fuzzy, it must be possible to [[Test method|test]] out their application in some way. But in the absence of any relevant clear distinctions, lacking an orderly environment, or when everything is "in a state of [[flux]]" or in transition, it may not be possible to do so, so that the amount of fuzziness increases.

==Everyday occurrence==

Fuzzy concepts often play a role in the creative process of forming new concepts to understand something. In the most primitive sense, this can be observed in infants who, through practical experience, learn to identify, distinguish and generalise the correct application of a concept, and relate it to other concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Piaget]] &amp; [[Bärbel Inhelder]], ''The Growth of Logical Thinking from Childhood to Adolescence''. New York: Basic Books, 1958; Philip J. Kelman &amp; Martha E. Arterberry, ''The cradle of knowledge: development of perception in infancy''. Cambridge, Mass.: The MIT Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, fuzzy concepts may also occur in scientific, journalistic, programming and philosophical activity, when a thinker is in the process of clarifying and defining a newly emerging concept which is based on distinctions which, for one reason or another, cannot (yet) be more exactly specified or validated. Fuzzy concepts are often used to denote [[Complexity|complex]] phenomena, or to describe something which is developing and changing, which might involve shedding some old meanings and acquiring new ones.

===Areas===
*In [[meteorology]], where changes and effects of complex interactions in the atmosphere are studied, the weather reports often use fuzzy expressions indicating a broad trend, likelihood or level. The main reason is that the forecast can rarely be totally exact for any given location.
*In [[biology]], protein complexes with multiple structural forms are called [[fuzzy complex]]es. The different conformations can result in different, even opposite functions. The conformational ensemble is modulated by the environmental conditions. Post-translational modifications or alternative splicing can also impact the ensemble and thereby the affinity or specificity of interactions. [[Genetic fuzzy systems]] use [[algorithms]] or [[genetic programming]] which simulate natural evolutionary processes, in order to understand their structures and parameters.
*In [[medical diagnosis]], the assessment of what the symptoms of a patient are often cannot be very exactly specified, since there are many possible qualitative and quantitative gradations in severity, incidence or frequency that could occur.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising, "On the absence of strict boundaries — Vagueness, haziness, and fuzziness in philosophy, science, and medicine". ''Applied Soft Computing'', Vol 8, 2008, pp. 1232–1242, at p. 1235.&lt;/ref&gt; Different symptoms may also overlap to some extent. These gradations can be difficult to measure, it may cost a lot of time and money, and so the medical professionals might use approximate "fuzzy" categories in their judgement of a medical condition or a patient's condition. Although it may not be exact, the diagnosis is often useful enough for treatment purposes. Fuzzy logic is increasingly employed in diagnostic and medical equipment capable of measuring gradations of a condition.&lt;ref&gt;Kazem Sadegh-Zadeh "The Fuzzy Revolution: Goodbye to the Aristotelian Weltanschauung". In: ''Artificial Intelligence in Medicine'', 21, 2001, pp. 18–19.[http://www.iiia.csic.es/~puyol/SEIAD2001/publicacions/sadegh.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[information services]] fuzzy concepts are frequently encountered because a customer or client asks a question about something which could be interpreted in different ways, or, a document is transmitted of a type or meaning which cannot be easily allocated to a known type or category, or to a known procedure. It might take considerable inquiry to "place" the information, or establish in what framework it should be understood.
*In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] which aims to study the structure of subjective experience without preconceptions,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Priest, Theories of the mind. London: Penguin Books, 1991, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; an important insight is that how someone experiences something can be influenced ''both'' by the influence of the thing being experienced itself, but ''also'' by how the person responds to it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hammond, Jane Howarth and Russell Keat, ''Understanding Phenomenology''. Oxford: Blackwell, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the actual experience the person has, is shaped by an "interactive object-subject relationship". To describe this experience, fuzzy categories are often necessary, since it is often impossible to predict or describe with great exactitude what the interaction will be, and how it is experienced.
*In [[translation]] work, fuzzy concepts are analyzed for the purpose of good translation. A concept in one language may not have quite the same meaning or significance in another language, or it may not be feasible to translate it literally, or at all.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Griebel, "Fuzzy concepts in translators’ minds". In: Valérie Dullion, ''Between specialised texts and institutional contexts – competence and choice in legal translation''. Amsterdam:  John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2017. (Special issue of ''Translation and Translanguaging in Multilingual Contexts'', Vol. 3, No. 1, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have concepts which do not exist in another language, raising the problem of how one would most easily render their meaning. In [[computer-assisted translation]], a technique called [[Fuzzy matching (computer-assisted translation)|fuzzy matching]] is used to find the most likely translation of a piece of text, using previous translated texts as a basis.
*In [[hypnotherapy]], fuzzy language is deliberately used for the purpose of trance induction. Hypnotic suggestions are often couched in a somewhat vague, general or ambiguous language requiring interpretation by the subject. The intention is to distract and shift the conscious awareness of the subject away from external reality to her own internal state. In response to the somewhat confusing signals she gets, the awareness of the subject spontaneously tends to withdraw inward, in search of understanding or escape.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Havens (ed.), ''The wisdom of Milton H.  Erickson, Volume I: hypnosis and hypnotherapy''. New York: Irvington Publishers, 1992, p. 106. Joseph O'Connor &amp; John Seymour (ed.), ''Introducing neuro-linguistic programming''. London: Thorsons, 1995, p. 116f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[business]] and [[economics]], it was discovered that "we are guided less by a correct exact knowledge of our self-interest than by a socially learned, evolved, intuitive grasp derived from mental shortcuts ([[Framing effect (psychology)|frames]], reference points, envy, addiction, temptation, fairness)".&lt;ref&gt;Francese Trillas, "Fuzzy logic and modern economics." In:  Rudolf Seising, Enric Trillas &amp; [[Janusz Kacprzyk]] (eds.), ''Towards the future of fuzzy logic''. Basel: Springer International Publishing, 2015, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, economic preferences are often ''fuzzy'' preferences, a highly important point for suppliers of products and services. Fuzzy set empirical methodologies are increasingly used by economic analysts to analyze the extent to which members of a population belong to a specific market category, because that can make a big difference to business results.
*In [[sexology]],  sex and gender are conceptualized by gender pluralists as a spectrum or continuum, or a set of scaled characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Surya Monro, ‘’Bisexuality’’. Houndmills, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the idea that people are either heterosexual [[men]], heterosexual [[women]], [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]] or [[transsexual]] is far too simplistic; [[gender identity]] is a matter of degree, a graded concept, which for that very reason is a ''fuzzy'' concept with unsharp boundaries. For example, somebody who is "mainly" heterosexual, may occasionally have had non-heterosexual contacts, without this warranting a definite "bisexual" label. A great variety of sexual orientations are possible and can co-exist. In the course of history, typical male or female gender roles and gender characteristics can also gradually change, so that the extent to which they express "masculine" or "feminine" traits is, at any time, a matter of degree, i.e. fuzzy. 
*In [[politics]], it can be highly important and problematic how exactly a conceptual distinction is drawn, or indeed whether a distinction is drawn at all; distinctions used in administration may be deliberately sharpened, or kept fuzzy, due to some political motive or [[Political power|power]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Kosko]], "Yes, Candidates, There Is a Fuzzy Math". ''New York Times'', 7 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians may be deliberately vague about some things, and very clear and explicit about others; if there is information that proves their case, they become very precise, but if the information doesn't prove their case, they become vague or say nothing. 
*In [[statistical]] research, it is an aim to measure the magnitudes of phenomena. For this purpose, phenomena have to be grouped and categorized, so that distinct and discrete counting units can be defined. It must be possible to allocate all observations to mutually exclusive categories, so that they are properly quantifiable. Survey observations do not spontaneously transform themselves into countable data; they have to be identified, categorized and classified in such a way, that identical observations can be grouped together, and that observations are not counted twice or more.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Gordon &amp; David Bendien, "Standard classifications". ''New Zealand Statistics Review'', September 1993, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; A well-designed questionnaire ensures that the questions are interpreted in the same way by all respondents, and that the respondents are really able to answer them within the formats provided. Again, for this purpose, it is a requirement that the concepts being used are exactly and comprehensibly defined for all concerned, and not fuzzy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Bauer et al., "Vague concepts in survey questions. A general problem illustrated with the left-right scale." SSRN Electronic Journal, April 2014.[http://pablobarbera.com/static/vague-concepts.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; There could be a margin of measurement error, but the amount of error must be kept within tolerable limits, and preferably its magnitude should be known.
*In [[theology]] an attempt is made to define more precisely the meaning of [[spirtuality|spiritual]] concepts, which refer to how human beings construct the meaning of human existence, and, often, the relationship people have with a [[supernatural]] world. Many spiritual concepts and beliefs are fuzzy, to the extent that, although abstract, they often have a highly personalized meaning, or involve personal interpretation of a type that is not easy to define in a cut-and-dried way. A similar situation occurs in [[psychotherapy]]. The Dutch theologian Kees de Groot has explored the imprecise notion that [[psychotherapy]] is like an "implicit [[religion]]", defined as a "fuzzy concept" (it all depends on what one means by "psychotherapy" and "religion").&lt;ref&gt;C.N. de Groot, "Sociology of religion looks at psychotherapy." ''Recherches sociologiques'' (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium), Vol. 29, No. 2, 1998, pp. 3–17 at p. 4.[http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=76988]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher of spirituality [[Ken Wilber]] argued that "nothing is 100% right or wrong", things merely "vary in their degree of incompleteness and dysfunction"; no one and nothing is 100% good or evil, each just varies "in their degree of ignorance and disconnection". This insight suggests, that ''all'' human valuations can be considered as graded concepts, where each qualitative judgement has at least implicitly a sense of quantitative proportion attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Manson, "The rise and fall of Ken Wilber", markmanson.net, 4 June 2012.[https://markmanson.net/ken-wilber]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[legal system]], it is essential that rules are interpreted and applied in a standard way, so that the same sorts of cases and the same sorts of circumstances are treated equally. Otherwise one would be accused of arbitrariness,&lt;ref&gt;That is, in applying rules, the rules are not consistently followed, and the pattern of their application therefore does not follow rules.&lt;/ref&gt; which would not serve the interests of justice. Consequently, lawmakers aim to devise definitions and categories which are sufficiently precise, so that they are not open to different interpretations. For this purpose, it is critically important to remove fuzziness, and differences of interpretation are typically resolved through a court ruling based on evidence. Alternatively, some other procedure is devised which permits the correct distinction to be discovered and made.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see e.g. Ralf Posche, "Ambiguity And Vagueness In Legal Interpretation", in: Lawrence M. Solan &amp; Peter M. Tiersma (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law''. Oxford University Press, 2012, pp. 128-144.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Business administration|administration]], [[Archive|archiving]] and [[accounting]], fuzziness problems in interpretation and boundary problems can arise, because it is not clear to what category exactly a case, item, document, transaction or piece of data belongs. In principle, each case, event or item must be allocated to the correct category in a procedure, but it may be, that it is difficult to make the appropriate or relevant distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;David Henry, "Fuzzy Numbers', ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', 3 October 2004.[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2004-10-03/fuzzy-numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalities===
It could be argued that many concepts used fairly universally in daily life (e.g. "love", "God", "health",  "social", "tolerance" etc.) are ''inherently or intrinsically'' fuzzy concepts, to the extent that their meaning can never be completely and exactly specified with logical operators or objective terms, and can have multiple interpretations, which are at least in part purely subjective. Yet despite this limitation, such concepts are not meaningless. People keep using the concepts, even if they are difficult to define precisely.

===Multiple meanings===
It may also be possible to specify one personal meaning for the concept, without however placing restrictions on a different use of the concept in other contexts (as when, for example, one says "this is what I mean by X" in contrast to other possible meanings). In ordinary speech, concepts may sometimes also be uttered purely randomly; for example a child may repeat the same idea in completely unrelated contexts, or an [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] term may be uttered arbitrarily. A feeling or sense is conveyed, without it being fully clear what it is about.

[[Happiness#definitions|Happiness]] may be an example of a word with variable meanings depending on context.

===Ambiguities===
Fuzzy concepts can be used deliberately to create [[ambiguity]] and [[vagueness]], as an evasive tactic, or to bridge what would otherwise be immediately recognized as a [[contradiction]] of terms. They might be used to indicate that there is definitely a connection between two things, without giving a complete specification of what the connection is, for some or other reason. This could be due to a failure or refusal to be more precise. But it could also could be a prologue to a more exact formulation of a concept, or to a better understanding of it.

==Efficiency==

Fuzzy concepts can be used as a practical method to describe something of which a complete description would be an unmanageably large undertaking, or very time-consuming; thus, a simplified indication of what is at issue is regarded as sufficient, although it is not exact.

===Popper===
There is also such a thing as an "economy of distinctions", meaning that it is not helpful or efficient to use more detailed definitions than are really necessary for a given purpose. In this sense, [[Karl Popper]] rejected [[pedant]]ry and commented that:

{{Quotation| "...it is always undesirable to make an effort to increase precision for its own sake — especially linguistic precision — since this usually leads to loss of clarity, and to a waste of time and effort on preliminaries which often turn out to be useless, because they are bypassed by the real advance of the subject: one should never try to be more precise than the problem situation demands. I might perhaps state my position as follows. Every increase in clarity is of intellectual value in itself; an increase in precision or exactness has only a pragmatic value as a means to some definite end..."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Unended quest: an intellectual autobiography''. London: Routledge, 2002, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The provision of "too many details" could be disorienting and confusing, instead of being enlightening, while a fuzzy term might be sufficient to provide an orientation. The reason for using fuzzy concepts can therefore be purely pragmatic, if it is not feasible or desirable (for practical purposes) to provide "all the details" about the meaning of a shared symbol or sign. Thus people might say "I realize this is not exact, but you know what I mean" – they assume practically that stating all the details is not required for the purpose of the communication.

===Fuzzy logic gambit===
[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] picked up this point, and drew attention to a "major misunderstanding" about applying fuzzy logic. It is true that the basic aim of fuzzy logic is to make what is imprecise more precise. Yet in many cases, fuzzy logic is used paradoxically to "imprecisiate what is precise", meaning that there is a deliberate tolerance for imprecision for the sake of simplicity of procedure and economy of expression. 

In such uses, there is a tolerance for imprecision, because making ideas more precise would be unnecessary and costly, while "imprecisiation reduces cost and enhances tractability" (tractability means "being easy to manage or operationalize"). Zadeh calls this approach the "Fuzzy Logic Gambit" (a gambit means giving up something now, to achieve a better position later).

In the Fuzzy Logic Gambit, "what is sacrificed is precision in [quantitative] value, but not precision in meaning", and more concretely, "imprecisiation in value is followed by precisiation in meaning". Zadeh cited as example [[Fuzzy control system|Takeshi Yamakawa]]'s programming for an [[inverted pendulum]], where differential equations are replaced by fuzzy if-then rules in which words are used in place of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "What is fuzzy logic?". ''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013. Takeshi Yamakawa "Stabilization of an Inverted Pendulum by a High-speed Fuzzy Logic Controller Hardware System". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'', Vol.32, pp. 161–180, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuzzy vs. Boolean===
Common use of this sort of approach, particularly in programming, has led some logicians to regard fuzzy logic merely as an extension of [[Boolean logic]] (a [[two-valued logic]] or binary logic is simply replaced with a [[many-valued logic]]). 

However, Boolean concepts have a logical structure which differs from fuzzy concepts. An important feature in Boolean logic is, that an element of a set can also belong to any number of other sets; even so, the element ''either'' does, ''or'' does not belong to a set (or sets). By contrast, whether an element belongs to a fuzzy set is a matter of degree, and not always a definite yes-or-no question.

All the same, the Greek mathematician Costas Drossos suggests in various papers that, using a "non-standard" mathematical approach, we could also construct fuzzy sets with Boolean characteristics and Boolean sets with fuzzy characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. C. A. Drossos, "Foundations of fuzzy sets: A nonstandard approach". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'', Volume 37, Issue 3, 28 September 1990, pp. 287-307.&lt;/ref&gt; This would imply, that in practice the boundary between fuzzy sets and Boolean sets is itself fuzzy, rather than absolute. For a simplified example, we might be able to state, that a concept ''X'' is definitely applicable to a finite set of phenomena, and definitely not applicable to all other phenomena. Yet, within the finite set of relevant items, ''X'' might be ''fully'' applicable to one subset of the included phenomena, while it is applicable only “to some varying extent or degree” to another subset of phenomena which are also included in the set.

==Clarifying methods==
In [[mathematical logic]], [[computer programming]], [[philosophy]] and [[linguistics]] fuzzy concepts can be analyzed and defined more accurately or comprehensively, by describing or modelling the concepts using the terms of [[fuzzy logic]] or other [[substructural logic]]s. More generally, clarification techniques can be used such as:

*1. Contextualizing the concept by defining the setting or situation in which the concept is used, or how it is used appropriately  ([[Context (language use)|context]]).
*2. Identifying the [[intention]], [[purpose]], aim or goal associated with the concept ([[teleology]] and [[design]]).
*3. Comparing and contrasting the concept with related ideas in the present or the past ([[comparative]] and [[comparative research]]).
*4. Creating a [[Conceptual model|model]], likeness, [[analogy]], [[metaphor]], [[prototype]] or [[narrative]] which shows what the concept is about or how it is applied ([[isomorphism]] or [[simulation]]).
*5. ''Probing the [[Presupposition|assumptions]]'' on which a concept is based, or which are associated with its use ([[critical thought]], [[tacit assumption]]).
*6. ''[[Map (mathematics)|Map]]ping or [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]ing'' the applications of the concept using some basic [[parameters]], or using some diagrams or flow charts to understand the relationships between elements involved ([[Visualization (graphics)|visualization]] and [[concept map]]).&lt;ref&gt;Guy W. Mineau et al. (eds.), ''Conceptual graphs for knowledge representation''. Berlin: Springer, 1993. Tru Hoang Cao, ''Conceptual graphs and fuzzy logic''. Berlin: Springer, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*7. Examining ‘’how likely’’ it is that the concept applies, statistically or intuitively ([[probability theory]]).
*8. Specifying relevant ''conditions'' to which the concept applies, as a procedure ([[computer programming]], [[formal concept analysis]]).
*9. [[Abstract and concrete|Concretizing]] the concept – finding specific examples, illustrations, details or cases to which it applies ([[Exemplification theory|exemplar]], [[exemplification]]).
*10. ''Reducing or restating'' fuzzy concepts in terms which are simpler or similar, and which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy ([[Computer algebra#Simplification|simplification]], [[dimensionality reduction]], [[plain language]], [[KISS principle]] or [[concision]]).
*11. Trying out a concept, by using it in interactions, practical work or in communication, and assessing the feedback to understand how the boundaries and distinctions of the concept are being drawn ([[trial and error]] or [[pilot experiment]]). 
*12. Engaging in a structured [[dialogue]] or repeated [[discussion]], to exchange ideas about how to get specific about what it means and how to clear it up ([[Scrum (software development)|scrum method]]).
*13. Allocating different applications of the concept to different but related ''sets'' ([[Boolean logic]]).
*14. Identifying ''operational rules'' defining the use of the concept, which can be stated in a language and which cover all or most cases ([[material conditional]]).
*15. [[Categorization|Classifying, categorizing, grouping]], or inventorizing all or most cases or uses to which the concept applies ([[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], [[cluster analysis]] and [[typology (statistics)|typology]]).
[[File:Operationalization of Free and Fair Judiciary.png|thumb|400px|An [[operationalization]] diagram, one method of clarifing fuzzy concepts.]]
*16. Applying a ''[[meta-language]]'' which includes fuzzy concepts in a more inclusive categorical system which is not fuzzy ([[meta]]).
*17. Creating a ''[[Measurement|measure]] or [[Scale (social sciences)|scale]]'' of the degree to which the concept applies ([[metrology]]).
*18. Examining the ''distribution patterns'' or distributional frequency of (possibly different) uses of the concept ([[statistics]]).
*19. Specifying a series of [[logical operators]] or inferential system which captures all or most cases to which the concept applies ([[algorithm]]).
*20. ''Relating'' the fuzzy concept to other concepts which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy, or simply by ''replacing'' the fuzzy concept altogether with another, alternative concept which is not fuzzy yet "works the same way" ([[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]])
*21. Engaging in [[meditation]], or taking the proverbial "run around the block" to clarify the mind, and thus improve precision of thought about the definitional issue ([[self-care]]).

In this way, we can obtain a more exact understanding of the meaning and use of a fuzzy concept, and possibly decrease the amount of fuzziness. It may not be possible to specify all the possible meanings or applications of a concept completely and exhaustively, but if it is possible to capture the majority of them, statistically or otherwise, this may be useful enough for practical purposes.

==Defuzzification==
{{main|Defuzzification}}
A process of [[defuzzification]] is said to occur, when fuzzy concepts can be logically described in terms of [[fuzzy set]]s, or the relationships between fuzzy sets, which makes it possible to define variations in the meaning or applicability of concepts as ''quantities''. Effectively, qualitative differences are in that case described more precisely as quantitative variations, or quantitative variability. Assigning a numerical value then denotes the magnitude of variation along a scale from zero to one.

The difficulty that can occur in judging the fuzziness of a concept can be illustrated with the question ''"Is this one of those?"''. If it is not possible to clearly answer this question, that could be because "this" (the object) is itself fuzzy and evades definition, or because "one of those" (the concept of the object) is fuzzy and inadequately defined.

Thus, the source of fuzziness may be in (1) the nature of the reality being dealt with, (2) the concepts used to interpret it, or (3) the way in which the two are being related by a person.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Timothy Williamson, ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1996, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that the personal meanings which people attach to something are quite clear to the persons themselves, but that it is not possible to communicate those meanings to others except as fuzzy concepts.

The '''Greco-Iberian [[alphabet]]''' is a direct adaptation of an [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] variant of a [[Greek alphabet]] to the specifics of the [[Iberian language]], thus this script is an alphabet and lacks the distinctive characteristic of the rest of [[paleohispanic scripts]] that present signs with syllabic value, for the [[occlusive]]s and signs with monophonemic value for the rest of [[consonants]] and [[vowels]].

==Location of findings==
[[Image:Plom I de La Serreta (Cara B).jpg|250px|thumb|Lead plaque from la Serreta ([[Alcoi]]).]] 
The inscriptions that use the Greco-Iberian alphabet had been found mainly in [[Alicante]] and [[Murcia]] and the direction of the writing is left to right. The number of known Greco-Iberian inscriptions is small: fewer than two dozen [[ceramic]] inscriptions and a dozen [[lead]] plaques, among them the lead plaque from La Serreta ([[Alcoy (Spain)|Alcoy]], [[Alicante]]) and the lead plaque from El Cigarralejo (Mula, [[Murcia]]). The archaeological context of the Greco-Iberian inscriptions seems to concentrate in the 4th century BC, but the paleographic characteristics of the model indicate that the adaptation may date from the 5th century BC.

==Typology==
[[Image:Un alfabet greco-ibèric.jpg|thumb|250px|A Greco-Iberian alphabet]] 
The Greco-Iberian alphabet contains 16 signs identical to Greek signs, except for the sign corresponding to the second [[rhotic consonant]]: five [[vowels]], three [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[occlusive]]s ([[Labial consonant|labial]], [[Dental consonant|dental]] and [[velar]]), but only two [[voiceless]] occlusives (dental and velar), two [[sibilants]], two [[rhotic consonant|rhotics]], one [[Lateral consonant|lateral]], and only one [[Nasal stop|nasal]] sign. To represent the second rhotic rho gets an additional stroke. Eta is used instead of [[epsilon]] to represent /e/. The only letter not found in the modern variant of the Greek alphabet is [[sampi]]. 

The letter forms are [[petroglyph]]ic since the writing surface (ceramic, stone, lead) affords angular glyphs with straight lines.

[[File:USDAHardiness 2012-2015 Scale.jpg|alt=(See table below)|thumb|Temperature scale used to define USDA hardiness zones. These are '''annual''' '''extreme minimums''' (an area is assigned to a zone by taking the lowest temperature recorded there in a given year). As shown, the USDA uses a GIS dataset averaged over 1976 to 2005 for its United States maps.]]
A '''hardiness zone''' is a geographic area defined to encompass a certain range of climatic conditions relevant to plant growth and survival.

The original and most widely-used system, developed by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) as a rough guide for landscaping and gardening, defines 13 zones by annual extreme minimum temperature. It has been adapted by and to other countries (such as Canada) in various forms.

Unless otherwise specified, "hardiness zone" or simply "zone" usually refers to the USDA scale. For example, a plant may be described as "hardy to zone 10": this means that the plant can withstand a minimum temperature of -1&amp;nbsp;°C (30.2&amp;nbsp;°F) to 3.9&amp;nbsp;°C (39.0&amp;nbsp;°F).

Other hardiness rating schemes have been developed as well, such as the UK Royal Horticultural Society and US Sunset Western Garden Book systems.

==United States hardiness zones (USDA scale)==
{{anchor|USDA hardiness zones}}
The USDA system was originally developed to aid gardeners and landscapers in the United States.

State-by-state maps, along with an electronic system that allows finding the zone for a particular zip code, can be found at the [http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Default.aspx USDA Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) website.]

In the United States, most of the warmer zones (zones 9, 10, and 11) are located in the deep southern half of the country and on the southern coastal margins. Higher zones can be found in [[Hawaii]] (up to 12) and [[Puerto Rico]] (up to 13). The middle portion of the mainland and central and northern coastal areas are in the middle zones (zones 8, 7, and 6). The far northern portion on the central interior of the mainland have some of the coldest zones (zones 5, 4, and small area of zone 3) and often have much less consistent range of temperatures in winter due to being more continental, and thus the zone map has its limitations in these areas. Lower zones can be found in [[Alaska]] (down to 1). The low latitude and often stable weather in [[Florida]], the [[Gulf Coast]], and southern [[Arizona]] and [[California]], are responsible for the few episodes of severe cold relative to normal in those areas. The [[Pacific Ocean]] keeps the [[Pacific Northwest#Climate|Pacific Northwest]] in warmer zones than nearby inland areas.  The warmest zone in the [[Contiguous United States|48 contiguous states]] is the [[Florida Keys]] (11b) and the coldest is in north-central [[Minnesota]] (3a).

===History===
The first attempts to create a geographical hardiness zone system were undertaken by two researchers at the [[Arnold Arboretum]] in [[Boston]]: the first was published in 1927 by Alfred Rehder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernald|first=M. L.|date=1927|editor-last=Rehder|editor-first=Alfred|title=Rehder's Manual of Cultivated Trees and Shrubs|jstor=23298457|journal=Rhodora|volume=29|issue=339|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second by Donald Wyman in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hedges_Screens_Windbreaks.html?id=IXPZAAAAMAAJ|title=Hedges, Screens &amp; Windbreaks: Their Uses, Selection and Care|last=Wyman|first=Donald|date=1938|publisher=McGraw-Hill|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arnold map was subsequently updated in 1951, 1967, and finally 1971, but eventually fell out of use completely.

The modern USDA system began at the [[United States National Arboretum|US National Arboretum]] in [[Washington, DC|Washington]]. The first map was issued in 1960, and revised in 1965. It used uniform 10 degree Fahrenheit ranges, and gradually became widespread among American gardeners.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.plantdelights.com/blogs/articles/plant-hardiness-zone-maps|title=History of Plant Hardiness Zone Maps - The Rest of the Story|work=Plant Delights Nursery|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Del Tredici|first=Peter|date=1990|title=The New USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/1990-50-3-the-new-usda-plant-hardiness-zone-map.pdf|journal=Arnoldia|volume=50 |issue=3|pages=16–20|via=Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USDA map was revised and reissued in 1990 with freshly available climate data, this time with 5-degree distinctions dividing each zone into new "a" and "b" subdivisions.

In 2003, the [[American Horticultural Society]] (AHS) produced a draft revised map, using temperature data collected from July 1986 to March 2002. The 2003 map placed many areas approximately a half-zone higher (warmer) than the USDA's 1990 map. Reviewers noted the map zones appeared to be closer to the original USDA 1960 map in its overall zone delineations. Their map purported to show finer detail, for example, reflecting [[urban heat island]]s by showing the downtown areas of several cities (e.g., [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]) as a full zone warmer than outlying areas. The map excluded the detailed a/b half-zones introduced in the USDA's 1990 map, an omission widely criticized by horticulturists and gardeners due to the coarseness of the resulting map. The USDA rejected the AHS 2003 draft map and created its own map in an interactive computer format, that the [[American Horticultural Society]] now uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://ahsgardening.org/gardening-resources/gardening-maps/hardiness-map|publisher=American Horticultural Society|accessdate=8 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208070740/http://ahsgardening.org/gardening-resources/gardening-maps/hardiness-map|archivedate=8 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[Arbor Day Foundation]] released an update of U.S. hardiness zones, using mostly the same data as the AHS. It revised hardiness zones, reflecting generally warmer recent temperatures in many parts of the country, and appeared similar to the AHS 2003 draft. The Foundation also did away with the more detailed a/b half-zone delineations.&lt;ref name="Arbor Day Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arborday.org/media/zonechanges2006.cfm |title=New arborday.org Hardiness Zone Map reflects warmer climate : Latest hardiness zones, based on most current temperature data available, suggest up-to-date choices for best trees to plant |accessdate=2007-12-27 |work= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228234728/http://www.arborday.org/media/zonechanges2006.cfm |archivedate=2007-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the USDA updated their plant hardiness map based on 1976–2005 weather data, using a longer period of data to smooth out year-to-year weather fluctuations.&lt;ref name="USDA"&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map, 2012|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov|website=Agricultural Research Service|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=7 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024112311/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/|archivedate=24 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two new zones were added to better define and improve information sharing on tropical and semitropical plants, they also appear on the maps of Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  The map has a higher resolution than previous ones, and is able to show local variations due to things such as elevation or large bodies of water.  Many zone boundaries were changed as a result of the more recent data, as well as new mapping methods and additional information gathered.  Many areas were a half zone warmer than the previous 1990 map.&lt;ref name="USDAWhatsNew"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's New &amp;#124; USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/AboutWhatsNew.aspx|website=Agricultural Research Service|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=7 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019072431/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/AboutWhatsNew.aspx|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 map was created [[Geographic information system|digitally]] for the internet, and includes a [[ZIP Code]] zone finder and an interactive map.&lt;ref name="planthardiness.ars.usda.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/About.aspx|title=About {{!}} USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=planthardiness.ars.usda.gov|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weekendgardener.net/garden-plants/history.of.usda.hardiness.zones.htm|title=History of USDA Hardiness Zones|website=www.weekendgardener.net|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
As the USDA system is based entirely on average annual extreme minimum temperature in an area, it is limited in its ability to describe the climatic conditions a gardener may have to account for in a particular area: there are many other factors that determine whether or not a given plant can survive in a given zone.

Zone information alone is often not adequate for predicting winter survival, since factors such as frost dates and frequency of snow cover can vary widely between regions. Even the extreme minimum itself may not be useful when comparing regions in widely different [[Köppen climate classification|climate zones]]. As an extreme example, most of the United Kingdom is in zones 8-9, while in the US, zones 8-9 include regions such as the subtropical coastal areas of the [[southeastern US]] and [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]] and [[Chihuahuan Desert|Chihuahuan]] inland deserts, thus an American gardener in such an area may only have to plan for several days of cold temperatures per year, while their British counterpart may have to plan for several months.

In addition, the zones do not incorporate any information about summer temperature or [[insolation]]; thus sites which may have the same mean winter minima, but markedly different summer temperatures, will be accorded the same hardiness zone. For example, zone 8 covers coastal, high latitude, cool summer  locations like [[Seattle]] and [[London]],  as well as lower latitude, hot summer climates like [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Madrid, Spain|Madrid]]. Farmers, gardeners, and landscapers in the former two must plan for entirely different growing seasons from those in the latter.

In the colder zones, another issue is that the hardiness scales do not take into account the reliability of snow cover. Snow acts as an insulator against extreme cold, protecting the root system of hibernating plants. If the snow cover is reliable, the actual temperature to which the roots are exposed will not be as low as the hardiness zone number would indicate. As an example, [[Quebec City]] in Canada is located in zone 4, but can rely on a significant snow cover every year, making it possible to cultivate plants normally rated for zones 5 or 6. But, in [[Montreal]], located to the southwest in zone 5, it is sometimes difficult to cultivate plants adapted to the zone because of the unreliable snow cover.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Another problem is that many plants may survive in a locality but will not flower if the day length is insufficient or if they require [[vernalization]] (a particular duration of low temperature).

There are many other climate parameters that a farmer, gardener, or landscaper may need to take into account as well, such as humidity, precipitation, storms, rainy-dry cycles or monsoons, and site considerations such as soil type, soil drainage and water retention, water table, tilt towards or away from the sun, natural or manmade protection from excesssive sun, snow, frost, and wind, etc. The annual extreme minimum temperature is a useful indicator, but ultimately only one factor among many for plant growth and survival.&lt;ref name="planthardiness.ars.usda.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKenney|first=Daniel W.|last2=Pedlar|first2=John H.|last3=Lawrence|first3=Kevin|last4=Campbell|first4=Kathy|last5=Hutchinson|first5=Michael F.|date=2007-12-01|title=Beyond Traditional Hardiness Zones: Using Climate Envelopes to Map Plant Range Limits|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/57/11/929/234249|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=57|issue=11|pages=929–937|doi=10.1641/B571105|issn=1525-3244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives===
An alternative means of describing plant hardiness is to use "indicator plants". In this method, common plants with known limits to their range are used.

''[[Sunset Magazine|Sunset]]'' publishes a series that breaks up climate zones more finely than the USDA zones, identifying 45 distinct zones in the US, incorporating ranges of temperatures in all seasons, precipitation, wind patterns, elevation, and length and structure of the growing season.&lt;ref name="sunset"&gt;''Sunset National Garden Book''. Sunset Books Inc. Menlo Park, California (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the [[Köppen climate classification|Koppen climate classification system]] can be used as a more general guide to growing conditions when considering large areas of the Earth's surface or attempting to make comparisons between different continents.

=== Climate change projections ===
Recent research suggests that USDA plant hardiness zones will shift northward under climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Lauren E.|last2=Abatzoglou|first2=John T.|date=2016|title=Projected changes in cold hardiness zones and suitable overwinter ranges of perennial crops over the United States|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/11/i=3/a=034001|journal=Environmental Research Letters|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=034001|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/034001|issn=1748-9326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European hardiness zones==

===Ireland and UK===
[[File:UK zonemap.png|thumb|Britain and Ireland's hardiness zones]]
Owing to the moderating effect of the [[North Atlantic Current]] on the Irish and British [[temperate]] [[maritime climate]], Britain, and Ireland even more so, have milder winters than their northerly position would otherwise afford. This means that the hardiness zones relevant to Britain and Ireland are quite high, from 7 to 10, as shown below.

*7. In Scotland the [[Grampian Mountains|Grampians]], Highlands and locally in the [[Southern Uplands]], in England the [[Pennines]], and in Wales the highest part of [[Snowdonia]].
*8. Most of England, Wales and Scotland, parts of central Ireland, and [[Snaefell]] on the [[Isle of Man]].
*9. Most of western and southern England and Wales, western Scotland, also a very narrow coastal fringe on the east coast of Scotland and northeast England (within {{convert|5|km}} of the [[North Sea]]), London, the West Midlands Urban Area, most of Ireland, and most of the Isle of Man.
*10. Very low-lying coastal areas of the southwest of Ireland and the [[Isles of Scilly]].

USDA zones do not work particularly well in the UK as they are designed for a continental climate.&lt;ref name=crawford2010 /&gt; The cooler UK summers must be considered. New growth may be insufficient or fail to [[Cold hardening|harden off]] affecting winter survival.&lt;ref name=crawford2010&gt;{{cite book |author1=Martin Crawford |title=Creating a forest garden : working with nature to grow edible crops |date=2010 |publisher=Green Books |isbn=9781900322621 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOt_QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012 the United Kingdom's Royal Horticultural Society introduced new hardiness ratings for plants, from H7, the hardiest (tolerant of temperatures below {{convert|-20|°C}}) to H1a (needing temperatures above {{convert|15|°C}}).&lt;ref name=RHS&gt;{{cite web|title=RHS hardiness rating|url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/trials-awards/award-of-garden-merit/rhs-hardiness-rating|website=RHS hardiness rating|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|accessdate=24 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925021320/https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/trials-awards/award-of-garden-merit/rhs-hardiness-rating|archivedate=25 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RHS hardiness ratings are based on absolute minimum winter temperatures (in °C) rather than the long-term average annual extreme minimum temperatures that define USDA zones.&lt;ref name=RHS /&gt;

===Scandinavia===
Scandinavia lies at the same latitude as Alaska or Greenland, but the effect of the warm [[North Atlantic Current]] is even more pronounced here than it is in Britain and Ireland. Save for a very small spot near [[Karasjok]], Norway, which is in zone 2, nowhere in the Arctic part of Scandinavia does it get below zone 3. The [[Faroe Islands]], at 62–63°N are in zone 8, as are the outer [[Lofoten Islands]] at 68°N. [[Tromsø]], a coastal city in Norway at 70°N, is in zone 7, and even [[Longyearbyen]], the northernmost true city in the world at 78°N, is still in zone 5. All these coastal locations have one thing in common, though, which are cold, damp summers, with temperatures rarely exceeding {{convert|20|C}}, or {{convert|15|C}} in Longyearbyen. This shows the importance of taking heat zones into account for better understanding of what may or may not grow.

[[File:Osterlengarden.jpg|thumb|A garden in [[Simrishamn]], southern [[Sweden]].]]

In Sweden and Finland generally, at sea level to {{convert|500|m}}, zone 3 is north of the Arctic Circle, including cities like [[Karesuando]], [[Pajala]], and [[Rovaniemi]]. [[Kiruna]] is the major exception here, which being located on a hill above frost traps, is in zone 5. Zone 4 lies between the Arctic Circle and about 64–65°N, with cities such as [[Oulu]] and [[Jokkmokk]], zone 5 (south to 61–62°N) contains cities such as [[Tampere]], [[Umeå]], and [[Östersund]]. Zone 6 covers the south of mainland Finland, Sweden north of 60°N, and the high plateau of [[Småland]] further south. Here one will find cities such as [[Gävle]], [[Örebro]], [[Sundsvall]], and [[Helsinki]]. The [[Åland Islands]], as well as coastal southern Sweden, and the [[Stockholm]] area are in zone 7. The west coast of Sweden ([[Gothenburg]] and southwards) enjoys particularly mild winters and lies in zone 7, therefore being friendly to some hardy exotic species (found, for example, in the [[Gothenburg Botanical Garden]]), the southeast coast of Sweden has a colder winter due to the absence of the Gulf Stream.

Denmark is in zones 9a, 8b, and 8a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-denmark-plant-hardiness-zone-map-celsius.php|title=Denmark Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|author=|date=|website=www.plantmaps.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011101638/http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-denmark-plant-hardiness-zone-map-celsius.php|archivedate=11 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Europe===
Central Europe is a good example of a transition from an [[oceanic climate]] to a [[continental climate]], which can be noticed immediately when looking at the hardiness zones, which tend to decrease mainly eastwards instead of northwards. Also, the plateaux and low mountain ranges in this region have a significant impact on how cold it might get during winter. Generally speaking, the hardiness zones are high considering the latitude of the region, although not as high as in the Shetland Islands where zone 9 extends to over 60°N. In Central Europe, the relevant zones decrease from zone 8 on the Belgian, Dutch, and German [[North Sea]] coast, with the exception of some of the [[Frisian Islands]] (notably [[Vlieland]] and [[Terschelling]]), the island of [[Helgoland]], and some of the islands in the [[Rhine]]-[[Scheldt]] estuary, which are in zone 9, to zone 5 around [[Suwałki]], [[województwo podlaskie|Podlachia]] on the far eastern border between [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]]. Some isolated, high elevation areas of the [[Alps]] and [[Carpathians]] may even go down to zone 3 or 4. An extreme example of a cold sink is [[Funtensee]], [[Bavaria]] which is at least in zone 3 and maybe even in zone 1 or 2. Another notable example is [[Waksmund]], a small village in the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Carpathians]], which regularly reaches {{convert|-35|C}} during winter on calm nights when cold and heavy airmasses from the surrounding [[Gorce Mountains|Gorce]] and [[Tatra Mountains]] descend down the slopes to this low-lying valley, creating extremes which can be up to {{convert|10|°C}}  colder than nearby [[Nowy Targ]] or [[Białka Tatrzańska]], which are both higher up in elevation. Waksmund is in zone 3b while nearby [[Kraków]], only {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} to the north and {{convert|300|m|abbr=on}} lower is in zone 6a. These examples prove that local topography can have a pronounced effect on temperature and thus on what is possible to grow in a specific region.

===Southern Europe===
The southern European marker plant for climate as well as cultural indicator is the [[olive tree]], which cannot withstand long periods below freezing so its cultivation area matches the cool winter zone.  The [[Mediterranean Sea]] acts as a temperature regulator, so this area is generally warmer than other parts of the continent; except in mountainous areas where the sea effect lowers, it belongs in zones 8–10; however, southern Balkans (mountainous Western and Eastern [[Serbia]], continental [[Croatia]], and [[Bulgaria]]) are colder in winter and are in zones 6–7. The Croatian ([[Dalmatia]]n) coast, [[Albania]], and northern [[Greece]] are in zones 8–9, as are central-northern [[Italy]] (hills and some spots in [[Po Valley]] are however colder) and southern [[France]]; Central [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] is 8–9 (some areas are slightly colder). The [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Atlantic coast, most of [[Andalusia]] and [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]], almost all the [[Valencian Community]], a part of [[Catalonia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], southwestern [[Sardinia]], most of [[Sicily]], coastal southern Italy, and southwestern Greece are in zone 10. The islands of [[Malta]] and [[Lampedusa]] belong to zone 11a.

==Australian hardiness zones==

The USDA hardiness zones are in use in Australia, but in addition the Australian National Botanic Gardens have devised another system more in keeping with Australian conditions.&lt;ref name="Australian National Botanic Gardens"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/gardens/research/hort.research/zones.html |title=Plant Hardiness Zones for Australia |accessdate=2010-11-11 |work= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210130241/http://anbg.gov.au/gardens/research/hort.research/zones.html |archivedate=2010-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are numerically about 6 lower than the USDA system. For example, Australian zone 3 is roughly equivalent to USDA zone 9. The higher Australian zone numbers have no US equivalents.

There are problems with classifications of this type: the spread of weather stations is insufficient to give clear zones and too many places with different climates are lumped together. Only 738 Australian stations have records of more than ten years (one station per {{convert|98491|ha|disp=or}}), though more populated areas have relatively fewer hectares per station. Local factors such as aspect, altitude, proximity to the sea also complicate the matter. For example, [[Mount Isa]] has three climatic stations with more than a ten-year record. One is in zone 4a, one in zone 4b, and the other is in zone 5a. Likewise, Sydney residents are split between zones 3a and 4b. Most other cities have similar problems. Different locations in the same city are suitable for different plants, making it hard to draw a meaningful map without publishing a list of weather stations and their zone classification to allow best use of local conditions.

==Canadian hardiness zones==

Climate variables that reflect the capacity and detriments to plant growth are used to develop an index that is mapped to Canada's Plant Hardiness Zones.&lt;ref name="Natural Resources Canada Plant Hardiness"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Resources Canada - Plant Hardiness of Canada|url=http://www.planthardiness.gc.ca/|website=Natural Resources Canada - Plant Hardiness of Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=7 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629173949/http://www.planthardiness.gc.ca/|archivedate=29 June 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This index comes from a formula originally developed by Ouellet and Sherk in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Ouellet, C.E., Sherk, L.C. 1967a. Woody ornamental plant zonation I. Indices of winter hardiness. Can J. Plant Sci. 47:231-238.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ouellet, C.E., Sherk, L.C. 1967b. Woody ornamental plant zonation. II.

Suitability map for the probable winter survival of ornamental trees and shrubs. Can J. Plant Sci. 47: 351-358.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula used:

Y = -67.62 + 1.734X₁ + 0.1868X₂ + 69.77X₃ + 1.256X₄ + 0.006119X₅ + 22.37X₆ - 0.01832X₇

where: 
Y = estimated index of suitability 
X₁ = monthly mean of the daily minimum temperatures (°C) of the coldest month
X₂ = mean frost free period above 0&amp;nbsp;°C in days
X₃ = amount of rainfall (R) from June to November, inclusive, in terms of R/(R+a) where a=25.4 if R is in millimeters and a=1 if R is in inches
X₄ = monthly mean of the daily maximum temperatures (°C) of the warmest month
X₅ = winter factor expressed in terms of (0&amp;nbsp;°C - X₁)Rjan where Rjan represents the rainfall in January expressed in mm
X₆ = mean maximum snow depth in terms of S/(S+a) where a=25.4 if S is in millimeters and a=1 if S is in inches
X₇ = maximum wind gust in (km/hr) in 30 years.

For practical purposes, Canada has adopted the American hardiness zone classification system.  The 1990 version of the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map included Canada and Mexico, but they were removed with the 2012 update to focus on the United States and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="USDAWhatsNew" /&gt;

==American Horticultural Society heat zones==

In addition to the USDA Hardiness zones there are [[American Horticultural Society]] (AHS) heat zones.

The criterion is the average number of days per year when the temperature exceeds {{convert|30|C}}. The AHS Heat Zone Map for the US is available on the American Horticultural Society website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahsgardening.org/gardening-resources/gardening-maps/heat-zone-map|title=AHS Plant Heat Zone Map|publisher=American Horticultural Society|accessdate=2017-05-26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516031634/http://ahsgardening.org/gardening-resources/gardening-maps/heat-zone-map|archivedate=2017-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Heinz Schwarz''' (13 May 1924 – 5 February 2010) was a South African lawyer, statesman and long-time [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|political opposition]] leader against [[apartheid]] in South Africa, who eventually served as the [[South African Ambassador to the United States]] during the country's transition to [[majority rule]].

Schwarz rose from the childhood poverty he experienced as a German-Jewish refugee to become a lawyer and a member of the [[Transvaal Provincial Council]], where from 1963 to 1974, he was [[Leader of the Opposition]]. In the 1964 [[Rivonia Trial]] he was a defence lawyer. Advocating a more aggressive political opposition to the National Party's racial policies in the 1960s and 1970s, as Leader of the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] in [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and leader of the liberal "Young Turks", he clashed with the United Party establishment. He pioneered the call in white politics for a negotiated end to apartheid and in 1974 signed the [[Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith]] with [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] for a non-racial democratic society in South Africa. He was in the opposition for over 40 years and was a founding member of the [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]]. In light of his record, his appointment as South African Ambassador to the United States in 1990 was widely heralded as symbolic of the government's commitment to ending apartheid,&lt;ref name="csmonitor"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Battersby |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1991/0325/25151.html |title=South Africa's Unlikely New Envoy |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played a significant role in renewing the nation's image as the new democratic South Africa.&lt;ref name="14163.tif"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1990/007/14163.tif|format=TIF|title=New Envoy to America : Sign of Changing Times|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="14253.tif"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1990/007/14253.tif|format=TIF|title=New Ambassador|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="14445.tif"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1990/007/14445.tif|format=TIF|title=New Phase for SA  Politics - De Beer|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[South African Air Force]] [[World War II]] veteran during the 1950s, Schwarz co-founded the [[Torch Commando]], an ex-soldiers' movement to protest against the disenfranchisement of coloured people in South Africa. Described as South Africa's "most feisty politician" and a political "maverick",&lt;ref name="samedia.uovs.ac.za"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2056613|title=Battling Ways of Air Man Schwarz|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2056613|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was known for his parliamentary clashes with the apartheid government over its racial and economic policies. In his political career spanning 43 years, in which he gained respect from across the political spectrum, he never lost an election.&lt;ref name="parliament"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.za/content/25.03%20INSESSION%20Mar%20final.pdf|format=PDF|title=In Session magazine|publisher=Parliament.gov.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727181931/http://www.parliament.gov.za/content/25.03%20INSESSION%20Mar%20final.pdf|archivedate=27 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he received the [[Order for Meritorious Service]] and received several [[Honorary Doctorate]]s.  He was also one of the South African Jewish community's foremost leaders and spoke out strongly against anti-semitism.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |title= Community and Conscience: The Jews and Apartheid South Africa |last= Shimoni |first= Gideon |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2003|publisher= University Press of New England |location= Hanover, N.H. |isbn= 1-58465-329-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarz was described by the [[University of Stellenbosch]] as "one of the conceptual and moral fathers of the new South Africa"&lt;ref&gt;[http://70.84.171.10/~etools/newsbrief/1995/news0923] {{dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense that he had not only been one of apartheid's most prominent opponents, but his ideas and the initiatives he had taken had played a key role in the development of the concept of a negotiated democracy in South Africa, based on the principles of [[Political freedom|freedom]] and justice. [[Nelson Mandela]], a friend of his whom he visited while in prison, described him as a "champion of the poor".&lt;ref name="parliament" /&gt;

==Refugee from Germany==
Harry Schwarz was born Heinz Schwarz to Fritz (1897–1969) and Alma Schwarz (1901–1999) in [[Cologne]], Germany. His family belonged to the [[Glockengasse Synagogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajr.org.uk/journalpdf/1986_september.pdf|format=PDF|title=WINDS OF CHANGE : New Perspectives at the Annual General Meeting |publisher=ajr.org.uk |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in South Africa as a Jewish refugee from Germany in 1934 with his mother and younger brother Kurt. His father Fritz, a [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] activist, left for South Africa the night the Nazis came to power. They boarded the [[SS Giulio Cesare]] in [[Genoa]], Italy which took them to South Africa. When they arrived in [[Cape Town]] they stayed in one room in a house in Kloof Street. Schwarz described how he was "lucky" as eventually he was able to sleep in a bathroom in a rusty bath. He spoke no [[Afrikaans]] or English at first and had strong memories of being taunted on the schoolyard for being different. Schwarz stated in an interview in 1991 that "I know what the word discrimination means, not because I've read it in a book, but because I've been the subject of it. And I know what it means to be hungry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-12/news/wr-1224_1_new-south-africa?pg=3 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Scott | last=Kraft | date=12 February 1991 | title=Profile : S. Africa's De Klerk Sends Best Foe to Washington : Is he crazy to appoint Harry Schwarz the new ambassador? Like a fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discrimination and financial difficulties of his family left a strong impression on Schwarz and helped shape his political philosophy with its emphasis on social justice and the rule of law.

He attended Tamboerskloof School and [[South African College Schools]] in Cape Town and then [[Jeppe High School for Boys]] in Johannesburg.

===Military service===
{{Main|Military history of South Africa during World War II}}
Following his graduation from school in 1943, he was offered a job working for a stockbroker, as well as a university scholarship. However, Schwarz instead joined the South African Air Force during World War II in order to defeat Nazism. He served as a navigator and fought in North Africa, Crete and Italy. It was in the air force that he adopted the name Harry, as his Colonel said Heinz would not stand him in good stead if he were captured by Germans. He was in [[15 Squadron SAAF|15 Squadron]] and seconded to the RAF. In 1984 he was made an Honorary Colonel of the 15th Squadron.
{{Apartheid}}

==Wits University==
In 1946 he went to [[University of the Witwatersrand]] (more commonly known as Wits University) in Johannesburg with the help of a Government loan and grant, where he first befriended fellow students and future anti-apartheid political activists [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Joe Slovo]]. He joined the United Party and assisted in the 1948 election. However, as a result of the National Party victory, he was determined to become more active and was elected Chairman of the United Party branch at the university. He argued that the National Party's victory in 1948 was reversible and anyone who opposed them should concentrate on defeating them. In an interview in 1991, Schwarz said on the National Party victory that "To me, they were the people who had supported Germany during the war. As a young man, it was very objectionable to me that the very people I had been fighting against were the people that the National Party had supported." He was also president of the university's ex-servicemen's league and chair of the Law Students Council. He stood as a candidate for treasurer of the Students Representative Council and refrained from voting for himself which he considered to be unethical. When the votes were counted, it was announced that Schwarz had lost by one vote.&lt;ref name="samedia.uovs.ac.za"/&gt;

He was awarded a BA, with distinctions in both history and [[economic history]], and later an [[Bachelor of Laws#South Africa|LLB]]. In 1949 he was admitted as a solicitor and, later, as a barrister (Member of [[Middle Temple]]) in London, United Kingdom. In 1953, he became  [[Advocate#South Africa|advocate at the South African Bar]].

==Rivonia trial==
{{Main|Rivonia Trial}}
In 1963, [[Nelson Mandela]] and many other political opponents were arrested and brought to court in the famous [[Rivonia Trial]]. Harry Schwarz was one of the defence barristers in the trial defending Accused No. 8 [[James Kantor|Jimmy Kantor]], who was a close friend of his. Kantor was Mandela's lawyer in the trial until he too was arrested and charged with the same crimes as Mandela. After being the subject of vicious taunting and many attempts to place him as a vital cog of MK by [[Percy Yutar]], finally Judge [[Quartus de Wet]] discharged him, stating Accused No 8 has no case to answer. Kantor along with [[Rusty Bernstein]] were the only accused who were acquitted. Kantor noted in his autobiography, A Healthy Grave, that Schwarz refused payment. Schwarz was refused access to Mandela while he was imprisoned on [[Robben Island]], however he was granted access to visit him after 1988 when he was transferred to [[Victor Verster Prison]]. After the trial he left the Bar and became a solicitor so that he could concentrate on fighting apartheid.

During the trial he presented the case for Kantor as follows, "My Lord, it is difficult to reply in a restrained fashion. My learned friend must not use words such as 'Communist' lightly, when he refers to Kantor. Kantor is not a Communist. My learned friend has used the tactics of McCarthyism in an endeavour to smear him. I think, with respect, my learned friend is allowing himself to run away with facts that are not there. His complaint in count one is not that they found files with evidence. Oh not, he says that 'we found files with nothing in them', not in Kantor's office, but in the office of Wolpe. Then my learned friend [held] that the practice had been ruined and liquidated Kantor's practice. My lord, it is not Kantor. It is not Kantor! Why I say it is so difficult to be restrained, is that my learned friend has thrown in everything that concerns every accused in this case, and says 'that is why I don't want Kantor to get bail.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kantor |first=James |year=1967 |title=A healthy grave |publisher=Seven Seas Books|asin=B0006D1XN4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to politics==
Harry Schwarz's political career started with his election to the [[Johannesburg]] City Council in 1951 for Booysens, which had been said to be an unwinnable seat against the National Party. Schwarz won the seat by 954 votes. Despite being the youngest person in the city council, he became chairman of the council's management committee - the most influential committee on the council. While in the council, Schwarz focused on challenging forced evictions of black and coloured people in Johannesburg, and attempted to improve housing and education. Booysens had once been occupied by [[Labour Party (South Africa)|Labour Party]] politician [[Jimmy Green (South African politician)|Jimmy Green]], who was his wife's uncle, who was first elected in 1920 to the City Council.

In 1958 during a by-election Schwarz was elected into the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] provincial council for the Hospital constituency. The constituency eventually was renamed [[Hillbrow]]. In 1963 he became Leader of the Opposition in the Transvaal Provincial Council, a post he would hold until 1974. He continued to practice law whilst serving in the Provincial Council and throughout his political career. However, he briefly withdrew from law between 1969 and 1974 to take up the position of Chief Executive of Merchant Bank.

Schwarz's vision for the post-apartheid South Africa was embodied in a document named the "Act of Dedication", of which he presented to the provincial council in 1973. The document, written by him, called for the Transvaal and the rest of South Africa to adopt and subscribe to the principles of a non-discriminatory society. While the UP Transvaal caucus unanimously adopted the initiative, the National Party refused to allow it to be debated in the council and parliament. Schwarz pushed for the adoption of the act in the 1973 National UP Congress, in which he succeeded.

==Tensions within United Party==
In 1959, Schwarz remained in the United Party after 11 liberal United Party members broke away from the party to form the Progressive Party in 1959, opting instead to change the UP from within. By the early 1970s Schwarz had become known as the leader of the liberal faction of the party, dubbed the "Young Turks", who wanted the UP to adopt a more aggressive approach to the National Party and its policy of apartheid. Schwarz and his Young Turks faced fierce opposition and resistance from the party's national leader Sir [[De Villiers Graaff]] and other members of the UP's "Old Guard". Schwarz achieved prominence as a race relations and economic reformist in the party. In 1971 he became deputy leader of the UP in the Transvaal, a post specially created for him. However, internal divisions in the party between liberals and conservatives came to a head in August 1973 when Schwarz ousted Marais Steyn as the leader of the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] in the Transvaal. Steyn had been a MP for almost 25 years and for 15 years had been a close adviser to [[De Villiers Graaff]]. After Steyn lost the election he defected to the National Party. Schwarz's victory was a visible sign of strength from the liberals within the party.

===Mahlabatini Declaration===
{{Main|Mahlabatini Declaration}}
On 4 January 1974, Harry Schwarz met and had discussions with Gatsha (later Mangosuthu) [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi|Buthelezi]], Chief Executive Councillor of the black homeland of [[KwaZulu]]. They agreed on a five-point plan for racial peace in South Africa that became known as the [[Mahlabatini Declaration|Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith]]. The declaration's purpose was to provide a blueprint for government of South Africa for racial peace in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Thomas |year=2002|title=Indispensable traitors: liberal parties in settler conflicts|publisher=[[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]]|isbn=0-313-31774-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It called for negotiations involving all peoples, in order to draw up constitutional proposals stressing opportunity for all with a [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]] to safeguard these rights. It suggested that the federal concept was the appropriate framework for such changes to take place. It also first affirmed that political change must take place though non-violent means. The concept of a non-discriminatory society had been outlined in the 'Act of Dedication' of 1973 that Schwarz had written, while Leader of the Opposition in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]. Schwarz had called for the Transvaal and South Africa to adopt and subscribe to the act. While the United Party Transvaal caucus unanimously adopted the initiative, the National Party refused for it to come to debate. The principles of the act were adopted at the 1973 National United Party Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/cis/omalley/OMalleyWeb/dat/SAIRR%20Survey%201973.pdf|format=PDF|title=A SURVEY OF RACE RELATIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA: 1973 |publisher=Nelsonmandela.org|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration was the first of such agreements by acknowledged black and white leaders in South Africa that affirmed to these principles. The commitment to the peaceful pursuit of political change was declared at a time when neither the National Party or African National Congress were looking for peaceful solutions or dialogue. The declaration was heralded by the English speaking press as a breakthrough in race relations in South Africa. The declaration was endorsed by several chief ministers of the [[black homelands]], including [[Cedric Phatudi]] ([[Lebowa]]), [[Lucas Mangope]] ([[Bophuthatswana]]) and Hudson Nisanwisi ([[Gazankulu]]). The declaration also received praise from liberal figures such as [[Alan Paton]].

The declaration drew much media interest from both inside and outside South Africa. However, the declaration provoked an angry response from the UP's 'Old Guard', including the party's leader De Villiers Graaff and led to Schwarz and other liberals being expelled from the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/cis/omalley/OMalleyWeb/dat/SAIRR%20Survey%201975.pdf|format=PDF|title=A SURVEY OF RACE RELATIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA: 1975|publisher=Nelsonmandela.org |accessdate=13 January 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1974 Chief Phatudi, Harry Schwarz and M. I. Mitchell (United Party MP), had discussions at [[Seshego]]. They issued a joint statement, endorsing the principles embodied in the Mahlabatini Declaration. It also stated that all South Africans must be united to meet any external threats, subversion, or terrorism, and that the best way of uniting the people to meet such threats was to give them a real stake in society which they were asked to defend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/cis/omalley/OMalleyWeb/dat/SAIRR%20Survey%201974.pdf|format=PDF|title=A SURVEY OF RACE RELATIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA: 1974 |publisher=Nelsonmandela.org|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary career==
[[File:HSchwarz.JPG|thumb|Harry Schwarz was expelled from the United Party in 1975 after delivering his "I am my brother's keeper" speech to Parliament]]

===Realigning opposition===
Harry Schwarz played a key role in the realignment of the opposition in South Africa. In the [[South African general election, 1974|1974 general election]], Schwarz was elected into Parliament for [[Yeoville]], along with other liberal members of Schwarz's Young Turks. In February 1975, Dick Enthoven MP was expelled from the United Party by Sir de Villiers Graaff for "disloyalty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/50/304/32-130-A32-84-al.sff.document.nusa197504.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February 1975, when asked in Parliament by a National Party MP if he supported Enthoven's liberal positions, Schwarz replied "I make no secret of it. I am my brother's keeper". For not following the party line, Schwarz was expelled from the party. This led to the resignation of four other MP's, Senator Brian Bramford, ten members of the Transvaal Provincial Council, which made it the official opposition party in the Transvaal Provincial Council, 14 out of the 36 Johannesburg City Councillors and four Randburg City Councillors. On the night of the expulsion, the [[Reform Party (South Africa)|Reform Party]] was launched, of which Schwarz as elected leader. The party's charter mainly incorporated the [[Mahlabatini Declaration]]'s principles and called for [[universal franchise]] and for equality to be extended to all.

On 25 July 1975, the Reform Party merged with the [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]] to form the [[Progressive Reform Party (South Africa)|Progressive Reform Party]]. Schwarz became the party's spokesman on finance, education and Chairman of the Federal Executive, while [[Colin Eglin]], the former leader of the Progressives was elected leader of the newly merged party. In 1977 the party was renamed the [[Progressive Federal Party]], when additional defectors from the United Party joined. This served to finally realign opposition politics in South Africa, as the PFP became the official opposition party in South Africa, following the [[South African general election, 1977|1977 General Election]].

===Leader of the opposition===
Schwarz, as one of his party's co-founders, finance spokesman (1975–91), defence spokesman (1975–84) and Chairman of the Federal Executive (1975–79), was one of its foremost leaders and a prominent leader of the opposition. He was regarded the PFP's "star performer" in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leon|first=Tony|year=2009|title=On the Contrary: Leading the Opposition in the New South Africa|publisher=Jonathan Ball Publishers|isbn=1-86842-259-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109013446/https://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article305270.ece/|title=Times LIVE|date=2017-11-09|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with others such as [[Colin Eglin]], he was an iconic opposition figure. He was known nationwide for his sharp attacks on the National Party. According to veteran progressive MP [[Helen Suzman]], Schwarz carried out his role so effectively as Shadow Finance Minister that National Party Finance Ministers lived in terror of him, particularly when the time came for delivering the annual budget speech. He served as deputy chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance and was on the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee. During his 17 years in parliament Schwarz, along with other opposition leaders like Colin Eglin, [[Zach de Beer]] and [[Frederik van Zyl Slabbert]] forcefully denounced the government's racial policies, as well as its press restrictions and economic policies. Schwarz also played a key role exposing the [[Muldergate Scandal]] of 1979, that led to the resignation of Prime Minister [[John Vorster|B. J. Vorster]], acting as the PFP's representative to the investigation commission. On several occasions, Schwarz received behind-the-scenes offers to take up a Cabinet position under a National Party government, which he refused every time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511045204/http://www.sajewishreport.co.za/pdf/latest_issue/NJWED00410.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|last=|first=|date=2013-05-11|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarz was often involved in heated clashes in parliament with government figures. In June 1980, Prime Minister P.W. Botha said to Schwarz, "You're the last person who will dictate to me", who was responding to Schwarz's accusation that the PM would be failing in his duty to South Africa unless he publicly repudiated the Minister of Posts, Hennie Smit, for his 'slow-thinking' remarks on Schwarz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1897581|title=PM and Schwarz Clash over Smit|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924093918/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1897581|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1989, Schwarz debated with Minister of the Budget [[Kent Durr]] live on Television in the House of Assembly. Schwarz  slammed the NP economic policies and was regarded to have won the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2032551 |title=Survey favours Schwarz in TV debate with Durr |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203043936/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2032551 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to press restrictions===
In 1979, Schwarz appealed to the National Party and its leader to reconsider a bill that would, in the PFP's view, heavily restrict press freedom. He urged the Prime Minister: "I make this appeal to Mr Botha: Show this statesmanship, show that at this time you will not allow our unity of purpose to overcome the real problems to be threatened."  In 1980, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] introduced the National Key Points Act that made those responsible for unauthorised reporting of incidents of sabotage or other attacks on declared national strategic targets a criminal. Schwarz slammed the attempts to restrict press freedoms, and stated that "Society as a whole is not condemned because individuals transgress, and nor should the press as a whole be judges by the actions of individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=20734481|title=Schwarz Slams Bid to Curb Press|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=20734481|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=20706601|title=A-G Bill a 'Turning Point' in SA Politics|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=20706601|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stating that press restrictions marked a "turning point" in South African politics, he also argued that press freedom was a "precious treasure" and a free and courageous press was a major weapon in South Africa's defence against external threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1979/031/01823.tif|format=TIF|title=Withdraw This Sledgehammer, Schwarz Pleads |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bill of Rights proposal===
In August 1983 during the [[South African Constitution of 1983|Constitutional Reform Debate]] Harry Schwarz submitted a motion calling for a 'Bill of Rights' to be incorporated in the new constitution of South Africa, the first motion of its kind ever brought before Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1917284|title=PFP's Lone Stand on 'Rights'|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227153032/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1917284|archivedate=27 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the Bill should guarantee freedom from discrimination on the ground of race, colour, sex or creed, freedom of conscience and religion, of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press, of association, peaceful assembly and movement, and freedom to pursue the gaining of a livelihood. It also included freedom from deprivation of life, liberty, security and property, except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. It would also guarantee equality before the law and equal protection and benefit of law.

Schwarz argued that if included in the constitution of the republic, it would act as a "protector of rights many people had struggled to achieve in South Africa" as well as to "act as an inspiration" to the people of South Africa and would "be a unifying factor in a country in which unity of people is essential for survival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1983/027/07120.tif|format=TIF|title=Bill of Rights Woyuld Help Unite - PFP |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While virtually all MPs of the Progressive Federal Party supported the bill, no other party in Parliament supported it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1917319|title=Right Wing Defeats PFP's Bill of Rights|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013446/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1917319|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting Schwarz's proposal, Daan van der Merwe of the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]] stated that the bill, based on a "leftist-liberal political philosophy", would jeopardise the freedom of the white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1917014|title=PFP Fails in Lone Fight for Bill of Rights|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224121/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1917014|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Republic Party (South Africa)|New Republic Party]] leader [[Vause Raw]] said Schwarz "a master at platitudes" was seeking idealistic freedoms that did not exist anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1983/027/07128.tif|format=TIF|title=Change Would Cause Court Chaos|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the rejection of Schwarz's bill, fellow PFP MPs' [[Helen Suzman]], [[Colin Eglin]], Ray Swart and Dave Dalling attempted a further four times to introduce a Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1911320|title=A Fourth Attempt to Change Reform Bill|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022635/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1911320|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bills' were effectively blocked by the National Party by placing them at the end of the order paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1910703|title=PFP Launches Another Bid for Constitution Bill|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020745/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1910703|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution of the new South Africa, signed into law in 1996, includes a Bill of Rights, which includes the same principles of the 1983 motion.

===Divisions within PFP===
While distinctly on the left of South African politics, he was perceived to be on the right-wing of the PFP mainly due to his favouring strong military defence and his insistence that political change must take place without the disruption of law and order, which earned him the nickname "Harry the Hawk Schwarz". He often found himself in dispute with some members of the original Progressive Party, particularly [[Helen Suzman]]. Colleagues would often refer the clashes they had in the parliamentary caucus meetings as "the Helen and Harry show". Suzman wrote of her relations with Schwarz in her autobiography, ''In No Uncertain Terms: A South African Memoir'': following the merger between the PP and Schwarz's Reform Party "I stayed in the party, but relations between Harry Schwarz and myself were very strained for some time thereafter. They improved only in 1986 when [[Frederik van Zyl Slabbert]] resigned from Parliament and the Progressive Federal Party. Harry Schwarz and I were the two most outraged members of the caucus, and our other differences faded into insignificance as a result. We developed a mutual respect for one another. Schwarz was an extremely able MP with a good financial brain, and a hard worker who could devastate National Party members in Parliament, especially [[Minister of Finance (South Africa)|Ministers of Finance]], who feared his vigorous attacks. Like me, he could be unpleasant both in and out of the House. The differences we had were not on racial policy, but on his hawkish support of the [[South African Defence Force]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Suzman |first=Helen |year=1993 |title=In No Uncertain Terms: A South African Memoir|publisher=Knopf|isbn=0-679-40985-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic Party===
Schwarz was one of the founding members of the Democratic Party. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, as its Spokesman on Finance, formulated its social market policy. Given South Africa's complex character, Mr Schwarz supported a federal system similar to that of the United States, as well as a justiciable Bill of Rights to protect the rights of minorities as well as the majority. This was also longstanding policy of the former Progressive Party dating back to the report of their Molteno Commission of the early 1960s. His economic philosophy was summed up in a phrase he often used: "Freedom is incomplete if it is exercised in poverty".

On 6 February 1991, he ended his career in parliament following his appointment as the South African ambassador to the United States. His farewell speech to parliament was entitled  "Look after my people while I'm gone".

==Mandela prison visit==
After the 1964 Rivonia Trial, where Schwarz had been on the defence team and where his university friend Nelson Mandela was imprisoned, Schwarz was barred from gaining access to Mandela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1989/026/04205.tif|format=TIF|title=Schwarz Meets Mandela |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Mandela was moved to [[Victor Verster Prison]], various restrictions were lifted upon Mandela, including more lenient visitation rights. On 23 November 1989, Schwarz, following a request from Mandela, visited him in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2164009 |title=The Mandela Merry-Go-Round |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za |accessdate=14 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924093957/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2164009 |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his visit, Schwarz called for the "immediate and unconditional" release of Mandela, stating that this was "in the interest of all South Africans - black and white - that this should happen as soon as possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1989/032/04057.tif|format=TIF|title=Free Mandela Immediately Says Schwarz |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South African Ambassador to United States==
[[File:New South African flag unveiling.jpg|thumb|Ambassador Harry Schwarz unveiling the new [[South African flag]] to the United States and President [[Bill Clinton]] in May 1994]]

Harry Schwarz was the first serving politician from the parliamentary [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] ranks to be appointed to a senior ambassadorial post in [[South African]] history as well as the first Jewish ambassador. He was also accredited as the first South African High Commissioner to [[Barbados]] in 1993 when diplomatic relations opened. Schwarz had previously received behind-the-scenes offers to accept a Cabinet position, by President P.W. Botha and Prime Minister B.J. Vorster, but refused every time due to his opposition to apartheid. He agreed to the appointment of ambassador because of the government's commitment to the fundamental reforms that he had fought for, as well as on the terms that the National Party would not try to take his seat in [[Yeoville]].

In an interview with the [[New York Times]] Schwarz said that "He hasn't asked me to change my political convictions," speaking of President de Klerk. "He knows that I'm implacably opposed to apartheid. Otherwise, there's no logic in asking me to do this job." Nor, Mr. Schwarz added, was he bound for Washington to represent South Africa's five million whites. "I've made it clear that I want to be ambassador for 37 million people." A comment in the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', typified the reaction among much of the US press: "When a man who has devoted most of his life to the struggle for a new South Africa tells you that apartheid is dead and that sanctions are holding up its burial, he speaks with a moral authority that is difficult to assail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jeff Jacoby |url=http://www.jeffjacoby.com/13588/this-apartheid-foe-says-sanctions-hurt |title=This apartheid foe says sanctions hurt |publisher=Jeff Jacoby |date=1991-05-08 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Schwarz, a well known and respected anti-apartheid leader was willing to accept the post was widely acknowledged in South Africa as a further demonstration of President F. W de Klerk's determination to introduce a new democratic system.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;

===Diplomatic legacy===
Schwarz has been credited as having played one of the leading roles in the renewal of relations between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1994/007/09915.tif|format=TIF|title=It's a Triumph for Schwarz |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cape Times described Schwarz as having "engineered a state of US/South Africa relations better than it has ever been".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=940042|title=A Job Well Done, Harry!|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094003/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=940042|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Schwarz, for decades a well known anti-apartheid figurehead, was willing to accept the position was widely acknowledged as a highly symbolic demonstration of President F. W de Klerk's determination to introduce a new democratic system.&lt;ref name="14163.tif" /&gt;&lt;ref name="14253.tif" /&gt;&lt;ref name="14445.tif" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1991/007/04818.tif|format=TIF||title=Schwarz Delivers Message of Change |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Schwarz's tenure, he negotiated the lifting of US sanctions against South Africa, secured a $600 million aid package from President [[Bill Clinton]], signed the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1991 and hosted President Mandela's state visit to the US in October 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1994/007/05929.tif|format=TIF|title=Schwarz Highly Rated |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[African National Congress]] victory in the 1994 General election, President Nelson Mandela requested Schwarz remain as ambassador until after his state visit in October of that year, of which Schwarz agreed. Schwarz resigned his post as ambassador and returned to South Africa in November 1994, following his three and-a-half-year tenure as South African ambassador to the United States. At an event sponsored by the South African Jewish Board of Deputies in his honour, Schwarz urged the Jewish community to make the best of the changes taking place in South Africa and to contribute actively to the success of the country.

==Jewish community leadership==
Beginning in the mid-seventies, Schwarz emerged as one of the South African Jewish community's foremost leaders. Schwarz often led the opposition to anti-semitic comments and movements by prominent public figures, and was often involved in heated clashes in parliament. In April 1982, Schwarz was ordered out of the parliamentary chamber after he described Nationalist MP Andre Fourie as "vuilgoed' (rubbish), in response to Fourie saying that he was "enough to make a Jew anti-Semitic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1904180|title=Schwarz Ordered From House|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1904180|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1986, he took up the issue of anti-semitism within the far-right Conservative Party after its leader [[Clive Derby-Lewis]] responded to a question of whether Jews were "money and power grabbers" by asking "Is that anti-semitic or fact?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2194868|title=MP Takes Up Issue of Anti Semitism|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2194868|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also slammed the CP's supporters use of Nazi symbols and banners, and for burning the Israeli flags. While affirming that "the days of the Jews walking into the gas chambers are over", Schwarz also warned that the Jewish community should "not paint everybody with a broad brush", and that impulsive reactions should be avoided before "waging war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=636702|title=Anti Semitism in SA|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=636702|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Schwarz would often use his access and relations with government ministers, police and the military establishment to investigate incidents of anti-semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1658112|title=Train Terror: Anti Semitism Unlikely|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1658112|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Schwarz was involved in a heated clash with [[Eugène Terre'Blanche]], Leader of the far-right paramilitary [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]], after Schwarz confronted him during a speech over the organisation's racial policy towards non-Afrikaans and non-Christian citizens of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1987/026/00246.tif|format=TIF|title=Odd Couple |publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the confrontation Schwarz received a huge standing ovation from both English and Afrikaans members of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1862186|title=MP Addresses AWB Leader Over Views About Jews|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1862186|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to apartheid, Schwarz argued that Judaism was fundamentally opposed to segregation, and that "If we rationalise or condone discrimination against one group, we have compromised our principles and we are then not true to our beliefs or our history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1552889|title=Harry Schwarz addresses Passover meeting|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914005308/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1552889|archivedate=14 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that violent change could ultimately lead to a nondemocratic government, incompatible with Jewish ethics and with the interests of the Jewish community. He emphasized that Jews needed not only a democratic society for all, but also "The right to follow [their] own religion and love for [[Israel]] freely." He was assured in private meetings by [[Israel]]i Prime Minister's [[Shimon Peres]] and [[Yitzhak Shamir]] that Jews in South Africa would not become isolated and links with Israel would be maintained. He played an increasingly important role on the Jewish Board of Deputies from the 1970s, serving as chairman of its committee on international relations and often acting as spokesman for the board to Jewish agencies abroad. In 2005, he was made an honorary vice-president of the board, and remained active until his death.

Schwarz's lifelong friendship with Nelson Mandela also helped to ensure Jews in South Africa did not feel isolated with the unbanning of the [[African National Congress]], and the subsequent election of Mandela as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=898206|title=Jews Want Meeting With Mandela on Israel|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=898206|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=899130|title=Give Mandela Benefit of the Doubt|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120070449/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=899130|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business activities==
While serving as a senior politician as well as practicing law, Harry Schwarz was also a prominent and respected business figure in South Africa. He held directorships of multiple companies, notably serving as Chief Executive of Merchant Bank between 1969 and 1974.

==Later life==
Harry Schwarz retired from politics upon returning from Washington, and returned to law to practice in Schwarz-North in [[Johannesburg]] and continued to work until he died. His areas of legal practice were primarily corporate and commercial with special interests in banking, insurance, diplomacy and advocacy. He was highly critical of the [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]]'s decision to merge with the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]] in 2000 and in 2008 stated that the DP "should have sought an alliance with black political groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SAPA |url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=93012 |title=Harry Schwartz dies at 85 &amp;#124; Archive &amp;#124; BDlive |publisher=Businessday.co.za |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained active in the Jewish community, notably serving as president of the South Africa-Israel Chamber of Commerce between 1999 and 2010 and vice-president of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies. Schwarz delivered his final public speech at the South African Parliament in November 2009 at a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the formation of the Progressive Party, in which he stated that "freedom is incomplete if it is exercised in poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=152985&amp;sn=Detail |title=Reflections on SA`s liberals in politics - FEATURES |publisher=Politicsweb |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to South Africa, Schwarz and his wife set up a charity trust called the Schwarz Upliftment Trust. He lived in [[Johannesburg]] with his wife Annette, who is an accomplished artist and ran all of his election campaigns. They were married for 57 years with three children and four grandchildren.

===Death and tributes===
On the morning of 5 February 2010, the South African Jewish Board of Deputies announced that Schwarz had died, following a short illness, at the age of 85.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therichmarksentinel.com/rs_headlines.asp?recid=3849|title=Dieta para perder barriga|publisher=Therichmarksentinel.com|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113041321/http://www.therichmarksentinel.com/rs_headlines.asp?recid=3849|archivedate=13 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried on Sunday 7 February in the section of honor in the West Park Cemetery in Johannesburg; the funeral was attended by hundreds of guests and family members.

[[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] leader and Leader of the Opposition [[Helen Zille]] led tributes to Schwarz. She said

&lt;blockquote&gt;Harry Schwarz will be remembered for his signal contribution to the development of our democracy. His piercing intellect, and long professional experience in banking, made him the most astute analyst in Parliament on economic and financial matters during his terms in office. He had strong leadership qualities and could inspire people to great achievements. He was an outstanding debater, both inside and outside Parliament. He could stand his ground against all-comers. His principled and steadfast resistance to racial nationalism was rooted in the key role he played in fighting Nazism during World War 2. He continued his resistance to racial nationalism through his long and distinguished career in South African opposition politics. He has engraved his place in South Africa's political history. We will always remember him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polity.org.za/article/da-statement-by-helen-zille-democratic-alliance-leader-expressing-condolences-on-the-passing-of-harry-schwarz-05022010-2010-02-05 |title=DA: Statement by Helen Zille, Democratic Alliance leader, expressing condolences on the passing of Harry Schwarz (05/02/2010) |publisher=Polity.org.za |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

South African [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Jacob Zuma]] paid tribute to Schwarz in the introduction of his State of the Nation address to [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] on 11 February 2010, the 20th anniversary of Nelson Mandela's release from prison and the 35th anniversary of the founding of Schwarz's Reform Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.iafrica.com/features/2222360.htm |title=iafrica.com State of the Nation text |publisher=News.iafrica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement the Jewish Board of Deputies said of Schwarz: "One of the last of a generation of German Jewish refugees from Nazism who came to South Africa in the 1930s, he rendered sterling service to his adopted country, whether in the political, diplomatic, human rights, legal or Jewish communal fields." It stated that he was "amongst the most forthright and effective campaigners against apartheid" and said how he "remained actively involved in Jewish communal work to the very end." Zev Krengel, chairman of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, said that "He was a man of formidable intellect and absolute integrity and was throughout his life a brave, unyielding fighter for justice." Rabbi Mendel Rabinowitz, who conducted the funeral said "Those like Harry, who contribute to society in so many capacities for so many years never die. Their bodies are laid to rest but the memory of them continues to live on."

Others such as former Leader of the Opposition [[Frederik van Zyl Slabbert]], former Foreign Minister [[Pik Botha]] and the [[African Christian Democratic Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acdp.mobi/wnewsdisp.php?id=4294 |title=Latest News |publisher=Acdp.mobi |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; paid tribute to Schwarz for his record as an anti-apartheid campaigner and for his contribution to democracy and human rights in South Africa.

==Quotes==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Freedom is incomplete if it is exercised in poverty.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To risk making predictions is rather presumptuous and unwise. If I'm wrong, it will never be forgotten. If I'm right, no one will remember.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Finweek/To-my-mind/Predictions-work-sometimes-20050920-2 |title=Predictions work – sometimes |publisher=Fin24.com |date=2004-05-05 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Morality is cheap when someone else is paying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1030957|title=Israel Economic Team: No Talk of Sanctions|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913220302/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=1030957|archivedate=13 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Laws alone is not enough to ensure that freedom is safeguarded. What is required is a spirit of freedom among the people concerned. There must be an atmosphere of respect, a feeling of belonging together, an atmosphere of harmony with fellow beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2000874|title=Govt. cares about power, not people|publisher=samedia.uovs.ac.za|accessdate=13 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924093949/http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2000874|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are a country with a people who are removing the shackles of apartheid and will create a just economic system and a true democracy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is important that in the process of change, existing institutions of value and means of production are not destroyed. The fabric of society, however critical one may be of its present structures, should be adopted and modified where required, but not destroyed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Honmei choco'''''|本命チョコ||"true feeling chocolate"}} in Japan is chocolate given by women on [[Valentine's Day]] to men whom the giver has romantic feelings for. This is often given to husbands, [[boyfriend]]s, and prospective boyfriends. ''Honmei'' chocolate is usually higher-quality and more expensive than ''[[giri choco]]'' ("obligation chocolate"), which is given to male coworkers and other men the woman has no romantic attachment to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123635365|title=Japanese Embrace Valentine's Day|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|accessdate=February 14, 2010|date=February 12, 2010|last=Craft|first=Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homemade ''honmei choco'' is also popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1589631,00.html|title=How Valentine's Day Conquered Japan|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=April 23, 2016|date=February 14, 2007|last=Sekiguchi|first=Toko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is generally reciprocated on [[White Day]], celebrated on March 14, when men buy candy and gifts for women.

'''Ideation''' is the [[creativity|creative]] process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an [[idea]] is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, 2005, page 613&lt;/ref&gt; Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from [[innovation]], to development, to actualization.&lt;ref&gt;Graham and Bachmann, 2004, pg 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideation can be conducted by individuals, organizations, or crowds. As such, it is an essential part of the [[design process]], both in education and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, in Fowles, 1979, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Methods of innovation==

The book ''Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas'' (Graham and Bachmann, 2004) proposes the following methods of innovation:

;Problem solution:  This is the most simple method of progress, where someone has found a problem and as a result, solves it.
;Derivative idea:  This involves taking something that already exists and changing it.
;Symbiotic idea:  A symbiotic method of idea creation is when multiple ideas are combined, using different elements of each to make a whole.
;Revolutionary idea:  A revolutionary idea breaks away from traditional thought and creates a brand new perspective.  For example, the writings of [[Copernicus]] (a development of classical Greek thought).
;Serendipitous discovery:  [[Serendipitous]] solutions are ideas which have been coincidentally developed without the intention of the inventor. For example, the discovery of [[penicillin]].
;Targeted innovation:  Creating a targeted innovation deals with a direct path of discovery.  This is often accompanied by intensive research in order to have a distinct and almost expected resolution.  For example, [[linear programming]].
;Artistic innovation:  Artistic innovation disregards the necessity for practicality and holds no constraints.
;Philosophical idea:  The philosophical idea lives in the mind of the creator and can never  be proven. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0471479446|title= Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of idea however can still have vast residual effects.  For example, the idea of [[eternal recurrence]].
;Computer-assisted discovery:  This uses a computer in order to widen possibilities of research and numeric possibilities.

This list of methods is by no means comprehensive or necessarily accurate. Graham and Bachmann's examples of revolutionary ideas might better be described as evolutionary; both Marx and Copernicus having built upon pre-existing concepts within new or different contexts.  Similarly, the description provided for artistic innovation represents one perspective.

More-nuanced understandings, such as that expressed by [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] in ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art'', recognize the generative force technical and perceptual limitations provide within specific arts practices.{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}  In [[painting]], for example, technical limitations such as the frame, the surface and the palette, along with perceptual constraints like [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure/ground relationships]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], provide creative frameworks for the painter.  Similarly in music, harmonic scales, meter and time signatures work in tandem with choices of instrumentation and expression to both produce specific results and improvise novel outcomes.

The [[T.O.T.E.|T.O.T.E. model]], an [[iterative]] [[problem solving]] strategy based on [[feedback]] loops, provides an alternative approach to considering the process of ideation.  Ideation may also be considered as a facet of other generative systems, such as [[Emergence]].

==Criticism==

The word "ideation" has come under informal criticism as being a term of meaningless jargon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2008/08/why-jargon-feeds-on-lazy-minds.html|title=Why Jargon Feeds on Lazy Minds|last=Berkun|first=Scott|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being inappropriately similar to the [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term for [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themuse.com/advice/10-annoying-buzzwords-the-whole-office-would-be-better-off-without|title=Annoying Tech Jargon to Remove From Your Vocabulary-The Muse|last=Thomson|first=Stephanie|publisher=[[The Daily Muse|The Muse]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2934">{{Corporate law|doctrines}}

The '''internal affairs doctrine''' is a [[choice of law]] rule in [[corporations law]].  Simply stated, it provides that the "internal affairs" of a [[corporation]] (e.g. conflicts between [[shareholder]]s and [[management]] figures such as the [[board of directors]] and [[corporate officer]]s) will be governed by the corporate [[statute]]s and [[case law]] of the state in which the corporation is [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]], sometimes referred to as the '''''lex incorporationis'''''.&lt;ref&gt;''Edgar v. MITE Corp.'', 457 U.S. 624, 645 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''McDermott Inc. v. Lewis'', 531 A.2d 206 (Del. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical effects of the doctrine==
The internal affairs doctrine ensures that such issues as voting rights of shareholders, distributions of [[dividend]]s and corporate [[property]], and the [[fiduciary]] obligations of management are all determined in accordance with the law of the state in which the company is incorporated.  On the other hand, the "external affairs" of a corporation, such as [[labor law|labor and employment]] issues and [[Tax law|tax liability]], are typically governed by the law of the state in which the corporation is doing business. Some issues and activities, such as [[contract]]s, [[mergers and acquisitions]], and sales of [[Security (finance)|securities]] to third parties, may be governed both by the laws of the state of incorporation and by the laws of the state in which the transaction takes place, and in some cases, by [[federal law]] as well (for example, [[United States securities law]] and [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]]).

==Relation to federalism==
{{see also|Federalism in the United States}}

In the [[United States]], each [[U.S. state|state]] has the power to set its own corporate law.  Because of this, and the fact that the internal affairs doctrine has been used by courts to allow application of the ''lex incorporationis'', this has created a competitive market for incorporations among the states.  Several states have taken advantage of this situation by becoming [[corporate haven]]s, particularly [[Delaware]] and [[Nevada]].  Likewise, many jurisdictions apply the internal affairs doctrine internationally, which has permitted [[offshore financial centre]]s to flourish.

The modern study of '''Japanese [[aesthetics]]''' only started a little over two hundred years ago in the West. The Japanese aesthetic is a set of ancient ideals that include ''[[Wabi-sabi|wabi]]'' (transient and stark beauty), ''[[Wabi-sabi|sabi]]'' (the beauty of natural patina and aging), and ''[[yūgen]]'' (profound grace and subtlety).&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-aesthetics | title=Japanese Aesthetics (Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy) | accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideals, and others, underpin much of Japanese cultural and aesthetic norms on what is considered [[Taste (sociology)|tasteful]] or [[beauty|beautiful]]. Thus, while seen as a [[philosophy]] in Western societies, the concept of aesthetics in Japan is seen as an integral part of daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aesthetics-online.org/articles/index.php?articles_id=3 |title=Teaching Japanese Aesthetics |accessdate=2008-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202060957/http://www.aesthetics-online.org/articles/index.php?articles_id=3 |archivedate=2008-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese aesthetics now encompass a variety of ideals; some of these are traditional while others are modern and sometimes influenced by other cultures.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With its emphasis on the wholeness of nature and character in ethics, and its celebration of the landscape, it sets the tone for Japanese aesthetics. Nevertheless, Japanese aesthetic ideals are most heavily influenced by [[Japanese Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.art.unt.edu/ntieva/download/teaching/Curr_resources/mutli_culture/Japan/Aesthetics/Japanese%20Aesthetics_Wabi-Sabi_Tea%20Ceremony.pdf | title=Japanese Aesthetics, Wabi-Sabi, and the Tea Ceremony | accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Buddhist tradition, all things are considered as either evolving from or dissolving into nothingness.  This "nothingness" is not empty space. It is rather a space of potentiality.&lt;ref name="Koren"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the seas represent potential then each thing is like a wave arising from it and returning to it. There are no permanent waves. At no point is a wave complete, even at its peak. Nature is seen as a dynamic whole that is to be admired and appreciated. This appreciation of nature has been fundamental to many Japanese aesthetic ideals, "arts," and other cultural elements. In this respect, the notion of "[[art]]" (or its conceptual equivalent) is also quite different from Western traditions (see [[Japanese art]]).

==Wabi-sabi==
{{main|Wabi-sabi}}
[[File:Castle Himeji sakura02.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Hanami]] ("blossom viewing") parties at [[Himeji Castle]]]]

Wabi and sabi refers to a mindful approach to everyday life. Over time their meanings overlapped and converged until they are unified into ''Wabi-sabi'', the aesthetic defined as the beauty of things "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete".&lt;ref name="Koren"/&gt; Things in bud, or things in decay, as it were, are more evocative of wabi-sabi than things in full bloom because they suggest the transience of things. As things come and go, they show signs of their coming or going, and these signs are considered to be beautiful. In this, beauty is an altered state of consciousness and can be seen in the mundane and simple. The signatures of nature can be so subtle that it takes a quiet mind and a cultivated eye to discern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm | title = What Is Wabi-Sabi? | accessdate=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zen]] philosophy there are seven aesthetic principles for achieving Wabi-Sabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bonsaibeautiful.com/nature_of_garden_art/japanese/index.html | title = The nature of garden art | accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Fukinsei''' (不均斉): asymmetry, irregularity;

'''Kanso''' (簡素): simplicity;

'''Koko''' (考古): basic, weathered;

'''Shizen''' (自然): without pretense, natural;

'''Yugen''' (幽玄): subtly profound grace, not obvious;

'''Datsuzoku''' (脱俗): unbounded by convention, free;

'''Seijaku''' (静寂): tranquility, silence.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Each of these things are found in nature but can suggest virtues of human character and appropriateness of behaviour. This, in turn suggests that virtue and civility can be instilled through an appreciation of, and practice in, the arts. Hence, aesthetic ideals have an ethical connotation and pervades much of the Japanese culture.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{cite book|title=Japanese arts and self-cultivation|last=Carter|first=Robert E.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7914-7254-5|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Miyabi ==
{{main|Miyabi}}
[[File:Kinkaku Snow E4.jpg|thumb|160px|The Temple of the Golden Pavilion (''[[Kinkaku-ji]]'')]]
Miyabi (雅) is one of the oldest of the traditional Japanese aesthetic ideals, though perhaps not as prevalent as Iki or Wabi-sabi. In modern Japanese, the word is usually translated as "elegance," "refinement," or "courtliness" and sometimes referred to as "heart-breaker".

The aristocratic ideal of Miyabi demanded the elimination of anything that was absurd or vulgar and the "polishing of manners, diction, and feelings to eliminate all roughness and crudity so as to achieve the highest grace." It expressed that sensitivity to beauty which was the hallmark of the [[Heian era]]. Miyabi is often closely connected to the notion of [[Mono no aware]], a bittersweet awareness of the transience of things, and thus it was thought that things in decline showed a great sense of miyabi.

==Shibui==
[[File:Hagi ware Japanese tea bowl, 18th-19th century, Freer Gallery of Art.jpg|left|150px|thumb|An 18th century [[Chawan|tea bowl]], exhibiting the aesthetics of Shibui]]
{{main|Shibui}}
Shibui (渋い) (adjective), shibumi (渋み) (noun), or shibusa (渋さ) (noun) are Japanese words which refer to a particular aesthetic or beauty of simple, subtle, and unobtrusive beauty. Originating in the Muromachi period (1336–1392) as shibushi, the term originally referred to a sour or astringent taste, such as that of an unripe persimmon. Shibui maintains that literal meaning still, and remains the antonym of amai (甘い), meaning 'sweet'. Like other Japanese aesthetic terms, such as iki and wabi-sabi, shibui can apply to a wide variety of subjects, not just art or fashion. Shibusa includes the following essential qualities. (1) Shibui objects appear to be simple overall but they include subtle details, such as textures, that balance simplicity with complexity. (2) This balance of simplicity and complexity ensures that one does not tire of a shibui object but constantly finds new meanings and enriched beauty that cause its aesthetic value to grow over the years. (3) Shibusa is not to be confused with wabi or sabi. Though many wabi or sabi objects are shibui, not all shibui objects are wabi or sabi. Wabi or sabi objects can be more severe and sometimes exaggerate intentional imperfections to such an extent that they can appear to be artificial. Shibui objects are not necessarily imperfect or asymmetrical, though they can include these qualities. (4) Shibusa walks a fine line between contrasting aesthetic concepts such as elegant and rough or spontaneous and restrained.

==Iki==
{{main|Iki (aesthetics)}}
Iki (いき, often written 粋) is a traditional aesthetic ideal in Japan. The basis of iki is thought to have formed among urbane mercantile class (Chōnin) in Edo in the Tokugawa period (1603–1868). Iki is an expression of simplicity, sophistication, spontaneity, and originality. It is ephemeral, straightforward, measured, and unselfconscious. Iki is not overly refined, pretentious, complicated. Iki may signify a personal trait, or artificial phenomena exhibiting human will or consciousness. Iki is not used to describe natural phenomena, but may be expressed in human appreciation of natural beauty, or in the nature of human beings.  The phrase ''iki'' is generally used in Japanese culture to describe qualities that are aesthetically appealing and when applied to a person, what they do, or have, constitutes a high compliment. ''Iki'' is not found in nature. While similar to ''wabi-sabi'' in that it disregards perfection, ''iki'' is a broad term that encompasses various characteristics related to refinement with flair. The tasteful manifestation of sensuality can be ''iki''. Etymologically, iki has a root that means pure and unadulterated. However, it also carries a connotation of having an appetite for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.mitsubishielectric.com/tasteofjapan/imprints/iki/index01_b.html |title=Taste of Japan |accessdate=2007-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430105206/http://global.mitsubishielectric.com/tasteofjapan/imprints/iki/index01_b.html |archivedate=2007-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jo-ha-kyū ==
{{main|Jo-ha-kyū}}
Jo-ha-kyū (序破急) is a concept of modulation and movement applied in a wide variety of traditional Japanese arts. Roughly translated to "beginning, break, rapid", it implies a tempo that begins slowly, accelerates, and then ends swiftly. This concept is applied to elements of the Japanese tea ceremony, to kendō, to the traditional theatre, to [[Gagaku]], and to the traditional collaborative linked verse forms renga and renku (haikai no renga).&lt;ref&gt;Zeami. "Teachings on Style and the Flower (''[[Fūshikaden]]'')." from [[J. Thomas Rimer|Rimer]] &amp; Yamazaki. ''On the Art of the Nō Drama''. p20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yūgen==
[[File:hokusai-fuji-koryuu.png|thumb|upright|130px|''The Dragon of Smoke Escaping from Mt Fuji'', [[Hokusai]]]]
{{nihongo|Yūgen|幽玄|}} is an important concept in traditional Japanese aesthetics. The exact translation of the word depends on the context. In the Chinese philosophical texts the term was taken from, yūgen meant "dim", "deep" or "mysterious". In the criticism of Japanese [[Waka (poetry)|waka]] poetry, it was used to describe the subtle profundity of things that are only vaguely suggested by the poems, and was also the name of a style of poetry (one of the ten orthodox styles delineated by [[Fujiwara no Teika]] in his treatises).

Yūgen suggests that which is beyond what can be said, but it is not an allusion to another world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/1139/1/CEAS.1971.n10.pdf | title = Zeami and the Transition of the Concept of Yūgen | accessdate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is about this world, this experience. All of these are portals to yūgen:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"To watch the sun sink behind a flower clad hill.
To wander on in a huge forest without thought of return.
To stand upon the shore and gaze after a boat that disappears behind distant islands.
To contemplate the flight of wild geese seen and lost among the clouds.
And, subtle shadows of bamboo on bamboo." [[Zeami Motokiyo]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zeami was the originator of the dramatic art form [[Noh theatre]] and wrote the classic book on dramatic theory (Kadensho). He uses images of nature as a constant metaphor. For example, "snow in a silver bowl" represents "the Flower of Tranquility". Yūgen is said to mean "a profound, mysterious sense of the beauty of the universe&amp;nbsp;... and the sad beauty of human suffering".&lt;ref&gt;(Ortolani, 325). Ortolani, Benito. The Japanese Theatre. Princeton University Press: Princeton, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to refer to Zeami's interpretation of "refined elegance" in the performance of Noh.&lt;ref name="Yamazaki"&gt;{{cite book

==Geidō==
[[File:Hasegawa Tohaku - Pine Trees (Shōrin-zu byōbu) - right hand screen.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Right panel of the {{nihongo|''Pine Trees screen''|[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]|松林図 屏風}} by [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], c.1595]]

{{nihongo|Geidō|芸道|}} refers to the various traditional Japanese arts disciplines: {{nihongo|[[Noh]]|能|}} (theater), {{nihongo|''kadō''|華道|}} ([[Japanese flower arrangement]]), {{nihongo|''shodō''|書道|}} ([[Japanese calligraphy]]), {{nihongo|''Sadō''|茶道|}} ([[Japanese tea ceremony]]), and {{nihongo|''yakimono''|焼物|}} ([[Japanese pottery]]). All of these disciplines carry an ethical and aesthetic connotation and teach an appreciation of the process of creation.&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; To introduce discipline into their training, Japanese warriors followed the example of the arts that systematized practice through prescribed forms called [[kata]] - think of the tea ceremony. Training in combat techniques incorporated the way of the arts (Geidō), practice in the arts themselves, and instilling aesthetic concepts (for example, yugen) and the philosophy of arts (geido ron). This led to combat techniques  becoming known as the martial arts (even today, David Lowry shows, in the 'Sword and Brush: the spirit of the martial arts', the affinity of the martial arts with the other arts). All of these arts are a form of tacit communication and we can, and do, respond to them by appreciation of this [[tacit]] dimension.

== Ensō ==
{{main|Ensō}} 
[[File:enso.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ensō by [[Kanjuro Shibata XX]]&lt;br /&gt;''Enso ca. 2000'']]
Ensō (円相) is a Japanese word meaning "circle". It symbolizes the Absolute, enlightenment, strength, elegance, the Universe, and the void; it also may be taken to symbolize the Japanese aesthetic itself.  Zen Buddhist calligraphists may "believe that the character of the artist is fully exposed in how she or he draws an ensō. Only a person who is mentally and spiritually complete can draw a true ensō. Some artists will practice drawing an ensō daily, as a kind of spiritual exercise."{{attribution needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Seo, Audrey Yoshiko; Addiss (1998).

==Aesthetics and Japan's cultural identities==
Because of its nature, Japanese aesthetics has a wider relevance than is usually accorded to aesthetics in the West. In her pathmaking book,&lt;ref name="Ikegami"&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Ikegami
 | first = Eiko
 | year = 2005

 | isbn = 0-521-60115-0 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eiko Ikegami reveals a complex history of social life in which aesthetic ideals become central to Japan's cultural identities. She shows how networks in the performing arts, the tea ceremony, and poetry shaped tacit cultural practices and how politeness and politics are inseparable. She contends that what in Western cultures are normally scattered, like art and politics, have been, and are, distinctly integrated in Japan.

After the introduction of Western notions in Japan, Wabi Sabi aesthetics ideals have been re-examined with Western values, by both Japanese and non-Japanese. Therefore, recent interpretations of the aesthetics ideals inevitably reflect [[Judeo-Christian]] perspectives and Western philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mongabay.com/reference/country_studies/japan/SOCIETY.html | title=Japan - the society| accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rath, Stephanie Assmann&lt;/ref&gt; see [[kaiseki]] for a refined expression.

==Kawaii==
{{main|Kawaii}}

A modern phenomenon, since the 1970s [[cuteness]] or {{nihongo||可愛い|'''kawaii'''|"cute", "adorable", "loveable"}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has become a prominent aesthetic of [[Japanese popular culture]], [[entertainment]], [[Japanese street fashion|clothing]], [[Japanese cuisine|food]], [[designer toys|toys]], personal [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], [[behavior]], and mannerisms.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Lee, "[http://uniorb.com/ATREND/Japanwatch/cute.htm Inside Look at Japanese Cute Culture]" (September 1, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a cultural phenomenon, [[cuteness]] is increasingly accepted in [[Japan]] as a part of [[Japanese culture]] and national identity. Tomoyuki Sugiyama, author of "[[Cool (aesthetic)|Cool]] Japan", believes that "cuteness" is rooted in Japan's harmony-loving culture, and Nobuyoshi Kurita, a sociology professor at [[Musashi University]] in [[Tokyo]], has stated that "cute" is a "magic term" that encompasses everything that's acceptable and desirable in Japan.&lt;ref name=ap2006&gt;Quotes and paraphrases from: {{cite news|title=Cuteness a hot-selling commodity in Japan|author=Yuri Kageyama|date=June 14, 2006|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/14/AR2006061401122.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''job demands-resources model''' or '''JD-R model''' is an [[occupational stress]] model that suggests strain is a response to imbalance between demands on the individual and the resources he or she has to deal with those demands.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Bakker, A.B., &amp; Demerouti, E. (2007). The Job Demands-Resources model: State of the art. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 22, 309–328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demerouti, E., Bakker, A.B., Nachreiner, F. and Schaufeli, W.B. (2001a), "The job demands-resources model of burnout", Journal of Applied Psychology, Vol. 86, pp. 499–512.&lt;/ref&gt;

The JD-R was introduced as an alternative to other models of employee well-being, such as the [[Occupational health psychology#Demand-control model|demand-control model]] and the [[Occupational health psychology#Effort-reward imbalance model|effort-reward imbalance model]]. The authors of the JD-R model argue that these models "have been restricted to a given and limited set of predictor variables that may not be relevant for all job positions" (p.&amp;nbsp;309)&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Therefore, the JD-R incorporates a wide range of working conditions into the analyses of organizations and employees. Furthermore, instead of focusing solely on negative outcome variables (e.g., burnout, ill health, and repetitive strain) the JD-R model includes both negative and positive indicators and outcomes of employee well-being.

== Basic assumptions ==
The JD-R model can be summarized with a short list of assumptions/premises:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E., De Boer, E. and Schaufeli, W.B. (2003b), "Job demands and job resources as predictors of absence duration and frequency", Journal of Vocational Behavior, Vol. 62, pp. 341–56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E., Taris, T., Schaufeli, W.B. and Schreurs, P. (2003c), "A multi-group analysis of the Job Demands-Resources model in four home care organizations", International Journal of Stress Management, Vol. 10, pp. 16–38&lt;/ref&gt;

* Whereas every occupation may have its own specific risk factors associated with job stress, these factors can be classified in two general categories: job demands and job resources.
** '''Job demands''': physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job, that require sustained physical and/or psychological effort or skills. Therefore, they are associated with certain physiological and/or psychological costs. Examples are, work pressure, emotional demands.
** '''Job resources:''' physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that are either or: functional in achieving work goals; reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological cost; stimulate personal growth, learning, and development. Examples are, career opportunities, supervisor coaching, role-clarity, and autonomy.
*** '''Workplace Resources vs. Personal Resources:''' The authors of the JD-R make a distinction between workplace resources and personal reources
* Two different underlying psychological processes play a role in the development of job strain and motivation.&lt;ref name="Huang 562–569"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Jie|last2=Wang|first2=Yansong|last3=You|first3=Xuqun|date=2016-12-01|title=The Job Demands-Resources Model and Job Burnout: The Mediating Role of Personal Resources|journal=Current Psychology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=562–569|doi=10.1007/s12144-015-9321-2|issn=1046-1310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first are physical and social resources available in the workplace setting. The latter, personal resources, are those the employee brings with them. These consist of specific personality traits: self-efficacy and optimism.&lt;ref name="Huang 562–569"/&gt; Both types of resources are powerful mediators of employee well-being (e.g. engagement).&lt;ref name="Huang 562–569"/&gt;
* '''Outcomes of Continued Job Strain'''
** Health impairment process: through this process, poorly designed jobs or chronic job demands exhaust employees' mental and physical resources. In turn, this might lead to the depletion of energy and to health problems.
* '''Outcomes of Abundant Job and Personal Resources'''
** Motivational process: through this process, job resources exert their motivating potential and lead to high work engagement, low cynicism, and excellent performance. Job resources may play either an intrinsic or an extrinsic motivational role.
* The interaction between job demands and job resources is important for the development of job strain and motivation as well. According to the JD-R model, job resources may buffer the effect of job demands on job strain, including burnout.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Which specific job resources buffer the effect of different job demands, depends on the particular work environment. Thus, different types of job demands and job resources may interact in predicting job strain. Good examples of job resources that have the potential of buffering job demands are performance feedback and social support (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;Haines, V.A., Hurlbert, J.S. and Zimmer, C. (1991), "Occupational stress, social support, and the buffer hypothesis", Work and Occupations, Vol. 18, pp. 212–35.&lt;/ref&gt;).
* Job resources particularly influence motivation or work engagement when job demands are high. This assumption is based on the premises of the conservation of resources (COR) theory.&lt;ref&gt;Hobfoll, S.E. (2001), "The influence of culture, community, and the nested-self in the stress process: advancing conservation of resources theory", Applied Psychology: An International Review, Vol. 50, pp. 337–70&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, people are motivated to obtain, retain and protect their resources, because they are valuable. Hobfoll (&lt;ref&gt;Hobfoll, S.E. (2002), "Social and psychological resources and adaptation", Review of General Psychology, Vol. 6, pp. 307–24.&lt;/ref&gt;) argues that resource gain acquires its saliency in the context of resource loss. This implies that job resources gain their motivational potential particularly when employees are confronted with high job demands. For example, when employees are faced with high emotional demands, the social support of colleagues might become more visible and more instrumental.

== Evidence ==

*Evidence for the dual process: a number of studies have supported the dual pathways to employee well being proposed by the JD-R model. It has been shown that the model can predict important organizational outcomes (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E. and Schaufeli, W.B. (2003a), "Dual processes at work in a call centre: an application of the Job Demands-Resources model", European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, Vol. 12, pp. 393–417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hakanen, J.J., Bakker, A.B. and Schaufeli, W.B. (2006), "Burnout and work engagement among teachers", Journal of School Psychology, Vol. 43, pp. 495–513&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Taken together, research findings support the JD-R model's claim that job demands and job resources initiate two different psychological processes, which eventually affect important organizational outcomes (see also,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaufeli, W.B. and Bakker, A.B. (2004), "Job demands, job resources, and their relationship with burnout and engagement: a multi-sample study", Journal of Organizational Behavior, Vol. 25, pp. 293–315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaufeli, W.B., Bakker, A.B., &amp; Van Rhenen, W. (2009). How changes in job demands and resources predict burnout, work engagement, and sickness absenteeism. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 30, 893–917&lt;/ref&gt;). When both job demands and resources are high, high strain and motivation is to be expected. When both are low, absence of strain and motivation is to be expected. Consequently, the high demands-low resources condition should result in high strain and low motivation while the low demands-high resources condition should have as a consequence low strain and high motivation.
*Evidence for the buffer effect of job resources: some support has been obtained for the proposed interaction between job demands and job resources in their relationship with employee well being (see,&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E. and Euwema, M.C. (2005), "Job resources buffer the effect of job demands on burnout", Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, Vol. 10, pp. 170–80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xanthopoulou, D., Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E. and Schaufeli, W.B. (2006), "The role of personal resources in the job demands-resources model", manuscript submitted for publication.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, most published studies on the model did either not examine or not report such interactions, whereas the practical relevance of this interaction – if present – is usually small. In a large-scale study, it was found that this interaction accounted for on average only 0.5% of the differences among workers in task enjoyment and work commitment.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, A.B., Van Veldhoven, M. &amp; Xanthopoulou, D. (2010), "Beyond the Demand-Control model: Thriving on high job demands and resources", Journal of Personnel Psychology, Vol. 9, pp. 3–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Evidence for the salience of job resources in the context of high job demands: one previous study outside the framework of the JD-R model has supported the hypothesis that resources gain their salience in the context of high demands (see.&lt;ref&gt;Billings, D.W., Folkman, S., Acree, M. and Moskowitz, J.T. (2000), "Coping and physical health during care-giving: the roles of positive and negative affect", Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 79, pp. 131–42.&lt;/ref&gt;) Studies using the JD-R model have shown that job resources particularly affect work engagement when job demands are high (see &lt;ref&gt;Hakanen, J.J., Bakker, A.B. and Demerouti, E. (2005), "How dentists cope with their job demands and stay engaged: the moderating role of job resources", European Journal of Oral Sciences, Vol. 113, pp. 479–87.&lt;/ref&gt;); and &lt;ref&gt;Bakker, A.B., Hakanen, J.J., Demerouti, E., &amp; Xanthopoulou, D. (2007). Job resources boost work engagement, particularly when job demands are high. Journal of Educational Psychology, 99, 274–284.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Practical implications ==
The JD-R model assumes that whereas every occupation may have its own specific working characteristics, these characteristics can be classified in two general categories (i.e. job demands and job resources), thus constituting an overarching model that may be applied to various occupational settings, irrespective of the particular demands and resources involved. The central assumption of the JD-R model is that job strain develops – irrespective of the type of job or occupation – when (certain) job demands are high and when (certain) job resources are limited. In contrast, work engagement is most likely when job resources are high (also in the face of high job demands). This implies that the JD-R model can be used as a tool for human resource management.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Continuing Research ==
The most recent article written by the authors of the original JD-R paper proposes that the interactions of demands and resources are nuanced and not clearly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakker|first=Arnold|date=10 October 2016|title=Job Demands–Resources Theory: Taking Stock and Looking Forward|url=http://ezproxy.neu.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy.neu.edu/docview/1826808940?accountid=12826|journal=Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here Bakker and Demerouti suggest that demands may sometimes actually have a positive influence on the employee, by providing a challenge to be overcome rather than an insurmountable obstacle. In this same article, the authors describe a cumulative effect of demands and resources in their suggestion of gain and loss spirals. They conclude that these issues and that of workplace aggression may all be part of the JD-R framework.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2396">A '''Jones diagram''' is a type of [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian graph]] developed by [[Loyd A. Jones]] in the 1940s, where each axis represents a different [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. In a Jones diagram opposite directions of an axis represent different quantities, unlike in a Cartesian graph where they represent positive or negative [[sign (mathematics)|signs]] of the same quantity. The Jones diagram therefore represents four variables. Each quadrant shares the vertical axis with its horizontal neighbor, and the horizontal axis with the vertical neighbor. For example, the top left quadrant shares its vertical axis with the top right quadrant, and the horizontal axis with the bottom left quadrant. The overall system response is in [[quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]] I; the variables that contribute to it are in quadrants II through IV.

A common application of Jones diagrams is in [[photography]], specifically in displaying sensitivity to light with what are also called "[[tone reproduction]] diagrams". These diagrams are used in the design of photographic systems ([[photographic film|film]], [[photographic paper|paper]], etc.) to determine the relationship between the light a viewer would see at the time a photo was taken to the light that a viewer would see looking at the finished photograph.

The Jones diagram concept can be used for variables that depend successively on each other. Jones's original diagram used eleven quadrants{{how|date=May 2013}} to show all the elements of his photographic system.

'''Karma''' (Sanskrit, also ''karman'', Pāli: ''kamma'') is a Sanskrit term that literally means "action" or "doing". In the [[Buddhist]] tradition, ''karma'' refers to action driven by intention (''[[cetanā]]'') which leads to future consequences. Those intentions are considered to be the determining factor in the kind of rebirth in ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]]'', the cycle of rebirth.

==Etymology==
''Karma'' (Sanskrit, also ''karman'', Pāli: ''kamma'', Tib. ''las''{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|1994|p=101}}) is a Sanskrit term that literally means "action" or "doing". The word ''karma'' derives from the verbal root ''kṛ'', which means "do, make, perform, accomplish."{{sfn|Chapple|1986|p=2}}

''Karmaphala'' (Tib. ''rgyu 'bras''{{sfn|Lichter|Epstein|1983|p=232}}{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|1994|p=101}}{{refn|group=note|In common Tibetan common speech, the term ''las'', "karma", is often used to denote the entire process of karma-and-fruit.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|1994|p=101}}}}) is the [[Phala|"fruit"]],{{sfn|Kalupahanna|1992|p=166}}{{sfn|Keown|2000|p=36-37}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=19}} "effect"{{sfn|Kopf|2001|p=141}} or "result"{{sfn|Kragh|2001|p=11}} of ''karma''. A similar term is ''karmavipaka'', the [[Vipāka|"maturation"]]{{sfn|Keown|2000|p=810-813}} or "cooking"{{sfn|Klostermaier|1986|p=93}} of ''karma'':
{{quote|The remote effects of karmic choices are referred to as the 'maturation' (vipāka) or 'fruit' (phala) of the karmic act."{{sfn|Keown|2000|p=36-37}}}}

The metaphor is derived from agriculture:{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=19}}{{sfn|Keown|2000|p=37}}
{{quote|One sows a seed, there is a time lag during which some mysterious invisible process takes place, and then the plant pops up and can be harvested.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=19}}}}

==Buddhist understanding of ''karma''==
[[Image:Tibetan chakra.jpg|thumb|150px|Tibetan ''Bhavacakra'' or "Wheel of Life" in [[Sera monastery|Sera]], [[Lhasa]].]]

''Karma'' and ''karmaphala'' are fundamental concepts in Buddhism.{{sfn|Kragh|2006|p=11}}{{sfn|Lamotte|1987|p=15}} The concepts of ''karma'' and ''karmaphala'' explain how our intentional actions keep us tied to rebirth in ''samsara'', whereas the Buddhist path, as exemplified in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], shows us the way out of ''samsara''.{{sfn|Bucknell|1984}}

===Rebirth===
[[Rebirth (Buddhism)|Rebirth]],{{refn|group=note|Sanskrit, punaraāvŗtti, punarutpatti, punarjanman, or punarjīlvātu}}, is a common belief in all Buddhist traditions. It says that birth and death in the [[six realms]] occur in [[Samsara|successive cycles]] driven by ignorance (''[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]]''), desire (''[[Taṇhā|trsnā]]''), and hatred (''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|dvesa]]''). The cycle of rebirth is called ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsāra]]''. It is a beginningless and ever-ongoing process.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=712}} Liberation from samsāra can be attained by following the [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|Buddhist Path]]. This path leads to ''vidyā'', and the stilling of ''trsnā'' and ''dvesa''. Hereby the ongoing process of rebirth is stopped.

===Karma===
The cycle of rebirth is determined by ''karma'',{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=712}} literally "action".{{refn|group=note|In early Buddhism rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance,{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi}}{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=416}} and the theory of ''karma'' may have been of minor importance in early Buddhist soteriology.{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}}{{sfn|Schmithausen|1986|p=206-207}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=13}}}} In the [[Buddhist]] tradition, ''karma'' refers to actions driven by ''intention'' (''[[cetanā]]''),{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998}}{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=119-120}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=19}}&lt;!---START OF NOTE---&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Rupert Gethin: "[Karma is] a being’s intentional 'actions' of body, speech, and mind—whatever is done, said, or even just thought with definite intention or volition";{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=119}} "[a]t root karma or 'action' is considered a mental act or intention; it is an aspect of our mental life: 'It is "intention" that I call karma; having formed the intention, one performs acts (karma) by body, speech and mind.'"{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=120}}}}&lt;!---END OF NOTE---&gt; a deed done deliberately through body, speech or mind, which leads to future consequences.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=55}} The ''Nibbedhika Sutta'', [[Anguttara Nikaya]] 6.63:{{quote|Intention (''[[cetana]]'') I tell you, is kamma. Intending, one does kamma by way of body, speech, &amp; intellect.&lt;ref group=web&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, trans. (1997). [https://web.archive.org/web/20140813042845/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an06/an06.063.than.html Nibbedhika Sutta: Penetrative], AN 6.63, PTS: A iii 410&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|There are many different translation of the above quote into English. For example, Peter Harvey translates the quote as follows: "It is will (''cetana''), O monks, that I call karma; having willed, one acts through body, speech, and mind." (A.III.415).{{sfn|Harvey|1990|pp=39-40}}}}}}

According to Peter Harvey,
{{quote|It is the psychological impulse behind an action that is 'karma', that which sets going a chain of causes culminating in karmic fruit. Actions, then, must be intentional if they are to generate karmic fruits.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|pp=39-40}}}}

And according to Gombrich,
{{quote|The Buddha defined karma as intention; whether the intention manifested itself in physical, vocal or mental form, it was the intention alone which had a moral character: good, bad or neutral [...] The focus of interest shifted from physical action, involving people and objects in the real world, to psychological process.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=51}}}}

According to Gombrich, this was a great innovation, which overturns brahmanical, caste-bound ethics. It's a rejection of caste-bound differences, giving the same possibility to reach liberation to all people, not just Brahmanins:{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=65-66}}
{{quote|Not by birth is one a brahmin or an outcaste, but by deeds (''kamma'').{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=68}}{{refn|group=note|Sutta-nipata verse 1366}}}}

How this emphasis on intention was to be interpreted became a matter of debate in and between the various Buddhist schools.{{sfn|Gombrich|1007|p=54-55}}{{refn|group=note|For example, the [[Sautrāntika]], a subsect of the [[Sarvastivada]], the most important of the [[early Buddhist schools]],{{sfn|Gombrich|1007|p=54}} regarded the intention to be the stimulus for ''karma'', action which leads to consequences.{{sfn|Gombrich|1007|p=54-55}} The [[Vaibhāṣika]], the other sub-sect of the Sarvastivada, separated the intention from the act, regarding intention as karma proper.{{sfn|Gombrich|1007|p=55}}{{refn|group=quote|Gombrich: "Bodily and verbal action manifested one’s intention to others and therefore were called vijñapti, ‘information’."{{sfn|Gombrich|1007|p=55}}}}}}

===Karmaphala===
Karma leads to future consequences, ''karma-phala'', "fruit of action".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=166}} Any given action may cause all sorts of results, but the ''karmic results'' are only those results which are a consequence of both the moral quality of the action, and of the intention behind the action.{{sfn|Reichenbach|1988|p=399}}{{refn|group=note|In the [[Abhidharma]] they are referred to by specific names for the sake of clarity, karmic causes being the "cause of results" (S. ''vipāka-hetu'') and the karmic results being the "resultant fruit" (S. ''vipāka-phala'').{{sfn|Waldron|2003|p=61}}}} According to Reichenbach,
{{quote|[T]he consequences envisioned by the law of karma encompass more (as well as less) than the observed natural or physical results which follow upon the performance of an action.{{sfn|Reichenbach|1990|p=1}}}}

The "law of karma" applies
{{quote|...specifically to the moral sphere [It is] not concerned with the ''general'' relation between actions and their consequences, but rather with the moral quality of actions and their consequences, such as the pain and pleasure and good or bad experiences for the doer of the act.{{sfn|Reichenbach|1990|p=1}}}}

Good moral actions lead to wholesome rebirths, and bad moral actions lead to unwholesome rebirths.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=712}}&lt;!---START OF NOTE---&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Karma and samsara:
* Peter Harvey: "The movement of beings between rebirths is not a haphazard process but is ordered and governed by the law of karma, the principle that beings are reborn according to the nature and quality of their past actions; they are 'heir' to their actions (M.III.123)."{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=39}}
* Damien Keown: "In the cosmology [of the realms of existence], karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. Individuals are thus the sole authors of their good and bad fortune."{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Location 794-797}}
* Alexander Berzin: "In short, the external and internal cycles of time delineate samsara – uncontrollably recurring rebirth, fraught with problems and difficulties. These cycles are driven by impulses of energy, known in the Kalachakra system as "winds of karma." Karma is a force intimately connected with mind and arises due to confusion about reality."&lt;ref group=web name=berzin1&gt;Alexander Berzin, [http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/vajrayana/kalachakra-advanced/overview-of-kalachakra ''Overview of Kalachakra'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paul Williams: "All rebirth is due to karman and is impermanent. Short of attaining enlightenment, in each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with the completely impersonal causal nature of one's own karman. The endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath, is samsara." {{sfn|Williams|2002|p=74}}}}&lt;!---END OF NOTE---&gt;&lt;!---START OF NOTE---&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Wholesome and unwholesome actions:
* Ringu Tulku: "We create [karmic results] in three different ways, through actions that are positive, negative, or neutral. When we feel kindness and love and with this attitude do good things, which are beneficial to both ourselves and others, this is positive action. When we commit harmful deeds out of equally harmful intentions, this is negative action. Finally, when our motivation is indifferent and our deeds are neither harmful or beneficial, this is neutral action. The results we experience will accord with the quality of our actions."{{sfn|Ringu Tulku|2005|p=31}}
* Gethin: [R]ebirth in the lower realms is considered to be the result of relatively unwholesome (akuśala/akusala), or bad (pāpa) karma, while rebirth in the higher realms the result of relatively wholesome (kuśala/kusala), or good (puṇya/puñña) karma.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=119}}}}&lt;!---END OF NOTE---&gt; The main factor is how they contribute to the well-being of others in a positive or negative sense.{{sfn|vetter|1988|p=84}} Especially ''dāna'', giving to the buddhist order, became an increasingly important source of positive ''karma''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=85}}

How these intentional actions lead to rebirth, and how the idea of rebirth is to be reconciled with the doctrines of [[Anicca|impermanence]] and [[Anatta|no-self]],{{sfn|Dargyay|1986|p=170}}{{refn|group=quote|Dargray: "When [the Buddhist] understanding of karma is correlated to the Buddhist doctrine of universal impermanence and No-Self, a serious problem arises as to where this trace is stored and what the trace left is. The problem is aggravated when the trace remains latent over a long period, perhaps over a period of many existences. The crucial problem presented to all schools of Buddhist philosophy was where the trace is stored and how it can remain in the ever-changing stream of phenomena which build up the individual and what the nature of this trace is."{{sfn|Dargyay|1986|p=170}}}} is a matter of philosophical inquiry in the Buddhist traditions, for which several solutions have been proposed.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=712}} In early Buddhism no explicit theory of rebirth and karma is worked out,{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}} and "the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology."{{sfn|Schmithausen|1986|p=206-207}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=13}} In early Buddhism, rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi}}{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=416}}

* Peter Harvey: "Karma is often likened to a seed, and the two words for karmic result, ''[[vipāka|vipaka]]'' and ''[[phala]]'', respectively mean 'ripening' and 'fruit'.

The Buddha's teaching of karma is not strictly deterministic, but incorporated circumstantial factors, unlike that of the Jains.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1975|p=127}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=20}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}}{{refn|group=quote|[[Thanissaro Bhikkhu|Bhikkhu Thanissaro]]: "Unlike the theory of [[causality|linear causality]] — which led the [[Vedas|Vedists]] and [[Jainism|Jains]] to see the relationship between an act and its result as predictable and tit-for-tat — the principle of ''[[Idappaccayatā|this/that conditionality]]'' makes that relationship inherently complex. The results of kamma&lt;ref group=subnote&gt;Bhikkhu Thanissaro uses the Pali spelling for karma.&lt;/ref&gt; experienced at any one point in time come not only from past kamma, but also from present kamma. This means that, although there are general patterns relating habitual acts to corresponding results [MN 135], there is no set one-for-one, tit-for-tat, relationship between a particular action and its results. Instead, the results are determined by the context of the act, both in terms of actions that preceded or followed it [MN 136] and in terms one’s state of mind at the time of acting or experiencing the result [AN 3:99]. [...] The feedback loops inherent in ''this/that conditionality'' mean that the working out of any particular cause-effect relationship can be very complex indeed. This explains why the Buddha says in AN 4:77 that the results of kamma are [[Acinteyya|imponderable]]. Only a person who has developed the mental range of a Buddha—another imponderable itself—would be able to trace the intricacies of the kammic network. The basic premise of kamma is simple—that skillful intentions lead to favorable results, and unskillful ones to unfavorable results—but the process by which those results work themselves out is so intricate that it cannot be fully mapped. We can compare this with the [[Mandelbrot set]], a mathematical set generated by a simple equation, but whose graph is so complex that it will probably never be completely explored."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}}}} It is not a rigid and mechanical process, but a flexible, fluid and dynamic process,{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=42}} and not all present conditions can be ascribed to karma.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=20}}{{refn|See also  [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn36/sn36.021.than.html Sivaka Sutta] (Samyutta Nikaya 36.21), in which the Buddha mentions eight different possible causes from which feelings can arise.

* Peter Harvey states:{{sfn|Harvey|1990|pp=39-40}} - "The law of karma is seen as a natural law inherent in the nature of things, like the law of physics.

* Dzongsar Khyentse: "[Karma] is usually understood as a sort of moralistic system of retribution—"bad" karma and "good" karma. But karma is simply a law of cause and effect, not to be confused with morality or ethics. No one, including Buddha, set the fundamental bar for what is negative and what is positive. Any motivation and action that steer us away from such truths as "all compounded things are impermanent" can result in negative consequences, or bad karma. And any action that brings us closer to understanding such truths as "all emotions are pain" can result in positive consequences, or good karma.

This is called karma. It has nothing to do with judgement; there is no one keeping track of our karma and sending us up above or down below. Karma is simply the ''wholeness'' of a cause, or first action, and its effect, or fruition, which then becomes another cause. In fact, one karmic cause can have many fruitions, all of which can cause thousands more creations. Just as a handful of seed can ripen into a full field of grain, a small amount of karma can generate limitless effects."{{sfn|Khandro Rinpoche|2003|p=95}}
* Walpola Rahula states: "The theory of karma should not be confused with so-called 'moral justice’ or 'reward and punishment’.

The term 'justice’ is ambiguous and dangerous, and in its name more harm than good is done to humanity. The theory of karma is the theory of cause and effect, of action and reaction; it is a natural law, which has nothing to do with the idea of justice or reward and punishment. Every volitional action produces its effects or results. If a good action produces good effects and a bad action bad effects, it is not justice, or reward, or punishment meted out by anybody or any power sitting in judgment on your action, but this is in virtue of its own nature, its own law."{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 860-866}}}} Certain experiences in life are the results of previous actions, but our responses to those experiences are not predetermined, although they bear their own fruit in the future.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=27}}{{refn|group=quote|Rupert Gethin: "From the Buddhist perspective certain experiences in life are indeed the results of previous actions; but our responses to those experiences, whether wished for or unwished for, are not predetermined but represent new actions which in time bear their own fruit in the future.

According to Gombrich, this sutra may have been a warning against the tendency, "probably from the Buddha's day until now", to understand the doctrine of ''karma'' "backwards", to explain unfavorable conditions in this life when no other explanations are available.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=20-22}} Gaining a better rebirth may have been,{{sfn|Vetter|1987|p=50-52}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=80-82}} and still is, the central goal for many people.{{sfn|Gombrich|1991}}{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=125}} The adoption, by laity, of Buddhist beliefs and practices is seen as a good thing, which brings [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] and good rebirth,{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=120}} but does not result in Nirvana,{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=120}} and liberation from ''samsāra'', the ultimate goal of the Buddha.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=79}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=20-22}}

According to the Buddhist tradition, the Buddha gained full and complete insight into the workings of karma at the time of his enlightenment.{{sfn|Goldstein|2011|p=74}}{{refn|group=note|The understanding of rebirth, and the reappearance in accordance with one's deeds, are the first two knowledges that the Buddha is said to have acquired at his enlightenment, as described in Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}}} According to Bronkhorst, these knowledges are later additions to the story,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} just like the notion of "liberating insight" itself.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{Refn|group=note|Bronkhorst is following Schmithausen, who, in his often-cited article ''On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of 'Liberating Insight' and 'Enlightenment' in Early Buddhism'', notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} It calls in question the reliability of these accounts, and the relation between ''dhyana'' and insight, which is a core problem in the study of early Buddhism.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} According to Tilmann Vetter, originally only the practice of dhyana, and the resulting calming of the mind may have constituted the liberating practice of the Buddha.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}}}

In AN 5.292, the Buddha asserted that it is not possible to avoid experiencing the result of a karmic deed once it's been committed.{{sfn|McDermott|1980|p=175}}

In the [[Anguttara Nikaya]], it is stated that karmic results are experienced either in this life (P. ''diṭṭadhammika'') or in a future lives (P. ''samparāyika'').{{sfn|McDermott|1984|p=21}} The former may involve a readily observable connection between action and karmic consequence, such as when a thief is captured and tortured by the authorities,{{sfn|McDermott|1984|p=21}} but the connection need not necessarily be that obvious and in fact usually is not observable.

The Sammyutta Nikaya makes a basic distinction between past karma (P. ''purānakamma'') which has already been incurred, and karma being created in the present (P. ''navakamma'').&lt;ref&gt;SN.4.132&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in the present one both creates new karma (P. ''navakamma'') and encounters the result of past karma (P. ''kammavipāka''). Karma in the early canon is also threefold: Mental action (S. ''manaḥkarman''), bodily action (S. ''kāyakarman'') and vocal action (S. ''vākkarman'').{{sfn|Lamotte|2001|p=18}}

==Within Buddhist traditions==
{{See also|Development of Karma in Buddhism}}
Various Buddhist philosophical schools developed within Buddhism, giving various interpretations regarding more refined points of karma. A major problem is the relation between the doctrine of no-self, and the "storage" of the traces of one's deeds,{{sfn|Dargyay|1986|p=170}} for which various solutions have been offered.

===Early Indian Buddhism===

====Origins====
The concept of ''karma'' originated in the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], where it was related to the performance of rituals{{sfn|Samuel|2010}} or the investment in good deeds{{sfn|vetter|1988|p=78}} to ensure the entrance to heaven after death,{{sfn|Samuel|2010}}{{sfn|vetter|1988|p=78}} while other persons go to the underworld.{{sfn|vetter|1988|p=78}}

====Pre-sectarian Buddhism====
{{Main article|Pre-sectarian Buddhism}}
The concept of karma may have been of minor importance in early Buddhism.{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}}{{sfn|Schmithausen|1986}} Schmithausen has questioned whether karma already played a role in the theory of rebirth of earliest Buddhism,{{sfn|Schmithausen|1986}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=13}} noting that "the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology."{{sfn|Schmithausen|1986|p=206-207}} Langer notes that originally karma may have been only one of several concepts connected with rebirth.{{sfn|Langer|2007|p=26}}{{refn|group=note|Langer: "When I was searching the Sanskrit texts for material, two things become apparent: first, rebirth, central as it is to Indian philosophy, is not found in the earliest texts; and second, rebirth and karman do not appear to be linked together from the beginning. In fact, originally karman seems to have been only one of several concepts connected with rebirth, but in the course of time it proved to be more popular than others. One of these ‘other concepts’ linked with rebirth is a curious notion of ‘rebirth according to one’s wish’, sometimes referred to in the texts as kAmacAra. The wish — variously referred to in the texts as kAma or kratu — is directed to a particular form or place of rebirth and can be spontaneous (at the time of death) or cultivated for a long time. This understanding seems to have some affinity with the Buddhist notion that a mental effort, a positive state of mind, can bring about a good rebirth."{{sfn|Langer|2007|p=26}}}} Tillman Vetter notes that in early Buddhism rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi}} Buswell too notes that "Early Buddhism does not identify bodily and mental motion, but desire (or thirst, ''trsna''), as the cause of karmic consequences."{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=416}} Matthews notes that "there is no single major systematic exposition" on the subject of karma and "an account has to be put together from the dozens of places where karma is mentioned in the texts,"{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}} which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early Buddhist soteriology.{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}}

According to Vetter, "the Buddha at first sought, and realized, [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism#Ideas and practices|"the deathless"]] (''amata/amrta''{{refn|group=note|Stanislaw Schayer, a Polish scholar, argued in the 1930s that the Nikayas preserve elements of an archaic form of Buddhism which is close to Brahmanical beliefs,{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}{{sfn|Lindtner|1999}}{{sfn|Akizuki|1990|p=25-27}}{{sfn|Ray|1999}} and survived in the Mahayana tradition.{{sfn|Reat|1998|p=xi}}{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=10}} According to Schayer, one of these elements is that Nirvana was conceived as the attainment of immortality, and the gaining of a deathless sphere from which there would be no falling back.{{sfn|Ray|1999|p=374-377}} According to Falk, in the precanonical tradition, there is a threefold division of reality, the third realm being the realm of nirvana, the "amrta sphere," characterized by prajna. This nirvana is an "abode" or "place" which is gained by the enlightened holy man.{{sfn|Ray|1999|p=375}} According to Falk, this scheme is reflected in the precanonical conception of the path to liberation.{{sfn|Ray|p=375}} The nirvanic element, as an "essence" or pure consciousness, is immanent within samsara. The three bodies are concentric realities, which are stripped away or abandoned, leaving only the nirodhakaya of the liberated person.{{sfn|Ray|p=375}} See also Rita Langer (2007), ''Buddhist Rituals of Death and Rebirth: Contemporary Sri Lankan Practice and Its Origins'', p.26-28, on "redeath" (''punarmrtyu'').{{sfn|Langer|2007|p=26-28}}}}), which is concerned with the here and now.{{refn|group=note|Tilmann Vetter, ''Das Erwachen des Buddha'', referenced by Bronkhorst.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=3}}}} Only after this realization did he become acquainted with the doctrine of rebirth."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=3}} Bronkhorst disagrees, and concludes that the Buddha "introduced a concept of karma that differed considerably from the commonly held views of his time."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=16}} According to Bronkhorst, not physical and mental activities as such were seen as responsible for rebirth, but intentions and desire.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=14}}

The doctrine of karma may have been especially important for common people, for whom it was more important to cope with life's immediate demands, such as the problems of pain, injustice, and death. The doctrine of karma met these exigencies, and in time it became an important soteriological aim in its own right.{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=125}}

====Vaibhāṣika-Sarvāstivādin tradition====
{{see also|Vaibhāṣika|Sarvastivada}}

The Vaibhāśika-Sarvāstivāda was widely influential in India and beyond. Their understanding of karma in the Sarvāstivāda became normative for Buddhism in India and other countries.{{sfn|Ryose|1987|p=3}} According to Dennis Hirota,
{{quote|Sarvastivadins argued that there exists a dharma of "possession" (''prapti''), which functions with all karmic acts, so that each act or thought, though immediately passing away, creates the "possession" of that act in the continuum of instants we experience as a person. This possession itself is momentary, but continually reproduces a similar possession in the succeeding instant, even though the original act lies in the past. Through such continual regeneration, the act is "possessed" until the actualization of the result.{{sfn|Hirota|2004|p=5100}}}}

The ''Abhidharmahṛdaya'' by Dharmaśrī was the first systematic exposition of Vaibhāśika-Sarvāstivāda doctrine, and the third chapter, the ''Karma-varga'', deals with the concept of karma systematically.{{sfn|Ryose|1987|pp=3-4}}

Another important exposition, the ''[[Mahavibhasa|Mahāvibhāṣa]]'', gives three definitions of karma: 
# action; karma is here supplanted in the text by the synonyms ''kriya'' or ''karitra'', both of which mean "activity";
# formal vinaya conduct; 
# human action as the agent of various effects; karma as that which links certain actions with certain effects, is the primary concern of the exposition.{{sfn|Ryose|1987|pp=39-40}}

The 4th century philosopher [[Vasubandhu]] compiled the ''[[Abhidharma-kośa]]'', an extensive compendium which elaborated the positions of the  [[Vaibhashika|Vaibhāṣika]]-[[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādin]] school on a wide range of issues raised by the early sutras. Chapter four the Kośa is devoted to a study of karma, and chapters two and five contain formulation as to the mechanism of fruition and retribution.{{sfn|Lamotte|2001|p=18}} This became the main source of understanding of the perspective of early Buddhism for later Mahāyāna  philosophers.{{sfn|Lamotte|2001}}

====Dārṣṭāntika-Sautrāntika====
The Dārṣṭāntika-[[Sautrāntika]] school pioneered the idea of karmic seeds (S. ''bija'') and "the special modification of the psycho-physical series" (S. ''saṃtatipaṇāmaviśeṣa'') to explain the workings of karma.{{sfn|Park|2007|pp=234-236}} According to Dennis Hirota,
{{quote|[T]he Sautrantikas [...] insisted that each act exists only in the present instant and perishes immediately. To explain causation, they taught that with each karmic act a "perfuming" occurs which, though not a dharma or existent factor itself, leaves a residual impression in the succeeding series of mental instants, causing it to undergo a process of subtle evolution eventually leading to the act’s result. Good and bad deeds performed are thus said to leave "seeds" or traces of disposition that will come to fruition.{{sfn|Hirota|2004|p=5100}}}}

===Theravādin tradition===

====Canonical texts====
In the Theravāda Abhidhamma and commentarial traditions, karma is taken up at length. The ''Abhidhamma Sangaha'' of Anuruddhācariya offers a treatment of the topic, with an exhaustive treatment in book five (5.3.7).{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=132}}

The ''[[Kathāvatthu]]'', which discusses a number of controverted points related either directly or indirectly to the notion of kamma."{{sfn|McDermott|1975|p=424}} This involved debate with the [[Pudgalavada|Pudgalavādin]] school, which postulated the provisional existence of the person (S. ''pudgala'', P. ''puggala'') to account for the ripening of karmic effects over time.{{sfn|McDermott|1975|p=424}} The Kathāvatthu also records debate by the Theravādins with the Andhakas (who may have been [[Mahāsāṃghika]]s) regarding whether or not old age and death are the result (''vipāka'') of karma.{{sfn|McDermott|1975|pp=426-427}} The Theravāda maintained that they are not—not, apparently because there is no causal relation between the two, but because they wished to reserve the term ''vipāka'' strictly for mental results--"subjective phenomena arising through the effects of kamma."{{sfn|McDermott|1975|pp=426-427}}

In the canonical Theravāda view of kamma, "the belief that deeds done or ideas seized at the moment of death are particularly significant."{{sfn|McDermott|1980|p=168}}

====Transfer of merit====
{{Main|Transfer of merit}}
The ''[[Milindapañha]]'', a [[Paracanonical texts (Theravada Buddhism)|paracanonical Theravāda text]], offers some interpretations of karma theory at variance with the orthodox position.{{sfn|McDermott|1984|p=110}} In particular, [[Nāgasena]] allows for the possibility of the transfer of merit to humans and one of the four classes of [[preta|petas]], perhaps in deference to folk belief.{{sfn|McDermott|1984|pp=109-111}} Nāgasena makes it clear that demerit cannot be transferred.{{sfn|McDermott|1977|p=463}} One scholar asserts that the sharing of merit "can be linked to the Vedic ''śrāddha'', for it was Buddhist practice not to upset existing traditions when well-established custom was not antithetic to Buddhist teaching."{{sfn|McDermott|1977|p=462}}

The [[Petavatthu]], which is fully canonical, endorses the transfer of merit even more widely, including the possibility of sharing merit with all petas.{{sfn|McDermott|1984|pp=109-111}}

===Mahayana tradition===

====Indian Yogācāra tradition====
In the [[Yogācāra]] philosophical tradition, one of the two principal Mahāyāna schools, the principle of karma was extended considerably. In the Yogācāra formulation, all experience without exception is said to result from the ripening of karma.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=297}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=URZNk9noWJEC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=%22due+to+karma%22+yogacara&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ug8YVFASFC&amp;sig=ASkknejfBRiFHO4RfQaDiAIX0U4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rGFPS7b9OZXU8QbM_u2TCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22due%20to%20karma%22%20yogacara&amp;f=false An Introduction to Buddhist ethics], Harvey&lt;/ref&gt; Karmic seeds (S. ''bija'') are said to be stored in the "storehouse consciousness" (S. ''[[ālayavijñāna]]'') until such time as they ripen into experience. The term ''vāsāna'' ("perfuming") is also used, and Yogācārins debated whether vāsāna and bija were essentially the same, the seeds were the effect of the perfuming, or whether the perfuming simply affected the seeds.{{sfn|Lusthaus|2002|p=194}} The seemingly external world is merely a "by-product" (''adhipati-phala'') of karma. The conditioning of the mind resulting from karma is called ''[[Saṅkhāra|saṃskāra]]''.{{sfn|Lusthaus|2002|p=48}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IeiwsT-XqwQC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=conditioning+buddhism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3J5qEoez8F&amp;sig=kbQ75qvMRURcje0GPsMfS68rdJ4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8xNRS-npJ4mb8AaQnrCZCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=conditioning&amp;f=false ''Buddhist Phenomenology: A philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih lun'' by Dan Lusthaus.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Treatise on Action'' (''Karmasiddhiprakaraṇa''), also by Vasubandhu, treats the subject of karma in detail from the Yogācāra perspective.{{sfn|Lamotte|2001|pp=13,35}} According to scholar Dan Lusthaus,
{{quote|Vasubandhu's ''Viṃśatikā'' (''Twenty Verses'') repeatedly emphasizes in a variety of ways that karma is intersubjective and that the course of each and every stream of consciousness (''vijñāna-santāna'', i.e., the changing individual) is profoundly influenced by its relations with other consciousness streams.{{sfn|Lusthaus|2002|p=48}}}}

According to Bronkhorst, whereas in earlier systems it "was not clear how a series of completely mental events (the deed and its traces) could give rise to non-mental, material effects," with the (purported) idealism of the Yogācāra system this is not an issue.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2000}}

In Mahāyāna traditions, karma is not the sole basis of rebirth. The [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirths]] of [[bodhisattva]]s after the seventh stage (S. ''[[bhūmi]]'') are said to be consciously directed for the benefit of others still trapped in {{IAST|saṃsāra}}.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=130}} Thus, theirs are not uncontrolled rebirths.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=130}}

====Mādhyamaka philosophy====
[[Nāgārjuna]] articulated the difficulty in forming a karma theory in his most prominent work, the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' (Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way):
{{quote|If (the act) lasted till the time of ripening, (the act) would be eternal. If (the act) were terminated, how could the terminated produce a fruit?&lt;ref group=subnote&gt;MMK (XVII.6), cited in Dargyay, 1986, p.170{{sfn|Dargyay|1986|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Mūlamadhyamakavṛtty-Akutobhayā'', also generally attributed to Nāgārjuna,{{sfn|Huntington|1986|p=4}} concludes that it is impossible both for the act to persist somehow and also for it to perish immediately and still have efficacy at a later time.{{refn|group=note|''Mūlamadhyamakavṛtty-Akutobhayā'', sDe dge Tibetan Tripitaka (Tokyo, 1977) pp. 32, 4.5, cited in Dargyay, 1986, p.170.{{sfn|Dargyay|1986|p=170}}}}

====Tibetan Buddhism====
{{Main|Karma in Tibetan Buddhism}}

In Tibetan Buddhism, the teachings on karma belong to the preliminary teachings, that turn the mind towards the Buddhist dharma.{{sfn|Norgay|2014|p=v}}

In the Vajrayana tradition, negative past karma may be "purified" through such practices as meditation on [[Vajrasattva]] because they both are the mind's psychological phenomenon.{{sfn|Kalu Rinpoche|1993|p=204}}{{sfn|Zopa Rinpoche|2004|p=ix}} The performer of the action, after having purified the karma, does not experience the negative results he or she otherwise would have.{{sfn|Thrangu Rinpoche|2012|pp=20-21}} Engaging in the ten negative actions out of selfishness and delusions hurts all involved. Otherwise, loving others, receives love; whereas; people with closed hearts may be prevented from happiness.{{sfn|Zopa Rinpoche|2004|p=ix}} One good thing about karma is that it can be purified through confession, if the thoughts become positive.{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche | 2011| pp=264-265}} Within Guru Yoga seven branch offerings practice, confession is the antidote to aversion.

====East Asian traditions====

=====Zen=====
{{religious text primary|section|reason=You need to confirm the relevance of these quotes by secondary sources, to prove it is not cherry-picking quotes.|date=October 2017}}
[[Dōgen Kigen]] argued in his ''[[Shobogenzo]]'' that karmic latencies are emphatically not empty, going so far as to claim that belief in the emptiness of karma should be characterized as "non-Buddhist," although he also states that the "law of karman has no concrete existence."{{sfn|Dōgen|1975|p=142, 149}}

Zen's most famous [[koan]] about karma is called [[wild fox koan|''Baizhang's Wild Fox'']] (百丈野狐). The story of the koan is about an ancient Zen teacher whose answer to a question presents a wrong view about karma by saying that the person who has a foundation in cultivating the great practice "does not fall into cause and effect." Because of his unskillful answer the teacher reaps the result of living 500 lives as a wild fox. He is then able to appear as a human and ask the same question to Zen teacher Baizhang, who answers, "He is not in the dark about cause and effect." Hearing this answer the old teacher is freed from the life of a wild fox.  The Zen perspective avoids the duality of asserting that an enlightened person is either subject to or free from the law of karma and that the key is not being ignorant about karma.

=====Tendai=====
The Japanese [[Tendai]]/[[Pure Land]] teacher [[Genshin]] taught a series of ten reflections for a dying person that emphasized reflecting on the [[Amida Buddha]] as a means to purify vast amounts of karma.{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=239}}{{relevance inline|date=October 2017}}

=====Nichiren Buddhism=====
Nichiren Buddhism teaches that transformation and change through faith and practice changes adverse karma—negative causes made in the past that result in negative results in the present and future—to positive causes for benefits in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fowler |first= Jeaneane and Merv |year=(2009) |title= Chanting in the Hillsides |publisher= Sussex Academic Press |publication-place= Portland, Oregon |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern interpretations and controversies==

===Social conditioning===
Buddhist modernists often prefer to equate karma with social conditioning, in contradistinction with, as one scholar puts it, "early texts &lt;nowiki&gt;[which]&lt;/nowiki&gt; give us little reason to interpret 'conditioning' as the infusion into the psyche of external social norms, or of awakening as simply transcending all psychological conditioning and social roles. Karmic conditioning drifts semantically toward 'cultural conditioning' under the influence of western discourses that elevate the individual over the social, cultural, and institutional. The traditional import of the karmic conditioning process, however, is primarily ethical and soteriological—actions condition circumstances in this and future lives."{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=198}}

Essentially, this understanding limits the scope of the traditional understanding of karmic effects so that it encompasses only ''saṃskāra''s—habits, dispositions and tendencies—and not external effects, while at the same time expanding the scope to include social conditioning that does not particularly involve volitional action.{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=198}}

===Karma theory and social justice===
Some western commentators and Buddhists have taken exception to aspects of karma theory, and have proposed revisions of various kinds. These proposals fall under the rubric of [[Buddhist modernism]].{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=174}}

The "primary critique" of the Buddhist doctrine of karma is that some feel "karma may be socially and politically disempowering in its cultural effect, that without intending to do this, karma may in fact support social passivity or acquiescence in the face of oppression of various kinds."{{sfn|Wright|2004|p=81}} Dale S. Wright, a scholar specializing in Zen Buddhism, has proposed that the doctrine be reformulated for modern people, "separated from elements of supernatural thinking," so that karma is asserted to condition only personal qualities and dispositions rather than rebirth and external occurrences.{{sfn|Wright|2004|p=89-90}}

Loy argues that the idea of accumulating merit too easily becomes "spiritual materialism," a view echoed by other Buddhist modernists,{{refn|group=note|name="Jones"|Ken Jones,'' The Social Face of Buddhism: An Approach to Political and Social Activism'', Wisdom Publications, 1989, quoted in "A Buddhist Ethic Without Karmic Rebirth?" by Winston L. King ''Journal of Buddhist Ethics'' Volume 1 1994}} and further that karma has been used to rationalize racism, caste, economic oppression, birth handicaps and everything else.{{sfn|Loy|2008|p=57}}

Loy goes on to argue that the view that suffering such as that undergone by [[Holocaust]] victims could be attributed in part to the karmic ripenings of those victims is "fundamentalism, which blames the victims and rationalizes their horrific fate," and that this is "something no longer to be tolerated quietly. It is time for modern Buddhists and modern Buddhism to outgrow it" by revising or discarding the teachings on karma.{{sfn|Loy|2008|p=55}}

Other scholars have argued, however, that the teachings on karma do not encourage judgment and blame, given that the victims were not the same people who committed the acts, but rather were just part of the same [[mindstream]]-continuum with the past actors,{{sfn|Burke|2003|p=32-33}} and that the teachings on karma instead provide "a thoroughly satisfying explanation for suffering and loss" in which believers take comfort.{{sfn|Burke|2003|p=32-33}}

'''Kirill Formanchuk''' is an [[activist]] for [[driving|motorists]]' rights in [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Russia]].  On October 12, 2007, he suffered severe injuries from a beating while in police custody, which has led to increased public and media scrutiny of traffic police in a number of Russian cities.

He was a member of the Committee to Protect the Rights of Motorists, an activist group.  He was previously employed by the Yekaterinburg municipal government.

== Activism ==

Prior to the attack, Formanchuk had achieved local notoriety by challenging the lawfulness of traffic patrol stops, which are widely perceived in Russia to be corrupt and motivated by  a desire for [[bribery|bribes]].  Formanchuk repeatedly refused to bribe traffic patrol officers, instead challenging them on their knowledge of traffic regulations and other laws governing traffic stops.

== Beating ==

According to Formanchuk, he went to a police station on October 12, 2007 to register his car.  He attempted to record video of his interaction with the officers, which he says infuriated them.  He was subsequently attacked.  Formanchuk did not positively identify his attackers as police officers, but he alleges that officers on duty did nothing to restrain the attackers.

The police allege that Formanchuk became belligerent in the police station, was arrested, and suffered his injuries when he instigated a fight with the other occupants of his jail cell.

Formanchuk was hospitalized after the attack, which caused injuries to his skull and brain.
[[File:Ekaterinburg Senate 18.12.13-Formanchuk.jpg|thumb|Formanchuk addresses [[Monarchist Party#Ekaterinburg Senate|Ekaterinburg Senate]]]]

== Response ==

After Formanchuk's beating became public, motorists' groups in Yekaterinburg, [[St. Petersburg]], and [[Moscow]] held demonstrations against the police.  An Internet posting in support of Formanchuk has received over 200,000 hits.  State-run media, which is usually reluctant to air criticism of government authorities, has begun to focus on Formanchuk's story, with one channel referring to his treatment as "outrageous."

The Yekaterinburg edition of [[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]], the official government newspaper, cited Formanchuk's situation while admonishing law enforcement services to be more cooperative with motorists.

Law enforcement officials denied any involvement with Formanchuk's beating and accused Formanchuk's activist group of inciting the public against the police.  They further alleged that Formanchuk is a draft dodger with many serious traffic violations.

== Ekaterinburg Senate ==
Formanchuk nowadays also acts as a senator in civil [[Monarchist Party#Ekaterinburg Senate|Ekaterinburg Senate]] aimed at providing public control for official authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} http://esenat.ru/senators.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He focuses on automobile-related affairs.

In [[aerodynamics]], the '''lift-to-drag ratio''', or '''L/D ratio''', is the amount of [[Lift (force)|lift]] generated by a [[wing]] or vehicle, divided by the [[aerodynamic drag]] it creates by moving through the air. A higher or more favorable L/D ratio is typically one of the major goals in aircraft design; since a particular aircraft's required lift is set by its weight, delivering that lift with lower drag leads directly to better [[fuel economy in aircraft]], climb performance, and [[glide ratio]].

The term is calculated for any particular [[airspeed]] by measuring the lift generated, then dividing by the drag at that speed. These vary with speed, so the results are typically plotted on a 2D graph. In almost all cases the graph forms a U-shape, due to the two main components of drag.

Lift-to-drag ratios can be determined by flight test, by [[computational fluid dynamics|calculation]] or by testing in a wind tunnel.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Drag==
[[Lift-induced drag]] is a component of [[Drag (aerodynamics)|total drag]] that arises whenever a finite span wing generates lift. At low speeds an aircraft has to generate lift with a higher [[angle of attack]], thereby leading to greater induced drag. This term dominates the low-speed side of the lift versus velocity graph.
[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|thumb|The drag curve]]
[[File:DargPolarAL.png|thumb|350px|right|Drag polar for light aircraft. The tangent gives the maximum {{math|L/D}} point.]]
[[Form drag]] is caused by movement of the aircraft through the air. This type of drag, also known as [[air resistance]] or [[profile drag]] varies with the square of speed (see [[drag equation]]). For this reason profile drag is more pronounced at higher speeds, forming the right side of the lift/velocity graph's U shape. Profile drag is lowered primarily by streamlining and reducing cross section.

Lift, like drag, increases as the square of the velocity and the ratio of lift to drag is often plotted in terms of the [[lift coefficient|lift]] and [[drag coefficient]]s C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;. Such graphs are referred to as [[drag polar]]s. Speed increases from left to right.  The lift/drag ratio is given by the slope from the origin to some point on this curve and so the peak L/D ratio does not occur at the point of least drag, the leftmost point. Instead it occurs at a slightly higher speed.  Designers will typically select a wing design which produces an L/D peak at the chosen [[cruising speed]] for a powered fixed-wing aircraft, thereby maximizing economy. Like all things in [[aeronautical engineering]], the lift-to-drag ratio is not the only consideration for wing design. Performance at high angle of attack and a gentle [[Stall (flight)|stall]] are also important.

==Glide ratio==
As the aircraft [[fuselage]] and control surfaces will also add drag and possibly some lift, it is fair to consider the L/D of the aircraft as a whole. As it turns out, the [[Gliding (flight)#Glide ratio|glide ratio]], which is the ratio of an (unpowered) aircraft's forward motion to its descent, is (when flown at constant speed) numerically equal to the aircraft's L/D. This is especially of interest in the design and operation of high performance [[sailplane]]s, which can have glide ratios approaching 60 to 1 (60 units of distance forward for each unit of descent) in the best cases, but with 30:1 being considered good performance for general recreational use. Achieving a glider's best L/D in practice requires precise control of airspeed and smooth and restrained operation of the controls to reduce drag from deflected control surfaces. In zero wind conditions, L/D will equal distance traveled divided by altitude lost. Achieving the maximum distance for altitude lost in wind conditions requires further modification of the best airspeed, as does alternating cruising and thermaling.  To achieve high speed across country, glider pilots anticipating strong thermals often load their gliders (sailplanes) with [[Gliding competitions#Water ballast|water ballast]]: the increased [[wing loading]] means optimum glide ratio at higher airspeed, but at the cost of climbing more slowly in thermals.  As noted below, the maximum L/D is not dependent on weight or wing loading, but with higher wing loading the maximum L/D occurs at a faster airspeed.  Also, the faster airspeed means the aircraft will fly at higher [[Reynolds number]] and this will usually bring about a lower [[zero-lift drag coefficient]].

==Theory==
Mathematically, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio can be estimated as:

:&lt;math&gt;(L/D)_{max} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi \epsilon AR}{C_{D,0}}}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Loftin, LK, Jr.|title=Quest for performance: The evolution of modern aircraft. NASA SP-468|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/cover.htm|accessdate=2006-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''AR'' is the [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]], &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; the [[span efficiency factor]], a number less than but close to unity for long, straight edged wings, and &lt;math&gt;C_{D,0}&lt;/math&gt; the [[zero-lift drag coefficient]].

Most importantly, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio is independent of the weight of the aircraft, the area of the wing, or the wing loading.

It can be shown that two main drivers of maximum lift-to-drag ratio for a fixed wing aircraft are wingspan and total wetted area. One method for estimating the zero-lift drag coefficient of an aircraft is the equivalent skin-friction method. For a well designed aircraft, zero-lift drag (or parasite drag) is mostly made up of skin friction drag plus a small percentage of pressure drag caused by flow separation. The method uses the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{D,0}=C_{fe}\frac{S_{wet}}{S_{ref}}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raymer|first1=Daniel|title=Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach|date=2012|publisher=AIAA|location=New York|edition=5th|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_{fe}&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent skin friction coefficient, &lt;math&gt;S_{wet}&lt;/math&gt; is the wetted area and &lt;math&gt;S_{ref}&lt;/math&gt; is the wing reference area. The equivalent skin friction coefficient accounts for both separation drag and skin friction drag and is a fairly consistent value for aircraft types of the same class. Substituting this into the equation for maximum lift-to-drag ratio, along with the equation for aspect ratio (&lt;math&gt;b^2/S_{ref}&lt;/math&gt;), yields the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;(L/D)_{max}=\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi \epsilon}{C_{fe}}\frac{b^2}{S_{wet}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''b'' is wingspan. The term &lt;math&gt;b^2/S_{wet}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the wetted aspect ratio. The equation demonstrates the importance of wetted aspect ratio in achieving an aerodynamically efficient design.

==Supersonic/hypersonic lift to drag ratios==
At very high speeds, lift to drag ratios tend to be lower. [[Concorde]] had a lift/drag ratio of around 7 at Mach 2, whereas a 747 is around 17 at about mach 0.85.

[[Dietrich Küchemann]] developed an empirical relationship for predicting L/D ratio for high Mach:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/waverider/design.shtml Aerospaceweb.org Hypersonic Vehicle Design]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L/D_{max}=\frac{4(M+3)}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

where M is the Mach number. Windtunnel tests have shown this to be roughly accurate.

'''''Logos''''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|ɒ|s|,_|ˈ|l|ɒ|ɡ|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|oʊ|s}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:λόγος|λόγος]]|lógos}}; from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}, {{transl|grc|légō}}, {{Literal translation|'I say'|lk=on}}) is a term in [[Western philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[rhetoric]], and [[religion]] derived from a Greek word variously meaning "ground", "plea", "opinion", "expectation", "word", "speech", "account", "reason", "proportion", and "discourse",&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: logos, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entrys[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; but it became a technical term in [[Western philosophy]] beginning with [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa| 535| 475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}), who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Heraclitus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' is the logic behind an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html |title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos |last=Butler|first=S|website=members.tripod.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' tries to persuade an audience using [[logical argument]]s and supportive evidence. ''Logos'' is a persuasive technique often used in writing and rhetoric.

Ancient Greek philosophers used the term in different ways. The [[sophist]]s used the term to mean [[discourse]]; [[Aristotle]] applied the term to refer to "reasoned discourse"&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"/&gt; or "the argument" in the field of rhetoric, and considered it one of the three [[modes of persuasion]] alongside ''[[ethos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, Christof, "[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/ Aristotle's Rhetoric]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers identified the term with the [[divine]] animating principle pervading the Universe. Within [[Hellenistic Judaism]], [[Philo of Alexandria]] ({{Circa| 20&amp;nbsp;BC| 50&amp;nbsp;AD}}) adopted the term into [[Jewish philosophy]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Philo Judaeus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of John]] identifies the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], through which all things are made, as divine (''[[God|theos]]''),&lt;ref name = "May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; and further identifies [[Jesus Christ]] as the [[incarnate]] Logos. The term is also used in [[Sufism]], and the analytical psychology of [[Carl Jung]].

Despite the conventional translation as "word", it is not used for a [[word]] in the grammatical sense; instead, the term ''lexis'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέξις|λέξις]]}}, {{transl|grc|léxis}}) was used.&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fcis ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: lexis, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both ''logos'' and ''lexis'' derive from the same verb {{transl|grc|légō}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}), meaning  "(I) count, tell, say, speak".&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlego"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fgw2 ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: legō, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and Professor Jeanne Fahnestock describes logos as a "premise". She states that, to find the reason behind a rhetor's backing of a certain position or stance, one must acknowledge the different "premises" that the [[rhetor]] applies via his or her chosen diction.&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahnestock|first1=Jeanne|title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetor's success, she argues, will come down to "certain objects of agreement...between arguer and audience". "Logos is logical appeal, and the term logic is derived from it. It is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker's topic."&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotle's Three Modes of Persuasion in Rhetoric|url=http://www.mountainman.com.au/ESSENES/aristotles_modes_of_persuasion_in_rhetoric.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, logos is credited with appealing to the audience's sense of logic, with the definition of "logic" being concerned with the thing as it is known.&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"/&gt;
Furthermore, one can appeal to this sense of logic in two ways.  The first is through [[inductive reasoning]], providing the audience with relevant examples and using them to point back to the overall statement.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://courses.durhamtech.edu/perkins/aris.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second is through [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[enthymeme]], providing the audience with general scenarios and then indicating commonalities among them.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"/&gt;

Philo distinguished between ''logos prophorikos'' ("the uttered word") and the ''logos endiathetos'' ("the word remaining within").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Adam Kamesar|title=The ''Logos Endiathetos'' and the ''Logos Prophorikos'' in Allegorical Interpretation: Philo and the D-Scholia to the ''Iliad'' |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501000000*/https://web.duke.edu/classics/grbs/FTexts/44/Kamesar.pdf |journal=Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies (GRBS)|volume=44|year=2004|pages=163–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoics]] also spoke of the ''[[logos spermatikos]]'' (the generative principle of the Universe) which foreshadows related concepts in [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L.

The [[Vulgate]] Bible usage of {{lang|la|in principio erat verbum}} was thus constrained to use the (perhaps inadequate) noun {{lang|la|verbum}} for "word", but later [[Romance language]] translations had the advantage of nouns such as {{lang|fr|le mot}} in French. Reformation translators took another approach. [[Martin Luther]] rejected {{lang|de|Zeitwort}} (verb) in favor of {{lang|de|Wort}} (word), for instance, although later commentators repeatedly turned to a more dynamic use involving ''the living word'' as felt by Jerome and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L.

==Ancient Greek philosophy==

===Heraclitus===
{{Further|Heraclitus#Logos}}
The writing of [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa|535|475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}})&lt;!---maintain consistency throughout article re: BC vs. BCE---&gt; was the first place where the word ''logos'' was given special attention in [[ancient Greek philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, ''Greek Philosophical Terms'', New York University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; although Heraclitus seems to use the word with a meaning not significantly different from the way in which it was used in ordinary Greek of his time.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''A History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, Cambridge University Press, 1962, pp. 419ff.&lt;/ref&gt; For Heraclitus, ''logos'' provided the link between rational discourse and the world's rational structure.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This ''logos'' holds always but humans always prove unable to ever understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this ''logos'', humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep.|[[Diels–Kranz]]|22B1}}

{{quote|For this reason it is necessary to follow what is common. But although the ''logos'' is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding.|Diels–Kranz|22B2}}

{{quote|Listening not to me but to the ''logos'' it is wise to agree that all things are one.|Diels–Kranz|22B50&lt;ref&gt;Translations from Richard D. McKirahan, ''Philosophy before Socrates'', Hackett, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What ''logos'' means here is not certain; it may mean "reason" or "explanation" in the sense of an objective cosmic law, or it may signify nothing more than "saying" or "wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;''Handboek geschiedenis van de wijsbegeerte 1'', Article by Jaap Mansveld &amp; Keimpe Algra, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, an independent existence of a universal ''logos'' was clearly suggested by Heraclitus.&lt;ref&gt;W. K. C. Guthrie, ''The Greek Philosophers: From Thales to Aristotle'', Methuen, 1967, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle identifies two specific types of persuasion methods: artistic and inartistic.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovering the Arguments: Artistic and Inartistic Proofs|url=http://www.classicalwriting.com/blog/2010/01/12/discovering-the-arguments-artistic-and-inartistic-proofs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines artistic proofs as arguments that the [[rhetor]] generates and creates on their own. Examples of these include  relationships, testimonies, and conjugates. He defines inartistic proofs as arguments that the rhetor quotes using information from a non-self-generated source. Examples of these include laws, contracts, and [[oath]]s.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"/&gt;

===Aristotle's rhetorical logos===
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|Aristotle, 384–322 BC.]]
Following one of the other meanings of the word, [[Aristotle]] gave ''logos'' a different technical definition in the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', using it as meaning argument from reason, one of the three [[modes of persuasion]]. The other two modes are ''[[pathos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθος|πᾰ́θος]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthos}}), which refers to persuasion by means of emotional appeal, "putting the hearer into a certain frame of mind";&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', in Patricia P. Matsen, Philip B. Rollinson, and Marion Sousa, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R3iLyz9zd7cC&amp;pg=PA120 Readings from Classical Rhetoric]'', SIU Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8093-1592-0}}, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[ethos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἦθος|ἦθος]]}}, {{transl|grc|êthos}}), persuasion through convincing listeners of one's "moral character".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt; According to Aristotle, ''logos'' relates to "the speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.1.i.html translation by W. Rhys Roberts], this reads "the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself".&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Paul Rahe:

{{Quote|For Aristotle, ''logos'' is something more refined than the capacity to make private feelings public: it enables the human being to perform as no other animal can; it makes it possible for him to perceive and make clear to others through reasoned discourse the difference between what is advantageous and what is harmful, between what is just and what is unjust, and between what is good and what is evil.&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"&gt;Paul Anthony Rahe, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zymp_kM33ZcC&amp;pg=PA21 Republics Ancient and Modern: The Ancien Régime in Classical Greece]'', University of North Carolina Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-8078-4473-X}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'' can all be appropriate at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Garver, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PoXnLHQ5mgwC&amp;pg=PA114 Aristotle's Rhetoric: An art of character]'', University of Chicago Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-226-28424-7}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments from reason (logical arguments) have some advantages, namely that [[data]] are (ostensibly) difficult to manipulate, so it is harder to argue against such an argument; and such arguments make the speaker look prepared and knowledgeable to the audience, enhancing ''ethos''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} On the other hand, trust in the speaker—built through ''ethos''—enhances the appeal of arguments from reason.&lt;ref&gt;Garver, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Wardy]] suggests that what Aristotle rejects in supporting the use of ''logos'' "is not emotional appeal [[Per se (Latin)|per se]], but rather emotional appeals that have no 'bearing on the issue', in that the ''pathē'' [{{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθη|πᾰ́θη]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthē}}] they stimulate lack, or at any rate are not shown to possess, any intrinsic connection with the point at issue—as if an advocate were to try to whip an [[antisemitic]] audience into a fury because the accused is Jewish; or as if another in drumming up support for a politician were to exploit his listeners's reverential feelings for the politician's ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wardy, "Mighty Is the Truth and It Shall Prevail?", in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QkIn37h_TMUC&amp;pg=PA64 Essays on Aristotle's Rhetoric]'', Amélie Rorty (ed), University of California Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-520-20228-7}}, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle comments on the three modes by stating: 
{{Quote|Persuasion is clearly a sort of demonstration, since we are most fully persuaded when we consider a thing to have been demonstrated. Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds. ... Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible. ... Secondly, persuasion may come through the hearers, when the speech stirs their emotions. ... Thirdly, persuasion is effected through the speech itself when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question.{{whose translation}}|Aristotle|''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''|350&amp;nbsp;BC}}

===Stoics===
[[Stoic philosophy]] began with [[Zeno of Citium]] {{Circa|300&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}, in which the ''logos'' was the active [[reason]] pervading and animating the [[Universe]]. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with [[God]] or [[Nature]]. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal logos'' ("''[[logos spermatikos]]''"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate [[matter]]. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos''.&lt;ref&gt;Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pp. 37–38. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics took all activity to imply a ''logos'' or spiritual principle. As the operative principle of the world, the ''logos'' was ''[[anima mundi]]'' to them, a concept which later influenced [[Philo of Alexandria]], although he derived the contents of the term from Plato.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wUF15rypDscC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Anima+mundi+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jwl8TP_xI8KSjAfUm-jSDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Anima%20mundi%20logos&amp;f=false ''Studies in European Philosophy''], by James Lindsay, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4067-0173-4}}, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In his Introduction to the 1964 edition of [[Marcus Aurelius]]' ''[[Meditations]]'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth wrote that "''Logos'' ... had long been one of the leading terms of [[Stoicism]], chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=24 |isbn=0-14044140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isocrates' logos===
Public discourse on ancient Greek rhetoric has historically emphasized Aristotle's appeals to ''logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'', while less attention has been directed to [[Isocrates]]' teachings about philosophy and ''logos'',&lt;ref name="David M 2010"&gt;David M. Timmerman and [[Edward Schiappa]], ''Classical Greek Rhetorical Theory and the Disciplining of Discourse'' (London: Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010): 43–66&lt;/ref&gt; and their partnership in generating an ethical, mindful ''[[polis]]''. Isocrates does not provide a single definition of ''logos'' in his work, but Isocratean ''logos'' characteristically focuses on speech, reason, and civic discourse.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt; He was concerned with establishing the "common good" of [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] citizens, which he believed could be achieved through the pursuit of philosophy and the application of ''logos''.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt;

==In Hellenistic Judaism==
{{See also|Hellenistic Judaism}}
In the [[Septuagint]] the term ''logos'' is used for the word of God in the creation of heaven in Psalm 33:6, and in some related contexts.

===Philo of Alexandria===
[[Philo]] ({{Circa|20&amp;nbsp;BC|50&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=on}}), a [[Hellenized Jew]], used the term Logos to mean an intermediary divine being or [[demiurge]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"/&gt; Philo followed the Platonic distinction between [[Hylic|imperfect matter]] and perfect Form, and therefore intermediary beings were necessary to bridge the enormous gap between God and the material world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"&gt;[[Frederick Copleston]], ''A History of Philosophy'', Volume 1, Continuum, 2003, pp. 458–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Logos'' was the highest of these intermediary beings, and was called by Philo "the first-born of God".&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;
Philo also wrote that "the Logos of the living God is the bond of everything, holding all things together and binding all the parts, and prevents them from being dissolved and separated".&lt;ref&gt;Philo, ''De Profugis'', cited in [https://archive.org/details/hellenismchristi00frieiala Gerald Friedlander, ''Hellenism and Christianity'', P. Vallentine, 1912, pp. 114–15.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato's Theory of Forms]] was located within the Logos, but the Logos also acted on behalf of God in the physical world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt; In particular, the [[Angel of the Lord]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Old Testament]]) was identified with the Logos by Philo, who also said that the Logos was God's instrument in the creation of the Universe.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Main article|Logos (Christianity)}}
[[File:Prologus Ioanni Vulgata Clementina.jpg|thumb|''In principio erat verbum'', [[Latin (language)|Latin]] for ''In the beginning was the Word'', from the [[Clementine Vulgate]], [[Gospel of John]], 1:1–18.]]
In [[Christology]], the ''Logos'' ({{lang-el|Λόγος|lit='Word", "Discourse", or "Reason'}})&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; is a name or title of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]], seen as the pre-existent second [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)#Christian_theology|person]] of the [[Trinity]]. The concept derives from [[John 1:1]], which in the [[Douay–Rheims]], [[King James Version|King James]], [[New International Version|New International]], and other versions of the [[Bible]], reads:
{{quote|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the translations, "Word" is used for Λόγος, although the term is often used [[transliterated]] but untranslated in theological discourse.
The Koine Greek reads, "Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν '''πρὸς τὸν θεόν''', '''καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος'''.(En arkhêi ên ho lógos, kaì ho lógos ên ''pròs tòn theón, kaì theòs ên ho lógos''.) The definite article is used with 'theos/god', making it 'God', and the second usage is indefinite (without an article), rendering it 'god'. Thus David Bentley Hart translates it as 'In the origin there was the Logos, and the Logos was present with GOD, and the Logos was god'.&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart. ''The New Testament: A Translation''. Yale, 2017, ISBN 0-978-0-300-18609-3, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many ancient Greek scholars, including Dr. Bruce M. Metzger of Princeton (Professor of New Testament Language and Literature) explains that concepts of definite articles in English and Koine Greek are not similar: "In the New World Translation the opening verse of the Gospel according to John is mistranslated as follows: “Originally the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.” A footnote which is added to the first word, “Originally,” reads, “Literally, In (At) a beginning.” By using here the indefinite article “a” the translators have overlooked the well-known fact that in Greek grammar nouns may be definite for various reasons, whether or not the Greek definite article is present. A prepositional phrase, for example, where the definite article is not expressed, can be quite definite in Greek, [in Hebrew 10:31, "εις χειρας θεου ζωντος" is properly rendered (even by the New World Translation) with the definite article expressed twice, “into the hands of the living God.”] as in fact it is in John 1:1"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzger|first=Bruce M.|date=April 1953|title=The Jehovah'S Witnesses and Jesus Christ: A Biblical and Theological Appraisal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/004057365301000110|journal=Theology Today|volume=10|pages=65-85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=729|title=WHAT GREEK SCHOLARS REALLY THINK!|last=|first=|date=2003|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letusreason.org/jw38.htm|title=The dispute on Jn.1:1|last=|first=|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhema==
The word ''logos'' has been used in different senses along with ''[[rhema]]''. Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] used the term ''logos'' along with ''rhema'' to refer to sentences and propositions.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P. Dinneen 1995 {{ISBN|0-87840-278-0}} p. 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=H8njxDzC450C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BEt4TOXbGMqSswb1v_yxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgo#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The history of linguistics in Europe from Plato to 1600'' by Vivien Law 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-56532-4}} p. 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=M_ooh9Q9cDMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3Up4TPWLA-DT4wallLWvBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoplatonism==
[[File:Plotinus and disciples.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Plotinus]] with his disciples.]]
[[Neoplatonist]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] ({{Circa|204/5|lk=on}}{{snd}}270&amp;nbsp;AD) used the term "Logos" in ways that drew on Plato and the [[Stoics]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Wagner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZJMzbtNFNsC&amp;pg=PA116 Neoplatonism and Nature: Studies in Plotinus' Enneads]'', Volume 8 of ''Studies in Neoplatonism'', SUNY Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7914-5271-9}}, pp. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt; but the term Logos was interpreted in different ways throughout Neoplatonism, and similarities to Philo's concept of Logos appear to be accidental.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Rist, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=n49OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA84 Plotinus: The road to reality]'', Cambridge University Press, 1967, {{ISBN|0-521-06085-0}}, pp. 84–101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Logos was a key element in the [[meditation]]s of Plotinus&lt;ref&gt;''Between Physics and Nous: Logos as Principle of Meditation in Plotinus'', The Journal of Neoplatonic Studies, Volumes 7–8, 1999, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; regarded as the first Neoplatonist. Plotinus referred back to [[Heraclitus]] and as far back as [[Thales]]&lt;ref&gt;Handboek Geschiedenis van de Wijsbegeerte I, Article by Carlos Steel&lt;/ref&gt; in interpreting Logos as the principle of meditation, existing as the interrelationship between the [[hypostases]]—the [[soul]], the intellect (''[[nous]]''), and the [[Monad (philosophy)|One]].&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Neoplatonic Studies, Volumes 7–8, Institute of Global Cultural Studies, Binghamton University, 1999, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotinus used a trinity concept that consisted of "The One", the "Spirit", and "Soul". The comparison with the Christian [[Trinity]] is inescapable, but for Plotinus these were not equal and "The One" was at the highest level, with the "Soul" at the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jcg83ynsJEwC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=plotinus+trinity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Is18TLriMt6U4gakq5CGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=plotinus%20trinity&amp;f=false] ''Ancient philosophy'' by Anthony Kenny 2007 {{ISBN|0-19-875272-5}} p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; For Plotinus, the relationship between the three elements of his trinity is conducted by the outpouring of Logos from the higher principle, and ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'' (loving) upward from the lower principle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Enneads'' by Plotinus, [[Stephen MacKenna]], John M.

Victorinus differentiated between the Logos interior to God and the Logos related to the world by creation and [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Theological treatises on the Trinity'', by Marius Victorinus, Mary T. Clark, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine of Hippo, often seen as the father of [[medieval philosophy]], was also greatly influenced by Plato and is famous for his re-interpretation of Aristotle and Plato in the light of [[early Christian]] thought.&lt;ref&gt;''Neoplatonism and Christian thought'' (Volume 2), By Dominic J.

W. Wolfskeel, introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{Main article|Logos (Islam)}}
The concept of the ''logos'' also exists in [[Islam]], where it was definitively articulated primarily in the writings of the classical [[Sunni]] [[Sufism|mystics]] and [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], as well as by certain [[Shi'a]] thinkers, during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardet, L., "Kalām", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;Boer, Tj. de and Rahman, F., "ʿAḳl", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sunni Islam]], the concept of the ''logos'' has been given many different names by the denomination's [[metaphysician]]s, mystics, and philosophers, including ''ʿaql'' ("Intellect"), ''al-insān al-kāmil'' ("Universal Man"), ''kalimat Allāh'' ("Word of God"), ''haqīqa muḥammadiyya'' ("The Muhammadan Reality"), and ''nūr muḥammadī'' ("The Muhammadan Light").

===''ʿAql''===
One of the names given to a concept very much like the Christian Logos by the classical Muslim metaphysicians is ''ʿaql'', which is the "Arabic equivalent to the Greek {{lang|grc|[[nous|νοῦς]]}} ('intellect')."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; In the writings of the Islamic [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers, such as [[al-Farabi]] ({{Circa|872|950&amp;nbsp;AD}}) and [[Avicenna]] (d. 1037),&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; the idea of the ''ʿaql'' was presented in a manner that both resembled "the late Greek doctrine" and, likewise, "corresponded in many respects to the Logos Christology."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;

The concept of Logos in Sufism is used to relate the "Uncreated" (God) to the "Created" (humanity). In Sufism, for the Deist, no contact between man and God can be possible without the Logos. The Logos is everywhere and always the same, but its personification is "unique" within each region. [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]] are seen as the personifications of the Logos, and this is what enables them to speak in such absolute terms.&lt;ref&gt;''Sufism: love &amp; wisdom'' by Jean-Louis Michon, Roger Gaetani 2006 {{ISBN|0-941532-75-5}} p. 242 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UVt-EvXnEC4C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BMNQNOHXKOMC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false ''Sufi essays''] by Seyyed Hossein Nasr 1973{{ ISBN|0-87395-233-2}} p. 148]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the boldest and most radical attempts to reformulate the Neoplatonic concepts into Sufism arose with the philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]], who traveled widely in Spain and North Africa. His concepts were expressed in two major works ''The Ringstones of Wisdom'' (''Fusus al-Hikam'') and ''The Meccan Illuminations'' (''Al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya''). To Ibn Arabi, every prophet corresponds to a reality which he called a Logos ([[Kalimah]]), as an aspect of the unique Divine Being. In his view the Divine Being would have for ever remained hidden, had it not been for the prophets, with Logos providing the link between man and divinity.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N. Hanif 2002 {{ISBN|81-7625-266-2}} p. 39 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2bhpr7RTLMAC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Arabi seems to have adopted his version of the Logos concept from Neoplatonic and Christian sources,&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Frazee, "Ibn al-'Arabī and Spanish Mysticism of the Sixteenth Century", ''Numen'' '''14''' (3), Nov 1967, pp. 229–40.&lt;/ref&gt; although (writing in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] rather than Greek) he used more than twenty different terms when discussing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Little |first=John T. |last2= |first2= |date=January 1987 |title=AL-INSĀN AL-KĀMIL: THE PERFECT MAN ACCORDING TO IBN AL-'ARAB? |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x/abstract |journal=The Muslim World |publisher=Hartford Seminary |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=43–54 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x |access-date=30 May 2016 |quote="Ibn al-'Arabi uses no less than twenty-two different terms to describe the various aspects under which this single Logos may be viewed."}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dobie  |first=Robert J. |date=17 November 2009 |title=Logos and Revelation: Ibn 'Arabi, Meister Eckhart, and Mystical Hermeneutics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWVwT3UpthUC&amp;pg=PA225 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Catholic University of America Press  |page=225 |isbn= 081321677X |quote="For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Sufi writers also show the influence of the Neoplatonic Logos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Henry Whinfield]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=l0vHUo0wnlgC&amp;pg=PR25 Masnavi I Ma'navi: The spiritual couplets of Maulána Jalálu-'d-Dín Muhammad Rúmí]'', Routledge, 2001 (originally published 1898), {{ISBN|0-415-24531-1}}, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century [[Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī]] introduced the ''Doctrine of Logos and the Perfect Man''. For al-Jīlī, the "perfect man" (associated with the Logos or the Holy Prophet) has the power to assume different forms at different times and to appear in different guises.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N. Hanif 2002 {{ISBN|81-7625-266-2}} p. 98 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2bhpr7RTLMAC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20jili&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sufism, Şeyh Gâlib (d. 1799) articulates Sühan (Logos-''Kalima'') in his ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'') in parallel to Ibn Arabi's Kalima. In the romance, ''Sühan'' appears as an embodiment of Kalima as a reference to the Word of God, the Perfect Man, and the Reality of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Betül Avcı, "Character of ''Sühan'' in Şeyh Gâlib’s Romance, ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'')" ''Archivum Ottomanicum'', 32 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=March 2018}}

==Jung's analytical psychology==
[[File:Carl Jung (1912).png|thumb|150px|A 37-year-old [[Carl Jung]] in 1912.]]
[[Carl Jung]] contrasted the critical and rational faculties of logos with the emotional, non-reason oriented and mythical elements of ''eros''.&lt;ref&gt;''C.G. Jung and the psychology of symbolic forms'' by Petteri Pietikäinen 2001 {{ISBN|951-41-0857-4}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Jung's approach, logos vs eros can be represented as "science vs mysticism", or "reason vs imagination" or "conscious activity vs the unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;''Mythos and logos in the thought of Carl Jung'' by Walter A. Shelburne 1988 {{ISBN|0-88706-693-3}} p. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yV-ZE8pyZjkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=logos+jung&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2CJ5TMS0Od3NjAew14ijBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Jung, logos represented the masculine principle of rationality, in contrast to its female counterpart, ''[[eros (concept)|eros]]'':

{{Quote|Woman’s psychology is founded on the principle of ''Eros'', the great binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is ''Logos''. The concept of ''Eros'' could be expressed in modern terms as psychic relatedness, and that of ''Logos'' as objective interest.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Aspects of the Feminine'', Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 65, {{ISBN|0-7100-9522-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jung attempted to equate logos and eros, his intuitive conceptions of masculine and feminine consciousness, with the [[alchemical]] Sol and Luna. Jung commented that in a man the lunar [[Anima and animus|anima]] and in a woman the solar [[Anima and animus|animus]] has the greatest influence on consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=jung+eros+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3CR5TLn_IqiM4gbNvYSUBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=jung%20eros%20logos&amp;f=false ''Aspects of the masculine'' by Carl Gustav Jung, John Beebe p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt; Jung often proceeded to analyze situations in terms of "paired opposites", e.g. by using the analogy with the eastern [[yin and yang]]&lt;ref&gt;''Carl Gustav Jung: critical assessments'' by Renos K. Papadopoulos 1992 {{ISBN|0-415-04830-3}} p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and was also influenced by the Neoplatonists.&lt;ref&gt;See the Neoplatonic section above.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis]]'' Jung made some important final remarks about anima and animus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In so far as the spirit is also a kind of "window on eternity"... it conveys to the soul a certain influx divinus... and the knowledge of a higher system of the world, wherein consists precisely its supposed animation of the soul.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in this book Jung again emphasized that the animus compensates eros, while the anima compensates logos.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of Jungian psychology: theory, practice and applications'' by Renos K. Papadopoulos 2006 {{ISBN|1-58391-147-2}} p. 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt7FfLRi17kC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=logos+jung&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2CJ5TMS0Od3NjAew14ijBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20jung&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental representation is the mental imagery of things that are not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mckellar|first1=Peter|title=Imagination and thinking: A psychological analysis|date=1957|publisher=Oxford, England|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1958-00258-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], specifically in fields of [[metaphysics]] such as [[philosophy of mind]] and [[ontology]], a mental representation is one of the prevailing ways of [[explanation|explaining]] and [[description|describing]] the nature of [[idea]]s and [[concept]]s.

Mental representations (or mental imagery) enable representing things that have never been experienced as well as things that do not exist.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009"&gt;{{cite book|author = Robert J. Sternberg|url = https://books.google.com/?id=la6mSK9vyIgC|title = Cognitive Psychology|year = 2009|isbn = 9780495506294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Think of yourself traveling to a place you have never visited before, or having a third arm. These things have either never happened or are impossible and do not exist, yet our brain and mental imagery allows us to imagine them. Although visual imagery is more likely to be recalled, mental imagery may involve representations in any of the sensory modalities, such as hearing, smell, or taste. [[Stephen Kosslyn]] proposes that images are used to help solve certain types of problems. We are able to visualize the objects in question and mentally represent the images to solve it.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009" /&gt;

Mental representations also allow people to experience things right in front of them—though the process of how the brain interprets the [[Mental content|representational content]] is debated.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Representational theories of mind ==

[[Representationalism]] (also known as [[Direct and indirect realism|indirect realism]]) is the view that representations are the main way we access external reality. Another major prevailing [[philosophical theory]] posits that concepts are entirely [[abstract object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ontology of Concepts—Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?|url=http://philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/papers/OntologyofConcepts.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Margolis|first1=Eric|last2=Laurence|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen Laurence|journal=Noûs|volume=41|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=561–593|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representational theory of mind attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[idea]]s, [[concept]]s and other [[mental content]] in [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]] and [[experimental psychology]]. In contrast to theories of naive or [[direct realism]], the representational theory of mind postulates the actual existence of mental representations which act as intermediaries between the [[observation|observing]] subject and the [[object (philosophy)|objects]], processes or other entities observed in the external world. These intermediaries stand for or represent to the mind the objects of that world.

For example, when someone arrives at the belief that his or her floor needs sweeping, the representational theory of mind states that he or she forms a mental representation that represents the floor and its state of cleanliness.

The original or "classical" representational theory probably can be traced back to [[Thomas Hobbes]] and was a dominant theme in classical [[empiricism]] in general. According to this version of the theory, the mental representations were images (often called "ideas") of the objects or states of affairs represented. For modern adherents, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and many others, the representational system consists rather of an internal [[Language of thought hypothesis|language of thought]] (i.e., mentalese). The contents of thoughts are represented in symbolic structures (the formulas of Mentalese) which, analogously to natural languages but on a much more abstract level, possess a [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] very much like those of natural languages. For the Spanish logician and cognitive scientist Luis M. Augusto, at this abstract, formal level, the syntax of thought is the set of symbol rules (i.e., operations, processes, etc. on and with symbol structures) and the semantics of thought is the set of symbol structures (concepts and propositions). Content (i.e., thought) emerges from the meaningful co-occurrence of both sets of symbols. For instance, "8 x 9" is a meaningful co-occurrence, whereas "CAT x §" is not; "x" is a symbol rule called for by symbol structures such as "8" and "9", but not by "CAT" and "§".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Unconscious representations 2: Towards an integrated cognitive architecture.|last = Augusto|first = Luis M.|date = 2014|journal = Axiomathes |volume=24|pages=19–43|doi = 10.1007/s10516-012-9207-y|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strong vs weak, restricted vs unrestricted ===
There are two types of representationalism, strong and weak. Strong representationalism attempts to reduce phenomenal character to intentional content. On the other hand, weak representationalism claims only that phenomenal character supervenes on intentional content. Strong representationalism aims to provide a theory about the nature of phenomenal character, and offers a solution to the hard problem of consciousness. In contrast to this, weak representationalism does not aim to provide a theory of consciousness, nor does it offer a solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

Strong representationalism can be further broken down into restricted and unrestricted versions. The restricted version deals only with certain kinds of phenomenal states e.g. visual perception. Most representationalists endorse an unrestricted version of representationalism. According to the unrestricted version, for any state with phenomenal character that state’s phenomenal character reduces to its intentional content. Only this unrestricted version of representationalism is able to provide a general theory about the nature of phenomenal character, as well as offer a potential solution to the hard problem of consciousness. The successful reduction of the phenomenal character of a state to its intentional content would provide a solution to the hard problem of consciousness once a physicalist account of intentionality is worked out.

=== Problems for the unrestricted version ===
When arguing against the unrestricted version of representationalism people will often bring up phenomenal mental states that appear to lack intentional content. The unrestricted version seeks to account for all phenomenal states. Thus, for it to be true, all states with phenomenal character must have intentional content to which that character is reduced. Phenomenal states without intentional content therefore serve as a counterexample to the unrestricted version. If the state has no intentional content its phenomenal character will not be reducible to that state’s intentional content, for it has none to begin with.

A common example of this kind of state are moods. Moods are states with phenomenal character that are generally thought to not be directed at anything in particular. Moods are thought to lack directedness, unlike emotions, which are typically thought to be directed at particular things e.g. you are mad ''at'' your sibling, you are afraid ''of'' a dangerous animal. People conclude that because moods are undirected they are also nonintentional i.e. they lack intentionality or aboutness. Because they are not directed at anything they are not about anything. Because they lack intentionality they will lack any intentional content. Lacking intentional content their phenomenal character will not be reducible to intentional content, refuting the representational doctrine.

Though emotions are typically considered as having directedness and intentionality this idea has also been called into question. One might point to emotions a person all of a sudden experiences that do not appear to be directed at or about anything in particular. Emotions elicited by listening to music are another potential example of undirected, nonintentional emotions. Emotions aroused in this way do not seem to necessarily be about anything, including the music that arouses them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kind|first = Amy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses&lt;!--'Directedness' redirects here--&gt; ===
In response to this objection a proponent of representationalism might reject the undirected nonintentionality of moods, and attempt to identify some intentional content they might plausibly be thought to possess. The proponent of representationalism might also reject the narrow conception of intentionality as being directed at a particular thing, arguing instead for a broader kind of intentionality.

There are three alternative kinds of '''directedness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;/[[intentionality]] one might posit for moods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Outward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content.
* Inward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
* Hybrid directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have both a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content and a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
In the case of outward directedness moods might be directed at either the world as a whole, a changing series of objects in the world, or unbound emotion properties projected by people onto things in the world. In the case of inward directedness moods are directed at the overall state of a person’s body. In the case of hybrid directedness moods are directed at some combination of inward and outward things.

=== Further objections ===
Even if one can identify some possible intentional content for moods we might still question whether that content is able to sufficiently capture the phenomenal character of the mood states they are a part of. Amy Kind contends that in the case of all the previously mentioned kinds of directedness (outward, inward, and hybrid) the intentional content supplied to the mood state is not capable of sufficiently capturing the phenomenal aspects of the mood states.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the case of inward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood does not seem tied to the state of one’s body, and even if one’s mood is reflected by the overall state of one’s body that person will not necessarily be aware of it, demonstrating the insufficiency of the intentional content to adequately capture the phenomenal aspects of the mood. In the case of outward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood and its intentional content do not seem to share the corresponding relation they should given that the phenomenal character is supposed to reduce to the intentional content. Hybrid directedness, if it can even get off the ground, faces the same objection.

== Philosophers ==
There is a wide debate on what kinds of representations exist. There are several philosophers who bring about different aspects of the debate. Such philosophers include Alex Morgan, Gualtiero Piccinini, and Uriah Kriegel—though this is not an exhaustive list.

=== Alex Morgan ===

There are "job description" representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is representations that (1) represent something—have [[intentionality]], (2) have a special relation—the represented object does not need to exist, and (3) content plays a causal role in what gets represented:  e.g. saying "hello" to a friend, giving a glare to an enemy.

Structural representations are also important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations are basically mental maps that we have in our minds that correspond exactly to those objects in the world (the intentional content). According to Morgan, structural representations are not the same as mental representations—there is nothing mental about them:  plants can have structural representations.

There are also internal representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations include those that involve future decisions, episodic memories, or any type of projection into the future.

=== Gualtiero Piccinini ===

In [[Gualtiero Piccinini]]'s forthcoming work, he discusses topics on natural and nonnatural mental representations. He relies on the natural definition of mental representations given by Grice (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Meaning|last = Grice|first = H.P.|date = 1957|journal = Philosophical Review |volume=66|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''P entails that P''. e.g. Those spots mean measles, entails that the patient has measles. Then there are nonnatural representations:  ''P does not entail P''. e.g. The 3 rings on the bell of a bus mean the bus is full—the rings on the bell are independent of the fullness of the bus—we could have assigned something else (just as arbitrary) to signify that the bus is full.

=== Uriah Kriegel ===

There are also objective and subjective mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kriegel|first = Uriah|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 161–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective representations are closest to tracking theories—where the brain simply tracks what is in the environment. If there is a blue bird outside my window, the objective representation is that of the blue bird. Subjective representations can vary person-to-person. For example, if I am colorblind, that blue bird outside my window will not ''appear'' blue to me since I cannot represent the blueness of blue (i.e. I cannot see the color blue). The relationship between these two types of representation can vary.

&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective varies, but the subjective does not:  e.g. brain-in-a-vat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective varies, but the objective does not:  e.g. color-inverted world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in objective and none in the subjective:  e.g. thermometer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in subjective and none in the objective:  e.g. an agent that experiences in a void.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Eliminativists think that subjective representations don't exist. Reductivists think subjective representations are reducible to objective. Non-reductivists think that subjective representations are real and distinct.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23457">'''Minority influence''', a form of [[social influence]], takes place when a member of a [[minority group]] influences the majority to accept the minority's [[beliefs]] or [[behavior]]. This occurs when a small group or an individual acts as an agent of social change by questioning established societal perceptions, and proposing alternative, original ideas which oppose the existing social norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardikiotis|first1=A.|title=Minority influence.|journal=Social And Personality Psychology Compass|date=2011|volume=5|issue=9|pages=679–693|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00377}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of social influence: majority influence (resulting in [[conformity]] and public compliance) and minority influence (resulting in conversion). Majority influence refers to the majority trying to produce conformity on the minority, while minority influence is converting the majority to adopt the thinking of the minority group.&lt;ref name="Sampson, E. 1991"&gt;Sampson, E. (1991). Social worlds, personal lives: An introduction to social psychology. (6th Ed.) San Diego, CA: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other forms of [[Social influence|influence]], minority influence is often thought of as a more innovative form of social change, because it usually involves a personal shift in private opinion. Without influential minorities challenging the majority view, there would be no new ideas or positive change in society. Examples of this are the Civil Rights movement in America and the suffragettes campaigning for votes for women.

==History==
Nearly all early [[research]] on minority influence focused on how the majority influenced the minority, based on the [[Natural deduction|assumption]] of many [[psychologists]] that it would be very hard for the minority to have any influence on the majority. [[Serge Moscovici|Moscovici]] had a different perspective, as he believed that it was possible for a minority influence to overcome majority influence. As a result, he conducted his own study on minority influence in 1969. Similar to Asch's (1951) 'blue-green' experiment, to see if a group of four participants were influenced by a minority. His research was important as it was one of the first studies to show that a minority was able to change the opinions of the majority. The research of Moscovici and his colleagues opened the door to more research on the subject.

== Mechanism ==
Moscovici's (1980, 1985) conversion theory outlines a dual process of social influence. When an individual's views differ from the majority view, this causes inner turmoil, motivating the individual to reduce conflict by using a comparison process, leading to compliance and public acceptance of the majority position to avoid ostracism and potential ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Crano|first1= W. D.|last2= Seyranian|first2= V.|title= Majority and minority influence.|journal= Social and Personality Psychology Compass|date= 2007|volume= 1|issue= 1|pages= 572–589|doi= 10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, majority influence is seen as normative social influence because often it is generated by a desire to fit in and conform to the group, e.g. Asch's (1951) line study. 
Conversely, a minority view is more distinctive, capturing attention and resulting in a validation process, where people carefully analyse the discrepancy between their own view and the minority view. This often results in attitude conversion, where the individual is convinced that the minority view is correct, which is much more likely to be private rather than public.

Majority influence occurs when people [[conform]] to certain beliefs and behaviours in order to be accepted by others. Unlike majority influence, minority influence can rarely influence others through [[normative social influence]] because the majority is indifferent to the minority's [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] of them. To influence the majority, the minority group would take the approach of [[informational social influence]] (Wood, 1994). By presenting information that the majority does not know or expect, this new or unexpected information catches the [[attention]] of the majority to carefully consider and examine the minority's view. After consideration, when the majority finds more validity and merit in the minority's view, the majority group has a higher chance of accepting part or all of the minority opinion.&lt;ref name="Wood, W. 1994"&gt;Wood, W., Lundgren, S., Ouellette, J., Busceme, S., &amp; Blackstone, T. (1994). "Minority Influence: A Meta-Analytic Review of Social Influence Processes".  ''Psychological Bulletin''. Vol 115, No 3, pp. 323-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority group may accept part or all of the minority view, that fact does not necessarily indicate that the majority has been completely influenced by the minority. A study by [[Elizabeth Mannix]] and Margaret Neale (2005) shows that having the [[Advocacy|support]] from the majority [[leader]] could prove the critical factor in getting the minority opinion to be heard and be accepted. The support of a leader gives the majority more confidence in the merit of the minority opinion, leading to an overall respect for the minority. The strength of the "key people" (Van Avermaet, 1996) comes from the reputation built from their consistency of behaviors and ideas. Involving key people will benefit the minority view because people are more open to hear from others whom they trust and respect.&lt;ref name="Van Avermaet, E. 1996"&gt;Van Avermaet, E. (1996). "Social influence in small groups". Introduction to Social Psychology: A European Perspective (2nd Ed.). Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; In minority influence, a few influential leaders can influence the opposing majority to the minority's way of thinking.&lt;ref name="Sunitiyoso, Y. 2010"&gt;Sunitiyoso, Y., Avineri, E., &amp; Catterjee, K.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affecting factors==

===Size of minority===
Moscovici and Nemeth (1974) argue that a minority of one is more influential than a minority of more than one, as one person is more likely to be consistent over long periods of time and will not divide the majority’s [[attention]].&lt;ref name="Moscovici, S. 1974"&gt;Moscovici, S. &amp; Nemeth, C. (1974). Social psychology: Classic and contemporary integrations (7th Ed.). Oxford, England: Rand Mcnally.&lt;/ref&gt; They explain that a person may question themself: "How can they be so wrong and yet so sure of themselves?", resulting in a tendency to reevaluate the entire situation, considering all possible alternatives, including the minority view. On the other hand, two people are more likely to be influential than one person as they are less likely to be seen as strange or [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]]. More recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arbuthnot|first1=J|last2=Wayner|first2=M|title=Minority Influence: Effects of size, conversion, and sex.|journal=The Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied.|date=1982|volume=111|issue=2|pages=285–295|doi=10.1080/00223980.1982.9915370}}&lt;/ref&gt; has supported the latter due to the belief that a minority with two or more, if consistent, has more credibility and is therefore more likely to influence the majority.&lt;ref name="Moscovici, S. 1974" /&gt;

===Size of majority===
The social impact model (Latané &amp; Wolf 1981) predicts that as the size of the majority grows, the influence of the minority decreases, both in public and in private attitude change.&lt;ref name="Latané &amp; Wolf 1981"&gt;Latané, B. &amp; Wolf, S. (September 1981). "The social impact of majorities and minorities". ''Psychological Review''. Vol 88, Issue 5, pp. 438-453.&lt;/ref&gt; The social impact model further explains that social impact is the multiplicative effect of strength (power, status, knowledge), the immediacy (physical proximity and recency), and the number of group members, supporting the view that a minority will be less influential on a larger majority.

Clark and Maass (1990) looked at the interaction between minority influence and majorities of varying sizes, and found that, like Latané &amp; Wolf's findings, the minority's influence decreases in a negatively accelerating power function as the majority increases.&lt;ref name="Clark &amp; Masss (1990)"&gt;Clark, R. D. and Maass, A. (1990), The effects of majority size on minority influence. European Journal of Social Psychology, 20: 99–117. {{doi|10.1002/ejsp.2420200203}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in findings that minority support should decrease considerably with the first few members of the majority, but additional members will have a marginally declining impact on getting people to conform to the majority position.

Similarly, Latané and Wolf cite Solomon Asch's work with "the magic number three". After his [[Asch conformity experiments|experiments]], Asch concludes that when the majority consists of just one or two individuals, there is very little conformity. The addition of a third majority member dramatically increases conformity, but increases ''beyond'' three did not result in increasing amounts of conformity.&lt;ref name="Latané &amp; Wolf 1981" /&gt;

===Behavioural style===
Minority influence is more likely to occur if the point of view of the minority is consistent, flexible, and appealing to the [[majority]]. Having a consistent and unwavering [[opinion]] will increase the [[appeal]] to the majority, leading to a higher chance of [[adaption]] to the minority view. However, any wavering opinions from the minority group could lead the majority to dismiss the minority's claims and opinions.&lt;ref name="Aronson, E. 2007"&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T.D., &amp; Akert, A.M. (2007). Social Psychology (6th Ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Serge Moscovici]] and Nemeth (1974) argued that minority influence is effective as long as there is consistency over time and agreement among the members of the minority.&lt;ref name="Moscovici, S. 1974" /&gt; If this consistency were lost, then the minority would lose its [[credibility]]. This can be the case if a member of the minority deserts and joins the majority, as this damages the consistency and unity of the minority. After this occurrence, members of the majority are less likely to shift their position to that of the minority.
The key to minority influence being successful is not just consistency, but how the majority interprets consistency. If the consistent minority are seen as too inflexible, rigid, and unwilling to change, they are unlikely to influence the majority. However, if they appear flexible and compromising, they will be seen as less extreme and more reasonable, having a better chance of changing majority views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mugny|first1=G|last2=Papastamou|first2=S|title=When rigidity does not fail: Individualization and psychologization as resistances to the diffusion of minority innovations.|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1980|volume=10|pages=43–61|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420100104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispositional and situational factors===
Research shows that individuals are more likely to listen to the minority and take on their ideas if they identify with them as being similar to themselves. Maass &amp; Clark (1984) arranged for a group of [[heterosexual]] participants to hear a debate on [[gay rights]]. The results showed that the majority heterosexual group debating was easier for the heterosexual participants to relate to. Therefore, the minority [[homosexual]] group had less of an influence. Influence is more likely to occur if the minority (or majority) is part of our '[[in-group]]' as we are more likely to be influenced by those who are similar to us. This research contradicts with Moscovici’s view that deviant minorities (or out-groups) are essential for minority influence to occur. In-group minorities are more likely to be successful, as they are seen as part of the group, and therefore their ideas are seen as more acceptable. On the other hand, out-groups are more likely to be discriminated, as they are not seen as part of the group, causing them to seem strange or unusual.&lt;ref name="Maass &amp; Clark. 1988"&gt;Maass, A. &amp; Clark, R.D. (1988). "Social categorization in minority influence: The case of homosexuality". ''European Journal of Social Psychology''. Vol 18, pp. 347-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the decisions of others may affect the potency of minority influence. Asch (1952) conducted a study in which test subjects would be accompanied one of two "partners" during a series of questions posed to a group: a) a partner that would agree with the subject's minority view, or b) a partner that would be more extremely incorrect than the majority. Asch found that regardless of the role of the "partner", the fact that the consensus was broken – even if by just one individual ("the magic number one") – was enough to reduce conformity to a majority, and add credibility to the minority view.&lt;ref name="Asch (1952)"&gt;Asch, S. E. Social psychology. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application: juries==

===Jury dynamics===

===Stories, evidence and verdicts===

Most juries will elect a leader and then decide whether the voting for a verdict will be public or private. Using the '''Story Model Theory''' which suggests that cognitive processing of trial information is what drives jurors to mentally organize evidence in coherent, credible narratives, jurors will approach a verdict in one of two ways. The first, '''Verdict Driven''' jurors sort the evidence into categories of guilty and not guilty before deliberation. these types of juries feel the need to reach a verdict quickly, thus they may feel social pressure outside of the group to deliver the content in a time efficient manner. On the other hand, '''Evidence Based''' jurors will resist making a final decision on the verdict until they have reviewed all the evidence. These juries tend to explore their different options as a group and are less influenced by the social pressure outside of the group to reach a verdict quickly.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2010). Group dynamics. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minority influence in juries===

The verdicts favored by the majority on the first ballot becomes the jury's final decision in about 90% of all jury trials, but the minority convinces the majority to change in about one out of every ten trials. If the majority was always right, we reach the conclusion that minorities (in a jury setting) do not have influence at all, this is not the case. Often when a jury is hung, it is usually because one or two jurors are holding our/resisting the influence of the majority. If these jury members are consistent with their views, it is likely they will be able to convince another member of the jury to also side with their view. As time goes on, more and more juries may change their vote in favor of the original minority. It is however, extremely important the original jurors are consistent and confident in their opinions. The more unsteady they appear, the less likely they will be able to conquer the majority.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Status and influence in juries===
Members of a jury who have high prestige or status are usually more influential than members who are not. Members who are also of high socioeconomic status are also more likely to influential in the jury deliberation process. This is demonstrated by the correlation between private preliberation opinion and jury's final decision was .50 for rich members and .2 for laborers. However, in recent analysis, race and sex no longer determine influence in juries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Improving juries===

# '''Jury Size:''' modifying could influence group structure, representativeness, and majority influence; large juries are more likely to be hung, but small and large juries do not significantly differ in the types of verdicts reached.
# '''Unanimity:''' juries that do not have to reach a unanimous decision render their judgements twice as quickly and are less likely to be hung.
# '''Procedural Innovation:''' we can improve juries by making the instructions given to juries (prior to deliberation) clearer and more understandable. If the members understand at the beginning of the process what their requirements are, then they will be more efficient in their delivery of the verdict, and be more understanding of the process.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Yielding==

===Social cryptoamnesia===
After a number of members have shifted their opinion to agree with the minority group, that minority becomes a majority. This is known as the snowball effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Avermaet|first1=E.|title=Social Influence in small groups|journal=Introduction to Social Psychology: A European Perspective|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a minority creates social change in society, the new view becomes an integral part of the society's culture. This results in the source of the minority influence that led to change being forgotten, which is known as social cryptoamnesia.&lt;ref name="Perez, 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perez|first1=J. A.|last2=Papastamou|first2=S.|last3=Mugny|first3=G.|title='Zeitgeist' and minority influence: Where is the causality: A comment on Clark (1990)|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1995|volume=25|issue=6|pages=703–710|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420250609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Minority influence can be successful if people can [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociate]] between the [[socio-cognitive]] activities of [[Psychological resistance|resistance]] that are induced by the source and other activities of resistance that develop from the content of the message. The process of dissociation is explained by social cryptoamnesia:&lt;ref name="Perez, 1995"/&gt; what was originally considered different is gradually constructed as an alternative (Perez, 1995).

A person can be affected by minority influence whether directly or indirectly. However, if one is not aware of the influence, the minority ideas could be taken as one's own while disregarding where the original idea came from. Social cryptoamnesia explains that thoughts and ideas that challenge or shock are stored in [[latency stage|latent]] memory without retaining the ownership of the idea. Ideas that were supposedly forgotten have reappeared in the person's mind as his or her own belief or thought.&lt;ref name="Perez, 1995" /&gt; This major attitude change takes place when the [[zeitgeist]] has changed. In history, minorities have changed the attitudes of society, and the attitudes of society have changed the personal opinion of the majority in that society. Although minority influence may not affect a person immediately, one's beliefs and behaviors may change over time due to social cryptoamnesia.

==Broadening views in organizations==
By integrating the [[theory]] of minority influence in [[organizations]], people may be more open to learning and change, benefiting the organization in the end.

===Increasing diversity in the workplace===
Not only is minority influence seen in [[social groups]], but this type of social influence is also present in the workplace. Incorporating the concept of minority influence can encourage [[multiculturalism|diversity]] and [[Social change|change]] in a [[corporate]] organization. Mannix and Neale (2005) performed a case study on a company that asked all the senior managers to mentor junior managers, preparing at least three younger managers to be ready and [[competence (human resources)|competent]] enough to replace the older managers. From this study, the firm realized that they were not achieving the extent of diversity that they intended. As a result, the company required at least one of the three junior managers in training to be a woman or underrepresented minority. This new requirement improved the intended diversity in the organization as well as the interaction between the senior manager mentor and the junior manager mentee.&lt;ref name="Mannix &amp; Neale. 2005" /&gt;

===Improving organizational values and culture===
In another study by Mannix and Neale, yearly performance evaluations were completed for Hispanic, African American, and Asian managers. Their performance reviews evaluated the managers on less tangible measures related to [[leadership]], an essential factor that is considered for receiving a promotion. Upon reflection of the company's performance evaluations, a senior leader suggested that the [[criterion validity|criteria]] on which managers were assessed was [[bias]]ed toward a "white, Anglo management style" (Mannix, 2005). As a solution, the leadership performance and promotion criteria of the performance reviews were revised. From this change and inclusion of minority influence, managers were able to learn from their strengths and weaknesses and change. Along with changing the criteria of performance evaluations, the organization itself underwent a change in [[values]] and [[culture]].&lt;ref name="Mannix &amp; Neale. 2005" /&gt;

==Combined with majority influence==
There is evidence to suggest that it is possible for minority influence and majority influence to work together. A study by Clark (1994) uses a [[jury]] setting from the film ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' to investigate social influence. Some of the participants were asked to just read the arguments from one of the characters (who acted as the minority), while the other group were also told how he changed the opinion of the rest of the jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Russell D. III |title=The Role of Censorship in Minority Influence |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=331–338 |year=1994 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420240303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social influence was present in both groups, but was stronger in the group that was exposed to both the arguments (minority influence) and the knowledge that the jury conformed (majority influence).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4334">[[File:Constructing nerve.png|thumb|Constructing the nerve of an open good cover containing 3 sets in the plane.]]

In [[topology]], the '''nerve of an open covering''' is a construction of an [[abstract simplicial complex]] from an [[Cover (topology)#open cover|open covering]] of a [[topological space]] ''X'' that captures many of the interesting topological properties in an algorithmic or combinatorial way. It was introduced by [[Pavel Alexandrov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aleksandroff|first=P. S.|author-link=Pavel Alexandrov| title=Über den allgemeinen Dimensionsbegriff und seine Beziehungen zur elementaren geometrischen Anschauung |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume=98 |year=1928| pages=617–635|doi=   10.1007/BF01451612}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now has many variants and generalisations, among them the Čech nerve of a cover, which in turn is generalised by [[hypercovering|hypercoverings]].


==Alexandrov's definition==
Given an [[index set]] ''I'', and [[open set]]s ''U&lt;sub&gt;i''&lt;/sub&gt; contained in ''X'', the ''nerve'' ''N'' is the set of finite subsets of ''I'' defined as follows:
* a finite set ''J'' ⊆ ''I'' belongs to ''N'' if and only if the intersection of the ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' whose subindices are in ''J'' is non-empty,
::&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{j\in J}U_j \neq \varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously, if ''J'' belongs to ''N'', then any of its subsets is also in ''N''. Therefore ''N'' is an abstract simplicial complex.

In general, the complex ''N'' need not reflect the topology of ''X'' accurately. For example we can cover any ''n''-sphere with two contractible sets ''U'' and ''V'', in such a way that ''N'' is an [[Abstract simplicial complex|abstract 1-simplex]]. However, if we also insist that the open sets corresponding to every [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] indexed by a set in ''N'' are also [[contractible space|contractible]], the situation changes. In particular, the nerve lemma states that if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U = \{U_i\}_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[good cover]], in that for each &lt;math&gt;\sigma\subset I&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i\in \sigma} U_i&lt;/math&gt; is contractible if it is nonempty, then the nerve &lt;math&gt;N(\mathcal U)&lt;/math&gt; is homotopy equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/899283974|title=Elementary applied topology|last=1969-|first=Ghrist, Robert W.,|isbn=9781502880857|edition=Edition 1.0|location=[United States]|oclc=899283974}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This means for instance that a circle covered by three open arcs, intersecting in pairs in one arc, is modelled by a homeomorphic complex, the [[geometrical realization]] of ''N''.

==The Čech nerve==
Given an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U=\{U_i\}&lt;/math&gt; of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, or more generally a cover in a site, we can regard the pairwise [[Pullback_(category_theory)|fibre products]] &lt;math&gt;U_{ij}=U_i\times_XU_j&lt;/math&gt;, which in the case of a topological space is precisely the intersection &lt;math&gt;U_i\cap U_j&lt;/math&gt;. The collection of all such intersections can be referred to as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U\times_X\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt; and the triple intersections as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U\times_X\mathcal U\times_X\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;. By considering the natural maps &lt;math&gt;U_{ij}\to U_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_i\to U_{ii}&lt;/math&gt;, we can construct a simplicial object &lt;math&gt;C(\mathcal U)_\bullet&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;C(\mathcal U)_n=\mathcal U\times_X\cdots\times_X\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;, n-fold fibre product. This is the '''Čech nerve''', and by taking connected components we get a simplicial set, which we can realise topologically: &lt;math&gt;|C(\pi_0(\mathcal U))|&lt;/math&gt;. If the covering and the space are sufficiently nice, for instance if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is compact and all intersections of sets in the cover are contractible or empty, then this space is weakly equivalent to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This is known as ''the nerve theorem''.

The '''open music model''' is an economic and technological framework for the [[recording industry]] based on research conducted at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. It predicts that the playback of prerecorded music will be regarded as a service rather than as individually sold products, and that the only system for the [[digital distribution]] of music that will be viable against piracy is a subscription-based system supporting [[file sharing]] and free of [[digital rights management]]. The research also indicated that [[United States dollar|US$]]9 per month for unlimited use would be the [[market clearing]] price at that time, but recommended $5 per month as the long-term optimal price.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/8438|title=Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models|author=[[Shuman Ghosemajumder]]|publisher=[[MIT Sloan School of Management]]|date=May 10, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its creation in 2002, a number of its principles have been adopted throughout the recording industry,&lt;ref name=irunway&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-runway.com/blog/on-demand-music-streaming-to-battle-piracy/|title=On-Demand Music Streaming to battle Piracy|author=Gautham Somraj Koorma|publisher=[[iRunway]]|date=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been cited as the basis for the business model of many [[Comparison of on-demand streaming music services|music subscription services]].&lt;ref name=lespresso&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/affari/2014/07/01/news/spotify-il-business-folle-sbarca-a-wall-street-1.171553|title=Spotify, il business folle sbarca a Wall Street|author=Marco Consoli|publisher=[[L'Espresso]]|date=July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazeta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technologie.gazeta.pl/internet/1,104665,18056619,Dla_uzytkownikow_streaming_muzyki_jest_spelnieniem.html|title=Dla użytkowników streaming muzyki jest spełnieniem marzeń, a dla wytwórni – źródłem obaw|author=Karol Kopańko|publisher=[[Gazeta.pl]]|date=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The model asserts that there are five [[necessary and sufficient|necessary]] requirements for a viable commercial music digital distribution network:
{| class="wikitable"
! # !! style="width: 20%;" | Requirement !! Description
|-
| 1 || Open file sharing || users must be free to [[file sharing|share files]] with each other
|-
| 2 || Open file formats || content must be distributed in open formats with no [[digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions
|-
| 3 || Open membership || [[copyright]] holders must be able to freely register to receive payment
|-
| 4 || Open payment || payment should be accepted via multiple means, not a closed system
|-
| 5 || Open competition || multiple such systems must exist which can interoperate, not a designed monopoly
|}The model was proposed by [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]] in his 2002 research paper ''Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models''&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt; at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. The following year, it was publicly referred to as the Open Music Model.&lt;ref name="opensource"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensource.com/life/11/11/drm-graveyard-brief-history-digital-rights-management-music|title=The DRM graveyard: A brief history of digital rights management in music|author=Ruth Suehle|publisher=[[Red Hat]] Magazine|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model suggests changing the way consumers interact with the digital property market: rather than being seen as a good to be purchased from online vendor, music would be treated as a service being provided by the industry, with firms based on the model serving as intermediaries between the music industry and its consumers. The model proposed giving consumers unlimited access to music for the price of [[United States dollar|US$]]5 per month&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt; (as of 2002), based on research showing that this could be a long-term optimal price, expected to bring in a total revenue of over [[United States dollar|US$]]3&amp;nbsp;billion per year.&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;

The research demonstrated the demand for third-party file sharing programs. Insofar as the interest for a particular piece of digital property is high, and the risk of acquiring the good via illegitimate means is low, people will naturally flock towards third-party services such as [[Napster]] and Morpheus (more recently, [[BitTorrent (protocol)|Bittorrent]] and [[The Pirate Bay]]).&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;

The research showed that consumers would use file sharing services not primarily due to cost but because of convenience, indicating that services which provided access to the most music would be the most successful.&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;

== Industry adoption ==
The model predicted the failure of [[digital distribution|online music distribution]] systems based on [[digital rights management]].&lt;ref name=opensource /&gt;&lt;ref name=CollectiveCopyright&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2602197|title=Collective Copyright|author1=Emanuele Lunadei |author2=Christian Valdiva Torres |author3=Erik Cambria |publisher=[[International World Wide Web Conference]] 2014|date=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of the model included that it would not eliminate the issue of piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/120018441/Music-Distribution-Technology-and-the-Value-of-Art-in-Society|title=Music Distribution: Technology and the Value of Art in Society|author=Sungwon Peter Choe|publisher=[[KAIST]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others countered that it was in fact the most viable solution to piracy,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.iplawintheus.com/open-music-model/|title=Open music model|author=Andrew Traub|publisher=US Intellectual Property Law|date=November 25, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101061826/http://www.iplawintheus.com/open-music-model/|archivedate=January 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; since piracy was "inevitable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cse.tkk.fi/Datacommunications/Doctoral_dissertations/Lic-Yrjo_Raivio.pdf | title=Mobile Services and the Internet: A Study of Emerging Business Models|author=Yrjö Raivio|publisher=[[Helsinki University of Technology]]|date=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters argued that it offered a superior alternative to the current [[Trade group efforts against file sharing|law-enforcement based methods]] used by the recording industry.&lt;ref&gt;

Several aspects of the model have been adopted by the recording industry and its partners over time:

|source=– [[Steve Jobs]], ''Thoughts on Music''&lt;ref name=stevejobs /&gt; open letter, 2007
}}

* The abolition of digital rights management represented a major shift for the industry. In 2007, [[Steve Jobs]], CEO of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], published a letter&lt;ref name=stevejobs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/kr/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/|title=Thoughts on Music|author=[[Steve Jobs]]|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling for an end to DRM in music. A few months later, [[Amazon.com]] launched a store single individual DRM-free mp3's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/amazon_mp3.php|title=Amazon MP3 Launches DRM-Free Music Store|author=Marshall Kirkpatrick|publisher=[[ReadWriteWeb]]|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, iTunes Store abolished DRM on most of its individual tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/137946/2009/01/itunestore.html|title=iTunes Store goes DRM-free|author=Peter Cohen|publisher=[[MacWorld]]|date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open payment was relatively straightforward to implement, and the [[iTunes Store]] offered gift cards, which could be purchased with cash, from its launch in 2003.
* In 2010, [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] announced a download ability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1627779/rhapsody-streaming-music-mp3-playlists-iphone-itunes-apple-ipad-entertainment|title=Rhapsody First Subscription Service in U.S. to Offer Offline Music on iPhone|author=Kit Eaton|publisher=[[FastCompany]]|date=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their subscribers using [[iPhones]].
* In 2011, Apple launched its [[iTunes Match]] service with a subscription model, supporting file-sharing between a user's own devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erikras.com/2011/11/16/cloud-music-and-itunes-match/|title=Cloud Music and iTunes Match|author=Erik Rasmussen|date=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the subscription price did not include the cost of acquiring content, which would still have to be purchased on a per track basis from the iTunes Store.
* Pricing close to the model's suggested $5 per month price, or its $9 per month market clearing price, has been adopted by many platforms:
** In 2005, [[Yahoo! Music]] was launched at $5 per month with [[digital rights management]].
** In 2011, [[Spotify]] introduced a $5 per month premium subscription in the United States with [[digital rights management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/07/spotify-launches-in-the-u-s-at-last/|title=Spotify Launches in the U.S at Last|author=Charlie Sorrel|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 2011, [[Microsoft]] [[Zune]] offered a subscription service for music downloads with [[digital rights management]] known as a [[Zune Pass]], at $10 a month.

** In 2015, Apple announced [[Apple Music]], which would offer unlimited streaming of songs encrypted with [[FairPlay]] DRM for a subscription price of $9.99 per month, and compensate artists on the basis of song popularity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3144">'''''Pages for Peace''''' is a book created as an after school enrichment program by the [[Groton-Dunstable Regional Middle School]] in [[Groton, Massachusetts]].  The group created the second largest book in the world (by physical dimensions).  The subject of the book they have chosen to create is [[World Peace]]. This enrichment program was created by 5th grade teacher [[Betsy Sawyer]].&lt;ref name=Pages&gt;[http://www.pagesforpeace.org/home.html Pages for Peace Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Pages for Peace'' consists of recollections and reflections on the topic of World Peace from people all over the world.

==History==
In October 2004 eight [[5th grade]] students joined Pages for Peace becoming its first members.

In late 2007 members of Pages for Peace visited The [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] to create the page turner for the book.

In September 2008 members of Pages for Peace visited the [[United Nations]] headquarters in [[New York City]] to give a presentation to the annual international youth conference, and have been invited back every year since (as of 2016).&lt;ref name=Pages/&gt;

In June 2010, ''Pages for Peace'' was awarded the Peace Abbey's "Courage of Conscience" award, which had previously been awarded to [[Mother Teresa]] and the [[Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Image:Protector-Niven-cropped.jpg|thumb|Phssthpok, a Pak Protector eating Tree-of-Life root in the Library on the Pak homeworld]]
'''Pak Breeders''' and '''Pak Protectors''' are two developmental stages of [[fictional]] life in [[Larry Niven]]'s [[Known Space]] universe.  The Pak first appeared in "The Adults," which appeared in ''Galaxy'' in 1967;  this story was expanded into the novel [[Protector (novel)|''Protector'']]  by Larry Niven (1973).  The Pak also appear in several of Niven's later novels, notably those set in the [[Ringworld]].

''[[Destroyer of Worlds (novel)|Destroyer of Worlds]]'' depicts a confrontation between the Pak and the [[Pierson's Puppeteers|Puppeteers]].

== Narrative purpose ==

Niven has written that he invented the Protectors as a [[thought experiment]] to explain the common effects of aging on humans and to create a fictional evolutionary explanation for humans' long lives after females have passed reproductive age.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, Larry. ''N-Space''. Tor Science Fiction, 1990, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, most of the positive attributes of Protectors are based on negative human aging effects: swollen joints, decreased muscle-fat ratio, weakening heart, invariant diet, decreasing height, facial atrophy, leathery skin, hair loss, lack of sex drive, and tooth loss are all turned to advantage during the shift from Breeder to Protector.

== The Pak species ==

In ''Protector'', we learn that humans are descended from the Pak.  Pak Children and Breeders appear in Earth's [[fossil record]] as ''[[Homo habilis]]'';  the few Pak Protectors to make it to Earth apparently are not found in the fossil record.

The Pak species goes through three stages of development: Child, Breeder and Protector.

'''Pak Child'''  is analogous to a human child:  sexually immature and dependent upon adults for survival.

'''Pak Breeder''' is analogous to a human adult:  sexually mature, self-sufficient (in later writings) and provides immediate care for the children. To the Pak, the Breeder stage, though capable of space travel, is not deemed fully sentient; Breeders, to a large extent, rely on Protectors for long-term survival. [[Ringworld|Earlier Niven stories]] describe the breeder as "just intelligent enough to swing a club or throw a stone."

'''Pak Protector''' is not analogous to any human form.  It is described as a 'fighting machine,' with armor-like skin, super-human strength and super-human intelligence.  Niven's stories that focus on the Pak mostly concentrate on the unique Protector-stage.

Niven explained the evolution of the Pak as resulting from high radiation levels on their home world near the core of the [[galaxy]].  The high radiation near the star-dense core caused severe mutations that can destabilize the evolutionary process. As a result, the Pak evolved a mechanism to eliminate dangerous mutations from the population. That mechanism is the protector stage.

Protectors are highly sensitive to the smell of their close relatives and "weed out" those that smell wrong, which may indicate a potentially dangerous mutation. This weeding also suppressed positive mutations, essentially halting Pak evolution. Protectors are fully sentient, and are far more intelligent than ordinary humans.  This "superior" intelligence, however, serves only a Pak Protector's instincts to protect its bloodline at any costs. The Pak have no drive toward the collection of "abstract knowledge," have no concept of "art," and do not even possess enough of an "artistic impulse" to understand the purpose of making sketches and paintings for reasons not directly useful.

The change from Breeder to Protector is the result of a [[peramorphosis|peramorphic]] transformation brought about by the plant known as [[Tree-of-Life]].  As humans (and all [[primates]]) are descended from the Pak, Tree-of-Life can create a Protector-stage human.

== Tree-of-Life ==

:''See also [[tree of life]] for other meanings of the term.

[[Tree-of-Life]] is the mechanism by which a Breeder becomes a Protector. The term originally is used to refer to a specific plant which, when consumed, triggers the transformation. The term "Tree-of-Life virus" is used to describe the [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] virus which actually governs the transition.

Niven took the name Tree-of-Life from the [[Book of Genesis]]; specifically to the fruit of the "Tree of Life" that could make Adam and Eve immortal (Genesis 3:22-24), which is quoted as the foreword to the novel [[Protector (novel)|''Protector'']], and also mentioned by Brennan within the novel.

Tree-of-Life (the plant) is a bush native to the Pak homeworld. When a Breeder reaches the proper age (early 40s for humans), the smell of the root becomes irresistible; the Breeder gorges on the Tree-of-Life root, infecting itself with the Tree-of-Life virus and transforming into a Protector. The age window for the metamorphosis is relatively narrow (between 42 and 50 Earth years). Tree-of-Life is common on the Pak world, so there is almost no risk of a Breeder living past this window without being exposed to the roots.

The transition from Breeder to Protector involves reconfiguration of the anatomy. Skin thickens, becoming similar to leather armor, strong enough to turn a copper knife. Joints swell until the creature becomes "a parody of the human form done in [[cantaloupe]]s and [[coconut]]s". This increases leverage available to muscles by increasing the force of the [[moment (physics)|moment arm]], the result being that a protector can lift ten times its own weight. Genitalia and gonads vanish, and a second two-chambered heart forms in the groin at the fusion of the [[femoral vein]]s. The arms lengthen. Fingernails turn into retractable claws. Teeth fall out and the lips and gums fuse, the mouth forming a horny beak (flat in protectors transformed from humans, non-flat in protectors transformed from Pak). All the breeder's hair falls out and the head acquires a bony ridge to protect the newly expanded [[skull|cranium]]. The expanded skull allows the brain to grow to an enormous size; the resulting mind, even starting from something as "unintelligent" as a chimpanzee, becomes far more intelligent than a typical human. Pak Protectors also acquire an extended lifespan, and can live tens of thousands of Earth years (a common element in Niven's stories).

Once the transformation is complete, a Pak Protector must periodically consume more Tree-of-Life root to maintain the virus in its body. Without the virus, a Protector will weaken and die as its DNA is degraded; the virus supplies replacement DNA.

The Tree-of-Life crop on Earth failed due to there being insufficient [[thallium oxide]] in the Earth's [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|soil]]; the plants grew but didn't support the virus. As a result, the Protectors that led the colony to Earth died of starvation when their store of roots ran out.

== Protector behavior ==

Pak Protectors have an innate need to protect close relatives.  When a Pak Protector has no bloodline to protect, it usually stops eating and starves;  some childless Protectors can adopt the entire Pak race as their family.

Niven states that Protectors on the crowded Pak homeworld would constantly war against each other to gain advantage for their family and that alliances would last only until one ally sees advantage in betrayal.  Human Protectors, and those on the Ringworld, seem to be less warlike and better able to work for the betterment of the entire species (or all of the Ringworld hominids) rather than just their bloodline, though this may simply be a function of how few protectors with families encounter each other.

Protectors typically die from starvation (from lack of will to live, e.g. if the Protector's bloodline has died out) or violence.  Although Protectors have a vastly extended lifetime, it is not infinite; during the original half million year journey to Earth some protector colonists did die from old age.

Because of their enormous intelligence and instinctive need to protect their family (or their species, etc.), Protectors are efficient, ruthless and quite amoral.  It is observed several times that this intelligence combined with instinct also compels action so completely that Protectors often have little "free will".  Niven uses this trait as a plot device several times as characters set up circumstances where Protector characters will react in a specific manner.  In ''Protector'', Jack Brennan (a human turned into a Protector) commits [[genocide]] by exterminating the [[Martian]] race ("Aliens were dangerous, or might be, and Pak were not interested in anything but Pak") and also releases a genetically modified Tree-of-Life virus on the colony world Home, turning everyone middle aged into a Protector (and killing all other humans on the planet) in order to create an army of childless Protectors with which to fight the invading Pak fleet. It is indicated throughout Niven's works that humans (''[[Homo sapiens]]'') that have turned into protectors are far more intelligent than their Pak (''[[Homo habilis]]'') counterparts (in much the way that humans are more intelligent than the primates they evolved from).

Niven explains much of Protector behavior in his Future History, by revealing in ''[[Ringworld's Children]]'' that the [[Amalgamated Regional Militia|ARM]] may be run by at least one Protector and that Boosterspice (which dramatically prolongs human lifespan) is derived from Tree-of-Life.

== The Pak and Humanity ==

In ''Protector,'' Niven explains that humans (and all of Earth's primates) are descended from a colony of Pak breeders that were stranded on Earth 2.5 million years ago. The protectors that built the colony ship died when their Tree-of-Life crops failed.  The original Pak Breeder population (known to us as ''[[Homo habilis]]'') bred and mutated wildly, evolving into modern humans as well as all other Earth [[primates]].  All Terran primates would transform into the Protector stage if exposed to Tree-of-Life root (or, more accurately, the symbiotic virus it contains).

In ''The Ringworld Engineers,'' the characters find evidence that the [[Ringworld]] was built by Pak Protectors (confirmed by the statements of a character in ''Ringworld's Children'' who claims to be one of the original builders) and populated by Pak breeders. The Pak Protectors dwindled in numbers until they were no longer able to maintain the genetic purity of the breeder forms and the breeders eventually evolved into all the other hominids of the Ringworld that one sees in Larry Niven's novels.

In ''[[Destroyer of Worlds (novel)|Destroyer of Worlds]]'' (co-written by Niven and [[Edward M. Lerner]]), a human world (and the [[Pierson's Puppeteers]] of the [[Fleet of Worlds]]) confronts a Pak Protector war fleet. The trailing edge of that Pak fleet, carrying the primary Pak Library, also figures prominently in ''[[Betrayer of Worlds]]'', by the same authors.

[[File:Friedens-Warte.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Die Friedens-Warte'', a German journal of the peace movement, issue #11, 1913]]
A '''peace movement''' is a [[social movement]] that seeks to achieve ideals such as the ending of a particular [[war]] (or all wars), minimize inter-human violence in a particular place or type of situation, and is often linked to the goal of achieving [[world peace]]. Means to achieve these ends include advocacy of [[pacifism]], [[non-violent resistance]], [[diplomacy]], [[boycott]]s, [[peace camp]]s, [[moral purchasing]], supporting [[anti-war]] political candidates, legislation to remove the profit from government contracts to the [[Military–industrial complex]], banning guns, creating [[open government]] and [[government transparency|transparency]] tools,  [[direct democracy]], supporting [[Whistleblowers]] who expose [[War crime|War-Crimes]] or conspiracies to create wars, [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], and national [[Interest group|political lobbying]] groups to create legislation. The political cooperative is an example of an organization that seeks to merge all peace movement organizations and green organizations, which may have some diverse goals, but all of whom have the common goal of peace and humane sustainability. A concern of some [[List of peace activists|peace activists]] is the challenge of attaining peace when those that oppose it often use violence as their means of communication and empowerment.

Some people refer to the global loose affiliation of activists and political interests as having a shared purpose and this constituting a single movement, "''the'' peace movement", an all encompassing "anti-war movement". Seen this way, the two are often indistinguishable and constitute a loose, responsive, event-driven collaboration between groups with motivations as diverse as [[humanism]], [[environmentalism]], [[veganism]], [[anti-racism]], [[feminism|anti-sexism]], [[decentralization]], [[hospitality service|hospitality]], [[ideology]], [[theology]], and [[faith]].

==The ideal of peace==

There are different ideas over what "peace" is (or should be), which results in a plurality of movements seeking diverse ideals of peace. Particularly, "anti-war" movements often have short-term goals, while peace movements advocate an ongoing life-style and proactive government policy.

It is often not clear whether a movement or a particular protest is against war in general, as in [[pacifism]], or against one's own government's participation in a war. Indeed, some observers feel that this lack of clarity or long term continuity has represented a key part of the strategy of those seeking to end a war, e.g., the [[Vietnam War]].

[[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|Global protests against the U.S. invasion of Iraq]] in early 2003 are an example of a more specific, short term and loosely affiliated [[single-issue]] "movement" —with relatively scattered ideological priorities, ranging from absolutist [[pacifism]] to [[Islamism]] and [[Anti-Americanism]] (see [[Human shield action to Iraq]]). Nonetheless, some of those who are involved in several such short term movements and build up trust relationships with others within them, do tend to eventually join more global or long-term movements.

By contrast, some elements of the global peace movement seek to guarantee [[Human security|health security]] by ending war and assuring what they see as basic [[human rights]] including the right of all people to have access to air, water, food, shelter and [[universal health care|health care]]. A number of activists seek [[social justice]] in the form of equal protection under the law and equal opportunity under the law for groups that have previously been disenfranchised.

The Peace movement is primarily characterized by a belief that humans should not wage war on each other or engage in violent [[Ethnic war|ethnic cleansing]]s over language, race or [[natural resources]] or [[Ethical dilemma|ethical conflict]] over [[religion]] or [[ideology]]. Long-term opponents of war preparations are primarily characterized by a belief that [[Armed forces|military power]] is not the equivalent of [[justice]].

The Peace movement tends to oppose the proliferation of dangerous technologies and [[weapons of mass destruction]], in particular [[nuclear weapons]] and [[biological warfare]]. Moreover, many object to the export of weapons including hand-held [[machine guns]] and [[grenades]] by [[G7|leading economic nations]] to lesser developed nations. Some, like [[SIPRI]], have voiced special concern that [[artificial intelligence]], [[molecular engineering]], [[genetics]] and [[proteomics]] have even more vast destructive potential. Thus there is intersection between peace movement elements and [[Neo-luddism|Neo-Luddites]] or [[primitivism]], but also with the more mainstream technology critics such as the [[Green parties]], [[Greenpeace]] and the [[ecology movement]] they are part of.

It is one of several movements that led to the formation of [[Green party]] political associations in many democratic countries near the end of the 20th century. The peace movement has a very strong influence in some countries' green parties, such as in [[Germany]], perhaps reflecting that country's negative experiences with [[militarism]] in the [[History of Germany|20th century]].

==History==

===Peace and Truce of God ===
{{Main|Peace and Truce of God}}
The first mass peace movements in history were the [[Peace of God]] (''Pax Dei''), being first proclaimed in AD 989 at the Council of Charroux, and the [[Truce of God]] evolving out of it and being first proclaimed in 1027. The Peace of God originated as a response to increasing violence against monasteries in the aftermath of the fall of the Carolingian dynasty, spearheaded by bishops and "was promoted at a number of subsequent [church] councils, including important ones at Charroux (c. 989 and c. 1028), Narbonne (990), Limoges (994 and 1031), Poitiers (c. 1000), and Bourges (1038)". The Truce of God sought to restrain violence by limiting the number of days of the week and times of the year where the nobility were able to practice violence. These peace movements "set the foundations for modern European peace movements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Peace of God |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Peace-of-God |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |author= Daniel Francis Callahan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic peace churches===
[[File:Edward Hicks - Penn's Treaty.jpeg |thumb|right|[[Penn Treaty Park|Penn's Treaty]] with the Indians. This treaty was never violated.]]
Beginning in the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] gave rise to a variety of new Christian sects, including the [[Peace churches|historic peace churches]]. Foremost among them were the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]] and [[Church of the Brethren]]. The Quakers were prominent advocates of pacifism, who as early as 1660 had repudiated violence in all forms and adhered to a strictly pacifist interpretation of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quaker Traditions of Pacifism and Nonviolence |url= http://events.stanford.edu/events/352/35227/ |author= Eric Roberts |publisher= Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the many 18th century wars in which Britain participated, the Quakers maintained a principled commitment [[Conscientious objector|not to serve in the army and militia]] or even to pay the alternative £10 fine.

=== 18th century ===
The 18th-century peace movements were products of two strands of thought that coalesced at the end of the 18th century. One, rooted in the secular [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], promoted peace as the rational antidote to the world's ills, while the other was a part of the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical religious revival]] that had played an important part in the campaign for the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. Representatives of the former, included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], in ''Extrait du Projet de Paix Perpetuelle de Monsieur l'Abbe Saint-Pierre'' (1756),&lt;ref&gt;Hinsley, pp. 46-61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''Thoughts on Perpetual Peace''.&lt;ref&gt;Hinsley,
pp.62-80.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jeremy Bentham]] who proposed the formation of a peace association in 1789. Representative of the latter, was [[William Wilberforce]] who thought that strict limits should be imposed on British involvement in the [[French Revolutionary War]] based on Christian ideals of peace and brotherhood.

===Peace movements===
During the period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], although no formal peace movement was established until the end of hostilities, a significant peace movement animated by universalist ideals did emerge, due to the perception of Britain fighting in a [[reactionary]] role and the increasingly visible impact of the war on the welfare of the nation in the form of higher taxation levels and high casualty rates. Sixteen peace petitions to [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] were signed by members of the public, anti-war and anti-[[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] demonstrations convened and peace literature was widely published and disseminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lx4xr3PsdI8C&amp;dq=freemason+hall+1843+london+peace&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Origins of War Prevention: The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1730–1854|author=Ceadel, Martin|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press,|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Richard, Vanity Fair, 1880-09-04.jpg|thumb|"Peace". Caricature of [[Henry Richard]], a prominent advocate of pacifism in the mid-19th century.]]
The first peace movements appeared in 1815–16. In the [[United States]] the first such movement was the [[New York Peace Society]], founded in 1815 by the theologian [[David Low Dodge]], and the [[Massachusetts Peace Society]]. It became an active organization, holding regular weekly meetings, and producing literature which was spread as far as [[Gibraltar]] and [[Malta]], describing the horrors of war and advocating pacificism on [[Christianity|Christian]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism to 1914 : an overview'' by Peter Brock. Toronto, Thistle Printing, 1994. (pp. 38-9).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peace Society|London Peace Society]] (also known as the Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace) was formed in 1816 to promote permanent and universal peace by the [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]]. In the 1840s, British women formed "Olive Leaf Circles", groups of around 15 to 20 women, to discuss and promote pacifist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''The Long Road to Greenham : Feminism and Anti-Militarism in Britain since 1820'', by [[Jill Liddington]]. London, Virago, 1989 {{ISBN|0-86068-688-4}} (pp. 14-5).&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace movement began to grow in influence by the mid nineteenth century. The London Peace Society, under the initiative of [[Elihu Burritt]] and [[Henry Richard]], convened the first [[International Peace Congress]] in London in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Peace.html?id=JCgvvXUzu-oC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas|author=Cortright, David|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The congress decided on two aims: the ideal of peaceable arbitration in the affairs of nations and the creation of an international institution to achieve that. [[Henry Richard|Richard]] became the secretary of the Peace Society in 1850 on a full-time basis, a position which he would keep for the next 40 years, earning himself a reputation as the 'Apostle of Peace'. He helped secure one of the earliest victories for the peace movement by securing a commitment from the [[Great Power]]s in the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] at the end of the [[Crimean War]], in favour of arbitration. On the European continent, wracked by [[1848 Revolution|social upheaval]], the first peace congress was held in [[Brussels]] in 1848 followed by [[Paris]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gustave Moynier and the peace societies|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jnaw.htm|publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]|author=André Durand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After experiencing a recession in support due to the resurgence of militarism during the [[American Civil War]] and [[Crimean War]], the movement began to spread across Europe and began to infiltrate the new [[working class]] [[socialism|socialist]] movements. In 1870, [[Randal Cremer]] formed the [[International Arbitration League|Workman's Peace Association]] in London. Cremer, alongside the French economist [[Frédéric Passy]] was also the founding father of the first international organisation for the arbitration of conflicts in 1889, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]. The [[National Peace Council]] was founded in after the 17th [[Universal Peace Congress]] in London (July August 1908).

===Nonviolent resistance===
[[File:Gandhi spinning.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi]], leader of the [[Indian independence movement]] and advocate of [[nonviolent resistance]].]]
[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (1869–1948) of India was one of the most influential spokesman for peace and non-violence in the 20th century. ''[[Gandhism]]'' comprises the ideas and principles Gandhi promoted. Of central importance is nonviolent resistance.  M.M. Sankhdher argues that Gandhism is not a systematic position in metaphysics or in political philosophy. Rather, it is a political creed, an economic doctrine, a religious outlook, a moral precept, and especially, a humanitarian world view. It is an effort not to systematize wisdom but to transform society and is based on an undying faith in the goodness of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;M.M. Sankhdher, "Gandhism: A Political Interpretation", ''Gandhi Marg'' (1972) pp. 68–74&lt;/ref&gt;  Gandhi was strongly influenced by the pacifist ideas of Russian novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In 1908 Tolstoy wrote ''[[A Letter to a Hindu]],'' which said that only by using love as a weapon through [[passive resistance]] could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi and Tolstoy began a correspondence regarding practical and theological applications of non-violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy: Letters |editor=Murthy, B. Srinivasa |year= 1987|isbn=0-941910-03-2|url=http://bsmurthy.com/download/Mahatma_Gandhi_Leostoy_Letters_by_BSM.pdf|publisher=Long Beach Publications|location=Long Beach, California|accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gandhi saw himself a disciple of Tolstoy, for they agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance.  However, they differed sharply on political strategy. Gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force. He was also willing to compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Green, Martin Burgess |title=The origins of nonviolence: Tolstoy and Gandhi in their historical settings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0luAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 January 2012|year=1986|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=978-0-271-00414-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi was the first to apply the principle of nonviolence on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Asirvatham|first =Eddy|title =Political Theory|publisher=S.chand|isbn=81-219-0346-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[nonviolence]] (''[[ahimsa]]'') and [[nonresistance]] has a long history in Indian religious thought and has had many revivals in Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Jewish and Christian contexts. Gandhi explains his philosophy and way of life in his autobiography ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]]''. Some of his other remarks were widely quoted, such as "There are many causes that I am prepared to die for but no causes that I am prepared to kill for."&lt;ref&gt;James Geary, ''Geary's Guide to the World's Great Aphorists'' (2007) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi realized later that this level of nonviolence required incredible faith and courage, which he believed everyone did not possess. He therefore advised that everyone need not keep to nonviolence, especially if it were used as a cover for cowardice, saying, "where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence."&lt;ref name="Borman1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Borman|title=Gandhi and non-violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6DE9OUvrTEC&amp;pg=PA253|year=1986|publisher=SUNY Press|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faisal Devji, ''The Impossible Indian: Gandhi and the Temptation of Violence'' (Harvard University Press; 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi came under political fire for his criticism of those who attempted to achieve independence through more violent means.  Gandhi responded,  "There was a time when people listened to me because I showed them how to give fight to the British without arms when they had no arms [...] but today I am told that my non-violence can be of no avail against the [Hindu–Moslem riots] and, therefore, people should arm themselves for self-defense."&lt;ref&gt;reprinted in [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0394714660/ Louis Fischer, ed. ''The Essential Gandhi: An Anthology of His Writings on His Life, Work, and Ideas''] 2002 (reprint edition) p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi's views came under heavy criticism in Britain when it was under attack from [[Nazi Germany]]. He told the British people in 1940, "I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them."&lt;ref name="Wolpert2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=Gandhi's passion: the life and legacy of Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ih1VCqkUr4gC&amp;pg=PA197|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenge of World War I===
[[File:The Deserter.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|''The Deserter'' (1916) by [[Boardman Robinson]].]]
Although the onset of the [[First World War]] was generally greeted with enthusiastic patriotism across Europe, peace groups were still active in condemning the war. Many [[socialism|socialist]] groups and movements were [[antimilitarist]], arguing that war by its nature was a type of governmental coercion of the [[working class]] for the benefit of [[capitalism|capitalist]] elites.

[[File:Peace-Marcher.jpg|thumb|left|200x200px|A World War I-era female peace protester.]]
In 1915 the [[League of Nations Society]] was formed by British [[liberalism|liberal]] leaders to promote a strong international organisation that could enforce the peaceful resolution of conflict. Later that year the [[League to Enforce Peace]] was established in America to promote similar goals. [[Hamilton Holt]] published an editorial in his New York City weekly magazine the ''Independent'' called "The Way to Disarm: A Practical Proposal" on September 28, 1914. It called for an international organization to agree upon the arbitration of disputes and to guarantee the territorial integrity of its members by maintaining military forces sufficient to defeat those of any non-member. The ensuing debate among prominent internationalists modified Holt's plan to align it more closely with proposals offered in Great Britain by [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|Viscount James Bryce]], a former ambassador from the UK to the US.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, 56-7&lt;/ref&gt; These and other initiatives were pivotal in the change in attitudes that gave birth to the [[League of Nations]] after the war.

Some of the many groups that protested against the war, as well as the traditional peace churches, were the [[Woman's Peace Party]] (which was organized in 1915 and led by noted reformer [[Jane Addams]]), the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP) (also organized in 1915),&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.binghamton.edu/womhist/milit/intro.htm Pacifism vs. Patriotism in Women's Organizations in the 1920s] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20021108014655/http://www.binghamton.edu/womhist/milit/intro.htm |date=2002-11-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Union Against Militarism]], the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]], and the [[American Friends Service Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5215/is_2002/ai_n19132457/pg_2 Chatfield, Charles, “Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy” 2002].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeannette Rankin]], the first woman elected to Congress, was another fierce advocate of pacifism, the only person to vote no to America's entrance into both World Wars.

===Interwar period===
The immense loss of life during the war, for what became regarded as futile reasons, caused a sea-change in public attitudes to militarism. Organisations formed in this period included the [[War Resisters' International]]&lt;ref&gt;''Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 1915–1963'' by Scott H. Bennett. New York, Syracuse  University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8156-3028-X}}, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], the [[No More War Movement]] and the [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU). The [[League of Nations]] also convened several disarmament conferences in the inter-war period such as the [[Geneva Naval Conference|Geneva Conference]].

[[Image:Prats-de-Mollo Children's Home.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Refugees from the Spanish Civil War at the [[War Resisters' International]] children's refuge in the French Pyrenees.]]
Pacifism and revulsion with war were very popular sentiments in 1920s Britain. A stream of novels and poems on the theme of the futility of war and the slaughter of the youth by old fools were published, including, [[Death of a Hero]] by [[Richard Aldington]], [[Erich Remarque]]'s translated [[All Quiet on the Western Front]] and [[Beverley Nichols]]'s expose, ''Cry Havoc''. A debate at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1933 on the motion 'one must fight for King and country' captured the changed mood when the motion was resoundingly defeated. [[Hugh Richard Lawrie Sheppard|Dick Sheppard]] established the [[Peace Pledge Union]] in 1934 totally renouncing war and aggression. The idea of collective security was also popular; instead of outright pacifism the public generally exhibited a determination to stand up to aggression, but preferably with the use of economic sanctions and multilateral negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Hom-c5.html|title=Pacifism|publisher=[[University of Wellington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish Civil War]] proved a major test for international pacifism, and the work of pacifist organisations (such as [[War Resisters' International]] and the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]]) and individuals (such as [[José Brocca]] and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón|Amparo Poch]]). Shortly after the war ended, [[Simone Weil]], despite having volunteered for service on the republican side, went on to publish ''[[The Iliad or the Poem of Force]]'', a work that has been described as a pacifist manifesto.&lt;ref name = "NYB"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=4551|title= War and the Iliad|publisher=The New York Review of books|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the threat of fascism, some pacifist thinkers, such as [[Richard B. Gregg]], devised plans for a campaign of [[nonviolent resistance]] in the event of a fascist invasion or takeover.&lt;ref&gt;Lynd, Staughton. ''Nonviolence in America: a documentary history'', Bobbs-Merrill, 1966, (pps. 271-296).&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Berkeley, California. University of California Student Peace Strike. About half of the students assembled at the... - NARA - 532103.tif|thumb|200px|A peace strike rally at [[University of California]], Berkeley, April 1940.]]
With the start of [[World War II]], pacifist and anti-war sentiment declined in nations affected by war. Even the communist-controlled [[American Peace Mobilization]] reversed its anti-war activism once Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. After the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], mainstream [[isolationist]] groups like the [[America First Committee]], declined, but many smaller religious and socialist groups continued their opposition to war. [[Bertrand Russell]] argued that the necessity of defeating [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] was a unique circumstance where war was not the worst of the possible evils; he called his position ''relative pacifism''. [[H. G. Wells]], who had joked after the armistice ending [[World War I]] that the British had suffered more from the war than they would have from submission to [[Germany]], urged in 1941 a large-scale British offensive on the continent of Europe to combat Hitler and [[Nazism]].{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Similarly [[Albert Einstein]] wrote: "I loathe all armies and any kind of violence; yet I'm firmly convinced that at present these hateful weapons offer the only effective protection."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on [http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/infodocs/people/pp-einstein2.html Albert Einstein] at Peace Pledge Union, and but also discussed in detail in articles in Einstein, Albert (1954), ''Ideas and Opinions'', New York: Random House, {{ISBN|0-517-00393-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French pacifists [[André and Magda Trocmé]] helped conceal hundreds of Jews fleeing the Nazis in the village
of [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]].&lt;ref name="pph"&gt;''Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed: The Story of Le Chambon and How Goodness Happened There'' Philip P. Hallie, (1979)  New York: Harper &amp; Row, {{ISBN|0-06-011701-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the Trocmés were declared [[Righteous Among the Nations]].&lt;ref name="pph" /&gt;

Pacifists in the [[Third Reich]] were dealt with harshly; German pacifist [[Carl von Ossietzky]],&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Olaf Kullmann]], a Norwegian pacifist active during the Nazi occupation,&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Socknat, pp. 402-3.&lt;/ref&gt; were both imprisoned in concentration camps and died as a result of their mistreatment there. Austrian farmer [[Franz Jägerstätter]] was executed in 1943 for refusing to serve in the [[Wehrmacht]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[In Solitary Witness: The Life and Death of Franz Jägerstätter]]'' by [[Gordon Zahn]]. Springfield, Illinois: Templegate Publishers. {{ISBN|0-87243-141-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were [[conscientious objectors]] and war [[tax resisters]] in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].  The United States government allowed sincere objectors to serve in noncombatant military roles. However, those [[draft dodgers|draft resisters]] who refused any cooperation with the war effort often spent much of each war in federal prisons. During World War II, pacifist leaders like [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Ammon Hennacy]] of the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] urged young Americans not to enlist in military service.

Since World War II, the peace movement has become widespread throughout the world, and its previously radical doctrines are now a part of mainstream political discourse.

===Anti-nuclear movement===
{{See also|History of the anti-nuclear movement|Anti-nuclear movement}}
[[Image:Operation Upshot-Knothole - Badger 001.jpg|thumb|A nuclear fireball lights up the night in a United States [[nuclear weapons test]].]]
Peace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified "Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs". Japanese opposition to the Pacific nuclear weapons tests was widespread, and "an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons".&lt;ref name=falkj&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] held an inaugural public meeting at [[Central Hall, Westminster]], on 17 February 1958, attended by five thousand people. After the meeting a few hundred left to demonstrate at [[Downing Street]].&lt;ref name=Minnion&gt;John Minnion and Philip Bolsover (eds.) ''The CND Story'', Alison and Busby, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85031-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |title=Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514024607/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CND's declared policies were the unconditional renunciation of the use, production of or dependence upon nuclear weapons by Britain and the bringing about of a general disarmament convention.  In the meantime, Britain should halt the flight of planes armed with nuclear weapons, end nuclear testing, not proceed with missile bases and not provide nuclear weapons to any other country.

The first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]] was organised by the CND and took place at [[Easter]] 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from [[Trafalgar Square]], London, to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] close to [[Aldermaston]] in [[Berkshire]], England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=CND&gt;[http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html A brief history of CND]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianUnlimited:1958&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | title = Early defections in march to Aldermaston | date = 1958-04-05 | url = http://century.guardian.co.uk/1950-1959/Story/0,,105488,00.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.&lt;ref name=falkj/&gt; 
The formation of [[CND]] tapped widespread popular fear and opposition to nuclear weapons following the development of the first [[hydrogen bomb]], and in the late 1950s and early 1960s anti-nuclear marches attracted large followings, especially to the annual Aldermaston march at Easter.

Popular opposition to nuclear weapons produced a Labour Party resolution for unilateral nuclear disarmament at the 1960 Party Conference, but it was overturned the following year and did not appear on later agendas. This experience disillusioned many anti-nuclear protesters with the Labour Party, in whom they had previously put their hopes. Subsequently, there was a strong anti-parliamentary current in the British peace movement, and it has been argued that during the 1960s anarchism became as influential as socialism.

Two years after the formation of CND [[Bertrand Russell]], its president, resigned to form the Committee of 100, which was to undertake civil disobedience in the form of sit-down demonstrations in central London and at nuclear bases around the UK. Russell said that these were needed because the press had grown indifferent to CND and because large-scale direct action could force the government to change its policy.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, "Civil Disobedience", ''New Statesman'', 17 February 1961&lt;/ref&gt; A hundred prominent people, many in the arts, put their names to the organisation. Very large numbers of demonstrators were essential to this strategy, but the violence of the police, the arrest and imprisonment of demonstrators, and pre-emptive arrests for conspiracy made support dwindle rapidly. Although several eminent people took part in sit-down demonstrations (including Russell, whose imprisonment at the age of 89 was widely reported) many of the 100 signatories were inactive.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Myers, "Civil Disobedience and Organizational Change: The British Committee of 100", ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 86, No. 1. (Mar., 1971), pp. 92–112&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Committee of 100 had a non-hierarchical structure and no formal membership, many local groups sprang up calling themselves [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]]. This helped the promulgation of civil disobedience but it produced policy confusion and, as the decade progressed, Committee of 100 groups engaged in actions on many social issues not directly related to war and peace.

[[Image:Women Strike for Peace NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|Women Strike for Peace during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]]]
In the United States, in 1961, at the height of the [[Cold War]], about 50,000 women brought together by [[Women Strike for Peace]] marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against [[nuclear weapons]]. It was the largest national women's [[peace march|peace protest]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=dagmar2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-dagmar-wilson-20110130,0,5499397.story |title=Dagmar Wilson dies at 94; organizer of women's disarmament protesters |author=Woo, Elaine |date=January 30, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/us/24wilson.html |title=Dagmar Wilson, Anti-Nuclear Leader, Dies at 94 |author=Hevesi, Dennis |date=January 23, 2011  |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Linus Pauling and his wife presented the United Nations with the petition signed by more than 11,000 scientists calling for an end to [[nuclear testing|nuclear-weapon testing]].

===Vietnam War Protests===
{{Main|Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War}}
[[File:Vietnam War protestors at the March on the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|right|Protests against the Vietnam War in Washington, D.C., on October 21, 1967]]
The peace movement began in the 1960s in the United States in opposition to U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. Some advocates within this movement advocated a unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces from [[South Vietnam]].

The first U.S. anti-Vietnam protest was led in 1962 by [[Sam Marcy]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} founder of [[Workers World Party]], a demonstration whose importance was noted by [[Ho Chi Minh]] in an interview published in the [[National Guardian]] newspaper.

[[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|Opposition to the Vietnam War]] tended to unite groups opposed to U.S. anti-communism, [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] and, for those involved with the [[New Left]], [[capitalism]] itself, such as the [[Catholic Worker Movement]]. Others, such as [[Stephen Spiro]] opposed the war based on the theory of [[Just War]].

In 1965 the movement began to gain national prominence. Provocative actions by police and by protesters turned anti-war demonstrations in Chicago at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] into a riot. Explosive news reports of American [[military abuses]], such as the 1968 [[My Lai Massacre]], brought new attention and support to the anti-war movement bringing it to its height. The movement continued to prosper over the span of the conflict.

High-profile opposition to the Vietnam war turned to street protests in an effort to turn U.S. political opinion against the war. The protests gained momentum from the [[Civil Rights Movement]] that had organized to oppose [[Racial segregation|segregation]] laws, which had laid a foundation of theory and infrastructure on which the anti-war movement grew. Protests were fueled by a growing network of independently published newspapers (known as "underground papers") and the timely advent of large venue rock'n'roll festivals such as [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] and [[Grateful Dead]] shows, attracting younger people in search of generational togetherness. The movement progressed from college campuses to middle-class suburbs, government institutions, and [[labor unions]].

[[File:Peace &amp; Love Rally 2015 Stockholm (5).JPG|thumb|'''Sweden:''' [[Stockholm]]'s ''Peace and Love Rally'' through the south side of the city drew hundreds of marchers and celebrants in May 2015]]

===Canada===
[[Agnes Macphail]], a Canadian pacifist, was the first woman to be elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. Macphail objected to the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in 1931 on pacific grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Preston `Canada`s RMC: A History of the Royal Military College` (University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Macphail was also the first Canadian woman delegate to the League of Nations, where she worked with the World Disarmament Committee. Although a pacifist, she voted for Canada to enter [[World War II]].

The [[Canadian Peace Congress]] (1949–1990) was a leading organizer in the peace movement for many years, particularly when it was under the leadership of [[James Gareth Endicott]] who was its president until 1971.

Currently, Canada has a diverse peace movement, with coalitions and networks in many cities, towns and regions. The largest cross-country umbrella coalition is the [[Canadian Peace Alliance]], whose 140 member groups include large city-based coalitions, small grassroots groups, national and local unions, faith, environmental, and student groups, with a combined membership of over 4 million Canadians. The Canadian Peace Alliance has been a leading voice, along with its member groups opposing the "War on Terror". In particular, the CPA opposes Canada's participation in the war in Afghanistan and Canadian complicity in what it views as misguided and destructive U.S. foreign policy.

Canada has also been home to a growing movement of Palestinian solidarity, marked by an increasing number of grassroots Jewish groups opposed to Israel's policies, in many cases likening them to Apartheid, war crimes, and ethnic cleansing.

===Germany===
During the Cold War (1947–89), the West German peace movement concentrated on  the abolition of nuclear technology, particularly weapons, from [[West Germany]] and Europe. Most activists stridently attacked both the United States and Soviet Union. Conservative critics repeatedly warned it was infiltrated by agents from the East German secret police, the [[Stasi]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried von Bredow, "The Peace Movement in the Federal Republic of Germany," ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'' (1982) 9#1 pp 33-48&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1989, the cause of peace was espoused by [[Green parties]] across Europe.  It sometimes exercised significant influence over policy, e.g., as during 2002 when the [[German Greens]] influenced German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] to oppose involvement in Iraq. The Greens controlled of the German Foreign Ministry under [[Joschka Fischer]] (a Green and the single most popular politician in Germany at the time). Fischer sought to limit German involvement in the [[War on Terrorism]]; he joined with French President [[Jacques Chirac]] whose opposition in the [[UN Security Council]] was decisive in limiting support for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. plan to invade Iraq]].

===Israel===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
{{Main|Projects working for peace among Arabs and Israelis}}
The [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] have existed since the inception of [[Zionism]], and especially since the 1948 formation of the state of [[Israel]], and the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. The mainstream peace movement in Israel is [[Peace Now]] (''Shalom Akhshav''), whose supporters tend to vote for the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labour Party]] or [[Meretz]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Peace Now]] was founded in the aftermath of Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]'s historic visit to Jerusalem, when many people felt that the chance for peace might be missed. PM Begin acknowledged that the Peace Now rally in Tel Aviv at the eve of his departure for the [[Camp David]] Summit with Presidents Sadat and Carter—drawing a crowd of 100,000, the largest peace rally in Israel until then—had a part in his decision to withdraw from Sinai and dismantle Israeli settlements there. Peace Now supported Begin for a time, and hailed him as a peace-maker, but turned against him when withdrawal from Sinai was accompanied by an accelerated campaign of land confiscation and settlement building in the West Bank.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[File:settlements map eng.pdf|thumb|A map showing settlements in the [[West Bank]], produced by Peace Now.]]
Peace Now advocates a negotiated peace with the [[Palestinians]]. Originally this was worded vaguely, with no definition of who "the Palestinians" are and who represents them. Peace Now was quite tardy in joining the dialogue with the PLO, started by such groups as the Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace and the [[Hadash]] communist party. Only in 1988 did Peace Now accept that the PLO is the body regarded by the Palestinians themselves as their representative.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

During the first Intifada, Peace Now held numerous protests and rallies to protest the Israeli army and call for a negotiated withdrawal from the [[Palestinian territories]]. At the time Peace Now strongly targeted then for Defence Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] for his order to "break the bones of Palestinian stone-throwers". However, after Rabin became Prime Minister, signed the [[Oslo Agreement]] and shook [[Yasser Arafat]]'s hand on the White House lawn, Peace Now strongly supported him and mobilized public support for him. Peace Now had a central role in the November 4, 1995 rally after which Rabin was assassinated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Since then the annual Rabin memorial rallies, held every year at the beginning of November, have become the main event of the Israeli Peace Movement. While officially organized by the Rabin Family Foundation, Peace Now presence in these annual rallies is always conspicuous.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Nowadays, Peace Now is especially known for its struggle against the expansion of settlement outposts on the West Bank.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Gush Shalom]], the Israeli Peace Bloc, is a radical movement to the left of Peace Now. In its present name and structure, Gush Shalom grew out of the ''Jewish-Arab Committee Against Deportations'', which protested the deportation without trial of 415 Palestinian Islamic activists to Lebanon in December 1992, and erected a protest tent in front of the prime minister's office in Jerusalem for two months—until the government consented to let the deportees return. Members then decided to continue as a general peace movement with a program strongly opposing the occupation and advocating the creation of an independent Palestine side-by-side with Israel in its pre-1967 borders ("The [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]]") and with an undivided Jerusalem serving as the capital of both states.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

While existing under the name Gush Shalom only since 1992, this movement is in fact the lineal descendant of various groups, movements and action committees that espoused much the same program since 1967, and that occupied the same space on the political scene. In particular, Gush Shalom is the descendant of the ''Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace'' (ICIPP), which was founded in 1975. The ICIPP founders included: a group of dissidents from the Israeli establishment, among them were Major-General [[Mattityahu Peled]], who was member of the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] General Staff during the 1967 Six Day War and after being dishcarged from the army in 1969 turned increasingly in the direction of the left; Dr. [[Ya'akov Arnon]], a well-known economist who headed the Zionist Federation in the Netherlands before coming to Israel in 1948, and was for many years director-general of the Israeli Ministry of Finance and afterwards chaired the Board of Directors of the Israeli Electricity Company; and [[Aryeh Eliav]], who was secretary-general of the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labour Party]] until he broke with the then PM [[Golda Meir]] over the issue of whether or not a Palestinian People existed and had national rights.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

These three and some two hundred more people became radicalised and came to the conclusion that "arrogance was a threat to Israel's future and that dialogue with the Palestinians must be opened."{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} They came together with a group of younger, grassroots peace activists who had been active against Israeli occupation since 1967. The bridge between the two groups was [[Uri Avnery]], a well known muckraking journalist who had been member of the [[Knesset]] (Israeli Parliament) between 1965 and 1973, at the head of his own radical one-man party.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The main achievement of the ICIPP was the opening of dialogue with the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), with the aim of convincing the Israelis of the need to talk and reach a peace deal with the Palestinians, and conversely making Palestinians aware of the need to talk to and eventually reach a deal with Israel.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

At present, Gush Shalom activists are mainly involved in daily struggle at Palestinian villages that have their land confiscated by the [[West Bank barrier]], erected to stop suicide bombers. Gush activists are to be found, together with those of other Israeli movements like [[Ta'ayush]] and [[Anarchists Against the Wall]], joining the Palestinian villagers of [[Bil'in]] in the weekly protest marches held to protest confiscation of more than half of the village lands.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Although [[Gush Shalom]] earned itself respect among peace-seeking Israelis as well as in the [[United States]] and Europe, it is regarded by mainstream Israelis as a purely pro-Palestinian movement.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

After the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|Gaza War]] in 2014, a group of Israeli women founded the [[Women Wage Peace]] movement with the goal of reaching a "bilaterally acceptable" political peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://womenwagepeace.org.il/en/mission-statement/|title=Mission Statement {{!}} Women Wage Peace|work=Women Wage Peace|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While based mainly in Israel, the movement has worked to build connections with Palestinians, reaching out to women and men of many different religions and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/these-israeli-women-marched-from-the-lebanese-border-to-jerusalem-heres-why/2016/10/19/a9b67618-b92c-4c7a-9ad8-d992477e7db1_story.html|title=These Israeli women marched from the Lebanese border to Jerusalem.

===United Kingdom===
From 1934 the [[Peace Pledge Union]] gained many adherents to its pledge, "I renounce war and will never support or sanction another." Its support diminished considerably with the outbreak of war in 1939, but it remained the focus of pacifism in the post-war years.

Post–World War II peace-movement efforts in the United Kingdom were initially focused on the dissolution of the [[British Empire]] and the rejection of [[imperialism]] by the United States and [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]. The [[anti-nuclear movement]] sought to "opt out" of the [[Cold War]] and rejected such ideas as "Britain's Little Independent Nuclear Deterrent" in part on the grounds that it (BLIND) was in contradiction even with MAD.

The VSC ([[Vietnam Solidarity Campaign]]) led by [[Tariq Ali]] mounted several very large and violent demonstrations against the Vietnam war in 67/68 but the first anti Vietnam demonstration was at the American Embassy in London and took place in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;''Comment Magazine''. (Communist) {{cite web |url=http://www.library.law.ua.edu/spcoll/findaids/murpaid/murpaid4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828050250/http://www.library.law.ua.edu/spcoll/findaids/murpaid/murpaid4.htm |archivedate=2012-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Not-in-my-name banner, Stop The War demo.JPG|thumb|left|StWC Placard]]
The peace movement was later associated with the [[Peace camp]] movement as [[British Labour party|Labour]] moved "more to the centre" under Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. By early 2003, the peace and anti-war movement, mostly grouped together under the banner of the [[Stop the War Coalition]], was powerful enough to cause several of Blair's cabinet to resign, and hundreds of Labour Party MPs to vote against their government. Blair's motion to support militarily the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. plan to invade Iraq]] continued only due to support from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative Party]]. [[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|Protests against the invasion of Iraq]] were particularly vocal in Britain. Polls suggested that without [[UN Security Council]] approval, the UK public was very much opposed to involvement, and over two million people protested in Hyde Park (the previous largest demonstration in the UK having had around 600,000).

The peace movement has seen 'pop-up' newspapers, pirate radio stations and plays over the years. 

The primary function of the National Peace Congress was to provide opportunities for consultation and joint activities between its affiliated members, to help create an informed public opinion on the issues of the day and to convey to the government of the day the views of the substantial section of British life represented by its affiliated membership. The NPC folded in 2000 to be replaced in 2001 by [[Network for Peace]], which was set up to continue the networking role of NPC.

===United States===
{{main|Pacifism in the United States}}
{{See also|Opposition to war against Iran}}
During the tail end of the [[Cold War]], U.S. peace activists largely concentrated on slowing the [[Nuclear arms race|superpower arms race]] in the belief that this would reduce the possibility of nuclear war between the U.S. and the USSR. As the [[Reagan administration]] accelerated military spending and adopted a tough, challenging stance to the Russians, peace groups such as the [[Nuclear Freeze]] and Beyond War sought to educate the public on what they believed was the inherent riskiness and ruinous cost of this policy. Outreach to individual citizens in the Soviet Union and mass meetings, using then-new satellite link technology, were part of peacemaking activities in the 1980s. In 1981, [[Thomas (activist)|Thomas]] started the longest uninterrupted peace [[vigil]] in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=ColmanMcCarthy&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/07/AR2009020701843.html|title=From Lafayette Square Lookout, He Made His War Protest Permanent|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 8, 2009|author=[[Colman McCarthy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later joined at [[President's Park#Lafayette Square|Lafayette Square]] by anti-nuclear activists [[Concepcion Picciotto]] and [[Ellen Thomas]].&lt;ref name=Oracles&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710053132/http://aje.me/HHwQcE The Oracles of Pennsylvania Avenue]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Iraq's invasion of [[Kuwait]] in 1990, President [[George H. W. Bush]] began preparations for a mideast war. Peace activists were starting to find their groove just before the [[Gulf War]] was launched in February 1991, with well-attended rallies, especially on the west coast. However, the ground war was over in less than a week. A lopsided Allied victory and a media-incited wave of patriotic sentiment washed over the protest movement before it could develop traction.

During the 1990s, peacemakers' priorities included seeking a solution to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli–Palestinian impasse]], belated efforts at humanitarian assistance to war-torn regions such as Bosnia and Rwanda, and Iraq; American peace activists brought medicine into Iraq in defiance of U.S. law, in some cases enduring heavy fines and imprisonment in retaliation. Some of the principal groups involved were [[Voices in the Wilderness]] and the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]].

[[Image:NYC021503.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Protesters against the [[Iraq War]] in New York.]]
Before, during, and after the [[War in Iraq]] began, a concerted protest effort began in the United States. On [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|February 15, 2003]] a series of protests across the globe took place with events in approximately 800 cities. In March 2003, just before the U.S. and British Military led invasion of Iraq, a protest mobilization called "The World Says No to War" led to as many as 500,000 protestors in cities across the U.S. However, many protest organizations have persisted as the United States has maintained a military and corporate presence in Iraq.

U.S. activist groups including [[United for Peace and Justice]], [[Code Pink]] (Women Say No To War), [[Iraq Veterans Against the War]], [[Military Families Speak Out]] (MFSO), [[Not In Our Name]], [[A.N.S.W.E.R.]], [[Veterans for Peace]], and [[The World Can't Wait]] continued to protest against the [[Iraq War]]. Methods of protest include rallies and marches, impeachment petitions, the staging of a war-crimes tribunal in New York (to investigate crimes and alleged abuses of power of the Bush administration), bringing Iraqi women to tour the U.S. and tell their side of the story, street theater and independent filmmaking, high-profile appearances by anti-war activists such as [[Scott Ritter]], [[Janis Karpinski]], and [[Dahr Jamail]], resisting military recruiting on college campuses, withholding tax monies, mass letter-writing to legislators and newspapers, blogging, music, and guerrilla theater. Independent media producers continue to broadcast, podcast and Web-host programs about the movement against the Iraq War.

Starting in 2005, [[opposition to military action against Iran]] started in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, including the creation of the [[Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran]]. By August 2007, fears of an imminent United States and/or [[Israel]]i attack on [[Iran]] had increased to the level that several [[Nobel Prize]] winners, [[Shirin Ebadi]] (Nobel Peace Prize 2003), [[Mairead Corrigan|Mairead Corrigan-Maguire]] and [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]] (joint Nobel Peace Prize 1976), [[Harold Pinter]] (Nobel Prize for Literature 2005) and [[Jody Williams]] (Nobel Peace Prize 1997), along with several [[anti-war]] groups, including The Israeli Committee for a Middle East Free from Atomic, Biological and Chemical Weapons, [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran|CASMII]], [[Code Pink]] and many others, warned about what they believed was the imminent risk of a "war of an unprecedented scale, this time against Iran", especially expressing concern that an attack on Iran using [[nuclear weapon]]s had "not been ruled out". They called for "the dispute about [[Iran's nuclear program]], to be resolved through peaceful means" and a call for [[Israel]], "as the only Middle Eastern state [[Israel and weapons of mass destruction|suspected of possession of nuclear weapons]]", to join the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].&lt;ref name="ebadi_etal_nucfree_mideast"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =For a Middle East free of all Weapons of Mass Destruction | work =| publisher =[[Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran]]| date = 2007-08-06| url =http://www.campaigniran.org/casmii/index.php?q=node/2694 |format =| doi =| accessdate = 2007-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perturbation theory''' comprises mathematical methods for finding an [[approximation theory|approximate solution]] to a problem, by starting from the exact [[solution (equation)|solution]] of a related, simpler problem. A critical feature of the technique is a middle step that breaks the problem into "solvable" and "perturbation" parts.&lt;ref name="General Perturbations"&gt;{{cite book |isbn= 978-145378-1470|url= https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Astrodynamics-William-E-Wiesel/dp/1453781471/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400160278&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=modern+astrodynamics+wiesel |title=Modern Astrodynamics |author=William E. Wiesel |location=Ohio |publisher=Aphelion Press| year=2010 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perturbation theory is applicable if the problem at hand cannot be solved exactly, but can be formulated by adding a "small" term to the mathematical description of the exactly solvable problem.

Perturbation theory leads to an expression for the desired solution in terms of a [[formal power series]] in some "small" parameter – known as a '''perturbation series''' – that quantifies the deviation from the exactly solvable problem. The leading term in this power series is the solution of the exactly solvable problem, while further terms describe the deviation in the solution, due to the deviation from the initial problem. Formally, we have for the approximation to the full solution {{mvar|A}}, a series in the small parameter (here called {{mvar|ε}}), like the following:

:&lt;math&gt; A= A_0 + \varepsilon^1 A_1 + \varepsilon^2 A_2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

In this example, {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} would be the known solution to the exactly solvable initial problem and {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} represent the '''higher-order terms''' which may be found iteratively by some systematic procedure. For small {{mvar|ε}} these higher-order terms in the series become successively smaller.

An approximate "perturbation solution" is obtained by truncating the series, usually by keeping only the first two terms, the initial solution and the "first-order" perturbation correction
:&lt;math&gt;A \approx A_0 + \varepsilon A_1~.&lt;/math&gt;

==General description==
Perturbation theory is closely related to methods used in [[numerical analysis]]. The earliest use of what would now be called ''perturbation theory'' was to deal with the otherwise unsolvable mathematical problems of [[celestial mechanics]]: for example the [[orbit of the Moon]], which moves noticeably differently from a simple [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian ellipse]] because of the competing gravitation of the Earth and the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.70.589 Martin C. Gutzwiller, "Moon-Earth-Sun: The oldest three-body problem", Rev. Mod. Phys. 70, 589 – Published 1 April 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perturbation methods start with a simplified form of the original problem, which is ''simple enough'' to be solved exactly. In [[celestial mechanics]], this is usually a [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian ellipse]]. Under [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|non-relativistic gravity]], an ellipse is exactly correct when there are only two gravitating bodies (say, the Earth and the [[Moon]]) but not quite correct when there are [[three-body problem|three or more objects]] (say, the Earth, [[Moon]], [[Sun]], and the rest of the [[solar system]]) and not quite correct when the gravitational interaction is stated using formulations from [[General relativity]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The solved, but simplified problem is then ''"perturbed"'' to make the conditions that the perturbed solution actually satisfies closer to the formula in the original problem, such as including the gravitational attraction of a third body (the [[Sun]]). Typically, the "conditions" that represent reality are a formula (or several) that specifically express some physical law, like [[Newton's second law|Newton's second law, the force-acceleration equation]],
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of the example, the force {{math|'''F'''}} is calculated based on the number of gravitationally relevant bodies; the acceleration {{math|'''a'''}} is obtained, using calculus, from the path of the [[Moon]] in its orbit. Both of these come in two forms: approximate values for force and acceleration, which result from simplifications, and hypothetical exact values for force and acceleration, which would require the complete answer to calculate.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The slight changes that result from accommodating the perturbation, which themselves may have been simplified yet again, are used as corrections to the approximate solution. Because of simplifications introduced along every step of the way, the corrections are never perfect, and the conditions met by the corrected solution do not perfectly match the equation demanded by reality. However, even only one cycle of corrections often provides an excellent approximate answer to what the real solution should be.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

There is no requirement to stop at only one cycle of corrections. A partially corrected solution can be re-used as the new starting point for yet another cycle of perturbations and corrections. In principle, cycles of finding increasingly better corrections could go on indefinitely. In practice, one typically stops at one or two cycles of corrections. The usual difficulty with the method is that the corrections progressively make the new solutions very much more complicated, so each cycle is much more difficult to manage than the previous cycle of corrections. [[Isaac Newton]] is reported to have said, regarding the problem of the [[Moon]]'s orbit, that ''"It causeth my head to ache."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Cropper | first1=William H. | title=Great Physicists: The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | isbn=978-0-19-517324-6 | year=2004 | page=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This general procedure is a widely used mathematical tool in advanced sciences and engineering: start with a simplified problem and gradually add corrections that make the formula that the corrected problem becomes a closer and closer match to the original formula.

==Examples==
Examples for the "mathematical description" are:  an [[algebraic equation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.unm.edu/~lromero/2013/class_notes/poly.pdf L. A. Romero, "Perturbation theory for polynomials", Lecture Notes, University of New Mexico (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[differential equation]] (e.g., the [[equations of motion]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lehre/vorlesungen/sose_11/T1_Theoretische_Mechanik/vorlesung/anharmonic-perturbation.pdf Sergei Winitzki, "Perturbation theory for anharmonic oscillations", Lecture notes, LMU (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[wave equation]]), a [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] (in [[statistical mechanics]]), radiative transfer,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222659054_Radiative_perturbation_theory_A_review Michael A. Box, "Radiative perturbation theory: a review", Environmental Modelling &amp; Software 17 (2002) 95–106]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] operator (in [[quantum mechanics]]).

Examples for the kind of solution to be found perturbatively: the solution of the equation (e.g., the [[trajectory]] of a particle), the [[average|statistical average]] of some physical quantity (e.g., average magnetization), the [[ground state]] energy of a quantum mechanical problem.

Examples for the exactly solvable problems to start with: [[linear equation]]s, including linear equations of motion ([[harmonic oscillator]], [[linear wave equation]]), statistical or quantum-mechanical systems of non-interacting particles (or in general, Hamiltonians or free energies containing only terms quadratic in all degrees of freedom).

Examples of "perturbations" to deal with: Nonlinear contributions to the equations of motion, [[interaction]]s between particles, terms of higher powers in the Hamiltonian/Free Energy.

For physical problems involving interactions between particles, the terms of the perturbation series may be displayed (and manipulated) using [[Feynman diagram]]s.

==History==
Perturbation theory was first devised to solve [[Three-body problem|otherwise intractable problems]] in the calculation of the motions of planets in the solar system. For instance, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] explained the gravitation between two astronomical bodies, but when a third body is added, the problem was, "How does each body pull on each?" Newton's equation only allowed the mass of two bodies to be analyzed. The gradually increasing accuracy of [[astrometry|astronomical observations]] led to incremental demands in the accuracy of solutions to Newton's gravitational equations, which led several notable 18th and 19th&amp;nbsp;century mathematicians, such as [[Lagrange]] and [[Laplace]], to extend and generalize the methods of perturbation theory. These well-developed perturbation methods were adopted and adapted to solve new problems arising during the development of [[quantum mechanics]] in 20th&amp;nbsp;century atomic and subatomic physics. [[Paul Dirac]] developed perturbation theory in 1927 to evaluate when a particle would be emitted in radioactive elements. It was later named [[Fermi's golden rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bransden|first1=B. H.|last2=Joachain|first2=C. J.|title=Quantum Mechanics|edition=2nd|year=1999|isbn=978-0582356917|page=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dirac | first = P.A.M. | authorlink = Paul Dirac | title = The Quantum Theory of Emission and Absorption of Radiation | journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | volume = 114 | pages = 243–265 | date=1 March 1927| issue = 767 | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1927.0039 | jstor=94746|bibcode = 1927RSPSA.114..243D }} See equations (24) and (32).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings in the study of planetary motion===
Since the planets are very remote from each other, and since their mass is small as compared to the mass of the Sun, the gravitational forces between the planets can be neglected, and the planetary motion is considered, to a first approximation, as taking place along Kepler's orbits, which are defined by the equations of the [[two-body problem]], the two bodies being the planet and the Sun.&lt;ref name="EoM"&gt;Perturbation theory. N. N. Bogolyubov, jr. (originator), Encyclopedia of Mathematics. URL: http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=Perturbation_theory&amp;oldid=11676&lt;/ref&gt;

Since astronomic data came to be known with much greater accuracy, it became necessary to consider how the motion of a planet around the Sun is affected by other planets. This was the origin of the [[three-body problem]]; thus, in studying the system Moon–Earth–Sun the mass ratio between the Moon and the Earth was chosen as the small parameter. [[Lagrange]] and [[Laplace]] were the first to advance the view that the constants which describe the motion of a planet around the Sun are  "perturbed", as it were, by the motion of other planets and vary as a function of time; hence the name "perturbation theory".&lt;ref name="EoM" /&gt;

Perturbation theory was investigated by the classical scholars—[[Laplace]], [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]], [[Gauss]]—as a result of which the computations could be performed with a very high accuracy. [[Discovery of Neptune|The discovery of the planet Neptune]] in 1848 by [[Urbain Le Verrier]], based on the deviations in motion of the planet [[Uranus]] (he sent the coordinates to [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] who successfully observed Neptune through his telescope), represented a triumph of perturbation theory.&lt;ref name="EoM" /&gt;

==Perturbation orders==
The standard exposition of perturbation theory is given in terms of the ''order'' to which the perturbation is carried out: '''first-order perturbation theory''' or '''second-order perturbation theory''', and whether the perturbed states are degenerate, which requires '''[[singular perturbation]]'''. In the singular case extra care must be taken, and the theory is slightly more elaborate.

==In chemistry==
Many of the [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods]] use perturbation theory directly or are closely related methods. Implicit perturbation theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00428a004 | title = Theory of the Chemical Bond | year = 1976 | last1 = King | first1 = Matcha | journal = JACS | volume = 98 | issue = 12 | pages = 3415–3420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; works with the complete Hamiltonian from the very beginning and never specifies a perturbation operator as such. [[Møller&amp;ndash;Plesset perturbation theory]] uses the difference between the [[Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] Hamiltonian and the exact non-relativistic Hamiltonian as the perturbation. The zero-order energy is the sum of orbital energies. The first-order energy is the Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock energy and electron correlation is included at second-order or higher. Calculations to second, third or fourth order are very common and the code is included in most [[Computational chemistry#Software packages|ab initio quantum chemistry programs]]. A related but more accurate method is the [[coupled cluster]] method.

'''Plagiarism''' is the "wrongful appropriation" and "stealing and publication" of another [[author]]'s "language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions" and the representation of them as one's own [[original work]].&lt;ref name="RandomHouse95"&gt;From the 1995 ''[[Random House Dictionary of the English Language|Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one's own original work&lt;/blockquote&gt; qtd. in {{cite book | title = Library plagiarism policies | first = Vera | last= Stepchyshyn | first2 = Robert S. |last2= Nelson | publisher = Assoc. of College &amp; Resrch Libraries | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-8389-8416-9 | page = 65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHamIn5dPR8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OEDdef"&gt;From the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The action or practice of taking someone else's work, idea, etc., and passing it off as one's own; literary theft.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagiarism is considered [[academic dishonesty]] and a breach of [[journalistic ethics]]. It is subject to sanctions such as penalties, suspension, and even [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] from school or work. Recently, cases of "extreme plagiarism" have been identified in academia.&lt;ref name="O'Connor2015"&gt;O'Connor, Z (2015) ''Extreme plagiarism: The rise of the e-Idiot?'', International Journal of Learning in Higher Education, 20 (1), pp1-11. {{ISSN|2327-7955}} [https://www.academia.edu/9975666/Extreme_plagiarism_The_rise_of_the_e-Idiot_2015_]&lt;/ref&gt; The modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] emerged in Europe in the 18th century, particularly with the [[Romantic movement]].

Plagiarism is not in itself a [[crime]], but can constitute [[copyright infringement]]. In academia and industry, it is a serious [[Ethics|ethical]] offense.&lt;ref name="Lynch02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRN315562" /&gt; Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent, but they are not equivalent concepts, and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement, which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts. Plagiarism is not defined or punished by law, but rather by institutions (including professional associations, educational institutions, and commercial entities, such as publishing companies).

== Etymology ==
In the 1st century, the use of the Latin word ''plagiarius'' (literally "kidnapper") to denote stealing someone else's work was pioneered by the Roman poet [[Martial]], who complained that another poet had "kidnapped his verses". ''Plagiary'', a derivative of ''plagiarus'', was introduced into English in 1601 by dramatist [[Ben Jonson]] during the [[Jacobean Era]] to describe someone guilty of literary theft.&lt;ref name="Lynch02"&gt;Lynch (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valpy05"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Valpy | first=Francis Edward Jackson | date=2005 | title=Etymological Dictionary of the Latin Language | page=345 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsWzg7rTEa4C&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=etymology+plaga+net&amp;ei=JVxXSq2_GIiEywS8mPSyBw | access-date= | quote=entry for ''plagium'', quotation: "the crime of kidnapping."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The derived form ''plagiarism'' was introduced into English around 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=plagiarism |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin]] ''plagiārius'', "kidnapper", and ''plagium'', "kidnapping", have the root ''plaga'' ("snare", "net"), based on the [[Proto-Indo-European root|Indo-European root]] ''*-plak'', "to weave" (seen for instance in [[Greek language|Greek]] ''plekein'', Bulgarian "плета" ''pleta'', and Latin ''plectere'', all meaning "to weave").

== Legal aspects ==
Although plagiarism in some contexts is considered theft or stealing, the concept does not exist in a legal sense, although the use of someone else's work in order to gain academic credit may meet some legal definitions of [[fraud]].&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38|title=Handbook of Academic Integrity|first1=Philip M.|last1=Newton|first2=Christopher|last2=Lang|editor-first=Tracey|editor-last=Bretag|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Springer Singapore|pages=249–271|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Plagiarism" specifically is not mentioned in any current statute, either [[Criminal law|criminal]] or [[Civil law (common law)|civil]].&lt;ref name="Lands99"&gt;Lands, Robert (1999) [http://www.theaoi.com/articles/texts/1999/decplagiarism.html ''Plagiarism is no Crime''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101213001/http://www.theaoi.com/articles/texts/1999/decplagiarism.html |date=2011-01-01 }} published by The Association of Illustrators (AOI), December 1999. Quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;Plagiarism may be a taboo in academia, but in art is almost essential.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRN315562" /&gt; Some cases may be treated as [[unfair competition]] or a violation of the doctrine of [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]].&lt;ref name="SSRN315562"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Plagiarism, Norms, and the Limits of Theft Law: Some Observations on the Use of Criminal Sanctions in Enforcing Intellectual Property Rights | first = Stuart P. | last = Green | ssrn = 315562 | journal = Hastings Law Journal | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased availability of copyrighted material due to the development of information technology has furthered the debate as to whether copyright offences are criminal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In short, people are asked to use the guideline, "if you did not write it yourself, you must give credit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/education/02cheat.html | title = Plagiarism Lines Blur for Students in Digital Age | first = Trip | last = Gabriel | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagiarism is not the same as [[copyright infringement]]. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different concepts, and false claims of authorship generally constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent. Plagiarism, in contrast, is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation, or the obtaining of academic credit, that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Thus, plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist's audience (for example, a reader, listener, or teacher).

Plagiarism is also considered a moral offense against anyone who has provided the plagiarist with a benefit in exchange for what is specifically supposed to be original content (for example, the plagiarist's publisher, employer, or teacher). In such cases,  acts of plagiarism may sometimes also form part of a claim for [[breach of contract|breach]] of the plagiarist's contract, or, if done knowingly, for a [[Tort|civil wrong]].

== In academia and journalism ==
Within [[academia]], plagiarism by students, professors, or researchers is considered [[academic dishonesty]] or academic fraud, and offenders are subject to academic censure, up to and including [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]]. Some institutions use [[Plagiarism detection|plagiarism detection software]] to uncover potential plagiarism and to deter students from plagiarizing. Some universities address the issue of academic integrity by providing students with thorough orientations, required writing courses, and clearly articulated honor codes{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Indeed, there is a virtually uniform understanding among college students that plagiarism is wrong{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

An extreme form of plagiarism, known as [[contract cheating]] involves students paying someone else, such as an [[essay mill]], to do their work for them.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com" /&gt;

In [[journalism]], plagiarism is considered a breach of [[journalistic ethics]], and reporters caught plagiarizing typically face disciplinary measures ranging from suspension to termination of employment{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Some individuals caught plagiarizing in academic or journalistic contexts claim that they plagiarized unintentionally, by failing to include [[quotation]]s or give the appropriate [[citation]]. While plagiarism in scholarship and journalism has a centuries-old history, the development of the [[Internet]], where articles appear as electronic text, has made the physical act of copying the work of others much easier.&lt;ref&gt;Susan D.

=== Academia ===
[[File:Example-of-Article-Plagiarism-Diagram.png|thumb|One form of academic plagiarism involves appropriating a published article and modifying it slightly to avoid suspicion.]] No universally adopted definition of academic plagiarism exists&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, S. E. (2017). [https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/1880/106472/Eaton-2017.pdf?sequence=2 Comparative Analysis of Institutional Policy Definitions of Plagiarism: A Pan-Canadian University Study]. ''Interchange: A Quarterly Review of Education, 48''(3), 271-281. doi:10.1007/s10780-017-9300-7&lt;/ref&gt;; however, this section provides several definitions to exemplify the most common characteristics of academic plagiarism.

According to Bela Gipp&lt;ref name="Gipp14"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gipp | first = Bela |
url=https://www.springer.com/springer+vieweg/it+%26+informatik/k%C3%BCnstliche+intelligenz/book/978-3-658-06393-1 |title=Citation-based Plagiarism Detection: Detecting Disguised and Cross-language Plagiarism using Citation Pattern Analysis | publisher = Springer Vieweg | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-3-658-06393-1}} p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  academic plagiarism encompasses:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The use of ideas, concepts, words, or structures &lt;br /&gt; without appropriately acknowledging the source &lt;br /&gt; to benefit in a setting where originality is expected."&lt;ref name="Gipp14" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The definition by B. Gipp is an abridged version of Teddi Fishman's definition of plagiarism, which proposed five elements characteristic of plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Fishman09"&gt;{{cite news | last = Fishman | first = Teddi | url = http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/09-4apcei/4apcei-Fishman.pdf |format=PDF|title=We know it when we see it is not good enough:  toward a standard definition of plagiarism that transcends theft, fraud, and copyright | publisher = Proceedings of the 4th Asia Pacific Conference on Educational Integrity |date=Sep 28–30, 2009}} p.5&lt;/ref&gt; According to T. Fishman, plagiarism occurs when someone:
#  Uses words, ideas, or work products
#  Attributable to another identifiable person or source
#  Without attributing the work to the source from which it was obtained
#  In a situation in which there is a legitimate expectation of original authorship
#  In order to obtain some benefit, credit, or gain which need not be monetary&lt;ref name="Fishman09" /&gt;

Furthermore, plagiarism is defined differently among institutions of higher learning and universities:

* [[Stanford University|Stanford]] sees plagiarism as the "use, without giving reasonable and appropriate credit to or acknowledging the author or source, of another person's original work, whether such work is made up of code, formulas, ideas, language, research, strategies, writing or other form."&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/judicialaffairs/integrity/plagiarism "What is Plagiarism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026061453/http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/judicialaffairs/integrity/plagiarism |date=2012-10-26 }}. Stanford University. 2012-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yale University|Yale]] views plagiarism as the "... use of another's work, words, or ideas without attribution," which includes "... using a source's language without quoting, using information from a source without attribution, and paraphrasing a source in a form that stays too close to the original."
* [[Princeton University|Princeton]] perceives plagiarism as the "deliberate" use of "someone else's language, ideas, or other original (not common-knowledge) material without acknowledging its source."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wpacouncil.org/positions/WPAplagiarism.pdf "Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices"]. Princeton University. 2012-07-27&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Oxford College of Emory University]] characterizes plagiarism as the use of "a writer's ideas or phraseology without giving due credit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxford.emory.edu/audiences/current_students/Academic/academic-success/student-honor-code/ "Student Honor Code"]. Emory: Oxford College. 2012-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brown University|Brown]] defines plagiarism as "... appropriating another person's ideas or words (spoken or written) without attributing those word or ideas to their true source."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/libweb/plagiarism.php "What is plagiarism?"]. Brown University Library. 2012-07-27&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United States Naval Academy|The U.S. Naval Academy]] defines plagiarism as "the use of the words, information, insights, or ideas of another without crediting that person through proper citation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://libguides.usna.edu/c.php?g=410493&amp;p=2795948 USNA Statements on Plagiarism - Avoiding Plagiarism] US Naval Academy, Retrieved April 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Common forms of student plagiarism ====

According to a 2015 survey of teachers and professors by [[Turnitin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Plagiarism Spectrum |url=http://go.turnitin.com/paper/plagiarism-spectrum |publisher=Turnitin |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are 10 main forms of plagiarism that students commit:
&lt;!--THERE ARE PUBLISHED WORKS ON THIS, WHY ARE WE CITING THIS LOCAL UNIVERSITY WEB INFORMATION? SEE LIPSON'S WORK AT https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Honest-Work-College-Plagiarism/dp/0226484777, AND OTHER SUCH SOURCES.--&gt;
# Submitting someone's work as their own.
# Taking passages from their own previous work without adding citations.
# Re-writing someone's work without properly citing sources.
# Using quotations, but not citing the source.
# Interweaving various sources together in the work without citing.
# Citing some, but not all passages that should be cited.
# Melding together cited and uncited sections of the piece.
# Providing proper citations, but fails to change the structure and wording of the borrowed ideas enough.
# Inaccurately citing the source.
# Relying too heavily on other people's work. Fails to bring original thought into the text.

==== Sanctions for student plagiarism ====
In the academic world, plagiarism by students is usually considered a very serious offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Generally, the punishment increases as a person enters higher institutions of learning{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study did not have a good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were very confident that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education|journal = Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|first=Philip|last=Newton|date=2 April 2016|volume=41|issue=3|pages=482–497|doi=10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.

For cases of repeated plagiarism, or for cases in which a student commits severe plagiarism (e.g., purchasing an assignment), suspension or [[Expulsion (education)|expulsion]] may occur. There has been historic concern about inconsistencies in penalties administered for university student plagiarism, and a plagiarism tariff was devised in 2008 for UK higher education institutions in an attempt to encourage some standardization of approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.plagiarismadvice.org/BTariff.pdf |title=Benchmark Plagiarism Tariff |first1=Peter |last1=Tennant |first2=Gill |last2=Rowell |year=2009–2010 |website=plagiarism advice.org |publisher=iParadigms Europe |format=PDF |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, to impose sanctions, plagiarism needs to be detected. Strategies faculty members use to detect plagiarism include carefully reading students work and making note of inconsistencies in student writing, citation errors and providing plagiarism prevention education to students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Colella-Sandercock, J. A., &amp; Alahmadi, H. W. (2015). Plagiarism education: Strategies for instructors. ''International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research, 13''(1), 76-84. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter/article/view/395/190&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that a significant share of (university) teachers do not use detection methods such as using text-matching software.&lt;ref name="Sattler2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/03075079.2015.1085007|title = The use frequency of 10 different methods for preventing and detecting academic dishonesty and the factors influencing their use| journal=Studies in Higher Education| volume=42| issue=6| pages=1126–1144|year = 2017|last1 = Sattler|first1 = Sebastian| last2=Wiegel| first2=Constantin| last3=Veen| first3=Floris van}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few more try to detect plagiarism by reading term-papers specifically for plagiarism, while the latter method might be not very effective in detecting plagiarism – especially when plagiarism from unfamiliar sources needs to be detected.&lt;ref name="Sattler2015" /&gt; There are checklists of tactics to prevent student plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Practical Prevention of Plagiarism for University Faculty &amp; Management – 14 Tactics|last=Dawes|first=John|date=20 July 2018|ssrn = 3209034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criminal and negative behaviour by diploma mills ====
{{one source|section|date=May 2017}}
There are allegations that some diploma mills{{discuss|diploma mills (sic)}} take students' money for essays, then produce a low standard essay or close their websites without providing the purchased essay.  Students then have little time to provide an essay before a deadline.  Also diploma mills have allegedly [[blackmail]]ed students demanding more money than was originally agreed and threatening to reveal plagiarism to the university unless more money is paid.  Sorana Vieru of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|NUS]] said, “We would urge those who are struggling to seek support through their unions and universities rather than looking to a quick fix, and be aware that using these websites could cost not only money but jeopardise their qualifications.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/19/students-warned-against-using-essay-mill-sites-to-write-dissertations Students warned against using 'essay mill' sites to write dissertations] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

There are calls for diploma mills to be made illegal in the United Kingdom, in New Zealand and some juristictions in the United States they are already illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-45640236 University bosses call for ban on essay-writing companies] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plagiarism education ====
Given the serious consequences that plagiarism has for students, there has been a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism.&lt;ref name="ireland"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264452242_Let_Them_Plagiarise_Developing_Academic_Writing_in_a_Safe_Environment|title=Let Them Plagiarise: Developing Academic Writing in a Safe Environment|first1=Chris|last1=Ireland|first2=University of|last2=Huddersfield|first3=|last3=UK|first4=John|last4=English|first5=University of|last5=Huddersfield|first6=|last6=UK|date=1 October 2011|publisher=|volume=1|issue=1|pages=165–172|doi=10.18552/joaw.v1i1.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leung, C.

==== Factors influencing student´s decision to plagiarize ====
Several studies investigated factors that influence the decision to plagiarize. For example, a panel study with students from German universities found that academic procrastination predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted within six months followed the measurement of academic procrastination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrzek | first1 = J. | last2 = Sattler | first2 = S. | last3 = van Veen | first3 = F. | last4 = Grunschel | first4 = C. | last5 = Fries | first5 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Investigating the Effect of Academic Procrastination on the Frequency and Variety of Academic Misconduct: A Panel Study | url = | journal = Studies in Higher Education | volume = | issue = | pages = 1–16| doi = 10.1080/03075079.2013.854765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that by plagiarizing students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial and if they have the opportunity to plagiarize.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Sattler, Peter Graeff, Sebastian Willen: ''Explaining the Decision to Plagiarize: An Empirical Test of the Interplay Between Rationality, Norms, and Opportunity.'' In: ''Deviant Behavior.'' 34, 2013, S.&amp;nbsp;444–463, [[doi:10.1080/01639625.2012.735909]].&lt;/ref&gt; When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur.

=== Journalism ===
Since journalism relies on the public trust, a reporter's failure to honestly acknowledge their sources undercuts a newspaper or television news show's integrity and undermines its credibility. Journalists accused of plagiarism are often suspended from their reporting tasks while the charges are being investigated by the news organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.famousplagiarists.com/journalism.htm |title=Journalism  |website=Famous Plagiarists.com / War On Plagiarism.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226090147/http://famousplagiarists.com/journalism.htm |archivedate=26 February 2007|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-plagiarism ===
{{See also|Duplicate publication}}
The reuse of significant, identical, or nearly identical portions of one's own work without acknowledging that one is doing so or citing the original work is sometimes described as "self-plagiarism"; the term "recycling fraud" has also been used to describe this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dellavalle | first = Robert P. | last2 = Banks | first2 = Marcus A. | last3 = Ellis | first3 = Jeffrey I. |date=September 2007 | title = Frequently asked questions regarding self-plagiarism: How to avoid recycling fraud | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | page = 527 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2007.05.018 | pmid = 17707155 | pmc = 2679117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles of this nature are often referred to as duplicate or [[multiple publication]]. In addition there can be a copyright issue if copyright of the prior work has been transferred to another entity. Self-plagiarism is considered a serious ethical issue in settings where someone asserts that a publication consists of new material, such as in publishing or factual documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Attwood. [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=402598 "Allow me to rephrase, and boost my tally of articles"]. Times Higher Education. 3 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It does not apply to public-interest texts, such as social, professional, and cultural opinions usually published in newspapers and magazines.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In academic fields, self-plagiarism occurs when an author reuses portions of their own published and copyrighted work in subsequent publications, but without attributing the previous publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hexham |first=Irving |year=2005 |title=The Plague of Plagiarism: Academic Plagiarism Defined |website=UCalgary.ca |url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~hexham/content/articles/plague-of-plagiarism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Roig, M.

==== A contested definition ====
Miguel Roig has written at length about the topic of self-plagiarism&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roig, M. (2005). Re-using text from one’s own previously published papers: An exploratory study of potential self-plagiarism. ''Psychological Reports, 2005''(97), 43-49. doi:10.2466/pr0.97.1.43-49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roig, M. (2011). ''Avoiding plagiarism, self-plagiarism, and other questionable writing practices: A guide to ethical writing''.

(2015). On reusing our previously disseminated work. ''American Association for the Advancement of Science''. Retrieved from https://www.aaas.org/news/reusing-our-previously-disseminated-work&lt;/ref&gt; and his definition of self-plagiarism as using previously disseminated work is widely accepted among scholars of the topic. However, the "self-plagiarism" has been challenged as being self-contradictory, an [[oxymoron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Broome | first1 = M | title = Self-plagiarism: Oxymoron, fair use, or scientific misconduct? | doi = 10.1016/j.outlook.2004.10.001 | journal = Nursing Outlook | volume = 52 | issue = 6 | pages = 273–4 |date=November 2004 | pmid = 15614263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on other grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Andreescu | first1 = Liviu | title = Self-Plagiarism in Academic Publishing: The Anatomy of a Misnomer | doi = 10.1007/s11948-012-9416-1 | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics |date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Stephanie J. Bird&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bird | first1 = SJ | title = Self-plagiarism and dual and redundant publications: what is the problem? Commentary on 'Seven ways to plagiarize: handling real allegations of research misconduct' | doi = 10.1007/s11948-002-0007-4 | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 543–4 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12501723 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that self-plagiarism is a misnomer, since by definition plagiarism concerns the use of others' material. Bird identifies the ethical issues of "self-plagiarism" as those of "dual or redundant publication." She also notes that in an educational context, "self-plagiarism" refers to the case of a student who resubmits "the same essay for credit in two different courses." As David B. Resnik clarifies, "Self-plagiarism involves dishonesty but not intellectual theft."&lt;ref&gt;See Resnik, David B. (1998). ''The Ethics of Science: an introduction'', London: Routledge. p.177, notes to chapter six, note 3. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zMn2KxPQyk8C&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=%22self-plagiarism%22&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA177 Online via Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Patrick M. Scanlon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.5240451.0002.007 | author = Scanlon, PM | year = 2007 | title = Song from myself: an anatomy of self-plagiarism | journal = Plagiary | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | accessdate=2010-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Self-plagiarism" is a term with some specialized currency. Most prominently, it is used in discussions of research and publishing integrity in biomedicine, where heavy publish-or-perish demands have led to a rash of duplicate and "salami-slicing" publication, the reporting of a single study's results in "[[least publishable unit]]s" within multiple articles (Blancett, Flanagin, &amp; Young, 1995; Jefferson, 1998; Kassirer &amp; Angell, 1995; Lowe, 2003; McCarthy, 1993; Schein &amp; Paladugu, 2001; Wheeler, 1989). Roig (2002) offers a useful classification system including four types of self-plagiarism: duplicate publication of an article in more than one journal; partitioning of one study into multiple publications, often called salami-slicing; text recycling; and copyright infringement.

==== Codes of ethics ====
Some academic journals have codes of ethics that specifically refer to self-plagiarism. For example, the ''Journal of International Business Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lorraine Eden |url=http://palgrave-journals.com/jibs/jibs_ethics_code.html |title=JIBS Code of Ethics |publisher=Journal of International Business Studies |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723212122/http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/jibs_ethics_code.html |archivedate=2010-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some professional organizations like the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) have created policies that deal specifically with self-plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 2010 | title = ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | url=http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations do not make specific reference to self-plagiarism such as the American Political Science Association (APSA). The organization published a code of ethics that describes plagiarism as "...deliberate appropriation of the works of others represented as one's own." It does not make any reference to self-plagiarism. It does say that when a thesis or dissertation is published "in whole or in part", the author is "not ordinarily under an ethical obligation to acknowledge its origins."&lt;ref&gt;American Political Science Association (2008).

Section 21.1. {{ISBN|1-878147-05-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) also published a code of ethics that says its members are committed to: "Ensure that others receive credit for their work and contributions," but it makes no reference to self-plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;American Society for Public Administration. [http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/index_codeofethics.cfm "ASPA's Code of Ethics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124015330/http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/index_codeofethics.cfm |date=2011-01-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Factors that justify reuse ====
[[Pamela Samuelson]], in 1994, identified several factors she says excuse reuse of one's previously published work, that make it not self-plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt; She relates each of these factors specifically to the ethical issue of self-plagiarism, as distinct from the legal issue of fair use of copyright, which she deals with separately. Among other factors that may excuse reuse of previously published material Samuelson lists the following:

# The previous work must be restated to lay the groundwork for a new contribution in the second work.
# Portions of the previous work must be repeated to deal with new evidence or arguments.
# The audience for each work is so different that publishing the same work in different places is necessary to get the message out.
# The author thinks they said it so well the first time that it makes no sense to say it differently a second time.

Samuelson states she has relied on the "different audience" rationale when attempting to bridge interdisciplinary communities. She refers to writing for different legal and technical communities, saying: "there are often paragraphs or sequences of paragraphs that can be bodily lifted from one article to the other. And, in truth, I lift them." She refers to her own practice of converting "a technical article into a law review article with relatively few changes—adding footnotes and one substantive section" for a different audience.&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt;

Samuelson describes misrepresentation as the basis of self-plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt; She also states "Although it seems not to have been raised in any of the self-plagiarism cases, copyrights law's fair use defense would likely provide a shield against many potential publisher claims of copyright infringement against authors who reused portions of their previous works."&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt;

=== Organizational publications ===
Plagiarism is presumably not an issue when organizations issue collective unsigned works since they do not assign credit for originality to particular people. For example, the [[American Historical Association]]'s "Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct" (2005) regarding textbooks and reference books states that, since textbooks and encyclopedias are summaries of other scholars' work, they are not bound by the same exacting standards of attribution as original research and may be allowed a greater "extent of dependence" on other works.&lt;ref name=AHA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.historians.org/PUBS/Free/ProfessionalStandards.cfm | title = Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct | date = 2005-01-06 | accessdate=2009-04-16 | publisher = American Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even such a book does not make use of words, phrases, or paragraphs from another text or follow too closely the other text's arrangement and organization, and the authors of such texts are also expected to "acknowledge the sources of recent or distinctive findings and interpretations, those not yet a part of the common understanding of the profession."&lt;ref name=AHA /&gt;

== In the arts ==
=== The history of the arts ===
Through all of the [[history of literature]] and [[History of art|of the arts]] in general, works of art are for a large part repetitions of the [[Poetic tradition|tradition]]; to the entire history of [[artistic creativity]] belong plagiarism, literary theft, [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]], incorporation, retelling, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, reprise, [[thematic variation]], ironic retake, [[parody]], imitation, stylistic theft, [[pastiche]]s, [[collage]]s, and deliberate [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]].&lt;ref name="Derrida01p57"&gt; Derrida [1959] quotation: (p.40):{{full|date=April 2017}} "The boundaries between permissible and impermissible, imitation, stylistic plagiarism, copy, replica and forgery remain nebulous."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eco90"&gt;Eco (1990) p. 95 quotation:
{{quotation|Each of the types of repetition that we have examined is not limited to the mass media but belongs by right to the entire history of artistic creativity; plagiarism, quotation, parody, the ironic retake are typical of the entire artistic-literary tradition. &lt;br /&gt; Much art has been and is repetitive. The concept of absolute originality is a contemporary one, born with Romanticism; classical art was in vast measure serial, and the "modern" avant-garde (at the beginning of this century) challenged the Romantic idea of "creation from nothingness," with its techniques of collage, mustachios on the Mona Lisa, art about art, and so on.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lands99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alfrey"&gt;Alfrey (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genette [1982] note 3 to ch. 7, p. 433. quotation: {{quotation|"transposition"... all the other possible terms (rewriting, rehandling, remake, revision, refection, recasting, etc.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner98pp437-459" /&gt; There is no rigorous and precise distinction between practices like imitation, stylistic plagiarism, [[Copying|copy]], [[replica]] and [[forgery]].&lt;ref name="Derrida01p57" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haywood87p109Arnau"&gt;Haywood (1987) p.109, quoting Arnau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eco87p202Arnau"&gt;Eco (1987) p.202, quoting Arnau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnau59p40"&gt;Arnau [1959] quotation: (p. 40) "The boundaries between permissible and impermissible, imitation, stylistic plagiarism, copy, replica and forgery remain nebulous."&lt;/ref&gt; These appropriation procedures are the main axis of a literate culture, in which the tradition of the canonic past is being constantly rewritten.&lt;ref name="Steiner98pp437-459"&gt;Steiner (1998) pp. 437, 459 quotation:
{{quotation|(p. 437) There is between 'translation proper' and 'transmutation' a vast terrain of 'partial transformation'. The verbal signs in the original message or statement are modified by one of a multitude of means or by a combination of means. These include [[Paraphrasing of copyrighted material|paraphrase]], graphic illustration, pastiche, imitation, thematic variation, parody, citation in a supporting or undermining context, false attribution (accidental or deliberate), plagiarism, collage, and many others. This zone of partial transformation, of derivation, of alternate restatement determines much of our sensibility and literacy. It is, quite simply, the matrix of culture.

(p. 459) We could, in some measure, at least, come closer to a verifiable gradation of the sequence of techniques and aims, which leads from literal translation through paraphrases, mimesis, and pastiche to thematic variation. I have suggested that this sequence is the main axis of a literate culture, that a culture advances, spiralwise, via translations of its own canonic past.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Graham quotes [[T.S. Eliot]]—"Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal. Bad poets deface what they take."—she notes that despite the "taboo" of plagiarism, the ill-will and embarrassment it causes in the modern context, readers seem to often forgive the past excesses of historic literary offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham |first=Ruth |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/247130 |title=Word Theft |publisher=Poetryfoundation.org |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Praisings of artistic plagiarism ===
A passage of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s 1767 ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' condemns plagiarism by resorting to plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Ford [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n23/mark-ford/love-and-theft Love and Theft] [[London Review of Books]] Vol. 26 No. 23 · 2 December 2004 pages 34–35 | 4103 words&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Goldsmith]] commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sterne's Writings, in which it is clearly shewn, that he, whose manner and style were so long thought original, was, in fact, the most unhesitating plagiarist who ever cribbed from his predecessors in order to garnish his own pages. It must be owned, at the same time, that Sterne selects the materials of his mosaic work with so much art, places them so well, and polishes them so highly, that in most cases we are disposed to pardon the want of originality, in consideration of the exquisite talent with which the borrowed materials are wrought up into the new form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Goldsmith]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=qEMVAAAAYAAJ The vicar of Wakefield: a tale, Volume 5] p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In other contexts ==

=== On the Internet ===
Free online tools are becoming available to help identify plagiarism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-5663303-7.html "Apple accused of copyright wrongs"] CNET&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/08/30/copyscape-searches-for-scraped-content|title=Copyscape Searches For Scraped Content|publisher=WebProNews|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221143230/http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/08/30/copyscape-searches-for-scraped-content|archivedate=2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are a range of approaches that attempt to limit online copying, such as [[Digital rights management|disabling]] [[Right-click#Common mouse operations|right clicking]] and placing warning banners regarding copyrights on web pages. Instances of plagiarism that involve copyright violation may be addressed by the rightful content owners sending a [[DMCA]] removal notice to the offending site-owner, or to the [[ISP]] that is hosting the offending site. The term "content scraping" has arisen to describe the copying and pasting of information from websites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-07-31-net-plagiarism_x.htm | title = Authorship gets lost on Web | work = [[USA Today]] | date = August 1, 2006 | first = Del | last = Jones }}&lt;/ref&gt; and blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2006/05/08/online_plagiarism_strikes_blog_world/ | title = Online plagiarism strikes blog world | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | first = Maura | last = Welch | date = May 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Population fragmentation''' is a form of population segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Proctor |first=Michael F. |last2=McLellan |first2=Bruce N. |lastauthoramp=yes |last3=Strobeck |first3=Curtis |year=2002 |title=Population Fragmentation of Grizzly Bears in Southeastern British Columbia, Canada |journal=Ursus |volume=8 |issue= |pages=153–160 |doi= |jstor=3873196 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often caused by [[habitat fragmentation]]. 

==Fragmentation causes==
Fragmentation can be natural or caused by human actions. In modern times, human activity is the most common cause.
* development of land around a protected area, sometimes by just a single road or fence line
* capture or killing of species in an area that links populations
* movement of a population away from other individuals of that species, such as the natural introduction of [[wolves and moose on Isle Royale]]
* geologic processes, such as landslides or volcanoes, dividing a habitat
* rising sea levels can separate islands from what was once a common landmass
* global warming, especially when coupled with mountains, can reduce movement from one habitat to another

==Genetic effects==
Population fragmentation causes [[inbreeding depression]], which leads to a decrease in genetic variability in the species involved.&lt;ref name="ProctorMcLellan"&gt;{{Citation |last=Proctor |first=M. F. |last2=McLellan |first2=B. N. |last3=Strobeck |first3=C. |lastauthoramp=yes |last4=Barclay |first4=R. M. R. |year=2005 |title=Genetic analysis reveals demographic fragmentation of grizzly bears yielding vulnerably small populations |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=272 |issue=1579 |pages=2409–2416 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3246 |pmid=16243699 |pmc=1559960 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This decreases the fitness of the population for several reasons. First, inbreeding forces competition with relatives, which decreases the [[evolutionary fitness]] of the species.&lt;ref name="ProctorMcLellan"/&gt; Secondly, the decrease in genetic variability causes an increased possibility a lethal homozygous recessive trait may be expressed; this decreases the average litter size reproduced, indirectly decreasing the population.&lt;ref name="KrebsCJ"&gt;{{Citation |last=Krebs |first=C. J. |year=2009 |title=Ecology: The Experimental Analysis of Distribution and Abundance |edition=6th |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-321-50743-3 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; When a population is small, the influence of genetic drift increases, which leads to less and/or random fixation of alleles. In turn, this leads to increased homozygosity, negatively affecting individual fitness. The performance of plants may be compromised by less effective selection which causes an accumulation of deleterious mutations in small populations. Since individuals in small populations are more likely to be related, they are more likely to inbreed. A reduction in fitness may occur in small plant populations because of mutation accumulation, reduced genetic diversity, and increased inbreeding. Over time, the evolutionary potential and a species’s ability to adapt to a changing environment, such as climate change, is decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Leimu, R., Vergeer, P., Angeloni, F., &amp; Ouborg, N. J. 2010. Habitat fragmentation, climate change, and inbreeding in plants. The Year in Ecology and Conservation Biology 1195:84-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9525">In [[mathematics]], a '''Priestley space''' is an [[partial order|ordered]] [[topological space]] with special properties. Priestley spaces are named after [[Hilary Priestley]] who introduced and investigated them.&lt;ref&gt;
Priestley, (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley spaces play a fundamental role in the study of [[distributive lattice]]s. In particular, there is a [[duality theory for distributive lattices|duality]] ("'''Priestley duality'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=[[Order (journal)|Order]] | date=September 1991 | volume=8 | number=3 | pages=299–315 | title=Remarks on Priestley duality for distributive lattices | first1=R. | last1=Cignoli | first2=S. | last2=Lafalce | first3=A. | last3=Petrovich | doi=10.1007/BF00383451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) between the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of Priestley spaces and the category of bounded distributive lattices.&lt;ref&gt;
Cornish, (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bezhanishvili et al. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A ''Priestley space'' is an ''ordered topological space'' {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}, i. e. a set {{math|''X''}} equipped with a [[partial order]] {{math|&amp;le;}} and a [[topological space#Definition|topology]] {{math|''&amp;tau;''}}, satisfying 
the following two conditions:

# {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}} is [[Compact space|compact]].
# If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\,\not\le\, y&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a [[clopen set|clopen]] [[up-set]] {{math|''U''}} of {{math|''X''}} such that {{math|''x''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt;''U''}} and {{math|''y''&amp;notin; ''U''}}. (This condition is known as the ''Priestley separation axiom''.)

==Properties of Priestley spaces==
* Each Priestley space is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]. Indeed, given two points {{math|''x'',''y''}} of a Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}, if {{math|''x''&amp;ne; ''y''}}, then as {{math|&amp;le;}} is a partial order, either &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\,\not\le\, y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y\,\not\le\, x&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming, without loss of generality, that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\,\not\le\, y&lt;/math&gt;, (ii) provides a clopen up-set {{math|''U''}} of {{math|''X''}} such that {{math|''x''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''U''}} and {{math|''y''&amp;notin; ''U''}}. Therefore, {{math|''U''}} and {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''X'' &amp;minus; ''U''}} are disjoint open subsets of {{math|''X''}} separating {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}.
* Each Priestley space is also [[zero-dimensional]]; that is, each [[open neighborhood]] {{math|''U''}} of a point {{math|''x''}} of a Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} contains a clopen neighborhood {{math|''C''}} of {{math|''x''}}. To see this, one proceeds as follows. For each {{math|''y'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''X'' &amp;minus; ''U''}}, either &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\,\not\le\, y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y\,\not\le\, x&lt;/math&gt;. By the Priestley separation axiom, there exists a clopen up-set or a clopen [[down-set]] containing {{math|''x''}} and missing {{math|''y''}}. Obviously the intersection of these clopen neighborhoods of {{math|''x''}} does not meet {{math|''X'' &amp;minus; ''U''}}. Therefore, as {{math|''X''}} is compact, there exists a finite intersection of these clopen neighborhoods of {{math|''x''}} missing {{math|''X'' &amp;minus; ''U''}}. This finite intersection is the desired clopen neighborhood {{math|''C''}} of {{math|''x''}} contained in {{math|''U''}}.

It follows that for each Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}, the topological space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}} is a [[Stone space]]; that is, it is a compact Hausdorff zero-dimensional space.

Some further useful properties of Priestley spaces are listed below.

Let {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} be a Priestley space.

::(a) For each closed subset {{math|''F''}} of {{math|''X''}}, both {{math|&amp;uarr; ''F'' {{=}} {''x'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''X''&amp;nbsp; :&amp;nbsp; ''y'' &amp;le; ''x'' for some ''y'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''F''} }} and {{math|&amp;darr; ''F'' {{=}} { ''x'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''X'' &amp;nbsp; :&amp;nbsp; ''x'' &amp;le; ''y'' for some ''y'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''F''} }} are closed subsets of {{math|''X''}}.

::(b) Each open up-set of {{math|''X''}} is a union of clopen up-sets of {{math|''X''}} and each open down-set of {{math|''X''}} is a union of clopen down-sets of {{math|''X''}}.

::(c) Each closed up-set of {{math|''X''}} is an intersection of clopen up-sets of {{math|''X''}} and each closed down-set of {{math|''X''}} is an intersection of clopen down-sets of {{math|''X''}}.

::(d) Clopen up-sets and clopen down-sets of {{math|''X''}} form a [[subbasis]] for {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}}.

::(e) For each pair of closed subsets {{math|''F''}} and {{math|''G''}} of {{math|''X''}}, if {{math|&amp;uarr;''F'' &amp;cap; &amp;darr;''G'' {{=}} &amp;empty;}}, then there exists a clopen up-set {{math|''U''}} such that {{math|''F'' &amp;sube; ''U''}} and {{math|''U'' &amp;cap; ''G'' {{=}} &amp;empty;}}.

A '''Priestley morphism''' from a Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} to another Priestley space {{math|(''X''&amp;prime;,''&amp;tau;''&amp;prime;,&amp;le;&amp;prime;)}} is a map {{math|f  :  ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X''&amp;prime;}} which is [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] and [[order-preserving]].

Let '''Pries''' denote the category of Priestley spaces and Priestley morphisms.

==Connection with spectral spaces==
Priestley spaces are closely related to [[spectral space]]s. For a Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}, let {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the collection of all open up-sets of {{math|''X''}}. Similarly, let {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the collection of all open down-sets of {{math|''X''}}.

'''Theorem:'''&lt;ref&gt;Cornish, (1975). Bezhanishvili et al. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
If {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} is a Priestley space, then both {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;)}} are spectral spaces.

Conversely, given a spectral space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}}, let {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the [[patch topology]] on {{math|''X''}}; that is, the topology generated by the subbasis consisting of compact open subsets of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}} and their [[Complement (set theory)|complement]]s. Let also {{math|&amp;le;}} denote the [[specialization order]] of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}}.

'''Theorem:'''&lt;ref&gt;Cornish, (1975). Bezhanishvili et al. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
If {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}} is a spectral space, then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;le;)}} is a Priestley space.

In fact, this correspondence between Priestley spaces and spectral spaces is [[functorial]] and yields an [[isomorphism]] between '''Pries''' and the category '''Spec''' of spectral spaces and [[spectral space|spectral map]]s.

==Connection with bitopological spaces==
Priestley spaces are also closely related to [[bitopological space]]s.

'''Theorem:'''&lt;ref&gt;Bezhanishvili et al. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
If {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} is a Priestley space, then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;,''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is a [[pairwise Stone space]]. Conversely, if {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a pairwise Stone space, then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} is a Priestley space, where {{math|''&amp;tau;''}} is the join of {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&amp;le;}} is the specialization order of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

The correspondence between Priestley spaces and pairwise Stone spaces is functorial and yields an isomorphism between the category '''Pries''' of Priestley spaces and Priestley morphisms and the category '''PStone''' of pairwise Stone spaces and [[bitopological space#Bi-continuity|bi-continuous map]]s.

Thus, one has the following isomorphisms of categories:

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Spec}\cong \mathbf{Pries}\cong \mathbf{PStone}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

One of the main consequences of the [[duality theory for distributive lattices]] is that each of these categories is dually equivalent to the category of bounded [[distributive lattice]]s.

'''''Pro bono publico''''' ({{lang-en|for the public good}}; usually shortened to '''''pro bono''''')                                                   is a [[Latin phrase]] for professional work undertaken voluntarily and without payment. Unlike traditional [[volunteerism]], it is service that uses the specific skills of professionals to provide services to those who are unable to afford them. 

''Pro bono publico'' is also used in the [[United Kingdom]] to describe the central motivation of large organizations, such as the [[National Health Service]] and various [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] which exist "for the public good" rather than for shareholder profit, but it equally or even more applies to the private sector where professionals like lawyers and bankers offer their specialist skills for the benefit of the community or [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]].

==Legal counsel==
{{globalize|section|United Kingdom|2name=the United Kingdom|USA|3name=the United States|date=April 2011}}
Pro bono legal counsel may assist an individual or group on a legal case by filing government applications or petitions. A judge may occasionally determine that the loser should compensate a winning pro bono counsel.

===South Korea===
South Korean lawyers are required to do at least 30 hours of pro bono work per year, (the local bar associations can reduce the hours to 20).&lt;!-- Per what time period? --&gt; Those who have a good reason not to fulfill the requirement may pay [[South Korean won|₩]]20,000–30,000 (USD 17-26) per hour instead.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Bar Association Rule on Pro Bono Article 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Since 2003, many UK law firms and [[law school]]s have celebrated an annual Pro Bono Week, which encourages [[solicitor]]s and [[barrister]]s to offer pro bono services and increases general awareness of pro bono service.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Clare. "Win or lose, no fee: pro bono week promotes free legal services." [https://www.theguardian.com/law/story/0,,1790285,00.html Pro Bono work.] The Guardian. 6 June 2007. Retrieved 2 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dowell, Katy. "Attorney General sets up global pro bono database." [https://archive.is/20120920004520/http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=135731 Pro bono week.] The Lawyer.17 November 2008. Retrieved 4 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
LawWorks (the operating name for the Solicitors Pro Bono Group) is a national charity that works with solicitors and law students, encouraging and supporting them in carrying out legal pro bono work.  It also acts as a clearing house for pro bono casework. Individuals and community groups may apply to the charity for free legal advice and mediation, where they could not otherwise afford to pay and are not entitled to [[legal aid]].&lt;ref name="LawWorks"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lawworks.org.uk/ |title=LawWorks - The Solicitors Pro Bono Group - Pro Bono Support across England and Wales provided by solicitors, mediators and law students |accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Advocates for International Development]], which exclusively brokers international pro bono contributing towards the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], operates from a London base.&lt;ref name="A4ID"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://a4id.org/content/contact-us |title=A4ID |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Lawyers in the [[United States]] are recommended under [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) ethical rules to contribute at least 50 hours of pro bono service per year.&lt;ref&gt;"ABA Model Rule 6.1 Voluntary Pro Bono Service." [http://www.americanbar.org/groups/probono_public_service/policy/aba_model_rule_6_1.html Pro Bono and Public Service.] Retrieved 2 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some state [[bar association]]s, however, may recommend fewer hours. Rule 6.1 of the New York Rules of Professional Conduct strongly encourages lawyers to aspire to provide at least 50 hours of pro bono service each year and quantifies the minimal financial contributions that lawyers should aspire to make to organizations providing legal services to the poor and underserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/jointappellate/NY-Rules-Prof-Conduct-1200.pdf|title="Rules of Professional Conduct (22 NYCRR Part 1200)"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, other states, such as Illinois, do not have recommended hours, yet require annual disclosure of voluntary pro bono hours and contributions made to pro bono organizations. &lt;ref&gt;See Illinois Supreme Court Rule 756(f).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chief Judge of New York has also instituted a requirement that applicants who plan to be admitted in 2015 and onward must complete 50 hours of pro bono service in order to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/attorneys/probono/baradmissionreqs.shtml|title=Pro Bono Bar Admission Requirements - NYCOURTS.GOV|website=www.nycourts.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; All attorneys who register must report their voluntary pro bono hours and/or voluntary contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/ATTORNEYS/probono/reportingreqs-intro.shtml|title=Reporting Requirements - Attorney Registration - NYCOURTS.GOV|website=www.nycourts.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2007 press conference reported in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', the law student group [[Building a Better Legal Profession]] released its first annual ranking of top [[law firm]]s by average billable hours, pro bono participation, and demographic diversity.&lt;ref name="Efrati"&gt;{{citation |first=Amir |last=Efrati |title=You Say You Want a Big-Law Revolution, Take II |url=http://www.law.stanford.edu/news/you-say-you-want-a-big-law-revolution-take-ii |journal=Wall Street Journal |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] (owned by [[News Corporation]]) |location=New York, NY, USA |date=October 10, 2007  |accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adam Liptak"&gt;{{citation |first=Adam |last=Liptak |authorlink=Adam Liptak |title=In Students’ Eyes, Look-Alike Lawyers Don’t Make the Grade |journal=[[New York Times]] |date=October 29, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/29/us/29bar.html?em&amp;ex=1193889600&amp;en=4b0cd84261ffe5b4&amp;ei=5087%0A |accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report found that most large firms fall short of their pro bono targets.&lt;ref name="Adcock &amp; Elinson"&gt;{{closed access}} {{citation |first1=Thomas |last1=Adcock |authorlink1=Thomas Adcock |first2=Zusha |last2=Elinson |title=Student Group Grades Firms on Diversity, Pro Bono Work |journal=[[New York Law Journal]] |date=October 19, 2007 |url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=900005493872 |accessdate=October 15, 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has sent the information to top law schools around the country, encouraging students to take this data into account when choosing where to work after graduation.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"&gt;{{citation |first=Henry |last=Weinstein |title=Lack of diversity marks L.A. law - A survey finds an 'opportunity gap' for minorities and women at large firms in the area |journal=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 11, 2007 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-diversity11oct11,1,661263.story?coll=la-headlines-california |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422183624/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/11/local/me-diversity11 |archivedate=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outside the legal sector==
Corporate pro bono efforts generally focus on building the capacity of local nonprofits or mentoring local businesses.  There are many models that businesses use and tailor to their specific strengths.  They may loan employees, provide coaching and mentoring, complete a service marathon, create standardized team projects, engage in open-ended outsourcing, provide sector-wise solutions, perform general contracting, or work on a signature issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kassi-Vivier |first=Yoann |title=Demonstrating the Business Value of Pro Bono Service |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |url=http://www.taprootfoundation.org/docs/Taproot-Business-Value-2012.pdf |publisher=Taproot Foundation and Pro Bono Lab |author2=Jennifer Pawlowski |author3=Carol Guttery |author4=Dima Mostovoy |date=[http://www.taprootfoundation.org/about-probono/blog/business-value-pro-bono-programs-introduced-taproots-latest-resource January 17, 2012] |accessdate=February 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105073516/http://www.taprootfoundation.org/docs/Taproot-Business-Value-2012.pdf |archive-date=2012-11-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loaned employee===
In this model companies are effectively donating a fully trained and paid-for employee to the non-profit.  Employees apply for the coveted opportunity to pursue a pro bono interest by lending their knowledge and experience.  They use their workplace skills in a hands-on and/or consulting role to build the partner nonprofit's capacity.

===Functional coaching and mentoring===
Employees match up with their nonprofit peers, form a relationship, and share functional expertise.  They may connect them with assets for growth or revise their business models.  For commodities and service-based businesses, [[coaching]] and [[mentoring]] is a fresh way for them to do philanthropy. It builds a stronger market for the businesses by strengthening the local economy and cultivates important skills for the service providers and recipients.

===Marathon===
An event where people meet up to do pro bono work for many hours.

===Standardized team projects===
Individuals are placed on teams, each with specific roles and responsibilities. Each project is scoped and structured around a standard deliverable based on the needs of the nonprofit partners.  Team projects are meant as fun [[team building|team-building]] activities or as highly competitive competitions to examine [[leadership]] abilities in employees.

===Open-ended outsourcing===
A company makes its services available to a specific number of nonprofit organizations on an ongoing, as needed basis.  Volunteers act in a mentor capacity to fill a non-profit’s need.  Often employees use workplace skills to provide services that non-profits do not have the resources to fund.

===Sector-wide solutions===
A company creates a deliverable pro bono resource that can be applicable to all nonprofits across the sector.  Similar to creating products for consumers, this pro bono model advocates creating products that will be distributed for free or at a greatly reduced cost.   Often these are software or other tech services.

===General contracting===
An entity coordinates and oversees internal and external resources, promoting cross-sector collaboration to address a specific social problem.  Contracting is generally done in an ad-hoc capacity and by intermediary organizations such as [[Taproot Foundation]], [[Common Impact]], or [[Points of Light Institute|Points of Light]].

===Signature issue===
Signature issues combine corporate assets with pro bono work to fight social problems.  This is as much a [[corporate branding]] initiative as it is an altruistic endeavor.  Pro bono volunteers that come en masse from a company become associated with that cause while combating social issues.

[[File:Eugène Atget (French - Chiffonier (Ragpicker) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A rag-picker in Paris, ca, 1899 - 1901.]]
A '''Rag-picker''', or '''Chiffonnier''', is term for someone who makes a living by rummaging through [[refuse]] in the streets to collect material for salvage. Scraps of cloth and paper could be turned into [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]], broken [[glass]] could be melted down and reused, and even dead cats and dogs could be [[Skinning|skinned]] to make clothes. 

The rag-pickers in 19th and early 20th Century did not [[recycle]] the materials themselves; they would simply collect whatever they could find and turn it over to a "master rag-picker" (usually a former rag-picker) who would, in turn, sell it&amp;mdash;generally by weight&amp;mdash;to wealthy investors with the means to convert the materials into something more profitable.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oHIDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA360&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Old and New Paris: Its history, its people, and its places|author=Edwards, Henry Sutherland|year=1893|pages=360–365|publisher=Cassell and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Opinion|volume=36|chapter=The Workers in Waste Products|author=The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|year=1904|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=atYaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA782&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although it was solely a job for the lowest of the [[working classes]], rag-picking was considered an honest [[Job (role)|occupation]], more on the level of [[street sweeper]] than of a [[beggar]]. In Paris, for instance, rag-pickers were regulated by law: their operations were restricted to certain times of night, and they were required to return any unusually valuable items to the owner or to the authorities.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt; When [[Eugène Poubelle]] introduced the [[garbage can]] in 1884, he was criticized in the French newspapers for meddling with the rag-pickers' livelihoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynch, Hannah|year=1901|title=French life in town and country|publisher=Putnam|pages=278–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[sanitation]] and recycling programs ultimately caused the profession to decline, though it did not disappear entirely; [[rag and bone man|rag and bone men]] were still operating in the 1970s. 

Rag-picking is still widespread in [[Third World]] countries today, such as in [[Mumbai]], [[India]], where it offers the poorest in society around the rubbish and recycling areas a chance to earn a hand-to-mouth supply of money. In 2015, the Environment Minister of India declared a national award to recognise the service rendered by rag-pickers. The award, with a cash prize of Rs. 1.5 lakh, is for three best rag pickers and three associations involved in innovation of best practices. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/rag-pickers-services-will-be-recognised-by-government-to-give-national-award/article7382780.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship in waste management and recycling ==
Ragpicking has a positive impact on urban spaces with a weak waste management infrastructure. In India, the economic activity of ragpicking is worth about ₹3200 crore. India was also found to have a near-90% recycle rate for PET bottles, which could probably be attributed to ragpicking, given a lack of solid-waste management and under-developed waste collection and recycling culture in that country. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/india-recycles-90-of-its-pet-waste-outperforms-japan-europe-and-us-study/story-yqphS1w2GdlwMYPgPtyb2L.html NCL and PET Packaging Association for Clean Environment (PACE)　2017年2月&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
*[[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''[[Les Fleurs du Mal]]'' (1888) includes a poem where the rag-picker character has a prominent role, entitled "Le Vin de chiffonniers" ("The Rag-Picker's Wine").
*[[Francis Saltus Saltus]]' ''Shadows and Ideals'' (1890) includes a poem about rag-pickers entitled "The Old Rag-picker of Paris".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shadows and Ideals|author=Francis Saltus Saltus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YokPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1890|publisher=C. W. Moulton}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A section of tenement buildings near [[Chatham Square, Manhattan]] became known as Rag-picker's Court, as this was the profession of most of its residents. In 1879, [[William Allen Rogers]] drew the rag-strewn courtyard for ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' as part of a series of engravings focused on inner-city life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New York in the nineteenth century|author=Grafton, John|year=1977|page=62|isbn=978-0-486-23516-5|publisher=Dover Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reed's rules''' are a set of guidelines developed by [[Joseph O. Reed]] in interpretation of [[Paediatrics|pediatric]] [[radiology]].&lt;ref&gt;Haller Jo, Slovis TL. Introduction to Radiology in Clinical Pediatrics. Year Book Medical Publishers, Inc. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reed's rules==
Reed's rules are as follows:
#''On every [[Chest radiograph|chest film]], read the abdominal portion as you would read an abdominal film. 
#''Knowledge of [[anatomy]] is the key to correct radiographic diagnosis.
#''The [[airway]] should be visible on all normal chest films.
#''A mass must be seen in two planes.
#''An [[esophagram]] must be done on any child with unexplained [[respiratory disease]].
#''In unilateral hyperexpansion of the [[lung]]s, you must see how the air moves. Mediastinal position is critical to this determination.
#''Always review all old films to assess new ones properly. Subtle findings can be missed easily when a single previous examination is reviewed.
#''The abdominal examination should include a minimum of three views—supine, prone and erect.
#''On every abdominal examination, evaluate the chest as if you were looking at a chest film.
#''In obstruction of the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], there should be proximal [[distention]].
#''During [[intravenous urography]], keep taking films as long as you are getting needed information.
#''Try to find the effects of the mass on adjacent organs on each abdominal film. Draw the mass, if necessary.
#''After you have defined the mass, find the center of the [[lesion]]. Then consider all structures, gross and microscopic, near the center of the lesion as possible sources of the mass. Think skin to skin.
#''The [[periosteum]] is not normally seen.
#''When viewing an extremity, try to imagine the appearance of the patient. An excellent example is [[bowed legs]] or [[knock knees]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47096">A '''renewable resource''' is a [[natural resource]] which replenishes to overcome [[resource depletion]] caused by usage and consumption, either through biological reproduction or other naturally recurring processes in a finite amount of time in a human time scale. Renewable resources are a part of Earth's natural environment and the largest components of its [[Ecosphere (ecology)|ecosphere]]. A positive life cycle assessment is a key indicator of a resource's sustainability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Management for a Small Planet" by Jean Garner Stead and W. Edward Stead, M.E.

Definitions of renewable resources may also include agricultural production, as in [[sustainable agriculture]] and to an extent [[water resources]].&lt;ref name="What are Renewable Resources"&gt;[http://www.oas.org/dsd/publications/Unit/oea79e/ch05.htm What are “Renewable Resources”?], by A.

==Air, food and water==

===Water resources===

{{Main article|Water resources}}

[[Water]] can be considered a ''renewable'' material when carefully controlled usage, treatment, and release are followed. If not, it would become a non-renewable resource at that location. For example, [[groundwater]] is usually removed from an [[aquifer]] at a rate much greater than its very slow natural recharge, and so groundwater is considered non-renewable. Removal of water from the pore spaces may cause permanent compaction ([[subsidence]]) that cannot be renewed. 97.5% of the water on the Earth is salt water, and 3% is [[fresh water]]; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in [[glacier]]s and [[Polar climate|polar]] [[ice cap]]s.&lt;ref name="USGS dist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/waterdistribution.html|title=Earth's water distribution|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction (0.008%) present above ground or in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Scientific Facts on Water: State of the Resource| publisher=GreenFacts Website | accessdate=2008-01-31 | url= http://www.greenfacts.org/en/water-resources/index.htm#2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water pollution]] is one of the main concerns regarding water resources. It is estimated that 22% of worldwide water is used in industry.&lt;ref name="WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA |title=WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends |date= |accessdate=2009-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301011840/http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major industrial users include hydroelectric dams, [[Electricity generation#Other generation methods|thermoelectric power plants]] (which use water for cooling), [[ore]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] refineries (which use water in chemical processes) and manufacturing plants (which use water as a solvent).

[[Desalination]] of seawater is considered a renewable source of water, although reducing its dependence on fossil fuel energy is needed for it to be fully renewable.&lt;ref name=LowCDesal&gt;{{cite web | last=Lienhard | first=John H. | last2=Thiel | first2=Gregory P. | last3=Warsinger | first3=David M. | last4=Banchik | first4=Leonardo D. | title=Low Carbon Desalination: Status and Research, Development, and Demonstration Needs, Report of a workshop conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in association with the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology | date=2016-12-08 | url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/105755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non agricultural food===
[[File:Alaska wild berries.jpg|thumb|right|Alaska wild "berries" from the [[Innoko National Wildlife Refuge]] - Renewable Resources]]
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212568/food Encyclopædia Britannica definition]&lt;/ref&gt; Most food has its origin in renewable resources. Food is obtained directly from plants and animals.

Hunting may not be the first source of meat in the modernised world, but it is still an important and essential source for many rural and remote groups. It is also the sole source of feeding for wild carnivores.&lt;ref&gt;Mammals: Carnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable agriculture===
{{main article|Sustainable agriculture}}
The phrase [[sustainable agriculture]] was coined by Australian agricultural scientist [[Gordon McClymont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rural Science Graduates Association |year=2002 |url=http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html |title={{sic|In Memo|rium|hide=y|expected=In Memoriam}}&amp;nbsp;— Former Staff and Students of Rural Science at UNE |publisher=[[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] |accessdate=21 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606220152/http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html |archivedate=6 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been defined as "an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will last over the long term".&lt;ref&gt;Gold, M. (July 2009). [http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/agnic/susag.shtml What is Sustainable Agriculture?]. United States Department of Agriculture, Alternative Farming Systems Information Center.&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion of agricultural land reduces [[biodiversity]] and contributes to [[deforestation]]. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades, cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development, along with reclamation of wetlands, and conversion of forest to cultivation, resulting in the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and increased [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4252e/y4252e14.htm |title=FAO World Agriculture towards 2015/2030 |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |year=2003 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Polyculture.JPG|thumb|250px|Polyculture practices in [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]
Although [[air]] and [[sunlight]] are available everywhere on [[Earth]], [[Agriculture|crops]] also depend on [[soil]] [[nutrients]] and the availability of [[water resources|water]]. [[Monoculture]] is a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field, which can damage land and cause it to become either unusable or suffer from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Monoculture can also cause the build-up of [[pathogen]]s and pests that target one specific species. The [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Famine (1845–1849)]] is a well-known example of the dangers of monoculture.

[[Crop rotation]] and [[shifting cultivation|long-term crop rotations]] confer the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of [[green manure]] in sequence with cereals and other crops, and can improve [[soil structure]] and [[fertility (soil)|fertility]] by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. Other methods to combat lost soil nutrients are returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients indefinitely) such as the [[Flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

Agricultural practices are the single greatest contributor to the global increase in [[Erosion|soil erosion]] rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Committee on 21st Century Systems Agriculture|title=Toward Sustainable Agricultural Systems in the 21st Century|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-309-14896-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wdm4qMW1azgC&amp;pg=PT88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that "more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africa's soil are eroded every year. Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musokotwane Environment Resource Centre for Southern Africa CEP Factsheet |url=http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |accessdate=2013-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213002938/http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dust Bowl]] phenomenon in the 1930s was caused by severe [[drought]] combined with farming methods that did not include crop rotation, fallow fields, [[cover crop]]s, soil terracing and wind-breaking trees to prevent [[Aeolian processes|wind erosion]].&lt;ref name=drought&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tillage]] of agricultural lands is one of the primary contributing factors to erosion, due to mechanised agricultural equipment that allows for deep plowing, which severely increases the amount of soil that is available for transport by [[water erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Blanco, Humberto &amp; Lal, Rattan|chapter=Tillage erosion|title=Principles of Soil Conservation and Management|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-8529-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj3690PbDY0C&amp;pg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lobb, D.A.|chapter=Soil movement by tillage and other agricultural activities|editor=Jorgenson, Sven E.|title=Applications in Ecological Engineering|publisher=Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-444-53448-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aRKO6ZazC8UC&amp;pg=PA247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The phenomenon called ''peak soil'' describes how large-scale factory farming techniques are affecting humanity's ability to grow food in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peak Soil: Why cellulosic ethanol, biofuels are unsustainable and a threat to America |url=http://culturechange.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=1 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without efforts to improve soil management practices, the availability of [[Arable land|arable soil]] may become increasingly problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CopperWiki Soil erosion |url=http://www.copperwiki.org/index.php?title=Soil_erosion |accessdate=2013-01-05}}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods to combat erosion include [[no-till farming]], using a [[keyline design]], growing [[Hedge|wind breaks]] to hold the soil, and widespread use of [[compost]]. [[Fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s can also have an effect of soil erosion,{{cn|date=July 2018}} which can contribute to [[soil salinity]] and prevent other species from growing. [[Phosphate]] is a primary component in the chemical fertiliser applied most commonly in modern agricultural production. However, scientists estimate that rock phosphate reserves will be depleted in 50–100 years and that ''Peak Phosphate'' will occur in about 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937800800099X |title=The story of phosphorus: Global food security and food for thought |author=Cordell|journal= Global Environmental Change |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2013-01-06|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.10.009 |volume=19 |pages=292–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Industrial process]]ing and [[logistics]] also have an effect on agriculture's sustainability. The way and locations crops are [[selling|sold]] requires energy for transportation, as well as the energy cost for materials, [[labour (economics)|labour]], and [[transport]]. Food sold at a local location, such a [[farmers' market]], have reduced energy overheads.

===Air===
Air is a renewable resource. All [[living organisms]] need [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]] (directly or indirectly), [[carbon]] (directly or indirectly) and many other gases in small [[quantities]] for their [[survival skills|survival]].

==Non-food resources==
[[File:Douglas des farges 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Douglas fir]] forest created in 1850, [[Meymac]] (Corrèze), France]]
{{main article|Energy crop|Non-food crop}}
An important renewable resource is [[wood]] provided by means of [[forestry]], which has been used for construction, housing and firewood since ancient times.
&lt;ref Name=unece&gt;[http://www.unece.org/unece-main/info-resources/presscurrent-press-h/forestry-and-timber/2012/wood-confirmed-as-the-primary-source-of-renewable-energy-in-europe/wood-confirmed-as-the-primary-source-of-renewable-energy-in-europe.html Wood confirmed as the primary source of renewable energy in Europe, UNECE February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=fao&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/am859e/am859e08.pdf FAO Factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=woodecon&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/business/21575771-environmental-lunacy-europe-fuel-future  Wood The fuel of the future] Environmental lunacy in Europe, Economist title story Apr 6th 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Plants provide the main sources for renewable resources, the main distinction is made between [[energy crop]]s and [[non-food crop]]s. A large variety of [[Grease (lubricant)|lubricants]], industrially used vegetable oils, textiles and fibre made e.g. of [[cotton]], [[copra]] or [[hemp]], [[paper]] derived from [[wood]], [[Textile|rags]] or [[grass]]es, [[bioplastic]] are based on plant renewable resources. A large variety of chemical based products like [[latex]], [[ethanol]], [[resin]], [[sugar]] and [[starch]] can be provided with plant renewables. Animal based renewables include [[fur]], [[leather]], technical [[fat]] and lubricants and further derived products, as e.g. [[animal glue]], [[tendon]]s, [[Casing (sausage)|casings]] or in historical times [[ambergris|ambra]] and [[baleen]] provided by [[whaling]].

With regard to pharmacy ingredients and legal and illegal drugs, plants are important sources, however e.g. venom of snakes, frogs and insects has been a valuable renewable source of pharmacological ingredients. Before GMO production set in, [[insulin]] and important [[hormones]] were based on animal sources. [[Feather]]s, an important byproduct of poultry farming for food, is still being used as filler and as base for [[keratin]] in general. Same applies for the [[chitin]] produced in farming [[Crustacean]]s which may be used as base of [[chitosan]]. The most important part of the human body used for non-medical purposes is [[human hair]] as for [[artificial hair integrations]], which is being traded worldwide.

===Historical role===
[[File:Japan Factory Ship Nisshin Maru Whaling Mother and Calf.jpg|left|thumb|An adult and sub-adult [[Minke whale]] are dragged aboard the [[Nisshin Maru]], a Japanese whaling vessel]]
[[File:Hanfdaemmstoff CG.jpg|right|thumb|[[Hemp#Building material|Hemp]] insulation, a renewable resource used as [[Sustainable living#Sustainable building materials|building material]]]]

Historically, renewable resources like firewood, [[latex]],  [[guano]], [[charcoal]], [[wood ash]], plant colors as [[indigo]], and whale products have been crucial for human needs but failed to supply demand in the beginning of the industrial era.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt; Early modern times faced large problems with overuse of renewable resources as in [[deforestation]], [[overgrazing]] or [[overfishing]].&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

In addition to fresh meat and milk, which as food items are not the topic of this section, [[livestock]] farmers and artisans used further animal ingredients as  [[tendon]]s, horn, bones, bladders. Complex technical constructions as the [[composite bow]] were based on combination of animal and plant based materials. The current distribution conflict between biofuel and food production is being described as [[Food vs. fuel]]. Conflicts between food needs and usage, as supposed by [[fief]] obligations were in so far common in historical times as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wageningenacademic.com/_clientfiles/download/livestockhousing-e_01.pdf A short history of livestock production]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, J. Hartung, in Livestock housing, Modern management to ensure optimal health and welfare of farm animals, edited by: Andres Aland and Thomas Banhazi, © 2013 {{ISBN|978-90-8686-217-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a significant percentage of (middle European) farmers yields went into [[livestock]], which provides as well organic fertiliser.&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Comberg, Die deutsche Tierzucht im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert, Ulmer, 1984, {{ISBN|3-8001-3061-0}}, (History of livestock breeding in Germany)&lt;/ref&gt; Oxen and horses were important for transportation purposes,  drove engines as e.g. in [[treadmill]]s.

Other regions solved the transportation problem with [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]], [[urban agriculture|urban]] and garden agriculture.&lt;ref name=rad&gt;Nature and Power: A Global History of the Environment. By Joachim Radkau. Publications of the German Historical Institute Series. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Further conflicts as between forestry and herding, or (sheep) herders and cattle farmers led to various solutions. Some confined wool production and sheep to large state and nobility domains or outsourced to professional shepherds with larger wandering herds.&lt;ref&gt;Veröffentlichungen des Max-Planck-Instituts für Geschichte. 2, Band 0, Max-Planck-Institut für Geschichte, Reiner Prass, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1958, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Agricultural Revolution]] was mainly based on a new system of [[crop rotation]], the  four-field rotation. [[United Kingdom|British]] agriculturist [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]] recognised the invention in Dutch [[Waasland]] and popularised it in the 18th century UK, [[George Washington Carver]] in the USA. The system used [[wheat]], [[turnip]]s and [[barley]] and introduced as well [[clover]]. Clover is able to fix nitrogen from air, a practically non exhaustive renewable resource, into fertilizing compounds to the soil and allowed to increase yields by large. Farmers opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop. Thus [[livestock]] could to be bred year-round and winter [[culling]] was avoided. The amount of manure rose and allowed more crops but to refrain from [[wood pasture]].&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

Early modern times and the 19th century saw the previous resource base partially replaced respectively supplemented by large scale chemical synthesis and by the use of fossil and mineral resources respectively.&lt;ref name= DCH/&gt; Besides the still central role of wood, there is a sort of renaissance of renewable products based on modern agriculture, genetic research and extraction technology. Besides fears about an upcoming [[peak oil|global shortage of fossil fuels]], local shortages due to boycotts, war and blockades or just transportation problems in remote regions have contributed to different methods of replacing or substituting fossil resources based on renewables.

===Challenges===
The use of certain basically renewable products as in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Animal substances|TCM]] [[endangered species|endangers various species]]. Just the black market in [[rhinoceros horn]] reduced the world's rhino population by more than 90 percent over the past 40 years.&lt;ref name=RH&gt;''"Rhino horn: All myth, no medicine"'', ''National Geographic'', Rhishja Larson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FTCMRH&gt;''Facts about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): rhinoceros horn'', Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/1035448/traditional-Chinese-medicine-TCM-as-discussed-in-rhinoceros-mammal Facts about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): rhinoceros horn, as discussed in rhinoceros (mammal):&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewables used for self sufficiency===

The success of the German chemical industry till World War I was based on the replacement of colonial products. The predecessors of [[IG Farben]]  dominated the world market for [[Dye|synthetic dyes]] at the beginning of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aftalion|1991|p=104}}, {{Harvnb|Chandler|2004|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had an important role in artificial [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[photographic film]], [[Agrichemical|agricultural chemicals]] and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemicals]].&lt;ref name= DCH&gt;{{Cite book|title = The German Chemical Industry in the Twentieth Century|last = Lesch|first = John E.|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the former [[Plant breeding]] research institutes took a different approach. After the loss of the [[German colonial empire]], important players in the field as [[Erwin Baur]] and [[Konrad Meyer]] switched to using local crops as base for economic [[autarky]].&lt;ref name="heim"&gt;Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus, (agrarian research during the NS regime) Susanne Heim, Wallstein, 2002, {{ISBN|389244496X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus, (agrarian research during the NS regime)|last = Heim|first = Susanne|publisher = Wallstein|year = 2002|isbn = 389244496X|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer as a key agricultural scientist and spatial planner of the Nazi era managed and lead [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] resources and focused about a third of the complete research grants in Nazi Germany on agricultural and genetic research and especially on resources needed in case of a further German war effort.&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt;  A wide array of agrarian research institutes still existing today and having importance in the field was founded or enlarged in the time.

There were some major failures as trying to e.g. grow [[Hardiness (plants)|frost resistant]] olive species, but some success in the case of [[hemp]], [[flax]], [[rapeseed]], which are still of current importance.&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt; During World War 2, German scientists tried to use Russian [[Taraxacum]] (dandelion) species to manufacture [[natural rubber]].&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt;  Rubber dandelions are still of interest, as scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) announced 2013 to have developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Rubber from Dandelion Juice|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131028114547.htm|work=sciencedaily.com|publisher=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal situation and subsidies==
Several legal and economic means have been used to enhance the market share of renewables.
The UK uses [[Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation]]s (NFFO), a collection of [[Statutory Instrument|orders]] requiring the electricity [[Distribution Network Operator]]s in [[England]] and [[Wales]] to purchase electricity from the [[nuclear power]] and [[renewable energy]] sectors. Similar mechanisms operate in [[Scotland]] (the Scottish Renewable Orders under the Scottish Renewables Obligation) and [[Northern Ireland]] (the Northern Ireland Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation). In the USA, [[Renewable Energy Certificates]] (RECs), use a similar approach. German [[Energy transition|Energiewende]] is using fed-in tariffs. An unexpected outcome of the subsidies was the quick increase of pellet byfiring in conventional fossil fuel plants (compare [[Tilbury power stations]]) and cement works, making wood respectively biomass accounting for about half of Europe’s renewable-energy consumption.&lt;ref Name=woodecon/&gt;

==Examples of industrial use==

===Biorenewable chemicals===
Biorenewable chemicals are chemicals created by biological organisms that provide feedstocks for the chemical industry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolau|first=Basil J.|last2=Perera|first2=M.

The tremendous diversity of enzymes in biological organisms, and the potential for [[synthetic biology]] to alter these enzymes to create yet new chemical functionalities, can drive the chemical industry.  A major platform for creation of new chemicals is the [[polyketide]] biosynthetic pathway, which generates chemicals containing repeated [[alkyl]] chain units with potential for a wide variety of [[functional group]]s at the different carbon atoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=Shivani|last2=Rizhsky|first2=Ludmila|last3=Jin|first3=Huanan|last4=Yu|first4=Xiaochen|last5=Jing|first5=Fuyuan|last6=Yandeau-Nelson|first6=Marna D.|last7=Nikolau|first7=Basil J.|title=Microbial production of bi-functional molecules by diversification of the fatty acid pathway|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1096717616000045|journal=Metabolic Engineering|volume=35|pages=9–20|doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2016.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leber|first=Christopher|last2=Da Silva|first2=Nancy A.|date=2014-02-01|title=Engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the synthesis of short chain fatty acids|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.25021/abstract|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|language=en|volume=111|issue=2|pages=347–358|doi=10.1002/bit.25021|issn=1097-0290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biomass]] is referring to [[biomaterial|biological material]] from living, or recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials.

Sustainable harvesting and use of renewable resources (i.e., maintaining a positive renewal rate) can reduce [[air pollution]], [[soil contamination]], [[habitat destruction]] and [[land degradation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Benefits of Renewable Energy Use |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/technology_and_impacts/impacts/public-benefits-of-renewable.html |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |accessdate=2013-01-04 |year=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325093405/http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/technology_and_impacts/impacts/public-benefits-of-renewable.html |archivedate=2012-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomass energy is derived from six distinct energy sources: garbage, wood, plants, waste, [[landfill gases]], and [[alcohol fuels]]. Historically, humans have harnessed biomass-derived energy since the advent of burning wood to make fire, and wood remains the largest biomass energy source today.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303740704577524822063133842] Retrieved on 2012-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global biomass fuel resources, Matti Parikka, in Biomass and Bioenergy, Volume 27, Issue 6, December 2004, Pages 613–620, Pellets 2002.

===Natural fibre===
{{main article|Natural fiber}}

Natural fibres are a class of hair-like materials that are continuous filaments or are in discrete elongated pieces, similar to pieces of [[yarn|thread]]. They can be used as a component of [[Composite material|composite]] materials. They can also be [[felted|matted]] into sheets to make products such as [[paper]] or [[felt]]. Fibres are of two types: natural fibre which consists of animal and plant fibres, and man made fibre which consists of synthetic fibres and regenerated fibres.

{{main article|Overfishing}}
''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' has described ocean over fishing as "simply the taking of wildlife from the sea at rates too high for fished species to replace themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocean.nationalgeographic.com/ocean/critical-issues-overfishing/ |title=Overfishing |publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tuna]] meat is driving overfishing as to endanger some species like the bluefin tuna. The European Community and other organisations are trying to regulate fishery as to protect species and to prevent their extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:358:0059:0080:EN:PDF COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 2371/2002] of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy.

===Deforestation===

{{main article|Deforestation}}
[[File:Deforestation Carceres Braasil 1996.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation in Brazil]] 1996]]
Besides their role as a resource for fuel and building material, trees protect the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide and by creating oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemistry.about.com/od/environmentalchemistry/f/oxygen-produced-by-trees.htm How Much Oxygen Does One Tree Produce?] By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D., About.com Guide&lt;/ref&gt;  The destruction of rain forests is one of the critical causes of [[climate change]]. Deforestation causes carbon dioxide to linger in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide accrues, it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation converts to heat which causes [[global warming]], which is better known as the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Mumoki, Fiona. “The Effects of Deforestation on our Environment Today.” Panorama. TakingITGlobal. 18 July 2006. Web. 24 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation also affects the [[water cycle]]. It reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation |work=UN Secretary-General’s Report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |archivedate=2001-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation reduces soil cohesion, so that [[Soil erosion|erosion]], flooding and [[landslide]]s ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH2/Rogge/index.htm|author=Daniel Rogge|work=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire|title=Deforestation and Landslides in Southwestern Washington|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805191140/http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH2/Rogge/index.htm|archivedate=2012-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/413717.stm |title=China's floods: Is deforestation to blame? |publisher=BBC News |date=August 6, 1999 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rain forests house many species and organisms providing people with food and other commodities.  In this way biofuels may well be unsustainable if their production contributes to deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/AssessingBiofuels/tabid/56055/Default.aspx |title=Assessing biofuels: towards sustainable production and use of resources |year=2009 |publisher=[[International Resource Panel]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]] |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endangered species===

Some renewable resources, species and organisms are facing a very high risk of extinction caused by growing human population and over-consumption. It has been estimated that over 40% of all living species on Earth are at risk of going extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525032656/http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 May 2017|title=Threatened Species|publisher=Conservation and Wildlife|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many nations have laws to protect hunted species and to restrict the practice of hunting. Other conservation methods include restricting land development or creating preserves. The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |title=Red List Overview |date=February 2011 |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527175928/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |archivedate=27 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, 199 countries have signed an accord agreeing to create [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to protect endangered and other threatened species.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13919">An approach to the [[foundations of mathematics]] that is of relatively recent origin, '''Scott–Potter set theory''' is a collection of nested [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatic set theories]] set out by the [[philosopher]] Michael Potter, building on earlier work by the [[mathematician]] [[Dana Scott]] and the philosopher [[George Boolos]].

Potter (1990, 2004) clarified and simplified the approach of Scott (1974), and showed how the resulting [[axiomatic set theory]] can do what is expected of such theory, namely grounding the [[cardinal number|cardinal]] and [[ordinal number]]s, [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]] and the other usual [[number system]]s, and the theory of [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]].

==ZU etc.==

===Preliminaries===
This section and the next follow Part I of Potter (2004) closely. The background logic is [[first-order logic]] with [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]]. The [[ontology]] includes [[urelement]]s as well as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], which makes it clear that there can be sets of entities defined by first-order theories not based on sets. The urelements are not essential in that other mathematical structures can be defined as sets, and it is permissible for the set of urelements to be empty.

Some terminology peculiar to Potter's set theory:
* ι is a [[definite description]] operator and binds a variable. (In Potter's notation the iota symbol is inverted.)
* The predicate U holds for all urelements (non-collections).
* ιxΦ(x) exists [[iff]] ([[Uniqueness quantification|∃!x]])Φ(x). (Potter uses Φ and other upper-case Greek letters to represent formulas.)
* {x : Φ(x)} is an abbreviation for  ιy(not U(y) and ([[forall|∀]]x)(x ∈ y ⇔ Φ(x))). 
* ''a'' is a '''collection''' if {''x'' : ''x''∈''a''} exists. (All sets are collections, but not all collections are sets.)
* The '''accumulation''' of ''a'', acc(''a''), is the set {''x'' : ''x'' is a urelement or [[Existential quantification|∃]]''b''∈''a'' (''x''∈''b'' or ''x''⊂''b'')}.
* If ∀''v''∈''V''(''v'' = acc(''V''∩''v'')) then ''V'' is a '''history'''.
* A '''level''' is the accumulation of a history.
* An '''initial level''' has no other levels as members. 
* A '''limit level''' is a level that is neither the initial level nor the level above any other level. 
* A '''set''' is a subcollection of some level.
* The '''birthday''' of set ''a'', denoted ''V''(''a''), is the lowest level ''V'' such that ''a''⊂''V''.

===Axioms===
The following three axioms define the theory '''ZU'''.

'''Creation''': ∀''V''∃''V' ''(''V''∈''V' '').

''Remark'': There is no highest level, hence there are infinitely many levels. This axiom establishes the [[ontology]] of levels.

'''Separation''': An [[axiom schema]]. For any first-order formula Φ(''x'') with (bound) variables ranging over the level ''V'', the collection {''x''∈''V'' : Φ(''x'')} is also a set.  (See [[Axiom schema of separation]].)

''Remark'': Given the levels established by ''Creation'', this schema establishes the existence of sets and how to form them. It tells us that  a level is a set, and all subsets, definable via [[first-order logic]], of levels are also sets. This schema can be seen as an extension of the background logic.

'''Infinity''': There exists at least one limit level.  (See [[Axiom of infinity]].)

''Remark'': Among the sets ''Separation'' allows, at least one is [[Infinity|infinite]]. This axiom is primarily [[mathematical]], as there is no need for the [[actual infinite]] in other human contexts, the human sensory order being necessarily [[Wikt:finite|finite]]. For mathematical purposes, the axiom "There exists an [[inductive set (axiom of infinity)|inductive set]]" would suffice.

===Further existence premises===
The following statements, while in the nature of axioms, are not axioms of '''ZU'''. Instead, they assert the existence of sets satisfying a stated condition. As such, they are "existence premises," meaning the following. Let '''X''' denote any statement below. Any theorem whose proof requires '''X''' is then formulated conditionally as "If '''X''' holds, then..." Potter defines several systems using existence premises, including the following two:
* '''ZfU''' =&lt;sub&gt;'''df'''&lt;/sub&gt;  '''ZU''' + ''Ordinals'';
* '''ZFU''' =&lt;sub&gt;'''df'''&lt;/sub&gt;   ''Separation'' + ''Reflection''.

'''Ordinals''': For each (infinite) ordinal α, there exists a corresponding level ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.

''Remark'': In words, "There exists a level corresponding to each infinite ordinal." ''Ordinals'' makes possible the conventional [[ordinal number|Von Neumann definition of ordinal numbers]]. 

Let τ(''x'') be a [[first-order logic|first-order term]].

'''[[axiom schema of replacement|Replacement]]''':  An [[axiom schema]]. For any collection ''a'', ∀''x''∈''a''[τ(''x'') is a set] → {τ(''x'') : ''x''∈''a''} is a set.

''Remark'': If the term τ(''x'') is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] (call it ''f''(''x'')), and if the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of ''f'' is a set, then the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of ''f'' is also a set.

'''Reflection''': Let Φ denote a [[first-order logic|first-order formula]] in which any number of [[free variable]]s are present. Let Φ&lt;sup&gt;(''V'')&lt;/sup&gt; denote Φ with these free variables all quantified, with the quantified variables restricted to the level ''V''.

Then ∃''V''[Φ→Φ&lt;sup&gt;(''V'')&lt;/sup&gt;] is an axiom.

''Remark'': This schema asserts the existence of a "partial" universe, namely the level ''V'', in which all properties Φ holding when the quantified variables range over all levels, also hold when these variables range over ''V'' only. ''Reflection'' turns ''Creation'', ''Infinity'', ''Ordinals'', and ''Replacement'' into theorems (Potter 2004: §13.3).

Let ''A'' and ''a'' denote sequences of non[[empty set]]s, each indexed by ''n''.

'''[[axiom of countable choice|Countable Choice]]''': Given any sequence ''A'', there exists a sequence ''a'' such that:
:∀''n''∈ω[''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;∈''A''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;].

''Remark''. ''Countable Choice'' enables proving that any set must be one of finite or infinite.

Let ''B'' and ''C'' denote sets, and let ''n'' index the members of ''B'', each denoted ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''[[axiom of choice|Choice]]''': Let the members of ''B'' be disjoint nonempty sets. Then:
:∃''C''∀''n''[''C''∩''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]].

==Discussion==
The [[Von Neumann universe]] implements the "iterative conception of set" by stratifying the universe of sets into a series of "levels," with the sets at a given level being the members of the sets making up the next higher level. Hence the levels form a nested and [[well-ordered]] sequence, and would form a [[hierarchy (mathematics)|hierarchy]] if set membership were [[transitive relation|transitive]]. The resulting iterative conception steers clear, in a well-motivated way, of the well-known [[paradox]]es of [[Russell's paradox|Russell]], [[Burali-Forti paradox|Burali-Forti]], and [[Cantor's paradox|Cantor]]. These paradoxes all result from the unrestricted use of the [[axiom of comprehension|principle of comprehension]] that [[naive set theory]] allows. Collections such as "the class of all sets" or "the class of all ordinals" include sets from all levels of the hierarchy. Given the iterative conception, such collections cannot form sets at any given level of the hierarchy and thus cannot be sets at all. The iterative conception has gradually become more accepted over time, despite an imperfect understanding of its historical origins.

Boolos's (1989) axiomatic treatment of the iterative conception is his set theory  ''S'', a two sorted [[first order logic|first order theory]] involving sets and levels.

===Scott's theory===
Scott (1974) did not mention the "iterative conception of set," instead proposing his theory as a natural outgrowth of the [[type theory|simple theory of types]]. Nevertheless, Scott's theory can be seen as an axiomatization of the iterative conception and the associated iterative hierarchy.

Scott began with an axiom he declined to name: the [[atomic formula]] ''x''∈''y'' implies that ''y'' is a set. In symbols:
:∀''x'',''y''∃''a''[''x''∈''y''→''y''=''a''].
His axiom of ''[[axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]]'' and [[axiom schema]] of ''Comprehension'' ([[axiom of separation|Separation]]) are strictly analogous to their [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] counterparts and so do not mention levels. He then invoked two axioms that do mention levels:
* ''Accumulation''. A given level "accumulates" all members and subsets of all earlier levels. See the above definition of ''accumulation''.
* ''Restriction''. All collections belong to some level.
''Restriction'' also implies the existence of at least one level and assures that all sets are well-founded.

Scott's final axiom, the ''Reflection'' [[axiom schema|schema]], is identical to the above existence premise bearing the same name, and likewise does duty for ZF's ''[[axiom of infinity|Infinity]]'' and ''[[axiom of replacement|Replacement]]''. Scott's system has the same strength as ZF.

===Potter's theory===
Potter (1990, 2004) introduced the idiosyncratic terminology described earlier in this entry, and discarded or replaced all of Scott's axioms except ''Reflection''; the result is '''ZU'''. '''ZU''', like ZF, cannot be finitely axiomatized. '''ZU''' differs from [[ZFC]] in that it:
* Includes no [[axiom of extensionality]] because the usual extensionality principle follows from the definition of collection and an easy lemma.
* Admits [[axiom of foundation|nonwellfounded]] collections. However Potter (2004) never invokes such collections, and all sets (collections which are contained in a level) are wellfounded. No theorem in Potter would be overturned if an axiom stating that all collections are sets were added to '''ZU'''.
*Includes no equivalents of [[axiom of choice|Choice]] or the axiom schema of [[axiom of replacement|Replacement]].

Hence '''ZU''' is closer to the [[Zermelo set theory]] of 1908, namely ZFC minus Choice, [[axiom of replacement|Replacement]], and Foundation. It is stronger than this theory, however, since cardinals and [[ordinal number|ordinals]] can be defined, despite the absence of Choice, using [[Scott's trick]] and the existence of levels, and no such definition is possible in Zermelo set theory. Thus in ZU, an equivalence class of:
*[[Equinumerous]] sets from a common level is a [[cardinal number]];
* [[Isomorphic]] [[well-ordering]]s, also from a common level, is an ordinal number.

Similarly the [[natural number]]s are not defined as a particular set within the iterative hierarchy, but as [[model theory|models]] of a "pure" Dedekind algebra. "Dedekind algebra" is Potter's name for a set closed under a unary [[injective]] operation, [[successor function|successor]], whose [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] contains a unique element, zero, absent from its [[range (mathematics)|range]]. Because the theory of Dedekind algebras is [[categorical theory|categorical]] (all models are [[isomorphic]]), any such algebra can proxy for the natural numbers.

Although Potter (2004) devotes an entire appendix to [[proper class]]es, the strength and merits of Scott–Potter set theory relative to the well-known rivals to ZFC that admit proper classes, namely [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]] and [[Morse–Kelley set theory]], have yet to be explored.

Scott–Potter set theory resembles [[New Foundations|NFU]] in that the latter is a recently (Jensen 1967) devised [[axiomatic set theory]] admitting both [[urelement]]s and sets that are not [[axiom of foundation|well-founded]]. But the urelements of NFU, unlike those of ZU, play an essential role; they and the resulting restrictions on [[axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]] make possible a proof of NFU's [[consistency]] relative to [[Peano arithmetic]]. But nothing is known about the strength of NFU relative to ''Creation''+''Separation'', NFU+''Infinity'' relative to ZU, and of NFU+''Infinity''+''Countable Choice'' relative to ZU + ''Countable Choice''.

Unlike nearly all writing on set theory in recent decades, Potter (2004) mentions [[mereology|mereological fusions]]. His ''collections'' are also synonymous with the "virtual sets" of [[Willard Quine]] and [[Richard Milton Martin]]: entities arising from the free use of the [[set builder notation|principle of comprehension]] that can never be admitted to the [[universe of discourse]].

'''Sibling rivalry''' is a type of [[competition]] or animosity among siblings, whether blood related or not.

Siblings generally spend more time together during childhood than they do with parents. The sibling bond is often complicated and is influenced by factors such as [[Parenting|parental]] treatment, [[birth order]], personality, and people and experiences outside the family.&lt;ref name="psychtoday"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jane Mersky Leder|title=Adult Sibling Rivalry|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/articles/199301/adult-sibling-rivalry|publisher=''[[Psychology Today]]''|accessdate=15 May 2018|date=January 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sibling rivalry is particularly intense when children are very close in age and of the same gender and/or where one or both children are [[Intellectual giftedness|intellectually gifted]].&lt;ref name="sylviarimm"&gt;[http://www.sylviarimm.com/article13.html The Effects of Sibling Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701155521/http://www.sylviarimm.com/article13.html |date=2007-07-01 }} Syliva B. Rimm, Educational Assessment Service, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Throughout the lifespan==
[[Image:MDRBobMomSmall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|From a young age, children are sensitive to differences in parental treatment.]]

According to observational studies by [[Judith Dunn]], children are sensitive from the age of one year to differences in parental treatment. From 18 months on siblings can understand family rules and know how to comfort and be kind to each other. By the age of 3, children have a sophisticated grasp of social rules, can evaluate themselves in relation to their siblings, and know how to adapt to circumstances within the family.&lt;ref name="psychtoday"/&gt;

Sibling rivalry often continues throughout childhood and can be very frustrating and stressful to parents.&lt;ref name="michigan"&gt;[http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/sibriv.htm Sibling Rivalry] University of Michigan Health System, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents fight for the same reasons younger children fight, but they are better equipped to physically, intellectually, and emotionally hurt and be intellectually and emotionally hurt by each other. Physical and emotional changes cause pressures in the teenage years, as do changing relationships with parents and friends. Fighting with siblings as a way to get parental attention may increase in adolescence.&lt;ref name="teenagers"&gt;[http://www.ext.nodak.edu/extnews/pipeline/teen-6w.htm Living With Your Teenager: Dealing With Sibling Rivalry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725054814/http://www.ext.nodak.edu/extnews/pipeline/teen-6w.htm |date=2011-07-25 }} Donna Rae Jacobson, North Dakota State University, July 1995&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that the age group 10 to 15 reported the highest level of competition between siblings.&lt;ref name="mcnerney"&gt;[http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/humannature01/FinalArticles/SiblingRivalryinDegreeand.html Sibling Rivalry in Degree and Dimensions Across the Lifespan] Annie McNerney and Joy Usner, 30 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sibling rivalry can continue into adulthood, and sibling relationships can change dramatically over the years. Events such as a parent’s illness may bring siblings closer together, whereas marriage may drive them apart, particularly if the in-law relationship is strained. Approximately one-third of adults describe their relationship with siblings as rivalrous or distant. However, rivalry often lessens over time. At least 80 percent of siblings over age 60 enjoy close ties.&lt;ref name="psychtoday"/&gt;

==Causes==

According to Kyla Boyse from the [[University of Michigan]], each child in a family competes to define who it is as an individual and wants to show that it is separate from its siblings.  Children may feel they are getting unequal amounts of their parents’ attention, discipline, and responsiveness. Children fight most in families where there is neither any understanding that fighting is not an acceptable way to resolve conflicts nor any alternative way of handling such conflicts; in families in which physical fighting is forbidden but no method of non-physical conflict resolution (''e.g.'', verbal argument) is permitted, the conversion and accumulation of everyday disputes into long-simmering hostilities can have an effect nearly as corrosive.  Stress in the parents’ and children’s lives can create more conflict and increase sibling rivalry.&lt;ref name="michigan"/&gt;

===Other psychological approaches===

[[Alfred Adler]] saw siblings as "striving for significance" within the family and felt that [[birth order]] was an important aspect of personality development. In fact, psychologists and researchers today endorse the influence of birth order, as well as age and gender constellations, on sibling relationships. However, parents are seen as capable of having an important influence on whether they are competitive or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/FrustAgg/levy.htm The Hostile Act] David M. Levy (1941) First published in Psychological Review, 48, 356-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Levy introduced the term "sibling rivalry" in 1941, claiming that for an older sibling "the aggressive response to the new baby is so typical that it is safe to say it is a common feature of family life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/laurie-kramer-interview/sibling-relationships/44340.aspx Interview with Laurie Kramer] G. Stepp (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers today generally endorse this view, noting that parents can ameliorate this response by being vigilant to favoritism and by taking appropriate preventative steps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/surviving-your-childs-adolescence/201103/adolescence-and-parental-favoritism.aspx Adolescence and parental favoritism] Carl Pickhardt (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, say researchers, the ideal time to lay the groundwork for a lifetime of supportive relationships between siblings is during the months prior to the new baby's arrival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/newbaby.htm Helping Your Older Child Adjust to a New Baby Sibling] University of Michigan Health System (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Parents can reduce the opportunity for rivalry by refusing to compare or typecast their children,&lt;ref name="Journal article"&gt;[http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/parenting-issues/family-favoritism/43568.aspx Parenting Issues: Playing Favorites] Stepp, G. (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; planning fun family activities together, and making sure each child has enough time and space of their own.&lt;ref name="michigan"/&gt; They can also give each child individual attention, encourage teamwork, refuse to hold up one child (such as the oldest) as a role model for the others (such as the younger children), and avoid favoritism.&lt;ref name="arkansas"&gt;[http://www.parenting-ed.org Center for Effective Parenting] Arkansas State Parent Information &amp; Resource Center&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching the children positive ways to ask for attention from parents when they need it can also make it less likely that they will resort to aggressive attention-getting strategies. [[Eileen Kennedy-Moore]] notes that this remedy also requires that parents "catch children being good" by responding to children's kind, helpful, and creative bids for attention.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy-Moore, E. &amp; Katayama, M. (2005). ''What About Me? 12 Ways to Get Your Parents' Attention Without Hitting Your Sister''. Seattle, WA: Parenting Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, by being proactive about teaching children [[emotional intelligence]], problem solving skills, negotiation skills and encouraging them to look for win-win solutions, parents can help children resolve conflicts that arise as a normal part of growing up together in the same household. A concerted effort by parents to reduce competitiveness while nurturing bonding can further help alleviate sibling rivalry.

However, according to Sylvia Rimm,  although sibling rivalry can be reduced it is unlikely to be entirely eliminated. In moderate doses, rivalry may be a healthy indication that each child is assertive enough to express his or her differences with other siblings.&lt;ref name="sylviarimm"/&gt;

Weihe&lt;ref&gt;Wiehe, V. R. (1997) Sibling abuse: Hidden physical, emotional, and sexual trauma, 2nd edition. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that four criteria should be used to determine if questioned and/or questionable behavior is rivalry or [[sibling abuse]]. First, given that children use different conflict-resolution tactics during various developmental stages, one must rule out the possibility that the questioned behavior is in fact age-appropriate for the child exhibiting it.  Second, one must determine whether the behavior is an isolated incident or instead part of an enduring pattern: abuse is, by definition, a long-term pattern rather than occasional disagreements.  Third, one must determine if there is an "aspect of victimization" to the behavior:  rivalry tends to be incident-specific, reciprocal, and obvious to others, while abuse is characterized by secrecy and an imbalance of power. Fourth, one must determine the goal of the questioned and/or questionable behavior:  while rivalry is motivated entirely or primarily by aspects of a child's self-interest in which [[wikt:disinterest|the interests of others, including the child's rival, do not play a role]], in scenarios featuring abuse the perpetrator's ultimate interests tend to include domination, humiliation, or at least embarrassment of the victim.

==Animals==
{{main|Sibling rivalry (animals)}}
Sibling rivalry is common among various animal species, in the form of competition for food and parental attention. An extreme type of sibling rivalry occurs when young animals kill their siblings. For example, a [[black eagle]] mother lays two eggs, and the first-hatched chick pecks the younger one to death within the first few days. In the [[blue-footed booby]], there is always the emergence of a brood hierarchy. The dominant chick will attack the subordinate one in times of food scarcity, often pecking it repeatedly or driving it from the nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drummond |first1=Hugh|last2=Chavelas |first2=Cecilia Garcia |title=Food Shortage Influences Sibling Aggression in the Blue-footed Booby |journal=Animal Behaviour |year=1989 |volume=37 |pages=806–819 |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(89)90065-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[spotted hyena]]s, sibling competition begins as soon as the second pup is born, and 25% of pups are killed by their siblings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sulloway.org/Holcomb.pdf Birth Order, Sibling Competition, and Human Behavior] Frank J Sulloway&lt;/ref&gt; (see: [[Siblicide]])

Sibling relationships in animals are not always competitive. For example, among [[wolves]], older siblings help to feed and guard the young.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/0501/0501_feature.html Mothers and Others] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324181241/http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/0501/0501_feature.html |date=2006-03-24 }} Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, Natural History Magazine, May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous instances==

===In religion===
[[Image:Cain leadeth abel to death tissot.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Cain leads Abel to Death'', by James Tissot.]]

The [[Book of Genesis]] in the [[Bible]] contains several examples of sibling rivalry: the story of [[Cain and Abel]] tells of one brother's jealousy after God appears to favour his sibling, and the jealousy ultimately leads to murder. [[Esau]] was jealous of his brother [[Jacob's]]   inheritance and blessing; sisters [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]] compete for the love of Jacob; [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]'s brothers are so jealous that they effectively sell him into slavery. The following are also present in the [[Qur'an]] and the Torah.

===In literature===
A number of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays display the incidences of sibling rivalry. [[King Lear]] provokes rivalry among his three daughters by asking them to describe their love for him; in the same play, Edmund contrives to force his half-brother Edgar into exile. In ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', sisters Kate and Bianca are shown fighting bitterly. In ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', the title character is at least partially motivated by rivalry with his brother, King Edward. In ''[[As You Like It]]'', there is obvious sibling rivalry and antagonism between Orlando and Oliver, and also between Duke Frederick and Duke Senior.

Most adaptations of [[Sherlock Holmes]] depicts sibling rivalry with his brother, [[Mycroft Holmes]].

In [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', the brothers Cal and Aron Trask are counterparts to Cain and Abel of the Bible story.

''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' contains numerous examples, such as that between [[Stannis Baratheon]] and [[Renly Baratheon]]. After their eldest brother [[Robert Baratheon]]'s death they contend for the Iron Throne, Stannis finally killing Renly through dark magic, though it is left unclear whether he is aware of his role in Renly's death. The history of Westeros also contains "The Dance of the Dragons", in which Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon II Targaryen fought over the Iron Throne after their father Viserys I Targaryen's death, Aegon eventually killing Rhaenyra, but being poisoned shortly after, leading to Rhaenyra's son Aegon III becoming King.

===In film and television===
Sibling rivalry is a common theme in media that features child characters, reflecting the importance of this issue in early life. These issues can include jealousy on the birth of a new baby, different sibling roles, frequent arguments, competitiveness for mother's affection, and tensions between step-siblings.

Adult siblings can also be portrayed with a rivalrous relationship, often a continuation of childhood conflicts. [[Situation comedies]] exploit this to comic effect. Sibling relationships may be shown as alternately loving and argumentative. Brothers or sisters in a similar line of work may display professional rivalry. In serious drama, conflict between siblings can be fatal, as shown in [[crime drama]]s involving such rivalries.

===Real life===
Occasionally real life instances of sibling rivalry are publicized in the mass media. Siblings who play the same sport will often be compared with each other; for example, [[American football]] players [[Peyton Manning|Peyton]] and [[Eli Manning]], or [[tennis]] players [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]]. Musicians [[Liam Gallagher|Liam]] and [[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] are portrayed as having a turbulent relationship, similar to that of [[Ray Davies|Ray]] and [[Dave Davies]] of [[The Kinks]]. Politicians [[Ed Miliband|Ed]] and [[David Miliband]] are likewise portrayed as having a strained relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{refimprove||date=November 2013}}

A '''story generator''' or '''plot generator''' is a tool that generates basic [[narratives]] or [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] ideas. The generator could be in the form of a computer program, a chart with multiple columns, a book composed of panels that flip independently of one another, or a set of several adjacent reels that spin independently of one another, allowing a user to select elements of a [[narrative]] plot. The tool may allow the user to select elements for the narrative, or it may combine them randomly, a specific variation known as a '''random plot generator'''. Such tools can be created for virtually any [[genre]], although they tend to produce formulaic and hackneyed situations.

== History ==
Plot generators were described as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Derek |last=Rowntree |title=Do You Really Need a Home Computer? |publisher=Scribner |year=1985 |isbn=0-684-18182-7 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article originally published in 1935 and reprinted in 2002, [[Robert J. Hogan (author)|Robert J. Hogan]] described a book-based device called the ''Plot Genie'' which consisted of three lists of 180 items each: murder victims in the first list, crime locations in the second list, and important clues in the third list. The item to use from each list was chosen by spinning a dial with 180 numbers on it. Hogan also mentions other similar devices called ''The 36 Dramatic Situations'' and ''Plotto: The Master Book of All Plots''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inside an Author's Brain: The Birth of a Book Length Mystery Novelette |first=Robert J.|last=Hogan |journal=[[Writer's Digest]] |date=October 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pulp Masters |first=James |last=van Hise |year=2002| pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Plotto'' by William Wallace Cook is a non-random plot generator. The reader makes all the decisions within the framework set out by the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/plottonewmethodo00cook|title=Plotto|last=Cook|first=William Wallace|date=1928|publisher=Ellis Publishing Company|year=|isbn=|location=Battle Creek, MI|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eger, Markus, Colin M. Potts, Camille Barot, and R. Michael Young. 2015. “[http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AIIDE/AIIDE15/paper/download/11602/11402 Plotter: Operationalizing the Master Book of All Plots].” In ''Eleventh Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment Conference'', 30–33. Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest computerized story generator was TALE-SPIN, an [[artificial intelligence]] program developed in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Selmer |last1=Bringsjord |first2=David A. |last2=Ferrucci |title=Artificial Intelligence and Literary Creativity: Inside the Mind of BRUTUS, a Storytelling Machine |location=Mahwah, New Jersey |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=2000 |isbn=0-8058-1986-X |pages=122, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=TALE-SPIN |first=James |last=Meehan |editor1-first=Roger C. |editor1-last=Schank |editor2-first=Christopher K. |editor2-last=Riesbeck |title=Inside Computer Understanding: Five Programs Plus Miniatures |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1981 |isbn=0-89859-071-X |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently in the 1990s, the computer program MEXICA was developed for academic research into automated plot generation. It produces plots related to the [[Mexica]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rafael |last=Pérez y Pérez |title=Computational Creativity Research: Towards Creative Machines |chapter=From MEXICA to MEXICA-Impro: The Evolution of a Computer Model for Plot Generation |editor1-first=Tarek Richard |editor1-last=Besold |editor2-first=Marco |editor2-last=Schorlemmer |editor3-first=Alan |editor3-last=Smaill |publisher=Atlantis Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-94-6239-084-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using an approach similar to that of MEXICA, the program ProtoPropp generates stories related to [[Russian folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://tomcat-stable.hcmc.uvic.ca:8080/ach/site/xhtml.xq?id=105 |title=Story Generators: Models and Approaches for the Generation of Literary Artefacts |first1=Birte |last1=Lönneker |first2=Jan Christoph |last2=Meister |first3=Pablo |last3=Gervás |first4=Federico |last4=Peinado |first5=Michael |last5=Mateas |conference=Joint Conference of the Association for Computers and the Humanities/Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing |conference-url=http://tomcat-stable.hcmc.uvic.ca:8080/ach/site/index.htm |date=June 2005 |location=[[University of Victoria]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a large number of "random plot generators" available on the internet—generic and relating to specific [[fandom]]s, with a certain amount of academic research into the subject.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Plot generators have also been portrayed in fiction, as in [[Fritz Leiber]]'s ''The Silver Egghead''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Story Generator Algorithm ==
The term story generator algorithms (SGAs) refers to computational procedures resulting in an artifact that can be considered a story. In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the automated generation of stories has been a subject of research for over fifty years. An algorithm is understood as a set of instructions that, when applied to a given input, produces an output. In the present context, the desired output is a story. The underlying concept of “story” in SGAs is functional and does not imply any aesthetic notion. This is important because it sets the context for evaluation of generated stories, for which having a surface realization as a readable and appealing text is not necessarily a core issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gervás|first1=Pablo|title=Story Generator Algorithms|url=http://wikis.sub.uni-hamburg.de/lhn/index.php/Story_Generator_Algorithms|website=The living book of narratology|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huttner.hitler.melbourne.jpg|thumb|right| Installation view of poster project “Young Dictators” (Hitler as child), by Per Hüttner at public location in Melbourne, September 2009.]]
'''The Invisible Generation''' was a contemporary art project conceived by artist [[Per Hüttner]] and Curator [[Daniele Balit]] and organized by [[Vision Forum (art organisation)|Vision Forum]] and created new meeting places between art and its audiences. A great number of projects were realized in  [[Melbourne]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Beijing]] and [[Kiev]] in 2009-2010. For each city the program and artist list was totally new. No project was ever repeated twice. The project always allowed the audience to meet art in new and unexpected situations and played with or confused the audiences’ expectations about what art is, where it normally appears and what shape it should take.&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation"&gt;The Invisible Generation, ed. Gerrie van Noord, design Marie Proyard, Published by Vision Forum, Stockholm, Sweden. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most projects were realized in contexts where the audience does not necessarily expect to find artwork. In the metro (Dinu Li, Per Hüttner), in a newspaper office (Yan Jun), on a public square (Natasha Rosling) or even contained as a story in the mind of a person in a shop (Good TV). In other instances the project played with the perceived immutability of the artwork. The audience was asked to actively create or re-create artwork (The Anti-Hospital), remove or destroy drawings (Jean-François Robardet), bring books to be changed (Private Contractors) or in some cases it was disguised as an informative poster, graffity or political propaganda (Huang Xiaopeng, Per Hüttner).

The inspiration and title is taken from a text by [[William S. Burroughs]] where he describes a series of situation where a tape recorder is used to create new forms of meeting between people and new forms of engagement with the media.

==Melbourne, September 2009==
The first part of The Invisible Generation opened to the public in Australia in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undo.net/cgi-bin/undo/pressrelease/pressrelease.pl?id=1252072574&amp;day=1253138400&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation was co-curated by Hüttner and Balit. It was introduced at the [[Margaret Lawrence Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vca.unimelb.edu.au/gallarchive09/#cs_3602&lt;/ref&gt; which was also the starting point for a number of interventions in the public space of the city. In the gallery were two major installations presented: Do Not Go Gentle Court by Per Hüttner and Polka Dot by French artist Mark Geffriaud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fracidf-leplateau.com/en/index.html  The work is in the collection of FRAC Île de France]&lt;/ref&gt; The two works redefine the gallery experience through reflections on the fabric of space and time. Being situated at the boundaries between installation and performance, they delineated a space that was the starting point for the Anti-Hospital, an open-ended and evolving platform which formed the core of the project. The Anti-Hospital was designed by Melbourne-based collective Greatest Hits&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatesthitswebsite.com/the-invisible-generation.html&lt;/ref&gt; and focused around a collection of artistic documents providing instructions that were formulated as possible actions, performances, temporary artworks, objects and social situations, scores and sonic interventions proposed by absent artists and realized by local artists, non-artists and visitors to the gallery. Greatest Hits created a dozen videos that enacted, played with and read out the instructions and together created a sort of manual to aid and inspire the visitor to relate to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://tig-melbourne.blogspot.com/2009/12/greatest-hits-video-excerpt-montage.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many instructions were interpreted, primarily by local artists while the exhibition was open to the public.

For the period of the exhibition the Anti-Hospital also coordinated a series of events, performances, actions, workshops and ways of disseminating the instructions through the media and the urban space of Melbourne including, local artists, students and a program on the screen and LEDs at Federation Square. This included the controversial project “Young Dictators” conceived and realized by Per Hüttner with two local students. The three put up 2000 copies of A4 sized posters around the city showing images of dictators such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] as children with the text “Have you seen this child? Please contact 0432 027 925” (Hüttner’s mobile number).

[[File:Dinu.li.low.jpg|thumb|right| Video stills of Dinu Li's performance on the Shenzhen Metro that was part of The Invisible Generation, November 2009.]]

==Shenzhen October 2009==
Where the presentation in Melbourne focused on the relationship between suspended instructions in the gallery and interventions in the public space, the project in Shenzhen consisted mostly of unannounced performances in the public space and hosted by the contemporary art museum OCAT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocat.com.cn Official OCAT website]&lt;/ref&gt; The shift in political, economical, social and architectural context also meant the dynamics of the project changed greatly and made the participation of the local audience more difficult to achieve, but all the more successful on the occasions where it happened. Presentations included carnivalesque costumes appearing in public space as temporary and wearable architectural elements by Natasha Rosling. Yang Zhifei carried a giant white pillow through the streets of the city and she let an army of people sleep in public spaces, each with a normally sized pillow under their head. She also organized a dream workshop to compare the dreams of the Chinese with those of the Dutch. [[Dinu Li]] created a choreography of corruption and guilt on the Shenzhen underground provoking fear in the audience and laying bare how deep inside the psyches of its citizens a [[totalitarian]] government can reach. Neno Belchev designed a portable zebra crossings to facilitate [[jaywalking]], a passion shared by the Chinese and [[Bulgarians]].&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation" /&gt;

[[File:Yzf1low.jpg|thumb|left| Yang Zhifei's performance in Beijing that was part of The Invisible Generation, October 2009.]]

==Beijing July 2009 – July 2010==
The events in Beijing took place over a whole year and culminated in a large presentation at [[Ullens Center for Contemporary Art]] in June 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucca.org.cn/portal/activitie/view.798?id=520&amp;lang=en&amp;menuId=28&lt;/ref&gt; Presentations kicked off with summer 2009 with Jon Phillips and [[Matt Hope|Matt Hope’s]] speaker event "Laoban Sound System" in conjunction with [[Ai Weiwei|Ai Weiwei’s]] day without internet. The two has since launched a range of events in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;http://laoban-soundsystem.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Other events included Yan Jun’s sonic material slipped into the desk drawers at Beijing Youth Weekly editorial office and interviews from the same newspaper that were replayed and perverted over 6 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.birdcagespace.com/index.php?/next-episode/yan-jun/&lt;/ref&gt; Good TV collected memories of images that had been lost for different reasons. collection of lost images retold by storytellers in their everyday life in the Wudaoying Hutong (五道营胡同). The Beijing context and the proximity to the centre of political power allowed “This Image Is No More” to develop another layer of interpretation which had been lacking in its realization in Europe. Both Natasha Rosling and Yang Zhifei created versions of their projects from Shenzhen in Beijing. Especially the giant white pillow carried through the streets the Chinese capital to mirrored its grandiose buildings in ways that also inspired interesting reactions among the unassuming audience.

==Kiev, November 2009 and July 2010==
In November Yulia Usova and PAI organised a series of talks in Kiev that approached issues such as [[Cultural heritage management|curation]] and art in public spaces and included speakers such as [[Olesya Turkina]], [[Olav Westphalen]] and Karen MacDonald. In conjunction with this a group of students from [[Kungliga Konsthögskolan]] in [[Stockholm]] made a series of improvised performances at [[Les Kurbas’ Theater Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kurbas.org.ua/en/les_kurbas.html Les Kurbas presentation in English]&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of the project took place during the [[swine flu]] epidemic in Ukraine  all public theatre events were stopped and schools closed giving the whole event a very special flavour.

The actual project was scheduled to be realized in April 2010, but had to be cancelled due to the volcanic ash cloud that prevented air travel in Europe at the given time and only web-performances were undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undo.net/cgi-bin/undo/pressrelease/pressrelease.pl?id=1271946267&amp;day=1271973600&lt;/ref&gt; The project was realized 19 June and 2–4 July 2010 and was co-curated by Per Hüttner and Yulia Usova.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.si.se/Creative-Force/Start/Creative-Force/News/Nyheter/Invisible-generation/&lt;/ref&gt; The project saw a meeting between artists from China, Western Europe and Ukraine. Rumours claim that artists met with great problems with local authorities including arrests, theft by undercover policemen and that the artists had to bribe officials to be able to leave the country.&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation" /&gt;

==Documentation and talks==
Since most of the events in The Invisible Generation only had an unexpecting audience, the organizers present the documentation of the project in various art institutions around the world, including UCCA in Beijing and Norrköpings Konstmuseum in Sweden. Vision Forum has also published an extensive catalogue about The Invisible Generation in 2011. It was edited by Gerrie van Noord and includes all the original instructions presented in Melbourne. The publication also contains texts by Daniele Balit, Per Hüttner, Olav Westphalen and incidentally contains a reproduction of this page. The book is framed by three texts by the editor, Gerrie van Noord where she reflects on the difficulty and necessity of mediating projects ephemeral projects like The Invisible Generation.&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation" /&gt;

'''Tunnel vision''' metaphorically denotes the reluctance to [[critical thinking|consider alternatives]] to one's preferred line of thought; instances include [[physician]]s treating patients, [[detective]]s considering [[crime suspect]]s, or anyone predisposed to a favored outcome.&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tunnel%20vision | title=Merriam Webster dictionary | accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common way to solve this problem is a [[second opinion]], that is, getting somebody unrelated to the original investigation to look at it from the beginning, without the same [[bias]]es and preconceptions. This is generally due to bias from preceding incidents. One key example of "tunnel vision" is [[racial profiling]] in the United States.

[[Image:Ernst Haeckel 2.jpg|thumb|170px|right| [[Ernst Haeckel]] wrote about the ''World Riddle'' in 1895]]

The term "'''world riddle'''" or "'''world-riddle'''" has been associated, for over 100 years, with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (who mentioned ''Welträthsel'' in several of his writings)
and with the [[biologist]]-[[philosopher]] [[Ernst Haeckel]], who, as a [[professor]] of [[zoology]] at the [[University of Jena]],&lt;ref name=Ha1911&gt;
     "Biography of Ernst Heinrich Haeckel, 1834&amp;ndash;1919" ([[Article (publishing)|article]]),

&lt;/ref&gt;
wrote the book ''Die Welträthsel'' in 1895&amp;ndash;1899, in modern spelling ''Die Welträtsel'' ([[German language|German]] "The World-riddles"), with the English version published under the title ''The Riddle of the Universe'', 1901.&lt;ref name=Ha1911/&gt;

The term "world riddle" concerns the nature of the universe and the [[meaning of life]].

The question and answer of the World Riddle has also been examined as an inspiration or [[allegory|allegorical meaning]] within some musical compositions, such as the unresolved harmonic progression at the end of ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896) by [[composer]] [[Richard Strauss]], made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

== View of Nietzsche ==
[[Image:FWNietzscheSiebe.jpg|thumb|120px|right| [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].]]

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] referred to the "World Riddle" (''Welträthsel'') in several of his writings; however, his direct influence was limited to a few years, by his failing health.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

== View of Haeckel ==
[[Ernst Haeckel]] viewed the World Riddle as a dual-question of the form, "What is the nature of the physical universe and what is the nature of human thinking?" which he explained would have a single answer since humans and the universe were contained within one system, a mono-system, as Haeckel wrote in 1895:

&lt;/ref&gt;
:: [From ''Monism as Connecting Religion and Science'' by Ernst Haeckel (translated):]
:: "The following lecture on [[Monism]] is an informal address delivered extemporaneously on October 9, 1892, at Altenburg, on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the ''"Naturforschende Gesellschaft des Osterlandes."'' ... The "exacting" [[Berlin]] [[physiologist]] shut this knowledge out from his mind, and, with a short-sightedness almost inconceivable, placed this special [[neurological]] question alongside of the one great "'''world-riddle'''," the fundamental question of substance, the general question of the connection between matter and energy.  As I long ago pointed out, these two great questions are not two separate "'''world-riddles'''." The neurological problem of [[consciousness]] is only a special case of the all-comprehending [[cosmology|cosmological]] problem, the question of substance. "If we understood the nature of matter and energy, we should also understand how the substance underlying them can under certain conditions feel, desire, and think." Consciousness, like feeling and willing, among the higher animals is a mechanical work of the [[ganglion|ganglion-cells]], and as such must be carried back to chemical and physical events in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of these.  -Ernst Haeckel, 1895 &lt;ref name=PGmono/&gt;

Haeckel had written that human behavior and feeling could be explained, within the laws of the physical universe, as "mechanical work of the ganglion-cells" as stated.

== View of William James ==
The [[philosopher]] [[William James]] in his book ''[[Pragmatism]]'' (1907) wrote about the world-riddle, as follows:

:: [From ''Pragmatism'' (Lecture VII) by William James:]
:: "All the great single-word answers to the world's riddle, such as God, the One, Reason, Law, Spirit, Matter, Nature, Polarity, the [[Dialectic]] Process, the Idea, the Self, the Oversoul, draw the admiration that men have lavished on them from this oracular role. By amateurs in philosophy and professionals alike, the universe is represented as a queer sort of petrified sphinx whose appeal to man consists in a monotonous challenge to his divining powers. THE Truth: what a perfect idol of the rationalistic mind!"
:::::::::::: --William James, ''Pragmatism'', 1907.&lt;ref name=GutenWJ&gt;
     "The Project Gutenberg EBook of Pragmatism, by William James" (text),
     Project Gutenberg, 2002, Gutenberg.org webpage:
     [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/prgmt10.txt Gutenberg-Pragmatism].
&lt;/ref&gt;

William James has questioned the attitude of thinking that a single answer applies to everything or everyone.  In the passage, the capitalized "THE" signifies the viewpoint meaning "the one and only" [[absolute truth]].

== Emil du Bois-Reymond ==
[[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] used the term "World Riddle" in 1880 for [[Emil_du_Bois-Reymond#The_Seven_World_Riddles|seven great questions]] of science, such as the ultimate nature of matter and the origin of simple sensations. In the lecture to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] he declared that neither science nor philosophy could ever explain these riddles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Emil du Bois-Reymond: Neuroscience, Self, and Society in Nineteenth-Century Germany|last=Finkelstein|first=Gabriel Ward|date=2013|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262019507|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/berdiegrenzende07reygoog]
