'''Alexander Mantashev''' ({{Lang-hy|Ալեքսանդր Մանթաշյանց}}, Aleksandr Mantashiants; {{Lang-ru|Александр Иванович Манташев}}, Aleksandr Ivanovich Mantashev; 3 March 1842 &amp;ndash; 19 April 1911 and was buried on 30 April in the [[Armenian Pantheon of Tbilisi]]) was a prominent [[Russian Armenia|Armenian]] [[petroleum|oil]] [[magnate]], [[industrialist]], [[financier]], and a [[philanthropy|philanthropist]].  By the end of his life he had become one of the world's wealthiest individuals.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Early life==
Born in Tiflis (modern [[Tbilisi]]), Mantashev spent most of his childhood in [[Tabriz]], in northern [[Iran]], where his father was involved in the [[cotton]] and [[textile]] trade. Being the only son, he was involved in his father's business affairs early on. In 1869, he moved to [[Manchester]] (known as [[Cottonopolis]] in the 19th century), a major center of cotton and textile processing industries, from where he helped ship goods to his father in Tabriz. Mantashev's stay in Manchester played an important role in the development of his character. Not only did he learn the secrets and crafts of the textile industry in Manchester, but he also delved into the intricacies of European business and [[Culture of England|English culture]]. During this period he learned the [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]] [[languages]]. In 1872, Mantashev returned to Tiflis with his father. In the first floor of the hotel ''Caucasus'', located in [[Freedom Square, Tbilisi|Erivansky Square]], the Mantashevs opened a cotton store, then another one, eventually becoming fully engaged in the wholesale textile trade. After his father's death in 1887, Alexander purchased most of the shares of the Tiflis Central Commercial Bank — thus becoming its principal shareholder, and then the Chairman of the Board of the Bank. The bank was involved in almost every aspect of trade in the Caucasus.  Incidentally, Tifkombank was the only financial institution in the Caucasus whose shares traded on the [[Saint Petersburg]] Stock Exchange. In the early 1890s, Alexander was already a 1st guild merchant and a Speaker of the Tiflis [[duma]]. It was then that he became interested in a new business venture, when he was looking into the prospects of [[Baku]] oil.

==Oil tycoon==
[[File:Alex Mantashyants Yerevan.jpg|thumb|The statue of Alexander Mantashev in [[Yerevan]]]] 
This was the epoch of the world oil trade. The underground black liquid promised entrepreneurs incredible profits and opened ambitious prospects. The only requirements were a large investment and the ability to run the business. These Mantashev had. His chief accountant recalled that not a single document went into effect without Alexander's resolution, "Asttsov" ("with God" in Armenian). Mantashev, not being afraid of high risk investments, bought (together with another Armenian colleague, Michael Aramyants) unprofitable oil wells in Baku that very soon became profitable. In 1894 he created a tentative association along with the other major oil interests in [[Russia]], the [[Branobel|Nobels]] and the [[Rothschild banking family of France|Rothschild]]s, in order to cooperate in the marketing of petroleum products within certain geographical areas. This was in response to [[Standard Oil]]'s aggressive marketing policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Mantashev introduced Gulbenkian to the right circles in Cairo, including [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Sir Evelyn Baring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

His company owned a factory for the fabrication of canisters for the packaging and storage of oil in [[Batumi]], a mechanical workshop in [[Zabrat]], an oil pumping station in [[Odessa]], and even one hundred freight cars circulating in the southwestern railways of Russia. (The young [[Joseph Stalin]] organized strikes in Mantashev's Batumi factory and participated in street demonstrations in 1902.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | page =43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[England]] Mantashev bought two tankers, which supplied oil to [[India]], [[China]], [[Japan]] and the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] countries. In 1899 he created the trading house "A.I. Mantashev and Co.", opening representative offices and warehouses in the major cities of Europe and Asia: [[İzmir|Smyrna]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Alexandria]], Cairo, [[Port Said]], [[Damascus]], [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and [[Shanghai]]. Mantashev became a shareholder in a number of oil companies, among them the Nobel Brothers. 51.3% of the total stock of oil and 66.8% of the oil content in the Caspian Sea was centered on the firm. In 1904, it was the third largest oil company in Baku, next to only the Nobel Brothers and the [[Caspian Sea Society]] of the Rothschild brothers.

Once while riding on a train from [[Vienna]] to Paris, Mantashev was accompanied by a silent passenger in the same car. Mantashev failed in all his attempts to communicate with the passenger. Only when it came to the subject of Baku oil did the silent passenger become talkative. During their discussion he had asked several professional questions regarding oil and had mentioned that the only person he had heard of in Baku was Alexander Mantashev. Mantashev smiled and introduced himself. The conversation stalled thereafter. In Paris, they shook hands and parted. A few days later Mantashev was invited to a cocktail party by Britain's [[Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Baron Rothschild]]. It became clear that the Baron had been the silent passenger on the train because the personal invitation contained several lines regarding their encounter on the train.

Mantashev funded the [[Baku-Batumi pipeline]] which was launched in 1907, becoming the world's longest pipeline, 835 kilometers long. From 1899 to 1909, his company by volume of fixed capital (22 million [[ruble]]s) was the largest in Russian industry. It is said that before buying oil wells Mantashev personally examined them. He knew that a rich deposit may suddenly dry up, and vice versa: a well seemingly lacking in [[oil exploration|prospects]] could end up as a rich fountain. Surrounded by a group of geologists and petroleum engineers, he visited the sites asking countless questions, carefully studying land-color, softness etc.; he even smelled the land. Mantashev always inquired into the status of the neighbouring sites, often seemingly choosing them at random and saying : "It's here, start digging." No one could understand what it was that made him choose that particular spot. But his decision was always final. The great paradox was that when drilling commenced, an oil fountain was almost always discovered.

==Philanthropist==

[[Image:Ներսիսյան դպրոց.jpg|thumb|The Nersisian school in Tiflis, renovated by Mantashev in 1905]]
Along with twelve like-minded people he founded the "[[Armenian Charitable Society in the Caucasus]]". He donated 300,000 rubles towards the building of the [[Nersisyan School|Nersessian spiritual academy]]. He donated 250,000 rubles to the holy town of [[Echmiadzin]] for the building of the residence of the [[Catholicos of Armenia|Catholicos of All Armenians]] (construction completed in 1914). Mantashev hand-picked fifty talented young Armenians and sent over two hundred to study at the best universities of Russia and Europe. Among them was the famous Armenian composer [[Komitas Vardapet|Komitas]], [[Hrachya Acharyan]] and the controversial Communist revolutionary [[Stepan Shahumyan]] as well as others who became famous later on. The most famous donation made by Mantashev remains the [[Armenian Church]] of St. John the Baptist in Paris on [[Jean Goujon]] street. He explained that he chose Paris because that's the city where he sinned most. During its construction in 1904 Mantashev spent 1,540,000 francs. For this act, the President of France gave Alexander Mantashev the Order of the [[Legion of Honor]].

==Personality and legacy==
[[File:Alexander Mantashev 2017 stamp of Armenia.jpg|thumb|Postage stamp dedicated to the theme “World famous Armenians. 175th anniversary of Alexander Mantashian”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haypost.am/en/1488546791 World famous Armenians. 175th anniversary of Alexander Mantashian]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Despite all of his wealth Mantashev led a modest lifestyle. He did not like gold and never wore jewellery. He only attached a fresh flower to his vest. He did not have an entourage and enjoyed travelling by [[tram]] in Tiflis. It is said that Mantashev only carried with him 20 gold coins and five rubles. Mantashev loved the theatre. In Tiflis he built the Pitoewski Theatre (now the [[Rustaveli Theatre]]). In the Academie National de Musique of Paris he had a personal lounge. He intended to build a similar theatre in [[Yerevan]]. The Small Hall of the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra was also built by him. Mantashev died on 19 April 1911 in Saint Petersburg. His body was moved to Tiflis and buried next to his wife at the cemetery of Van Cathedral which was being restored at the time with his donations. After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, his company ceased to exist along with all the other oil companies in Russia. In 1933, by the order of [[Lavrentiy Beria]], the Van Cathedral was destroyed along with the cemetery where Mantashev was buried. Today he is remembered in [http://hush.am/index.php?route=product/hush&amp;grave_id=hush786b1bc3e68fe52 Tbilisi] for his charity, where many of his buildings are still standing, and in Yerevan, where a downtown street was named after him along with a major luxury goods store. A monument of Mantashian has been erected in Yerevan in April 2012.

The '''Anglo Adriatic Investment Fund''' [[S.A. (corporation)|SA]] was an investment fund set up to hold privatisation vouchers issued by the government of post-Communist Albania. It was unsuccessful in its attempts to reinvest them and collapsed.

==Early success==
At one point the fund had 450,000 shareholders and vouchers with a nominal value of more than $120 million.&lt;ref name="IT1212156417272"/&gt;

==Collapse==
But AAIF had collected too many vouchers: it had 12%&lt;ref name="SEEDMema"/&gt; of all the vouchers and privatisation leks combined, more than the 10% maximum&lt;ref name="SEEDMema"/&gt; prescribed by law.&lt;ref group=nb name="LN7979"&gt;Law No. 7979, entitled "On Investment Funds", dated 26.07.95, see [http://www.seedcenter.gr/projects/MNE/1stconfer/1stconf_papers/Mema.pdf] for source&lt;/ref&gt; Following a lengthy period of negotiation and accusation between AAIF and the Albanian government,&lt;ref name="SEEDMema"/&gt; AAIF was left unable to continue with the privatisation.&lt;ref name="SEEDMema"/&gt; Even worse, the market value of the vouchers had dropped during the [[1997 rebellion in Albania|collapse of the Albanian economy]] from 25.6%&lt;ref name="SEEDMema"/&gt; of their nominal value in January 1996&lt;ref name="SEEDMema"/&gt; to 1.7%&lt;ref name="SEEDMema"/&gt; in October 1998.&lt;ref name="SEEDMema"/&gt; AAIF was bankrupt.&lt;ref name="SEEDMema"/&gt;

==Funding==
AAIF was officially funded by [[Ganley International]],&lt;ref name="AT11320"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110531200846/http://austriantimes.at/index.php?id=11320 "Irish anti-EU party to set up in Austria for June elections"] Austrian Times, 19 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEE3982Albania"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SEE3982Albania"/&gt; with a 10%&lt;ref name="SEE3982Albania"/&gt; stake taken by the US-based Rothschild Emerging Markets Fund.&lt;ref name="SEE3982Albania"/&gt; ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' stated&lt;ref name="DS0,1518,580807,00"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,580807,00.html "Wie ein Milliardär Europa aufschrecktv"], Spiegel Online, 28 September 2008, English translation [https://translate.google.com/translate_c?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,580807,00.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; that AAIF's UK office (128 Mount Street, London, W1Y 5HA&lt;ref name="PSEPSAnglo-Adriatic%20Investment%20Fund"&gt;[http://www.private-equity.org.uk/profile.php?contact=Anglo-Adriatic%20Investment%20Fund "Company Profile - Anglo-Adriatic Investment Fund"], entry on [http://www.private-equity.org.uk/ PSEPS venture capital and private equity directory]&lt;/ref&gt;) shared an address with the European branch of US investment fund Paladin Capital, and also stated&lt;ref name="DS0,1518,580807,00"/&gt; that Paladin Capital's advisory board was chaired by former CIA director [[R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12141">[[File:Blow molding.png|thumb|400px|The blow molding process]]
'''Blow molding''' ([[BrE]] '''moulding''') is a specific manufacturing process by which hollow [[plastic]] parts are formed and can be joined together:  It is also used for forming [[glass bottle]]s or other hollow shapes.   In general, there are three main types of blow molding: extrusion blow molding, injection blow molding, and injection stretch blow molding.  The blow molding process begins with melting down the plastic and forming it into a [[wikt:parison|parison]] or, in the case of injection and injection stretch blow molding (ISB), a preform.  The parison is a tube-like piece of plastic with a hole in one end through which compressed air can pass.

The parison is then clamped into a [[molding (process)|mold]] and air is blown into it.  The air pressure then pushes the plastic out to match the mold.  Once the plastic has cooled and hardened the mold opens up and the part is ejected. The cost of blow molded parts is higher than that of injection-molded parts but lower than rotational molded parts.

==History==
The process principle comes from the idea of [[glassblowing]]. Enoch Ferngren and William Kopitke &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blow Molding|url=http://www.pmmanufacturing.co.za/index.php/our-products/blow-moulding|website=P.M. Manufacturing Co.|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blow Molding|url=http://sadhimachinery.com|website=Sadhi Machinery|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;produced a blow molding machine and sold it to Hartford Empire Company in 1938.  This was the beginning of the commercial blow molding process.  During the 1940s the variety and number of products was still very limited and therefore blow molding did not take off until later.  Once the variety and production rates went up the number of products created soon followed.

The technical mechanisms needed to produce hollow bodied workpieces using the blowing technique were established very early on. Because glass is very breakable, after the introduction of plastic, plastic was being used to replace glass in some cases. The first mass production of [[plastic bottle]]s was done in America in 1939. Germany started using this technology a little bit later, but is currently one of the leading manufacturers of blow molding machines.

In the United States [[soft drink industry]], the number of [[plastic container]]s went from zero in 1977 to ten billion pieces in 1999.  Today, even a greater number of products are blown and it is expected to keep increasing.

For [[amorphous metals]], also known as bulk metallic glasses, blow molding has been recently demonstrated under pressures and temperatures comparable to plastic blow molding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jan Schroers |author2=Thomas M. Hodges |author3=Golden Kumar |author4=Hari Raman |author5=Anthony J. Barnes |author6=Quoc Pham |author7=Theodore A.

== Typologies ==

=== Extrusion blow molding ===
[[File:Principe extrusion soufflage polymere.svg|thumb|300px|Extrusion blow molding]]

In ''' extrusion blow molding''' ('''EBM'''), plastic is melted and extruded into a hollow tube (a parison). This parison is then captured by closing it into a cooled metal mold. Air is then blown into the parison, inflating it into the shape of the hollow [[bottle]], container, or part. After the plastic has cooled sufficiently, the mold is opened and the part is ejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Small Scale Recycling of Plastics|author=John Vogler|page=6|publisher=Intermediate Technology Publication|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Continuous and Intermittent are two variations of Extrusion Blow Molding.  In continuous extrusion blow molding the parison is extruded continuously and the individual parts are cut off by a suitable knife.  In Intermittent blow molding there are two processes: straight intermittent is similar to injection molding whereby the screw turns, then stops and pushes the melt out. With the accumulator method, an accumulator gathers melted plastic and when the previous mold has cooled and enough plastic has accumulated, a rod pushes the melted plastic and forms the parison. In this case the screw may turn continuously or intermittently.&lt;ref&gt;Extrusion Blow Molding Technology, Hanser Gardner Publications, {{ISBN|1-56990-334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; With continuous extrusion the weight of the parison drags the parison and makes calibrating the wall thickness difficult. The accumulator head or reciprocating screw methods use hydraulic systems to push the parison out quickly reducing the effect of the weight and allowing precise control over the wall thickness by adjusting the die gap with a parison programming device.

'''EBM processes''' may be either continuous (constant extrusion of the parison) or intermittent. Types of EBM equipment may be categorized as follows:

'''''Continuous extrusion equipment'''''
* [[rotary wheel blow molding systems]]
* [[shuttle machinery]]

'''''Intermittent extrusion machinery'''''
* [[reciprocating screw machinery]]
* [[accumulator head machinery]]

Examples of parts made by the EBM process include most polyethylene hollow products, milk bottles, shampoo bottles,  automotive ducting, watering cans and hollow industrial parts such as drums.

Advantages of blow molding include: low tool and die cost; fast production rates; ability to mold complex part; Handles can be incorporated in the design.

Disadvantages of blow molding include: limited to hollow parts, low strength, to increase barrier properties multilayer parisons of different materials are used thus not recyclable. To make wide neck jars spin trimming is necessary.

=== Spin trimming ===

Containers such as jars often have an excess of material due to the molding process. This is trimmed off by spinning a knife around the container which cuts the material away. This excess plastic is then recycled to create new moldings.  Spin Trimmers are used on a number of materials, such as PVC, HDPE and PE+LDPE. Different types of the materials have their own physical characteristics affecting trimming. For example, moldings produced from amorphous materials are much more difficult to trim than crystalline materials. Titanium coated blades are often used rather than standard steel to increase life by a factor of 30 times.

=== Injection blow molding ===

The process of '''injection blow molding''' ('''IBM''') is used for the production of hollow [[glass]] and [[thermoplastic|plastic]] objects in large quantities. In the IBM process, the polymer is injection molded onto a core pin; then the core pin is rotated to a blow molding station to be inflated and cooled. This is the least-used of the three blow molding processes, and is typically used to make small medical and single serve bottles. The process is divided into three steps: injection, blowing and ejection.

The injection blow molding machine is based on an extruder barrel and screw assembly which melts the [[polymer]]. The molten polymer is fed into a hot runner manifold where it is injected through nozzles into a heated cavity and core pin. The cavity mold forms the external shape and is clamped around a core rod which forms the internal shape of the preform. The preform consists of a fully formed bottle/jar neck with a thick tube of polymer attached, which will form the body. similar in appearance to a test tube with a threaded neck.

The preform mold opens and the core rod is rotated and clamped into the hollow, chilled blow mold. The end of the core rod opens and allows compressed air into the preform, which inflates it to the finished article shape.

After a cooling period the blow mold opens and the core rod is rotated to the ejection position. The finished article is stripped off the core rod and as an option can be leak-tested prior to packing. The preform and blow mold can have many cavities, typically three to sixteen depending on the article size and the required output. There are three sets of core rods, which allow concurrent preform injection, blow molding and ejection.

Advantages: It produces an injection molded neck for accuracy.

Disadvantages: only suits small capacity bottles as it is difficult to control the base centre during blowing. No increase in barrier strength as the material is not biaxially stretched. Handles can't be incorporated.

=== Injection stretch blow molding process ===
{{anchor|Stretch blow molding}}
This has two main different methods, namely Single-stage and two-stage process. Single-stage process is again broken down into 3-station and 4-station machines.
In the two-stage injection stretch blow molding  process, the plastic is first molded into a "preform" using the injection molding process. These preforms are produced with the necks of the bottles, including threads (the "finish") on one end. These preforms are packaged, and fed later (after cooling) into a reheat stretch blow molding machine. In the ISB process, the preforms are heated (typically using infrared heaters) above their glass transition temperature, then blown using high-pressure air into bottles using metal blow molds. The preform is always stretched with a core rod as part of the process.

Advantages: Very high volumes are produced. Little restriction on bottle design. Preforms can be sold as a completed item for a third party to blow. Is suitable for cylindrical, rectangular or oval bottles.
Disadvantages: High capital cost. Floor space required is high, although compact systems have become available.
 
In the single-stage process both preform manufacture and bottle blowing are performed in the same machine. The older 4-station method of injection, reheat, stretch blow and ejection is more costly than the 3-station machine which eliminates the reheat stage and uses latent heat in the preform, thus saving costs of energy to reheat and 25% reduction in tooling. The process explained: Imagine the molecules are small round balls, when together they have large air gaps and small surface contact, by first stretching the molecules vertically then blowing to stretch horizontally the biaxial stretching makes the molecules a cross shape. These "crosses" fit together leaving little space as more surface area is contacted thus making the material less porous and increasing barrier strength against permeation. This process also increases the strength to be ideal for filling with carbonated drinks.

Advantages: Highly suitable for low volumes and short runs. As the preform is not released during the entire process the preform wall thickness can be shaped to allow even wall thickness when blowing rectangular and non-round shapes.

Disadvantages: Restrictions on bottle design. Only a [[Wine bottle#Punts|champagne base]] can be made for carbonated bottles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8545">The '''Brenner debate''' was a major debate amongst historians during the late 1970s and early 1980s, regarding the [[History of capitalism|origins of capitalism]].

It began with a 1976 journal article by [[Robert Brenner]].

Historians [[Trevor Aston]] and [[Charles Philpin|C. H. E. Philpin]] (1985) characterised the debate as 'one of the most important historical debates of recent years'.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Aston and C. H. E. Philpin, 'Preface', in ''The Brenner Debate: Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe'', ed. by Trevor Aston and C.H.E. Philpin, Past and Present Publications (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The debate has been seen as a successor to the so-called "[[transition debate]]" (or Dobb-Sweezy debate) that followed [[Maurice Dobb|Maurice Dobb's]] 1946 ''Studies in the Development of Capitalism'',&lt;ref&gt;Chris Harman, '[http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj102/harman.htm The Rise of Capitalism]', ''International Socialism Journal'', 102 (Spring 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Paul Sweezy]]'s 1950 article "The Transition From Feudalism To Capitalism"), in the journal ''[[Science &amp; Society]]''. (These articles were subsequently collected and published as a book, also entitled ''The Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism'', in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;''The Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism'', ed. by R. H. Hilton (London: Verso, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;
It began with Brenner's 1976 article "Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe", in the influential historical journal ''[[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past &amp; Present]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unc.edu/courses/2005fall/geog/160/001/GEC'05/brenner.pdf Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe]. ''[[Past and Present (journal)|Past &amp; Present]]'' 70 (1976), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–74&lt;/ref&gt;
== The debate==
Brenner's thesis was the focus of a symposium in around 1977, several contributions to which also appeared in the pages of ''Past &amp; Present''. Brenner's article and the discussions that followed it have a broad significance for understanding the origins of [[capitalism]], and were foundational to so-called "[[Political Marxism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Meikisins Wood, ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'', 2nd edn (London: Verso, 2002), esp. pp. 50–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, [[Michael Postan]] and [[John Hatcher (historian)|John Hatcher]] characterised the debate as attempting to determine whether [[Malthusian]] cyclic explanations of population and development or [[social class]] explanations governed demographic and economic change in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Postan, John Hatcher, "Population and Class relations in Feudal society" ''Past &amp; Present'' 78 (1) 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;  The debate challenged the prevalent views of regarding class relations in the [[economy of England in the Middle Ages]] in particular  – and agricultural societies with [[serfdom]] in general, as well as engaging the broader historiography of the economics of feudalism from the 20th century (in both the west and the Soviet Union).

Even though Brenner's key ideas have not achieved consensus,&lt;ref&gt;Shami Ghosh, 'Rural Economies and Transitions to Capitalism: Germany and England Compared (''c''.1200–''c''.1800)', ''The Journal of Agrarian Change'', 16.2 (April 2016), 255–90, DOI: 10.1111/joac.12096.&lt;/ref&gt; the debate has remained influential in 21st century scholarship,&lt;ref&gt;''Peasants into Farmers? The Transformation of Rural Economy and Society in the Low Countries (Middle Ages- 19th Century) in Light of the Brenner Debate'', ed. by Peter Hoppenbrouwers and Jan Luiten van Zanden, CORN Publication Series, 4 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2001), {{ISBN|250351006X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Meikisins Wood, ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'', 2nd ed. (London: Verso, 2002), esp. pp. 50–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Dimmock, ''The Origin of Capitalism in England, 1400–1600'' (Leiden: Brill, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
In the view of Shami Ghosh, Brenner's thesis proposed an explanatory framework for the evolution of what he called "agrarian capitalism", in England, during the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;blockquote&gt;[A] transformation of relationships between landlords and cultivators led to the creation of a largely free and competitive market in land and labour, while simultaneously dispossessing most of the peasants. Thus from the old class divisions of owners of land on the one hand, and an unfree peasantry with customary rights of use to land on the other, a new tripartite structure came into being, comprising landlords, free tenant farmers on relatively short-term market-determined leases and wage labourers; this Brenner defines as ‘agrarian capitalism’. Wage labourers were completely market-dependent – a rural proletariat – and tenant farmers had to compete on the land market in order to retain their access to land. This last fact was the principal motor of innovation leading to a rise in productivity, which, coupled with the growth of a now-free labour market, was essential for the development of modern (industrial) capitalism. Thus the transformations of agrarian class structures lay at the root of the development of capitalism in England.{{cn|date=June 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''[[Brighton and Hove]] City Centre''' is the commercial and cultural centre of the city of Brighton. Geographically, the so-called city centre is located in an easterly part of the Brighton and Hove urban conurbation.

== Culture ==
[[Image:Brighton Royal Pavilion.jpg|thumb|right|The Royal Pavilion]]
[[Image:Pavilion theatre brighton.jpg|thumb|left|The Pavilion Theatre]]
The North Laine area has a network of streets dubbed the 'Cultural Quarter', so called because of its concentration of theatres, galleries and small venues. This area covers New Road, the location of the [[Theatre Royal, Brighton|Theatre Royal]], and the [[Brighton Dome]] complex which includes the [[Pavilion Theatre (Brighton)|Pavilion Theatre]], Corn Exchange Theatre and the Dome Concert Hall. Next to this is [[Brighton Museum and Art Gallery]]. Bordering New Road and the Dome is Pavilion Gardens which is home to the [[Royal Pavilion, Brighton|Royal Pavilion]], former palace residence of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]. Opposite New Road is Jubilee Street, a modern redevelopment containing restaurant and cafe chains. It is also the location of the [[Jubilee Library, Brighton|Jubilee Library]], the city's central library.

On the seafront is the Fishing Museum and near [[Brighton railway station]] is the [[Brighton Toy and Model Museum]]. The Old Steine and St. Peter's area is a large patch of green in the city centre which is the location of a war memorial, the Frankish [[St Peter's Church, Brighton|St. Peter's Church]] and two art galleries: the [[Phoenix Gallery]] and the [[University of Brighton]] gallery.

== Shopping ==
[[Image:Crowds fringecity 5thmay07.png|right|thumb|Weekend shoppers flock to the city centre during the day.]]
Brighton is home to hundreds of shops and is renowned{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} for its wealth of independent shops. Most of the chain stores can be found on Western Road and [[Churchill Square (Brighton and Hove)|Churchill Square]]. The other major high streets are West Street, Queens Road, North Street, East Street, Duke Street and Ship Street.

[[The Lanes (Brighton)|The Lanes]] are the centre of Brighton's old town and consist of narrow streets and alleyways. The area is home to lots of jewellery and antique shops.

North of the Lanes is the [[North Laine]], both a residential and major commercial area, and the location of most of the city's independent shops. The commercial area of North Laine is centred on Trafalgar Street, Sydney Street, Gloucester Road, Kensington Gardens, North Road, Gardner Street, Church Street and Bond Street. The area is also home to small art galleries and [[Komedia]], a theatre, bar, comedy venue and cinema. The area is also home to Jubilee Square, home of Jubilee library and a number of restaurants.

A little more east of the main high streets is [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]], home to many gay shops and other businesses. Its main shopping thoroughfare is St. James' Street, which has many cafés and restaurants, such as The Saint restaurant and Redroaster Coffee House.

== Amusements ==
[[Image:Uk BrightonPierSunset.jpg|thumb|left|Brighton Pier at sunset]]
[[Brighton Pier]] (or, the Palace Pier) is home to many rides and other amusements such as fortune tellers and prize winning games. Near the pier is Brighton Sea Life centre, an aquarium. Near the aquarium is [[Volks Electric Railway]], a historic electric railway, providing transportation to [[Brighton Marina]]. West Street is the city's centre for nightlife as home to a number of night clubs and late-night bars.

== Transport ==
{{main|Transport in Brighton and Hove}}
[[Image:Virgin Train at Brighton.jpg|thumb|left|Brighton railway station]]
[[Image:Brighton to Shoreham along the coast 011.jpg|thumb|right|Brighton and Hove Buses run regularly throughout the city centre]]
The city centre is well served by public transport. Brighton and Hove Buses run regularly throughout the area with stops and stations at Churchill Square, Brighton Station, the [[Clock Tower, Brighton|Clock Tower]], North Street and the Old Steine. Buses serve as the main mode of public transport in Brighton and Hove connecting all suburbs and outer areas to the city centre.

There are major taxi ranks located in Brighton Station and East Street.

Near the Old Steine is Pool Valley Coach Station which is used for intercity travel.

Brighton Railway station serves as the city's main rail terminus and has good links to [[London]], [[Gatwick Airport]] and the south coast. [[Hove railway station]] serves the centre of Hove and can be reached from Brighton in less than five minutes. [[London Road (Brighton) railway station|London Road Station]] is near Preston Circus. The rail network in Brighton and Hove is not as extensive as the bus network, however certain suburbs and university campus are well connected to the centre of Brighton and Hove by rail.

== Accommodation ==
[[Image:Grand Hotel - Brighton - 02082004.jpg|thumb|right|The Grand Hotel, Brighton]]

There are numerous hotels in the city centre, some of the more notable ones include [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|The Grand Hotel]], the Hilton Metropole Hotel, the [[Royal Albion Hotel]] and the Ramada Hotel.

{{Corporate finance}}
A '''business plan''' is a formal written document containing business goals, the methods on how these goals can be attained, and the time frame that these goals need to be achieved. It also describes the nature of the business, includes background information on the organization, the organization's financial projections, and the strategies it intends to implement to achieve stated targets. In its entirety, this document serves as a road map that provides direction to the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/business-plan|title=Business Plan Definition - Entrepreneur Small Business Encyclopedia|website=Entrepreneur|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written business plans are often required to obtain a bank loan or other kind of financing.

==Audience==

Business plans may be internally or externally focused.  Externally-focused plans draft goals that are important to outside stakeholders, particularly financial stakeholders.  These plans typically have detailed information about the organization or the team making effort to reach its goals.  With for-profit entities, external stakeholders include investors and customers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/planning/sbabusplan.html Small Business Notes] business plan outline for small    business start-up&lt;/ref&gt;  for non-profits, external stakeholders refer to donors and clients,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131105152438/http://ase.tufts.edu/yet/pdf/Non-Profit%20Incorporating%20%20The%20Business%20Plan.pdf Tufts University] non-profit business plan&lt;/ref&gt;  for government agencies, external stakeholders are the tax-payers, higher-level government agencies, and international lending bodies such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], various economic agencies of the [[United Nations]], and [[Multilateral development bank|development banks]].

Internally-focused business plans target intermediate goals required to reach the external goals.   They may cover the development of a new product, a new service, a new IT system, a restructuring of finance, the refurbishing of a factory or a restructuring of the organization.  An internally-focused business plan is often developed in conjunction with a [[balanced scorecard]] or a list of critical success factors.  This allows success of the plan to be measured using non-financial measures.  

Business plans that identify and target internal goals, but provide only general guidance on how they will be met are called [[Strategic planning|strategic plans]].

Operational plans describe the goals of an internal organization, working group or department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://doa.louisiana.gov/opb/faf/OPFormatWord_FY01MWLayout.pdf State of Louisiana, USA]  government agency operational plan&lt;/ref&gt; Project plans, sometimes known as project frameworks, describe the goals of a particular project.  They may also address the project's place within the organization's larger strategic goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egovernment.tas.gov.au/themes/project_management/project_management/knowledge_base Tasmanian government project management knowledge base] government project plan {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622211235/http://www.egovernment.tas.gov.au/themes/project_management/project_management/knowledge_base |date=June 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

Business plans are [[decision-making tools]].  The content and format of the business plan is determined by the goals and audience. For example, a business plan for a non-profit might discuss the fit between the business plan and the organization's mission.  Banks are quite concerned about defaults, so a business plan for a bank loan will build a convincing case for the organization's ability to repay the loan.  [[Venture capitalists]] are primarily concerned about initial investment, feasibility, and exit valuation.  A business plan for a project requiring equity financing will need to explain why current resources, upcoming growth opportunities, and [[sustainable competitive advantage]] will lead to a high exit valuation.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Preparing a business plan draws on a wide range of knowledge from many different business disciplines: [[finance]], human resource management, [[intellectual property]] management, [[supply chain management]], operations management, and [[marketing]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/schools/csom/mba/academics/bplan.html Boston College, Carroll School of Management, Business Plan Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116051622/http://www.bc.edu/schools/csom/mba/academics/bplan.html |date=2008-01-16 }} The business school advises students that "To create a robust business plan, teams must take a comprehensive view of the enterprise and incorporate management-practice knowledge from every first-semester course." It is increasingly common for business schools to use business plan projects to provide an opportunity for students to integrate knowledge learned through their courses.&lt;/ref&gt;   It can be helpful to view the business plan as a collection of sub-plans, one for each of the main business disciplines.&lt;ref name="Eric S. Siegel 1993"&gt;Eric S. Siegel, Brian R. Ford, Jay M. Bornstein (1993), ''''The Ernst &amp; Young Business Plan Guide'''' (New York: John Wiley and Sons) {{ISBN|0-471-57826-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"... a good business plan can help to make a good business credible, understandable, and attractive to someone who is unfamiliar with the business. Writing a good business plan can’t guarantee success, but it can go a long way toward reducing the odds of failure." &lt;ref name="Eric S. Siegel 1993" /&gt;

== Presentation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
The format of a business plan depends on its presentation context. It is common for businesses, especially start-ups, to have three or four formats for the same business plan.

An "[[elevator pitch]]" is a short summary of the plan's executive summary. This is often used as a teaser to awaken the interest of potential investors, customers, or strategic partners. It is called an elevator pitch as it is supposed to be content that can be explained to someone else quickly in an elevator. The elevator pitch should be between 30 and 60 seconds.&lt;ref name="inc magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/05/mastering-business-elevator-pitch.html|title=How to Master Your Elevator Pitch|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Sales presentation|pitch deck]] is a slide show and oral presentation that is meant to trigger discussion and interest potential investors in reading the written presentation.  The content of the presentation is usually limited to the executive summary and a few key graphs showing financial trends and key decision making benchmarks. If a new product is being proposed and time permits, a demonstration of the product may be included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/07/pitchdeck/|title=How To Create An Early-Stage Pitch Deck For Investors|first=|last=Contributor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A written presentation for external stakeholders is a detailed, well written, and pleasingly formatted plan targeted at external stakeholders.

An internal operational plan is a detailed plan describing planning details that are needed by management but may not be of interest to external stakeholders.  Such plans have a somewhat higher degree of candor and informality than the version targeted at external stakeholders and others.

== Revising the business plan ==

=== Cost overruns and revenue shortfalls ===

Cost and [[revenue]] estimates are central to any business plan for deciding the viability of the planned venture. But costs are often underestimated and revenues overestimated resulting in later cost overruns, revenue shortfalls, and possibly non-viability. During the [[dot-com bubble]] 1997-2001 this was a problem for many technology start-ups. [[Reference class forecasting]] has been developed to reduce the risks of cost overruns and revenue shortfalls and thus generate more accurate business plans.

==Legal and liability issues==

=== Disclosure requirements ===
An externally targeted business plan should list all legal concerns and financial liabilities that might negatively affect investors.  Depending on the amount of funds being raised and the audience to whom the plan is presented, failure to do this may have severe legal consequences.

=== Limitations on content and audience ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
[[Non disclosure agreement]]s (NDAs) with third parties, [[non-compete agreement]]s, conflicts of interest, privacy concerns, and the protection of one's [[trade secrets]] may severely limit the audience to which one might show the business plan.  Alternatively, they may require each party receiving the business plan to sign a contract accepting special clauses and conditions.

This situation is complicated by the fact that many venture capitalists will refuse to sign an NDA before looking at a business plan, lest it put them in the untenable position of looking at two independently developed look-alike business plans, both claiming originality.  In such situations one may need to develop two versions of the business plan: a stripped down plan that can be used to develop a relationship and a detail plan that is only shown when investors have sufficient interest and trust to sign an NDA.

==Open business plans==
Traditionally business plans have been highly confidential and quite limited in audience.
The business plan itself is generally regarded as secret.

An open business plan is a business plan with unlimited audience. The business plan is typically
web published and made available to all.

In the free software and open source business model, trade secrets, [[copyright]] and patents can no longer
be used as effective locking mechanisms to provide sustainable advantages to a particular business and therefore a secret business plan is less relevant in those models.

== Uses ==
*[[Education]]
**Business plans are used in some primary and secondary programs to teach economic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Economic Spa|url=http://www.economicspa.org/products.asp?cat=15&amp;hierarchy=02|title= Pennsylvania Business Plan Competition}} competition intended to teach economic principles to K-12 students&lt;/ref&gt;  
:*[[Wikiversity]] has a [[v:Lunar Boom Town|Lunar Boom Town]] project where students of all ages can collaborate with designing and revising business models and practice evaluating them to learn practical business planning techniques and methodology

*Fundraising
Fundraising is the primary purpose for many business plans, since they are related to the inherent probable success/failure of the company risk.
:*[[Angel investor]]s
:*[[Business loan]]s
:*[[Grant (money)|Grants]]
:*[[Startup company]] funding
:*[[Venture capital]]

*Internal use
:*[[Management by objectives]] (MBO) is a process of agreeing upon objectives (as can be detailed within business plans) within an organization so that management and employees agree to the objectives and understand what they are in the organization.
:*[[Strategic planning]] is an organization's process of defining its strategy, or direction, and making decisions on allocating its resources to pursue this strategy, including its capital and people. Business plans can help decision makers see how specific projects relate to the organization's strategic plan.
:*[[Total quality management]] (TQM) is a business management strategy aimed at embedding awareness of quality in all organizational processes. TQM has been widely used in manufacturing, education, call centers, government, and service industries, as well as NASA space and science programs.

==Not for profit businesses==
The business goals may be defined both for [[non-profit]]  or for-profit organizations.  For-profit business plans typically focus on financial goals, such as profit or creation of wealth.  Non-profit, as well as government agency business plans tend to focus on the "organizational mission" which is the basis for their governmental status or their non-profit, tax-exempt status, respectively—although non-profits may also focus on optimizing revenue.

The primary difference between profit and non-profit organizations is that "for-profit" organizations look to maximize wealth versus non-profit organizations, which look to provide a greater good to society. In non-profit organizations, creative tensions may develop in the effort to balance mission with "margin" (or revenue).

==Satires==
The business plan is the subject of many satires.  Satires are used both to express cynicism about business plans and as an educational tool to improve the quality of business plans.  For example,
* In his presentation, ''Five Criteria For a Successful Business Plan in Biotech'', Dr. Roger Bernier, uses ''[[Dilbert]]'' comic strips to remind people what ''not'' to do when researching and writing a business plan for a biotech start-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.mta.ca/rendezvousbiosciences/day3panel-ppt/Roger%20Bernier.ppt |title=Five Criteria For a Successful Business Plan in Biotech |author=Bernier, Roger Laurent |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106201111/http://www.mta.ca/rendezvousbiosciences/day3panel-ppt/Roger%20Bernier.ppt |archivedate=January 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
* Selena Maranjian's "Fool on the Hill" article in ''[[The Motley Fool]]'', "'South Park's' Investing Lesson" (November 8, 2001), references the "Underpants Gnomes" to illustrate the fallacy of focusing on goals without a clear implementation strategy. That "[[Gnomes (South Park)|Gnomes]]" episode satirizes the business plans of the [[Dot.com bubble|Dot-com era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='South Park's' Investing Lesson|author=Maranjian, Selena|date=November 8, 2001|work=The Motley Fool|url=http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth011108.htm|access-date=2007-10-16|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66ArVrcEB?url=http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth011108.htm#|archive-date=2012-03-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chapter 26 of [[Neal Stephenson]]'s 1999 novel [[Cryptonomicon]] begins with the business plan of a fictional high tech company, satirizing both the writing style and the physical form of slickly produced business publications like business plans and [[annual report]]s.

'''Carl Ulf Sture Lundström''' (born 13 April 1960 in [[Filipstad]], [[Sweden]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[businessman]].

Carl Lundström is the son of Ulf Lundström and the grandson of Karl Edvard Lundström, founder of the world's largest [[crisp bread]] producer [[Wasabröd]]. When his father Ulf Lundström died in 1973, Carl Lundström was one of five heirs to Wasabröd. In 1982 Wasabröd was sold to the Swiss [[pharmaceutical company]] [[Sandoz]]. Lundström has founded and financed a number of companies, notably [[Swedish telecom]], internet and co-location provider [[Rix Telecom]].

==Political affiliations==
Lundström has been involved with various [[far-right]] political organisations in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/26/pirate_bay_neo_nazi/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Lundström financed the Swedish [[Progress Party (Sweden)|Progress Party]], which later merged with the party [[Sverigedemokraterna|Sweden Democrats]].

In 2001, the Swedish [[National Democrats (Sweden)|National Democrats]] party publicized having received a donation of SEK 5000 from Lundström.

In 2005, Lundström took part in an oppositional group within the [[Swedish Taxpayers' Association]], protesting the association's passive stance on the issue of costs for immigration.

==The Pirate Bay trial==
{{main|The Pirate Bay trial}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3357">[[Council Regulation]] (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987, creates the goods nomenclature called the '''Combined Nomenclature''', or in abbreviated form 'CN', established to meet, at one and the same time, the requirements both of the [[Common Customs Tariff]] and of the external trade statistics of the [[European Union]]. 

The codes and the descriptions of goods established on the basis of the combined nomenclature shall replace those established on the basis of the nomenclatures of the Common Customs Tariff and the Nimexe.

It is established on the basis of the [[Harmonized System]]. The combined nomenclature shall comprise : (a) the harmonized system nomenclature; (b) Community subdivisions to that nomenclature, referred to as 'CN subheadings' in those cases where a corresponding rate of duty is specified; (c) preliminary provisions, additional section or chapter notes and footnotes relating to CN subheadings. 

Each CN subheading shall have an eight digit code number : (a) the first six digits shall be the code numbers relating to the headings and subheadings of the harmonized system nomenclature; (b) the seventh and eighth digits shall identify the CN subheadings

The Commission established an integrated tariff, of the European Communities, referred to as the '[[TARIC code]]', based on the combined nomenclature. 

The combined nomenclature, together with the rates of duty and other relevant charges, and the tariff measures included in the Taric or in other Community arrangements shall constitute the common customs tariff referred to in Article 9 of the Treaty, which shall be applied on the importation of goods into the Community

Member States may insert subdivisions after the CN subheadings for national statistical purposes, and after the Taric subheadings for other national purposes.

The Commission shall be assisted by a Committee on Tariff and Statistical Nomenclature, called the 'Nomenclature Committee'.

'Favourable tariff arrangement' means any reduction or suspension, even under a tariff quota, of a customs duty or charge having equivalent effect or of an agricultural levy or other import charge provided for under the common agricultural policy or under the specific  arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting form the processing of agricultural products. 

Commission shall adopt each year by means of a [[Regulation]] a complete version of the combined nomenclature together with the corresponding autonomous and conventional rates of duty of the [[Common Customs Tariff]], as it results from measures adopted by the Council or by the Commission. said Regulation shall be published not later than 31 October in the Official Journal of the European Communities and it shall apply from 1 January of the following year.

'''David Milwyn Duggan''' (May 5, 1879 – May 4, 1942) was a Welsh-born Canadian politician who was the [[Mayor of Edmonton]] from 1920 to 1923, a member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], and a leader of the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative Party of Alberta]].

==Early life==

David Duggan was born in [[Builth]], [[Wales]] May 5, 1879.  In 1893 he entered the dry goods business, in which he would remain until leaving Wales.  In 1902 he married Marian Price; the pair would have four children.

Duggan immigrated to Canada in 1905 to farm near [[Nanton, Alberta]].  He moved to Edmonton in 1912 and founded Duggan Investments, Ltd., a firm handling bonds and investments.

==Municipal politics==

Duggan ran for mayor in the [[Edmonton municipal election, 1920|1920 Edmonton election]] when, despite lacking any previous experience, he defeated incumbent [[Joseph Clarke (Canadian politician)|Joseph Clarke]].  Clarke had become unpopular with the city's Board of Trade and both of its newspapers owing to what they perceived as anti-business policies, and these groups supported Duggan aggressively.  While Duggan was mayor, Alberta's first radio station, [[CJCA]], began operations, and Duggan himself concluded its inaugural broadcast by boasting "Edmonton leads the way in all Alberta. Calgary and others follow. That is all. Goodnight."  He was re-elected in [[Edmonton municipal election, 1921|1921]] and [[Edmonton municipal election, 1922|1922]], but did not seek re-election after his last term expired.

==Provincial politics==

His attentions turned to provincial politics, and he was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] in the [[Alberta general election, 1926|1926 election]] as a [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] in the riding of [[Edmonton (provincial electoral district)|Edmonton]].  Duggan succeeded [[Alexander McGillivray (Alberta politician)|Alexander McGillivray]] as leader in 1930, and led the party into [[Alberta general election, 1930|that year's election]].  In this election, the Conservatives picked up a seat in Edmonton (taking three of the city's six seats), but were shut out of seats outside of Edmonton and [[Calgary (provincial electoral district)|Calgary]], as they had been in 1926.  Moreover, they lost ground to the rival [[Alberta Liberal Party]] in the race to form the official opposition to the governing [[United Farmers of Alberta]].  Duggan easily retained his own seat.

The situation worsened for the Conservatives in the [[Alberta general election, 1935|1935 election]], when the [[Social Credit Party of Alberta]] swept the province, reducing the Conservatives to two members, Duggan and Calgary [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]] [[John Irwin (politician)|John Irwin]] (the other parties fared no better - the Liberals lost six of the eleven seats they had won in 1930, while the UFA, owners of a majority government before the writ was dropped, were eliminated from the legislature completely).  In response to this catastrophe, Duggan's Conservatives formed an alliance with the Liberals, the Unity League, whereby candidates of the parties would not run against each other, these were identified as Independents on election results as the Unity League did not have official party status.  In the [[Alberta general election, 1940|1940 election]], there were nineteen independents elected, including Duggan.

During his last full term in the legislature, Duggan was involved in the [[Bankers' Toadies incident]].  He brought to the house's attention a government-sponsored leaflet that named him and eight other men ([[William Antrobus Griesbach]] among them) as "Banker's Toadies" and urged readers to "exterminate them".  This incident saw two men, including Social Credit MLA [[Joseph Unwin]], prosecuted for criminal [[libel]] and counselling murder.

==Personal life, death, and legacy==

Duggan was active with the [[Baptist]] Church, the [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]], the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce, and the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]].  He died May 4, 1942 while still an MLA. He was buried in Mt. Pleasant Cemetery in Edmonton.

In 2004, [[Edmonton City Council]] passed a motion directing its Names Advisory Committee to strike a subcommittee whose purpose would be, among other things, to honour Duggan by naming a city feature after him.

'''Edinburgh Park''' is a [[business park]] in [[South Gyle]],  [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].  It is west of the city, near [[Edinburgh Airport]] and the [[Edinburgh City Bypass]]. It was opened in 1995.  The layout of the park was masterplanned by [[United States|American]] architect [[Richard Meier]].  [[Edinburgh Park railway station]], which is on the [[Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk Line]], opened in December 2003.

[[Edinburgh Trams]] began serving the park on 31 May 2014 with stops at Edinburgh Park Station, Edinburgh Park Central and The Gyle.

It is not to be confused with [[South Gyle|Gyle Park]] nearby, site of the former [[Gogarloch]].

The park has a bar/grill, nursery, and several sculptures, including busts of famous Scottish poets, many of them [[Socialism|socialists]].&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|title=Literary Corstorphine: A reader's guide to West Edinburgh|date=2017|last=Bell|first=Raymond MacKean|location=Edinburgh|publisher=Leamington Books|isbn=9780244644406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'' "Monkey model" redirects here. For animal testing in medical research, see [[Animal model]].''

'''Export variants of Soviet military equipment''' were versions of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military equipment (armored vehicles, airplanes, missiles) of significantly inferior capability to the original designs and intended only for export.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htproc/20080220.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  '''''Monkey model''''' was the unofficial designation given by the [[Soviet Military]] to such variants.  The monkey model was exported with the same or a similar designation as the original Soviet design but in fact it lacked many of the advanced or expensive features of the original.

Monkey-model weaponry was used mainly by non-[[communism|communist]] Soviet allies, such as [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]].  [[Eastern Bloc]] states generally used fully capable versions of Soviet weaponry, although poorer states often used earlier generations of weapons.

The term ''monkey model'' was popularized in the West by [[Viktor Suvorov]], in ''[[Inside the Soviet Army]]''.  Suvorov states that the simplified monkey model was designed for massive production in wartime, to replace front-line stocks if a war should last for several weeks. In peacetime, Soviet industry gained experience building both standard and export-model variants, the latter being for sale "to the 'brothers' and 'friends' of the USSR as the very latest equipment available."  He also cites the benefit of [[disinformation]] when an exported monkey model fell into the hands of Western intelligence, who "naturally gained a completely false impression of the true combat capabilities of the BMP-1  and of Soviet  tanks" .{{sfn|Suvorov|1982|pp=215}}

==Armored vehicles==

Monkey-model tanks were equipped with downgraded fire control systems, downgraded armor, no NBC system, and provided with substandard ammunition. (Their ballistic computers, range finders, and night vision were inferior to those found on production models)

For instance, the 3BM17 APFSDS [[125 mm smoothbore ammunition]] were designed specifically for export, and had a penetration of sloped armor at 2000 m that was inferior to the original Soviet model, the 3BM15. By the time of the [[Gulf War]], both rounds were obsolescent and relegated solely to training purposes (not actual combat). For 3rd world client states, however, they were the most advanced 125mm KE rounds available.

==Aircraft==

Monkey-model aircraft were downgraded in a manner similar to that of tanks. The [[MiG-23]] MS 'Flogger-E', for example, was an export variant the original MiG 23 developed because the MiG 23 was considered too advanced to be exported to Third World countries. The 'Flogger-E' lacked the most advanced features of the original. [[Infra-red search and track]] and [[beyond visual range missile]] capabilities were removed and its [[avionics]] suite was very basic. This variant was widely sold during the 1970s to Soviet allies in the [[Middle East]].

==Effectiveness of monkey models==
The fact that most Soviet-designed tanks and aircraft engaged by western forces during the last decades were actually monkey models must be kept in mind when trying to assess the capabilities of real Soviet-era equipment versus those of contemporary western designs. A good example of this is the dismal performance of Iraqi T-72 models during the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.

In each conflict, Iraqi T-72s failed to destroy a single M1 abrams tank, even after scoring direct hits. On the other hand, a publication from the early 80s claims that the 125&amp;nbsp;mm 2A46 gun "will penetrate the armor of any current or future NATO tank at ranges greater than 2,000 meters." &lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Armed Forces Journal International|date=1980|volume=118|publisher=Army and Navy Journal, Incorporated|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Dj9VAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, Robert H. Scales insisted that the 125mm gun "could penetrate the Abrams (frontal armor) at 1,000 meters," provided it was using modern ammunition. {{sfn|Scales|1994|pp=116}} The performance discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the Iraqi's used substandard ammunition for their guns, while operating a mix of monkey models and their own locally produced variant, the [[Lion of Babylon (tank)|Lion of Babylon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3216">'''Float-zone silicon''' is very pure [[silicon]] obtained by vertical [[zone melting]]. The process was developed at [[Bell Labs]] by Henry Theuerer in 1955 as a modification of a method developed by [[William Gardner Pfann]] for [[germanium]]. In the vertical configuration molten silicon has sufficient [[surface tension]] to keep the charge from separating. Avoidance of the necessity of a containment vessel prevents contamination of the silicon.

[[File:Si-crystal floatingzone.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Silicon crystal in the beginning of the growth process]]
[[File:Si-crystal floatingzone growing.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Growing silicon crystal]]

Float-zone silicon is a high-purity alternative to crystals grown by the [[Czochralski process]]. The concentrations of light impurities, such as [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]], are extremely low. Another light impurity, [[nitrogen]], helps to control microdefects and also brings about an improvement in mechanical strength of the [[wafer]]s, and is now being intentionally added during the growth stages.

The diameters of float-zone wafers are generally not greater than 200mm due to the [[surface tension]] limitations during growth. A polycrystalline rod of ultra-pure electronic grade silicon is passed through an RF heating coil, which creates a localized molten zone from which the crystal ingot grows. A [[seed crystal]] is used at one end in order to start the growth. The whole process is carried out in an evacuated chamber or in an inert gas purge. The molten zone carries the impurities away with it and hence reduces impurity concentration (most impurities are more soluble in the melt than the crystal). Specialized doping techniques like core doping, pill doping, gas doping and neutron transmutation doping are used to incorporate a uniform concentration of impurity.

==Application==
Float-zone silicon is typically used for [[power semiconductor device|power devices]] and [[photodetector|detector]] applications. It is highly transparent to [[terahertz radiation]], and is usually used to fabricate optical components, such as lenses and windows, for terahertz applications. It is also used in [[solar arrays]] of [[satellites]] as it has higher conversion efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iflscience.com/technology/new-solar-innovation-cuts-costs-by-60-while-increasing-efficiency-by-24/ |title=New Solar Innovation Cuts Costs By 60% While Increasing Efficiency By 24% |accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.altenergymag.com/article/2015/08/float-zone-silicon-solar-panels--60-less-expensive-and-25-more-efficient/21139 |title=Float Zone Silicon Solar Panels - 60% less expensive and 25% more efficient |accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fort Howard Paper Company''' was an American [[Pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper]] company based in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. Its products were sold under a variety of brand names, including ''Envision'', ''Fort Howard'', ''Mardi Gras'', and ''Soft'n Gentle''.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

The company merged with [[James River Corporation]] in 1997 to form the [[Fort James Corporation]]; it became part of [[Georgia-Pacific]] in 2000.

==History==
[[File:BALES BY THE THOUSANDS FORM PAPER BULWARK OUTSIDE THE FORT HOWARD PAPER COMPANY ON THE SHORES OF GREEN BAY - NARA - 550883.tif|thumb|Paper bales outside the Green Bay mill]]
[[Austin E. Cofrin]] founded the Fort Howard Paper Company in 1919. It was named after [[Fort Howard (Wisconsin)|Fort Howard]], a [[19th century]] [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[fortification]] located along the west bank of the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]] in Green Bay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forttours.com/pages/fortedwardaugustus.asp Fort Edward August]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gp.com/Company/Company-Overview/Locations/Green-Bay.aspx#tab-0 |title=Green Bay operations |access-date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the company began experimenting with recycled paper production.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

In 1960, Austin E. Cofrin stepped down as CEO, and handed control of the company to his son, John P. Cofrin.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;

In 1971, the company was taken public, and common stock was offered.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

In 1976, the company began construction on its second facility in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt; 

In 1980, the company acquired [[The Harmon Group]] of [[New York City]]. They also expanded internationally by acquiring [[The Sterling Group]] of [[Manchester, England]].&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

In 1983, they purchased the [[Maryland Cup Corporation]], the largest manufacturer of paper and plastic food products.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;

In 1988, the company was taken private, and in 1989 they sold their cup operations, because it was not cost effective.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

In 1997, the company merged with another Green Bay paper company, the James River Corporation. The new company became the Fort James Corporation.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp/&gt; Three years later, the Fort James Corporation was acquired by [[Georgia-Pacific]].&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

==Awards==
In 1990, the Fort Howard Paper Company was recognized with the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] Administrator’s Award for Recycling Leadership.&lt;ref name=uwgb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwgb.edu/archives/files/pdf/Containerlist-Jeans.pdf |title=Fort Howard Company Records |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Green Bay |access-date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, they received the National Recycling Coalition Award for Recycling Innovation as well as the American Paper Institute’s Environmental and Energy Achievement Award.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

==Legacy==
The historical records of the Fort Howard Paper Company are housed at the Area Research Center at the [[University of Wisconsin-Green Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.uwgb.edu/featured/giving-back/10/26/major-gift-fort-howard/ |title=Photos: Major gift evokes Fort Howard Paper history |author=Christopher Sampson |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Green Bay |date=October 26, 2009 |access-date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Game Tycoon''''' is a [[business simulation game]] focused on production of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/932120.asp|title=Game Tycoon - PC|publisher=gamerankings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been largely ridiculed, especially for some parts not translated from German to English.
&lt;!--
*Reception
[[X-Play]] gave the game a 1 out of 5, mentioning that parts of the game are still not translated from the original German. They also said that it was barely a game.--&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Game play is centered on the full production of video-game making; from production of an engine, concept design, physical design, packaging, licensing deals, market campaigns, and reviews.

The game starts off in 1982 with somewhat limited availability of features. Eventually, more options are made for engines and packaging, etc.

'''''Hospital Hustle''''' (formerly titled ''Sarah's Emergency Room'') is a video game developed and published by GameInvest. The player controls Sarah, a recent graduate nurse. Sarah’s first job is to manage the waiting room of a small town hospital. The faster and better she directs the patients to the correct doctor the more experience she gets and the happier the patients become. Sarah keeps moving up to bigger and busier hospitals as the player progresses in the game.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1217">'''Intelligent device management''' is a technology used for [[enterprise software]] applications that allow equipment manufacturers to monitor and manage remote equipment, systems and products via the [[Internet]].  Another term for intelligent device management is '''remote device management''' (RDM) while '''strategic service management''' describes the service.

IDM extends IT service management to on-site devices and can support standard service processes, such as  [[Incident Management (ITSM)|Incident]], [[ITIL#Problem_management|Problem]], [[Change Management (ITSM)|Change]], [[Configuration Management (ITSM)|Configuration Management]] as defined by [[ITIL]].

This technology is commonly used by ATM, security and [[self-service kiosk]] companies.

Now 80, he is the former deputy prime minister of Lebanon, as well as a multibillionaire entrepreneur.

In 1954, at the age of seventeen, Fares left his homeland and found a job as a clerk at a catering and food services firm in Qatar. Two years later, he was heading Abela Group’s finances and subsequently managing its operations in Pakistan, Kuwait, Iran and Saudi Arabia.

At age 38, Fares went into business for himself and established a civil engineering and construction firm, which completed many notable projects including the world's longest international bridge, which connects [[Bahrain]] to [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/rich-list-issam-fares-88756.html "Rich List-Issam Fares"], ''Arabian Business - Rich List'', 10 December 2008. Accessed 22 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then sold the company to [[British Aerospace]], and used the proceeds to buy up Houston-based investment firm, Wedge Group, a company that he heads today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arabian Business Rich List 2010|url = http://www.arabianbusiness.com/arabian-business-rich-list-2010-367763.html?view=profile&amp;itemid=367875#.Vlf6nVXhDnA|website = Arabian Business|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3401">'''Issued shares''' is a term of [[law]] and [[finance]] for the number of [[shares]] of a [[corporation]] which have been allocated (allotted) and are subsequently held by [[shareholders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912476587|title=United states investment and business guide : strategic and practical information.|last=Usa.|first=Int'L Business Publications,|date=2015|publisher=Intl Business Pubns Usa|year=|isbn=1329182405|location=[Place of publication not identified]|pages=155|oclc=912476587}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Issued+Shares|title=Issued shares|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of creating new issued shares is called ''issuance'', ''allocation'' or ''allotment''. Allotment is simply the creation of shares and their transfer to a subscriber. After allotment, a subscriber becomes a shareholder, though usually that also requires formal entry in the [[share registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497076|title=Schaum's outline of theory and problems of financial accounting|last=K.|first=Shim, Jae|date=1999|publisher=McGraw-Hill|others=Siegel, Joel G.|year=|isbn=0071341668|edition= 2nd|location=New York|pages=233|oclc=41497076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The number of shares that can be issued is limited to the total [[shares authorized|authorized shares]]. Issued shares are those shares which the [[board of directors]] and/or shareholders have agreed to allocate. Issued shares are the sum of [[outstanding shares]] held by shareholders; and [[treasury shares]] are shares which had been issued but have been repurchased by the corporation, and which generally have no voting rights or rights to dividends.

The issued shares of a corporation form the [[Equity (finance)|equity capital]] of the corporation, and some corporations are required by law to have a minimum value of equity capital, while others may not need any or just a nominal number. The value of the issued shares are determined at the time they are issued and the value does not change, in relation to the issuing corporation after that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/equity%20capital|title=Definition of EQUITY CAPITAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shares are most commonly issued fully paid, in which case the liability of the shareholders is limited to the amount paid on the shares; but they may also be issued [[partly paid]], with unlimited liability, subject to guarantee, or some other form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beleggen.info/aandelen/|title=Beleggen in aandelen|last=Lisam|first=Heinrickh|date=|website=beleggen.info|language=nl-nl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic formulae===

:&lt;math&gt;Shares\ authorized = Shares\ issued + Shares\ unissued&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Shares\ issued = Shares\ outstanding + Treasury\ shares&lt;/math&gt;

'''Management by objectives''' ('''MBO'''), also known as '''management by results''' ('''MBR'''), was first popularized by [[Peter Drucker]] in his 1954 book ''The Practice of Management''.&lt;ref name=Practice&gt;Drucker, P., ''The Practice of Management'', Harper, New York, 1954; Heinemann, London, 1955; revised edn, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Management by objectives is the process of defining specific objectives within an organization that [[manager (disambiguation)|management]] can convey to organization members, then deciding on how to achieve each objective in sequence. This process allows managers to take work that needs to be done one step at a time to allow for a calm, yet productive work environment. This process also helps organization members to see their accomplishments as they achieve each objective, which reinforces a positive work environment and a sense of achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Management by objectives and corporate social responsibility disclosure: First results from Italy|first1=Chiara|last1=Mio|first2=Andrea|last2=Venturelli|first3=Rossella|last3=Leopizzi|date=4 March 2015|journal=Acc Auditing Accountability J|volume=28|issue=3|pages=325–364|doi=10.1108/AAAJ-09-2013-1480}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important part of MBO is the measurement and comparison of an [[employee]]'s actual [[Performance management|performance]] with the standards set. Ideally, when employees themselves have been involved with the [[goal-setting]] and choosing the course of action to be followed by them, they are more likely to fulfill their responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://home.snu.edu/~jsmith/library/body/v20.pdf |title=MANAGEMENT BY OBJECTIVES  |last=Thomson |first=Thomas M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[George S. Odiorne]]{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}, the system of management by objectives can be described as a process whereby the superior and subordinate jointly identify common [[goal]]s, define each individual's major areas of responsibility in terms of the results expected of him or her, and use these measures as guides for operating the unit and assessing the contribution of each of its members.

== History ==
[[Peter Drucker]] first used the term "management by objectives" in his 1954 book ''The Practice of Management''.&lt;ref name=Practice/&gt; While the basic ideas of MBO were not original to Drucker, they pulled from other management practices to create a complete “system”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LaFollette|first=William R.|last2=Fleming|first2=Richard J.|date=1977-08-01|title=The Historical Antecedents of Management by Objectives|url=http://proceedings.aom.org/content/1977/1/2.2|journal=Academy of Management Proceedings|language=en|volume=1977|issue=1|pages=2–5|doi=10.5465/AMBPP.1977.4976584|issn=0065-0668}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea draws on the many ideas presented in Mary Parker Follett's 1926 essay, "[[The Giving of Orders]]".

After the term and idea were brought up, Drucker's student, [[George S. Odiorne|George Odiorne]], continued to develop the idea in his book ''Management Decisions by Objectives'', published in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/23/obituaries/george-s-odiorne-is-dead-at-71-developed-theory-of-management.html|title=George S. Odiorne Is Dead at 71; Developed Theory of Management|last=Lambert|first=Bruce|date=1992-01-23|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; MBO was popularized by companies like Hewlett-Packard, who claimed it led to their success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hindle, Tim. ''Guide to Management Ideas and Gurus''. New York: Bloomberg Press, 2008. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept and framework ==

Management by objectives at its core is the process of employers/supervisors attempting to manage their subordinates by introducing a set of specific goals that both the employee and the company strive to achieve in the near future, and working to meet those goals accordingly.&lt;ref name="Practice" /&gt;

Five steps: 
#Review organizational goal 
#Set worker objective 
#Monitor progress 
#Evaluation 
#Give reward

== Features and advantages ==
The principle of MBO is for employees to have a clear understanding of their roles and the responsibilities expected of them, so they can understand how their activities relate to the achievement of the organization's goals. MBO also places importance on fulfilling the personal goals of each employee.

Proponents argue that benefits of MBO include:
#[[Motivation]] – Involving employees in the whole process of goal setting and increasing employee [[empowerment]].  This increases employee [[job satisfaction]] and commitment.
#Better communication and coordination – Frequent [[performance appraisal|reviews]] and interactions between superiors and subordinates help to maintain harmonious relationships within the organization and also to solve problems.
#Clarity of goals.
#Subordinates tend to have a higher commitment to objectives they set for themselves than those imposed on them by another person.
#Managers can ensure that objectives of the subordinates are linked to the organization's objectives.
#Common goal for whole organization means it is a unifying, directive principle of management.

== Application in practice ==
There are endless ways to exercise management by objectives. One must simply find specific goals to aim for in an organization or business. Many noteworthy companies have used MBO. The management at the computer company [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP), has said that it considers the policy a huge component of its success. Many other corporations praise the effectiveness of MBO, including [[Xerox]], [[DuPont]], [[Intel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gtmhub.com/blog/2016/09/14/masterclass-in-mission-statement-from-gordon-moore-co-founder-intel-corporation/|title=Masterclass on Mission Statement from Gordon Moore, co-founder, Intel Corporation &gt;  Gtmhub team blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and countless others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-managerial-objectives-23790.html|title=Examples of Managerial Objectives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that use MBO often report greater sales rates and productiveness within the organization. Objectives can be set in all domains of activities, such as production, marketing, services, sales, R&amp;D, human resources, finance, and information systems. Some objectives are collective, and some can be goals for each individual worker. Both make the task at hand seem attainable and enable the workers to visualize what needs to be done and how.

In the MBO paradigm, managers determine the mission and the [[Strategic planning|strategic goals]] of the enterprise. The goals set by top-level managers are based on an analysis of what can and should be accomplished by the organization within a specific period of time. The functions of these managers can be centralised by appointing a project manager who can monitor and control activities of the various departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rituinc.com/the-concept-of-management-by-objectives/|title=The Concept Of Management By Objectives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this cannot be done or is not desirable, each manager's contributions to the organizational goal should be clearly spelled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282450672|title=Multi-objective Optimization Tool for Integrated Groundwater Management (PDF Download Available)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectives need quantifying and [[surveillance|monitoring]]. Reliable [[management information systems]] are needed to establish relevant objectives and monitor their "reach ratio" in an objective way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ycxb.tobacco.org.cn/EN/abstract/abstract863.shtml|title=基于动态平均数的烟草企业目标管理|journal=中国烟草学报|volume=21|issue=3|doi=10.16472/j.chinatobacco.2014.457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pay [[incentive]]s (bonuses) are often linked to results in reaching the objectives.

The mnemonic [[SMART criteria|S.M.A.R.T.]] is associated with the process of setting objectives in this paradigm. "SMART" objectives are:
* Specific - Target a specific area for improvement.
* Measurable - Quantify or suggest an indicator of progress. 
* Assignable - Specify who will do it.
* Realistic - State what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
* Time-Related - Specify when the result(s) can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;S.M.A.R.T. Goals" November 1981 issue of American Management Association Review by Ph.D. George T. Doran&lt;/ref&gt;
The aphorism "what gets measured gets done", is aligned with the MBO philosophy.

==Arguments against==
MBO has its detractors and attention notably among them [[W. Edwards Deming]], who argued that a lack of understanding of systems commonly results in the misapplication of objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Deming, W. Edwards, ''Out of the Crisis'', The MIT Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-262-54116-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Deming stated that setting production targets will encourage workers to meet those targets through whatever means necessary, which usually results in poor quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/demings-14-points-and-quality-project-leadership Deming’s 14 Points and Quality Project Leadership] ''J. Alex Sherrer, March 3, 2010''&lt;/ref&gt;

Point 7 of Deming's [[W. Edwards Deming#Key principles|key principles]] encourages managers to abandon objectives in favour of leadership because he felt that a leader with an understanding of systems was more likely to guide workers to an appropriate solution than the incentive of an objective. Deming also pointed out that Drucker warned managers that a systemic view was required&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter, "Management Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices", Harper &amp; Row, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; and felt that Drucker's warning went largely unheeded by the practitioners of MBO.

There are several limitations to the assumptive base underlying the impact of managing by objectives,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} including:
	 
# It over-emphasizes the setting of goals over the working of a plan as a driver of outcomes.
# It under-emphasizes the importance of the environment or context in which the goals are set.

That context includes everything from the availability and quality of resources, to relative [[wikt:buy-in|buy-in]] by leadership and stake-holders. As an example of the influence of management buy-in as a contextual influencer, in a 1991 comprehensive review of thirty years of research on the impact of Management by Objectives, Robert Rodgers and John Hunter concluded that companies whose CEOs demonstrated high commitment to MBO showed, on average, a 56% gain in [[productivity]]. Companies with CEOs who showed low commitment only saw a 6% gain in productivity.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

When this approach is not properly set, agreed and managed by organizations, self-centered employees might be prone to distort results, falsely representing achievement of targets that were set in a short-term, narrow fashion. In this case, managing by objectives would be counterproductive.

== Recent research ==
Management by Objectives is still practiced today, with a focus on planning and development aiding various organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raj|first=Ritu|date=12 October 2012|title=The Concept of Management by Objectives|url=http://rituinc.com/the-concept-of-management-by-objectives/|journal=Ritu, Inc.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent research focuses on specific industries, specifying the practice of MBO for each.&lt;ref&gt;Xihuai, L. (2014). On Application of MBO in College.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nouiri, Issam. "Objective optimization tool for integrated groundwater management." ''Water Resource Management''. November 2015. vol. 29 issue 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, following criticism of the original MBO approach, a new formula was introduced in 2016, aiming at revitalizing it, that is the OPTIMAL MBO, which stands for its components, namely: (O) Objectives, Outside-in; (P) Profitability (budget) related goals; (T) Target Setting; (I) Incentives &amp; Influence; (M) Measurement; (A) Agreement, Accountability, Appraisal, Appreciation; and (L) Leadership Support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319670872|title=The OPTIMAL MBO|last=Gotteiner|first=Sharon|date=2016|website=|publisher=European Accounting and Management Review Vol. 2, Issue 2, pp. 42-56|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the practice is used today, it may go by different names – the letters "MBO" have lost their formality, and future planning is a more standard practice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14299761|title=Management by objectives|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6551">[[File:Maximiano Errazuriz Valdivieso.jpg|thumb|Maximiano Errázuriz]]
'''Maximiano Errázuriz Valdivieso''' (February 21, 1832 &amp;ndash; November 17, 1890) was a [[Chile]]an politician, industrialist and winemaker of [[Basque people|Basque]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euskonews.com/0186zbk/kosmo18602.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Maximiano Errazuriz was born in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], in 1832, the son of Francisco Javier de Errázuriz y Aldunate and of his second wife, Rosario Fernández de Valdivieso y Zañartu (sister to Archbishop [[Rafael Valentín Valdivieso]]). Maximiano Errazuriz studied in Santiago and later settled in [[Valparaíso]], Chile, which at the time was one of the main ports of Chile and South America. There he met his future wife, Amalia Urmeneta Quiroga, daughter of [[José Tomás Urmeneta]], who was the wealthiest man in the country. Maximiano and Amalia were married in 1855, when she was 18 and he was 22 years old.

Soon after the marriage, Maximiano Errazuriz entered into a partnership with his father-in-law to form a copper producing company. Copper is one of Chile's most important natural resources, and at one time, their company accounted for one third of the world's total copper production. A year later, in 1856, Maximiano Errazuriz formed the ''Santiago Gas Company'' ({{lang-es|Compañía de Gas de Santiago|links=no}}), a company which was responsible for establishing street lighting in the capital city of Santiago.

A few years later, the couple moved to Guayacán, in the northern part of the country. There, Maximiano managed the mining company's production and business operations. But the move to Guayacán proved tragic. While pregnant with her fourth child, health problems forced Amalia to return to Santiago and live with her mother-in-law. She never recovered completely after the birth of their son [[Rafael Valentín Errázuriz|Rafael]]. Amalia died in 1861, at the young age of 24.

After Amalia's death, Maximiano Errazuriz placed his children under the care of his mother and moved from the North back to Valparaíso to be near them and still manage his business. His family was concerned about his grief for his wife. To help him, they encouraged Maximiano to embark on a yearlong journey across Europe, where he was able to reinvigorate his interest in history and the arts.

==Public office==
Maximiano Errazuriz participated actively in Chile's public life. As a young man of 25, he served for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies. He was elected representative for three periods and subsequently Senator of the Republic for nine years. He also participated actively as a representative of the Chilean government on diplomatic tasks in the United States and in the United Kingdom. On one occasion, he showed his undying commitment to his country by backing Chilean government dealings with his own personal finances.

==Winemaking activities==
In 1870, again following the example of his father-in-law, he planted a vineyard on land he bought in Panquehue, a small town located North of Santiago in the Aconcagua Valley. Maximiano Errazuriz planted a total of 300 hectares in Panquehue. Later, his son Rafael increased the plantings to 700 hectares, with the Errazuriz vineyards becoming - based on the information of the time - the world's largest vineyard in the hands of a single owner.

==Later life==
In 1871, Maximiano Errazuriz met Carmen Valdes, daughter of the Governor of [[Valparaíso]], Chile, whom he married. Shortly thereafter, he began construction of a large house in Panquehue. A beautiful park designed by French landscapers surrounded the house. This was to become the residence of the new couple. However, fate intervened. The candidates running for office for the [[Chilean presidential election, 1871|presidential election of 1871]] were very close to him: his older half-brother [[Federico Errázuriz Zañartu]] and his father-in-law [[José Tomás Urmeneta]]. He did not want his strong political influence to be used to affect the outcome of the election. To avoid being forced to take sides, he decided to leave the country. He traveled to Paris with his new wife and children. In the course of their subsequent return, Carmen became severely ill with yellow fever. She survived the trip only to die in Chile, close to her family.

Maximiano Errazuriz continued his activities and concentrated in his children's education. He decided to build a new house in Santiago, where he moved to distance himself from painful memories. This building, presently the Brazilian Embassy, is one of the most beautiful architectural designs in the capital city.

After the death of his former father-in-law and partner José Tomás Urmeneta in 1878, Maximiano Errazuriz formed a new partnership with his children and began a gradual retreat from the world of business, diplomacy and politics. In 1883, with his children already married, he settled permanently at his vineyard in Panquehue, selling his house in Santiago. He decided to live in the property's administration house, and never used the mansion he had built to share with his second wife. At 48, he completely transformed his life and became devoted to prayer and to aiding the poor. He lived austerely in the peacefulness of Panquehue, building houses for his workers, founding a school and a church. He also donated a significant portion of his art collection to charitable institutions. Maximiano Errazuriz died in 1890, at the age of 58.

'''Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz''' (16 August 1932 – 29 September 2015) ([[Arabic]]:نواف بن عبد العزيز آل سعود) was a senior member of the [[House of Saud]] and was a close ally of the deceased [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]].&lt;ref name=gsn&gt;{{cite journal|title=Further Prince Sultan succession speculation|journal=Gulf States Newsletter|date=16 January 2009|volume=33|issue=845|url=http://www.gsn-online.com/SSIs/SAMPLES/documents/GSN845.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Prince Nawwaf was born on 16 August 1932.&lt;ref name=Sharaf2001/&gt; He was the twenty-second son of Ibn Saud.&lt;ref name=GIP&gt;{{cite web|title=HRH Prince Nawaf bin Abdulaziz|url=http://www.gip.gov.sa/sites/english/PreviousPresidency/Pages/HRHPrinceNawafBinAbdulAziz.aspx|publisher=Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, General Intelligence Presidency|accessdate=5 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216030709/http://gip.gov.sa/sites/english/PreviousPresidency/Pages/HRHPrinceNawafBinAbdulAziz.aspx|archivedate=16 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a full brother of [[Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Prince Talal]]. Their mother was an [[Armenians|Armenian]], Munaiyir, whose family escaped from the [[Armenian Genocide]] experienced  under the reign of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1915 to 1923.&lt;ref name=jros/&gt; Munaiyir was presented to [[Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al-Saud|Abdulaziz]] when she was 12 years old in the place of emir of [[Unayzah]] in 1921. Their first child, Talal, was born in 1924. Following the tradition, Munaiyir became to be known as Umm Talal, "mother of Talal".&lt;ref name=jros/&gt; However, in 1927, the three-year-old Talal died. Later, she gave four children to Ibn Saud, one of them is Prince Nawwaf. It is not exactly known when Abdulaziz divorced his fourth wife and formally wed Munaiyir. It is reported by her family that she remained illiterate all her life.&lt;ref name=jros&gt;{{cite news|last=Rossant|first=John|title=The return of Saudi Arabia's red prince|url=http://www.atimes.com/front/DC19Aa02.html|accessdate=4 May 2012|work=Online Asia Times|date=19 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munaiyir was regarded by British diplomats in Saudi Arabia as one of [[Ibn Saud]]’s favourite wives.

During the reign of [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]], his relations with his full-brother Prince Talal became negative, even leading to contesting their inheritances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kechichian|first=Joseph A.|title=Succession in Saudi Arabia|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|pages=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=79Fs5bLPgBYC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=succession+in+saudi+arabia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YFljq6DjSQ&amp;sig=jUyMCiI4Fo3DWpozWA8fR6pC9jY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CuZ-T7bEK9Gp0AWAuoGTBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=succession%20in%20saudi%20arabia&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz served briefly as chief of the royal court in 1961.&lt;ref name=Sharaf2001/&gt; He was also appointed finance minister by [[King Saud]] and served in the post for two years.&lt;ref name=Sharaf2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=anews1sept&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Nawaf new intelligence chief|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/214954|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=Arab News|date=1 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded Prince Talal in the post.&lt;ref name=Oron&gt;{{cite book|author=Yitzhak Oron, Ed.|title=Middle East Record Volume 2, 1961|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzZ71Eh5QvMC&amp;pg=PA419|accessdate=11 April 2013|publisher=The Moshe Dayan Center|pages=419|id=GGKEY:4Q1FXYK79X8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Prince Nawwaf worked as [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]]'s special adviser for Persian Gulf affairs from 1968 to 1975.&lt;ref name=anews1sept/&gt; In 1968, following the evacuation of the British forces from [[Persian Gulf|the Persian Gulf region]], [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]] named him as one of his special advisors. In view of his experience in various spheres, King Faisal sent him to participate in official delegations of the Kingdom at various meetings, including Arab and Islamic summits and meetings of non-aligned countries. He also led the Kingdom's delegations on behalf of King Faisal or work as his special envoy. Prince Nawwaf was thoroughly familiar with international policy and law, and was also an expert on the Middle East affairs. He did his best to unify the ranks of the Arab emirates and to integrate these emirates into one state following their partitions into seven tiny states during the colonial rule.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity.org/&gt; In view of his rich experience in economic and political spheres, Prince Nawwaf was delegated to serve as the Saudi Government's official spokesman and its special envoy on several occasions. He visited the four corners of the world and positively contributed to the settlement of numerous disputes in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] as well as in other parts of the world. He also accompanied Crown Prince [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]] during his official foreign trips.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"/&gt; However, Prince Nawwaf did not hold any official position until 2001.&lt;ref name=alb1sep&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi Prince Criticizes Washington's Policy against Tehran|url=http://www.albawaba.com/news/saudi-prince-criticizes-washingtons-policy-against-tehran|accessdate=6 April 2013|work=Albawaba|date=1 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a special advisor to the late King Abdullah at the rank of minister&lt;ref name=GIP/&gt; and his term was extended for four years in 2009.&lt;ref name=gsn/&gt;

==Other activities==
Prince Nawwaf was one of the supporters of [[Free Princes Movement|the Free Princes Movement]] led by his brother Prince Talal in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vijay Prashad|authorlink=Vijay Prashad|title=The Darker Nations- A Biography of the Short-Lived Third World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vY-rhSbio8cC&amp;pg=PA275|accessdate=13 September 2013|year=2007|publisher=[[LeftWord Books]]|isbn=978-81-87496-66-3|pages=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed to the establishment of some industrial projects inside and outside the Kingdom to serve the Arab economy. His contribution to the strengthening of the Kingdom's relations with other world states is widely respected. He was one of the founders and a major shareholder of the Saudi-New Zealand Bank. He also owned some investment projects in the fields of real estate and tourism. He was one of the pioneers of the solar energy industry. Realizing the importance of solar energy, he extended his support to [[Sydney University]] in [[Australia]] to enable it to conduct research and studies in this field.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"/&gt;

==Views==
A Saudi survey conducted shortly after the [[11 September attacks]] concluded that 95 percent of educated Saudi men aged between 25 and 41 supported ‘bin Laden’s cause. Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz argued that this support is motivated by Saudi anger over U.S. support for [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quilliam|first=Neil|author2=Maggie Kamel|title=Modernising Legitimacy: Saudi Strategies|journal=[[Alternatives: Turkish Journal of International Relations]]|year=2003|volume=2|issue=2|url=http://alternativesjournal.net/volume2/number2/kamel.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518172802/http://alternativesjournal.net/volume2/number2/kamel.pdf|archivedate=18 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[US sanctions against Iran|the US sanctions]] against [[Iran]] in 2000, Prince Nawwaf said "Iran is being treated unfairly by some countries and this is not in the interests of the Arabia Gulf or even the US."&lt;ref name=alb1sep/&gt;

&lt;!-- FAIR USE of NikeGrindLogo.png: low resolution copy of the grind program logo --&gt;

'''Nike Grind''' is part of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s Reuse-A-Shoe program that was started in 1993. The purpose of the program is to eliminate waste and close the loop on Nike's [[Product life-cycle management (marketing)#Product life cycle (PLC)|product lifecycle]] by collecting post-consumer, non-metal-containing athletic shoes of any brand. This includes Nike shoes that are returned due to material or workmanship defects.

==Recycling Process==
Once collected, the sneakers are ground up and separated into three distinct types of material: [[rubber]] from the outsole, foam from the midsole and fabric from the shoe's upper. Nike and its partners (Atlas Track &amp; Tennis, Playtop, Training Ground, Everlast and [[Rebound Ace]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Partners | work=Let Me Play | url= http://www.letmeplay.com/reuseashoe/grind/partners}}&lt;/ref&gt; take the granulated rubber and create [[soccer]], [[American football|football]], [[baseball]] fields, [[weight room]] flooring and running tracks. The first synthetic turf soccer field installed with Nike Grind rubber was Douglas Park in Chicago. That surface was donated by Nike and the U.S. Soccer Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/News/3151.html |title=Gold Medal Soccer Stars Mia Hamm &amp; Briana Scurry Help NikeGO and The U.S. Soccer Foundation Dedicate Chicago Soccer Field|work=Corporate Social Responsibility News|accessdate=2004-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nike uses the granulated foam from the shoes for synthetic [[basketball]] courts, [[tennis]] courts and playground surfacing tiles. The granulated fabric from the shoe uppers becomes the padding under hardwood basketball floors.

These programs are located in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]].

==Processing==

There are two Nike Grind processing plants, one located in the United States and the other in Belgium. The American facility uses a "slice and grind" technique, where each shoe is cut into three slices that contain the main materials. These slices are fed through grinders and purified to become the different types of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nike Partnership: A Perfect Fit For ECORE | work=ECORE International | url=http://www.ecoreintl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian facility grinds the shoes whole, and passes the resulting material through a series of separators for the same three groups of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Nike Kicks Off Shoe Recycling Program | work=Sportswear International | url= http://www.sportswearnet.com/marketnews/pages/show.prl?params=&amp;id=530&amp;currPage=16&amp;ori=find }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Offshore Software R&amp;D''' is the provision of [[software development]] services by a supplier (whether external or internal) located in a different country from the one where the software will be used. The main reason behind companies using offshore software development services is the higher development cost of the local service providers. The global software R&amp;D services market, as contrasted to [[Information Technology Outsourcing|ITO]] and [[Business process outsourcing|BPO]], is rather young and currently is at a relatively early stage of development.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6279679.stm BBC NEWS | Business | Globalisation shakes the world&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries involved==

While India, Ireland, Canada and Israel were the four leading countries that controlled this business in 2003,&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; the percentages shifted by 2009 when the front-runners, India and the Philippines, had a combined share of the world market for business process offshoring of about 50 percent. The UN Information Economy Report 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unctad.org/Templates/webflyer.asp?docid=13912&amp;intItemID=5637&amp;lang=1&amp;mode=downloads UN Information Economy Report 2010, p.49]&lt;/ref&gt; reads that "the second largest exporter, Canada, continued to shrink to 21 percent by 2009. Beyond these top three locations, several economies from all continents are making inroads as offshoring destinations. The group of 'other destinations' in figure III.5 surged from 4 percent in 2004 to 16 percent in 2009. The main such locations in 2009 included China, Thailand and Sri Lanka in Asia;26 and Argentina, Brazil, Colombia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnamericas.com/news/technology/colombia-moves-towards-top-of-outsourcing-a-list-says-nearshore-americas|title=Colombia Moves Towards Top of Outsourcing A-List|work=BnAmericas|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2016/10/03/6-tech-companies-from-colombia-to-watch/|title=6 Tech Companies from Colombia to Watch|work=Forbes|accessdate=3 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; , Costa Rica and Mexico in Latin America. On the African continent, Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco and South Africa all have more than 10,000 offshore jobs in the IT and ICT-enabled services sector (Everest Research Institute, 2009). The share of countries in Central and Eastern Europe was unchanged at 6 percent between 2008 and 2009."  According to [[Gartner]] Group,&lt;ref name="russoft.org"&gt;[http://www.russoft.org/docs/?doc=1123 Offshore Outsourcing: Why Russia? - RUSSOFT &amp; Outsourcing-Russia.Com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; only these four countries are capable of scaling up enough to meet the demands of large-scale projects. 
[[Brazil]] has been attracting attention due to the closer timezone to the US eastern coast, besides closer cultural affinity.&lt;ref name="www.cio.com"&gt;[http://www.cio.com/article/122251/Brazil_Sambas_onto_Offshore_Outsourcing_Stage?page=1 Brazil Sambas onto Offshore Outsourcing Stage]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, countries like [[Colombia]], the third largest Spanish speaking country by population, have become popular "nearshoring" destinations due to their proximity to the US &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnamericas.com/news/technology/colombia-moves-towards-top-of-outsourcing-a-list-says-nearshore-americas|title=Colombia Moves Towards Top of Outsourcing A-List|work=BnAmericas|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Other offshore software development destinations include [[Western Europe]] ([[Portugal]]), [[Central Europe]] ([[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], Hungary, [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), [[Eastern Europe]] ( [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], Russia), [[Asia]] ([[Armenia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Vietnam]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]]), [[Africa]] ( [[Egypt]], [[Morocco]]), [[South America]] ( [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]]), and [[Philippines]].

==Offshore R&amp;D hubs==

According to [[Gartner]] group's report, global cities are categorized into Tier I, Tier II and Tier III based on numerous factors such as the quality of infrastructure, global connectivity, and availability of [[human capital]],&lt;ref name="russoft.org"/&gt; in order to rank the best places to set up an offshore R&amp;D location. The report concludes that cities like [[Bangalore]], [[Yerevan]], [[Mumbai]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Bucharest]],  [[New Delhi]], [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], [[Ho Chi Minh city]], [[Chennai]], [[Pune]], [[Indore]], [[NOIDA]], [[Gurgaon]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Greater Toronto Area]], [[Ottawa]], [[Montreal]], [[Haifa]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Dublin]], [[Lahore]], [[Kiev]], [[Minsk]], [[Moscow]], and [[St. Petersburg]] would be the ideal places, and hence "Tier I" cities to offshore R&amp;D.

==Western dilemma==

[[Outsourcing]] R&amp;D has also become a solution to some issues facing certain Western countries, especially United States and Canada, even though they have traditionally tried not to lose their technological advantage to [[Asia]]. United States and Canada are producing little more than half the required number of graduates in science and technology. Many of the [[Master of Science|MSc]] and [[PhD]] students in these countries are international students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeanet.org/publications/IDMK_AeA_Offshore_Outsourcing.asp Offshore Outsourcing in an Increasingly Competitive and Rapidly Changing World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[North America]] has an ageing population and many people in senior positions are heading towards retirement.&lt;ref name="innovationdialogue.com"&gt;[http://www.innovationdialogue.com/article_cornfordmurgatroyd.2005.08.19.htm Innovation in Canada - Failing the Grade?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Government, "The High-Tech Worker Shortage and U.S. Immigration Policy," U.S. G.P.O, Supt. Of Docs., Congressional Sales Office, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these countries are falling behind in growth and competitiveness, and the productivity gap between them and smaller industrialized nations continues to widen.&lt;ref name="innovationdialogue.com"/&gt; Short term solutions to these problems aren't available in Western countries, as even immigration is a long and cumbersome process. It is therefore beneficial for these countries to offshore development.

==Labor issues in Japan==
Japanese companies often exploits the foreign labors, particularly Chinese and Vietnamese, by violating the Employment Security Act, and Labor Standard Act set by ministry of health and labors in Japan using the name of offshoring.

Article 44 of Employment Security Act in Japan implicitly bans the domestic/foreign workers supplied by unauthorized companies regardless of their operating locations. Law will apply if at least one party of suppliers, clients, labors reside in Japan, and if the labors are the integral part of the chain of command by the client company, or the supplier.

{{quotation|No person shall carry out a labor supply business or have workers supplied by a person who carries out a labor supply business work under his/her own directions or orders, except in cases provided for in the following Article.|Employment Security Act}}

Those deemed to violate will be punished with

== Usability issues in offshore development ==

The main driver for offshoring development work has been the greater availability of developers at a lower cost than in the home country. However, the rise in offshore development has taken place in parallel with an increased awareness of the importance of usability, and the user experience, in software. Outsourced development poses special problems for development, i.e. the more formal, contractual relationship between the supplier and client, and geographical separation place greater distance between the developers and users, which makes it harder to reflect the users' needs in the final product. This problem is exacerbated if the development is offshore. Further complications arise from cultural differences, which apply even if the development is carried out by an in-house offshore team.

Historically offshore development concentrated on back office functions but, as offshoring has grown, a wider range of applications have been developed. Offshore suppliers have had to respond to the commercial pressures arising from usability issues by building up their usability expertise. Indeed, this problem has presented an attractive opportunity to some suppliers to move up market and offer higher value services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.userindesign.com/Images/Papers/Usability%20Issues%20in%20Offshore.pdf "Usability Issues in Offshore Development: an Indian Perspective"], accessed January 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarotesting.com/page12.htm "What Happens to Usability when Development goes Offshore?"], accessed January 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.userindesign.com/Images/Papers/Offshore%20Development%20Culture%20and%20UX.pdf "Offshore Development Culture and User Experience"], accessed January 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
Offshore Software R&amp;D means that company A turns over responsibility, in whole or in part, of an in-house software development to company B whose location is outside of company A’s national jurisdiction.  Maximizing the economic value of an offshore software development asset critically depends on understanding how best to use the available forms of legal regulations to protect intellectual rights. If the vendor cannot be trusted to protect trade secrets, then the risks of an offshoring software development may outweigh its potential benefits.  Hence, it is critical to review the intellectual property policy of the potential offshoring supplier. The intellectual property protection policy of an offshore software development company must be reflected in these crucial documents: General Agreement; Non-Disclosure Agreement; Employee Confidentiality Contract.&lt;ref&gt;How to protect intellectual property and confidential information dealing with offshore software development company? https://belitsoft.com/offshore-software-development-company/protect-intellectual-property-and-confidential-information&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future trends==

In 2003, a survey by [[Santa Clara University]] showed that R&amp;D sector would be the next target of [[outsourcing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3069991 InternetNews Realtime IT News – R&amp;D the Latest Target of Silicon Valley Outsourcing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The same survey also mentioned that even as of 2003, many United States-based companies were adapting to a new business model where they would have the ownership of the intellectual property, but the outsourcing vendor would be given the contract for development with well defined goals in a certain period of time. Outsourcing research operations is currently a small sector in the [[offshoring]] business; however, it is growing very rapidly. As of 2006, India alone was getting 25% of new global investments on research.&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/287555.cms India draws 25% of global R&amp;D funds- Corporate Trends-News By Company-News-The Economic Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of major multinational corporations have set up R&amp;D centers in India, the list of such companies include several big names such as [[Oracle Corporation]], [[Intel]], [[Adobe Systems]], [[STMicroelectronics|STM]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[IBM]], and [[Microsoft]].

India's software exports are growing by more than 30% per year,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/technology/feeds/afx/2006/02/09/afx2512585.html India software exports seen growing 32 pct in yr to March 2006 - NASSCOM - Forbes.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which has triggered protectionist measures on the part of US government, especially the [[IRS]], which recently passed regulations to make outsourcing research harder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.rediff.com/money/2006/nov/27guest.htm US tightens grip on Indian R&amp;D centres&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, these regulations don't forbid outsourcing research, and many Western corporations like [[Eli Lilly and Company]], [[P&amp;G]], [[Henkel]], [[Dow AgroSciences]], [[Novartis]] and Indian scientists are using web as a forum to easily get around such regulations lawfully. Many R&amp;D contracts have been given to Indian universities and labs in this way, but only some research solutions are patented during this process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/693457.cms Desi scientists help MNCs with R&amp;D solutions- Corporate Trends-News By Company-News-The Economic Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 article, [[Forbes]] magazine suggests that it is increasingly more dangerous to offshore IP sensitive projects to India, because of India's continued ignorance of patent regulations.&lt;ref&gt;It's time to stop Outsourcing Pharma RD to India. Oct. 2012. https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2012/10/11/its-time-to-stop-outsourcing-pharma-rd-to-india/&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, companies such as [[Pfizer]] and Novartis, have lost rights to sell many of their cancer medications in India because of lack of [[Intellectual Property|IP protection]], an Indian policy that is soon to include not just cancer drugs, but a larger variety of medications.  As a result, many Western pharmaceutical corporations are reconsidering offshore R&amp;D in India, since the loss in revenues is in many cases larger than the cost-savings of offshore R&amp;D.

Offshore R&amp;D depends on availability of highly skilled labor in offshore destinations. [[Eastern Europe]]an countries, from [[Belarus]] to [[Ukraine]], will continue to offer a highly skilled technical workforce, because of their vast education infrastructure. There is currently 17.2 million people in tertiary education across the region including Russia, compared to 13.6 million in India.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} That paired with cost-efficiency and higher security guarantees makes Eastern Europe a very attractive offshore R&amp;D destination.

India's technical workforce is also increasing, but at a slower pace. It is estimated that very soon there could be a 25-30% gap between supply and demand of PhD's in India.&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"/&gt; However, increased [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] and creation of a lot of well-paid job opportunities are encouraging enough to motivate more Indians to pursue [[PhD]]s. Moreover, many Indians have recently moved to India from [[Silicon Valley]], and a lot of them are technically specialized and hold advanced degrees from world's premier institutions, which considerably enrich India's workforce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1281338.stm BBC News | BUSINESS | Asian exodus from Silicon Valley?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; While the number of technically skilled labor grows in India, Indian offshore companies are increasingly tapping into the skilled labor already available in Eastern Europe to better address the needs of the Western European R&amp;D market.&lt;ref&gt;Indian BPOs Dial Eastern Europe. Jun 2009. http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2009-06-12/news/27663963_1_indian-bpo-outsourcing-market-india-s-bpo&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vietnam]]’s IT services sector boomed in recent years as international companies raced to capitalize on the country’s low-cost tech talent. Although many came in search of cheap workers for basic tasks, some now see the country as a viable provider of higher-value services, including complex software development, data analytics, and even original R&amp;D.&lt;ref&gt;B2B Marketplace for Offshore SW Services https://www.gsp-client.de/marketplace&lt;/ref&gt;

Generating transparency on such service providers available on a global scale is the aim of dedicated B2B marketplaces offered as online service.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam IT Services Climb The Value Chain https://www.forbes.com/sites/techonomy/2014/12/09/vietnam-it-services-climb-the-value-chain/&lt;/ref&gt;

As B2B marketplaces often only cover short-term or freelance one-off engagements, premium Clients looking for long-term strategic partnerships makes use of independent and on-demand 'Software Outsourcing Advisory as a Service'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.resiport.com Software Outsourcing Advisory as a Service]&lt;/ref&gt; platforms to match the hundreds of parameters in an outsourcing strategy with the tens of thousands of Independent Software Vendors available worldwide. 

==Governance==
An important aspect of offshore software development is to implement an efficient governance structure for the remote applications development. Effective governance can be achieved by using the proper business model that provides the right amount of flexibility, scalability and risk management. Models widely differ based on business needs, and can involve a lot of integration, for example in joint venture and group captive models, or can be less involved, as is the case with Remote Insourcing, managed services and "build-operate-transfer" models. It is important to note that all models require significant investment in communication process and change management, especially at the beginning of the process.

To measure efficient governance an automated generation of meaningful Key Performance Indicators is helpful and topic of research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plixos.com/images/plixos/downloads/research-paper_global-bus-system.pdf] 2nd research paper resulting from the project -Global Bus System - GloBuS- with the Technische Universität München&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on [[software quality]] metrics is another good way to maintain track of how well a project is performing and whether the governance models fit the project. If the resulting outcome is not on par with expectations, which will be rapidly obvious when looking at software quality metrics, then executives know they must improve governance (whether through implementation of a new model or improving one aspect of the existing process).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11626">{{Corporate law|UK/Ire/Com}}

A '''public limited company''' (legally abbreviated to '''plc''') is a type of [[public company]] under the [[United Kingdom company law]], some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. It is a [[limited liability]] company whose shares may be freely  sold and traded to the public (although a plc may also be privately held, often by another plc), with a minimum [[share capital]] of £50,000 and usually with the letters PLC after its name.&lt;ref&gt;Longman Business English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Similar companies in the United States are called ''publicly traded companies''. Public limited companies will also have a separate legal identity.

A PLC can be either an unlisted or listed company on the [[stock exchange]]s. In the United Kingdom, a public limited company usually must include the words "public limited company" or the abbreviation "PLC" or "plc" at the end and as part of the legal company name. Welsh companies may instead choose to end their names with {{lang|cy|ccc}}, an  abbreviation for ''{{lang|cy|cwmni cyfyngedig cyhoeddus}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/58 |title=s. 58(2) Companies Act 2006 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some public limited companies (mostly [[nationalization|nationalised]] concerns) incorporated under special legislation are exempted from bearing any of the identifying suffixes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
The term "public limited company" and the "PLC"/"plc" suffix were introduced in 1981; prior to this, all limited companies bore the suffix "Limited" ("Ltd."), which is still used by [[private company limited by shares|private limited companies]].&lt;ref&gt;"Companies Bill defines 'insider': legislation is expected by the summer", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 December 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

== Registration ==

When a new company incorporates in [[England]] and [[Wales]] or in [[Scotland]], it must register with [[Companies House]], an [[executive agency]] of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]]. Prior to October 2009 companies in [[Northern Ireland]] were registered with the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]'s [[Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment]], but since then Northern Ireland company registrations are handled by [[Companies House]] along with the rest of the [[United Kingdom]].

== Company directors ==
Formation of a public limited company requires a minimum of two directors and one secretary (differing from country to country: in India three directors are required). In general terms anyone can be a company director, provided they are not disqualified on one of the following grounds:
*in the case of PLCs or their subsidiaries, the person is over 70 years of age or reaches 70 years of age while in office, unless they are appointed or re-appointed by resolution of the company in general meeting of which special notice has been given.
*the person is an undischarged bankrupt, subject to a Bankruptcy Restrictions Order (BRO) or Bankruptcy Restrictions Undertaking (BRU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/bankruptcy/restrictions|title=Applying to become bankrupt: Restrictions - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise disqualified by a Court from holding a directorship, unless given leave to act in respect of a particular company or companies.
*in England and Wales (as of October 2008; Companies Act 2006) and in Scotland (Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991), the person is under 16 years old.

== Share capital ==

The members must agree to take some, or all, of the shares when the company is registered.  The memorandum of association must show the names of the people who have agreed to take shares and the number of shares each will take.  These people are called the subscribers.

There is a  minimum share capital for public limited companies: Before it can start business, it must have allotted shares to the value of at least £50,000.  A quarter of them, £12,500, must be paid up.  Each allotted share must be paid up to at least one quarter of its nominal value together with the whole of any premium.

A company can increase its authorised share capital by passing an [[ordinary resolution]] (unless its articles of association require a special or [[extraordinary resolution]]).  A copy of the resolution – and notice of the increase on Form 123 – must reach [[Companies House]] within 15 days of being passed.  No fee is payable to Companies House.

A company can decrease its authorised share capital by passing an ordinary resolution to cancel shares which have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person.  Notice of the cancellation, on Form 122, must reach Companies House within one month.  No fee is payable to Companies House.

=== Share types ===
A company may have as many different types of shares as it wishes, all with different conditions attached to them.  Generally share types are divided into the following categories:
*'''Ordinary''' – As the name suggests these are the ordinary shares of the company with no special rights or restrictions.  They may be divided into classes of different value.
*'''Preference''' – These shares normally carry a right that any annual dividends available for distribution will be paid preferentially on these shares before other classes.
*'''Cumulative preference''' – These shares carry a right that, if the dividend cannot be paid in one year, it will be carried forward to successive years.
*'''Redeemable''' – These shares are issued with an agreement that the company will buy them back at the option of the company or the shareholder after a certain period, or on a fixed date.  A company cannot have redeemable shares only.

[[Bearer shares#Bearer shares|Bearer shares]] are no longer possible, as they were abolished in the UK by the [[Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015]]. Any existing bearer shares had to be converted to registered shares before February 2016, or face cancellation.

A plc has access to capital markets and can offer its shares for sale to the public through a recognised stock exchange.  It can also issue advertisements offering any of its securities for sale to the public.  In contrast, a private company may not offer to the public any shares in itself.

=== Company formation ===

==== Paper process ====
The following documents, together with the registration fee are sent to the Registrar of Companies:

; Memorandum of Association : This sets out the company name, the registered office address and the company objects.  The object of a company may simply be to carry on business as a general commercial company.  The company's memorandum delivered to the Registrar must be signed by each subscriber in front of a witness who must attest the signature. It is often referred to as the 'charter of a company' or 'constitution of the company'. The signatories to the Memorandum of Association are deemed to be the first Directors of the company. The Memorandum defines the relation of members with the rest of the world.
; Articles of Association : This is the document which sets out  the rules for the running of the company's internal affairs.  The company's articles delivered to the Registrar must be signed by each subscriber in front of a witness who must attest the signature. The Articles define the inter-management, inter-member and inter-employee relationship. 
; Form 1 : This gives details of the first director(s), secretary and the intended address of the registered office.  As well as their names and addresses, the company's directors must give their date of birth, occupation and details of other directorships they have held within the last five years.  Each officer appointed and each subscriber (or their agent) must sign and date the form.
; Form 12 : This is a statutory declaration of compliance with all the legal requirements relating to the incorporation of a company.  It must be signed by a solicitor who is forming the company, or by one of the people named as a director or company secretary on Form 10.  It must be signed in the presence of a commissioner for oaths, a notary public, a justice of the peace or a solicitor.  There is usually a £5 fee payable to the person that witnesses the statuary declaration.

==== Electronic process ====
{{see also|Electronic process of law}}
The key difference with the paper process is that there is no Form 12 and requirement for a statutory declaration.  This significantly speeds the process and Companies House's record for an Electronic Company formation is 23 minutes.

Because the electronic process requires compatible software that works with Companies House eFiling service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/toolsToHelp/accountsSoftware.shtml |title=Companies House website |publisher=Companieshouse.gov.uk |date=2013-09-18 |accessdate=2013-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; companies are usually formed through a Company Formation Agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/toolsToHelp/formationAgents.shtml |title=Companies House website |publisher=Companieshouse.gov.uk |date=2013-12-19 |accessdate=2013-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annual returns ===
Every company must deliver an annual return to Companies House at least once every twelve months.  It has 28 days from the date to which the return is made up to do this.  Failure to file a return is a criminal offence, for which the officers of the company may be fined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/858|title=Companies Act 2006 Section 858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an annual document-processing fee of £40 if filed by paper (or £13 for users of the Electronic Filing or [[WebFilings]] services), which must be sent to Companies House with the annual return.

== Conversion ==

=== Private limited company to a public limited company ===
Both a private company limited by shares and an [[unlimited company]] with a share capital may re-register as a plc, but a company without a share capital cannot do so.

A private company must pass a special resolution that it be so re-registered and deliver a copy of the resolution together with an application form to the Registrar. The resolution must also:
*alter the company's memorandum so that it states that the company is to be a public limited company,
*increase its share capital to the statutory minimum of £50,000,
*make any other alterations to the memorandum so that it conforms to that required for a public limited company,
*make any required alterations to the articles of association of the company.

If it does not already have sufficient share capital, the company must issue £50,000 in shares a minimum of 25% part paid.{{citation needed|reason=is this specific to the UK?|date=August 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2658">'''Rasmus Sigvardt''' (born 26 February 1886) was a mechanic from [[Orehoved]] on the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Falster]]. In 1904, he opened a cycle repair shop which later developed into an engine factory, specializing in boat motors and mechanized fruit-tree sprayers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://falstershistorie.dk/orehoved.html "Orehoved"], Falsters historie. {{da icon}} Retrieved 16 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

The little workshop Sigvardt opened in 1904 was only {{Convert|120|sqft}} but in 1906 he expanded it to {{Convert|450|sqft}}. Around that time, when motorcycles came to Denmark, he was one of the first to obtain the tools he needed for their maintenance and repair. In 1909, he built even larger facilities, where he and his staff of three could repair automobiles, motorcycles and boat motors.&lt;ref name=motorsam&gt;[http://www.motorsamlingen.dk/wordpress/motorfabrikker/orehoved-motorfabrik-danmark/ "Orehoved Motorfabrik, Danmark"], Dansk Motor- og Maskinsamling. {{da icon}} Retrieved 16 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, the factory began to manufacture two-stroke [[glow fuel]] or gasoline engines to serve as boat motors. They were marketed as R. S. M. Motorer from R. Sigvardts Motorfabrik. By the 1920s, Sigvardt was manufacturing even more sophisticated engines, always keeping up to date with developments. In 1926, he began manufacturing spraying equipment for fields and gardens, marketing Denmark's first mechanized sprayer by the end of the same year. By that time he was employing 14 workmen. He also made a success of stationary engines for winching. While continuing his engine business, he later also moved into radios which he assembled himself until he met competition from larger manufacturers.&lt;ref name=motorsam/&gt;

In 1936, Sigvardt organized the ''Brohallen'' bridge exhibition in Orehoved in connection with the building of the [[Storstrøm Bridge]]. In 1951, he had 12 houses built in the town for his factory employees. In 1970, the Sigvardt factory was taken over by Hardi International. It has now moved to Nørre Alslev where it is the town's largest employer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-online.dk/kulturm_rapport/Nr_Alslev.pdf "375-1 Gåbense"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502132122/http://www.museum-online.dk/kulturm_rapport/Nr_Alslev.pdf |date=2014-05-02 }}, Museum-online.dk. {{da icon}} Retrieved 16 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[business]], a '''revenue center''' is a [[division (organization)|division]] that gains revenue from product sales or service provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=revenue center|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/revenue-center.html|publisher=Businessdictionary.com|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The manager in revenue center is accountable for revenue only.

==Overview==
A revenue center is one of the five divisions of a responsibility center – cost center, revenue center, profit center, contribution center and investment center.&lt;ref name="Tulsian2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. Tulsian|title=Cost Accounting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2kbrUHIuk0C&amp;pg=SA1-PA15|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=1 July 2006|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-062043-8|pages=1.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cost centers, like revenue centers, only monitor costs, thereby making them a counterpart to the revenue center.&lt;ref name="Jensen1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael C. Jensen|title=Foundations of Organizational Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-TP-fxGJDQC&amp;pg=PA351|accessdate=20 October 2014|year=1998|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-64342-0|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue centers only measure the output (in fiscal standings) and are therefore marketing establishments which are exempt from profit generation and accountability thereof.&lt;ref name="casestudyinmarketing"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pradip Kumar Sinha|title=Case Study in Marketing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz1xH9eYZMEC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=20 October 2014|year=2007|publisher=Nirali Prakashan|isbn=978-93-80064-10-9|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a revenue center performance is measured by comparing actual sales to projected ones (as well as number of sales or revenue per time scale). Quota and budget comparisons are also used as a performance indicator.&lt;ref name="NeedlesCrosson2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Belverd Needles|author2=Susan Crosson|title=Managerial Accounting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=te4WAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA250|accessdate=22 October 2014|date=19 February 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-285-67528-2|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jawaharlal2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jawahar Lal|title=Cost Accounting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMr8a2gQ-4UC&amp;pg=PA844|accessdate=22 October 2014|edition=3|date=1 August 2002|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-048274-6|page=844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revenue center has costs, however to the manager of a revenue center this is of little importance as revenue is his sole performance indicator.&lt;ref name="BushJohnston1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James W. Bush|author2=Daniel Johnston|title=International Oil Company Financial Management in Nontechnical Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sYIqxibXy1kC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=22 October 2014|date=1 January 1998|publisher=PennWell Books|isbn=978-0-87814-597-3|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all costs are ignored in a revenue center. For example, the manager of a revenue center is responsible for the expenses of his department (such as maintenance costs).&lt;ref name="Palanivelu2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=V.R. Palanivelu|title=Accounting for Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzkX7v7wQBEC&amp;pg=PA406|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Firewall Media|isbn=978-81-318-0119-2|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a sales office (the most widespread example of a revenue center), maintenance costs can be construed as rent, salaries, taxes and security. However, any costs related to product sale and manufacturing are not included in such expenses.&lt;ref name="GHOSH2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=N. GHOSH|title=MANAGEMENT CONTROL SYSTEMS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mLk11itaLrIC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=1 January 2005|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-203-2844-0|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revenue center becomes a profit center if the latter is encompassed, thus making a profit center a blend of both a cost and revenue center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mahesh Kulkarni|author2=Suhas Mahajan|title=Management Accounting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFdzpFzpVtUC&amp;pg=SA6-PA8|accessdate=19 October 2014|year=2008|publisher=Nirali Prakashan|isbn=978-93-80064-15-4|pages=6.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a revenue center the manager usually has control over issues regarding marketing and sales. This is delegated to him because both of the spheres require extensive knowledge that is explicit to the local market. However, the revenue center manager will not be given control over decision on quantity or product mix. If the manager is given control over these decisions problems can arise (see below).&lt;ref name="casestudyinmarketing"/&gt;

Technological advancements have been able to reduce expenses in revenue centers as well as bring non-traditional (online) revenue centers to non-retail companies that work in manufacturing or service industries. This can be done by setting up websites which offer products directly from the supplier. This reduces cost by shortening the distribution channel and cuts out wholesalers and retailers.&lt;ref name="website"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Revenue Center|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-revenue-center.htm|year=2014|publisher=wiseGEEK|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with Revenue Centers==

One of the biggest problems in a revenue center is that costs are mostly ignored. If costs are not monitored by another division of the business, profits can be hindered. Furthermore, the manager of a revenue center does not have the insight required for marketing decisions, consequently responsibility for a marketing decision cannot be given to a revenue center manager. Setting prices on products or services is an example of revenue center managers being unable to undertake marketing decisions.&lt;ref name="casestudyinmarketing"/&gt;

It is easy to calculate the performance of a revenue center as revenue is the only variable being performed against. However, this means that performance evaluations are also limited to one variable which is usually not enough to see the performance of a business division.&lt;ref name="KinneyRaiborn2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Kinney|author2=Cecily Raiborn|title=Cost Accounting: Foundations and Evolutions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nm3uBQP7cTIC&amp;pg=PA509|accessdate=18 October 2014|date=31 May 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-111-97172-2|page=509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure revenue centers hardly exist. This is due to the fact that costs cannot be completely ignored. Usually (as stated above) revenue center managers control expenses.&lt;ref name="KinneyRaiborn2012"/&gt;

Revenue center managers should not be allowed to make marketing decisions. For example, if a revenue center manager is allowed to set the revenue target, he will maximise revenue. This will cause the marginal revenue to become zero.&lt;ref name="BushJohnston1998"/&gt;

In large companies with multiple products revenue centers will be responsible for meeting revenue target for each product. The problem will arise if all revenues are added together into a total of all products. The revenue manager will then be able to make up any losses in revenue by taking the revenue from the ones that outperformed the targets to the ones that underperformed, thereby causing a loss in overall profits.&lt;ref name="BushJohnston1998"/&gt;

Businesses may decide to open revenue centers when entering new markets or industries. The initial cost of these centers is high and it is highly likely that a lot of time is required in order for those centers to become profitable and cover the start-up expenditures.&lt;ref name="BushJohnston1998"/&gt;

'''Roberto Salas Benedicto''' (April 17, 1917&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; - May 15, 2000)  was a Filipino lawyer, ambassador, diplomat, and banker historically most remembered&lt;ref name="Hau20160408"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www3.grips.ac.jp/~esp/en/event/what-is-%E2%80%9Ccrony-capitalism%E2%80%9D/ |title=What is "Crony Capitalism"? |last=Hau |first=Caroline S. |authorlink=Caroline Hau |date=2016-04-08 |website=National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS) Emerging State Project |publisher=National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies |location=Tokyo, Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Cronies of Ferdinand Marcos|crony]] of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/the-philippines-during-the-martial-law/ |title=It Takes a Village to Loot a Nation: Cronyism and Corruption |website=Martial Law Museum |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benedicto owned Philippine Exchange Company, the ''[[Philippines Daily Express]]'',  [[Radio Philippines Network]], [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation]] and [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]]. Benedicto was the Philippines' Ambassador to Japan from 1972 to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-22/news/mn-269_1_federal-bank|title=Local Bank Known for Ties to the Marcoses|first=JUBE SHIVER|last=Jr|date=22 October 1988|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2018|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the prime of his career, Benedicto's empire consisted of 85 corporations, 106 sugar farms, 14 haciendas, other agricultural lands, 17 radio stations, 16 television stations, 2 telecommunications networks, 7 buildings, 10 vessels and 5 aircraft.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28428684 |title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism |last=Ricardo. |first=Manapat, |date=1991 |publisher=Aletheia Publications |isbn=9719128704 |location=New York |oclc=28428684}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also owned 14 hectares of real estate in Bacolod City, 13.5&amp;nbsp;billion shares in Oriental Petroleum, and membership shares in golf and country clubs estimated at {{US$|491,000}}.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; Overseas, he owned a sugar mill in [[Venezuela]], a trading company in Madrid, bank deposits, mansions, and limousines in [[California]]. Marcos's executive secretary estimated that in 1983, Benedicto's net worth was $800&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Benedicto, born in [[La Carlota, Negros Occidental]] on April 17, 1917,&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;{{rp|page=100}} was a contemporary of Ferdinand Marcos, becoming his classmate and fraternity brother while studying at the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]].&lt;ref name="Crewdson19860323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MathewsAirline"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcos Seizes Airline That Billed Wife|first=Jay|last=Mathews|date=23 April 1978|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Association with Ferdinand Marcos ==
Roberto Benedicto was Marcos's former classmate at the [[University of the Philippines College of Law|UP Law School]], and his [[Upsilon Sigma Phi]] fraternity brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-23/news/8601210600_1_jose-y-campos-eduardo-cojuangco-ferdinand-marcos|title=Marcos Graft Staggering|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;

When Marcos became president, Benedicto became part of his small circle in [[Malacañang Palace|Malacañan]], one of the few with full access even to private quarters.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Garcia2016"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Thirty Years Later ... Catching Up with the Marcos Era Crimes |last=Garcia |first=Myles |year=2016 |publisher=eBookIt.com|ISBN=9781456626501|quote="Although he was not a relative, Benedicto became part of the small Marcos circle in Malacanang and was one of the few with complete access to the president's private quarters" and "From La Carlota, Negros Occidental, Benedicto developed an early friendship with Marcos at the University of the Philippines".}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marcos would eventually give power-of-attorney to Benedicto, allowing him to deal with corporations on the Marcoses' behalf.&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt;  

=== Role in the creation of the Credit Suisse "Saunders Account" ===
It was with Roberto Benedicto's help&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt; that Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos opened their first Swiss Bank accounts in 1968, funneling money which the Swiss Federal Court would later determine to be "of criminal origin".  This was the infamous "Saunders Account" with [[Credit Suisse]], which Ferdinand Marcos signed under the false name of "William Saunders" and which Imelda Marcos signed as "Jane Ryan".&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;

== Role and business interests during the Marcos administration ==
Benedicto's business interests grew significantly when Ferdinand Marcos became president. Marcos appointed him as the Philippines' Ambassador to Japan and put him in charge of the [[Philippine National Bank]] (PNB), the Philippines' largest state-owned bank.&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt; 

=== Chairman of the Philippine National Bank ===
In his role as PNB Chairman, Benedicto permitted huge loans for business of other cronies and associates. He used PNB to grant loans for his shipping company, Northern Lines, and his sugar business.&lt;ref name="Crewdson19860323"/&gt; His role as PNB Chair enabled him to gain control of additional banks, and overcome business competitors by dictating the terms of loans.&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt; 

=== Philippine Ambassador to Japan ===
{{main|Marcos Japanese ODA scandal}}
Benedicto's appointment as Japanese ambassador allowed him to develop high-level contacts in Japan. He secured more than {{US$|550}}M in World War&amp;nbsp;II reparations, which he allegedly used to promote his private interests.&lt;ref name="Crewdson19860323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt;

Working with President Marcos, they ratified the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation between Japan and the Philippines, which gave Japan [[Most favoured nation|most-favored nation]] status. This agreement gave Japan an advantage in using the country's natural resources, which was the primary reason the Philippine Senate did not ratify the treaty for 13 years.&lt;ref name="Crewdson19860323"/&gt;

His ambassadorship also gave him insider knowledge regarding the business interests of the Japanese, which allowed him to arrange lucrative joint-venture operations between Japanese corporations and his own.&lt;ref name="Crewdson19860323"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-23/news/8601210600_1_jose-y-campos-eduardo-cojuangco-ferdinand-marcos |title=Marcos Graft Staggering:Investigators Trace Billions in Holdings |last=Crewdson |first=John |date=1986-03-23 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2018-05-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

When the Marcoses were exiled to the [[United States]] in February 1986,&lt;ref name="JapanForeignRelationsinAsia"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=cBFFDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT443&amp;lpg=PT443&amp;dq=Marcos+ODA+scandals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sC-HjBNB-a&amp;sig=WQ-gr_AJgc0X8u2NQVTJNcahpDw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOvde_3f_bAhVYbysKHTcwAIYQ6AEITjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcos%20ODA%20scandals&amp;f=false|title=Japan's Foreign Relations in Asia|last=Brown|first=James D.J.|last2=Kingston|first2=Jeff|date=2018-01-02|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351678575|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American authorities confiscated papers that they brought with them. The confiscated documents revealed that since the 1970s, Marcos and his associates received commissions of 10 to 15 percent of Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund loans from about fifty Japanese contractors. These revelations became very controversial and became known in Japan as the {{Nihongo|''[[Marukosu giwaku]]''|マルコス疑惑}} ({{lang-en|Marcos scandal}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=gL-HDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=Marcos+ODA+scandals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m2dga16nUR&amp;sig=2LntN4uZtW4mKE7XMDmVLS9FK_Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOvde_3f_bAhVYbysKHTcwAIYQ6AEIXDAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcos%20ODA%20scandals&amp;f=false|title=Civil Society in Japan: The Growing Role of NGO’s in Tokyo’s Aid and Development Policy|last=Hirata|first=K.|date=2002-08-16|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230109162|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lessons from the Marcos scandal were among the reasons why Japan created its 1992 ODA Charter.&lt;ref name="JapanForeignRelationsinAsia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsunekawa2014"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Tsunekawa |first=Keiichi |date=February 2014 |title=Objectives and Institutions for Japan's Official Development Assistance (ODA) : Evolution and Challenges |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268503601_Objectives_and_institutions_for_Japan%27s_official_development_assistance_ODA_Evolution_and_challenges |journal=JICA Research Institute Working Papers No.66. |volume=No. 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sugar monopoly ===
{{main|Monopolies in the Philippines (1965–1986)#Sugar industry}}
The most-notable expansion in Benedicto's business holdings during the Marcos dictatorship&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt; was in his establishment of a monopoly in the Philippines' sugar industry beginning in 1974, which earned him the monicker of "Sugar King".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/05/world/philippine-planters-and-workers-fight-sugar-controls.html|title=PHILIPPINE PLANTERS AND WORKERS FIGHT SUGAR CONTROLS|last=Kamm|first=Henry|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcos's [[Proclamation No. 1081|proclamation of martial law]] allowed Benedicto to take control of the Philippine Exchange Company (Philex), which monopolized local hacienderos' (sugar barons) international trade.  Benedicto used Philex to buy cheap sugar from local producers and sell it abroad for large profits. Aided by Marcos's presidential decrees under martial law, Benedicto later seized control of the Philippine Sugar Commission, which accounted for 27% of the Philippines' dollar earnings at the time. In turn, a big segment of the profits from this sugar monopoly was deposited in a "special fund" which was "subject to the disposition of the president for public purposes."&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"/&gt;

=== Media monopoly ===
{{main|Monopolies in the Philippines (1965–1986)#Broadcast media}}
Martial law also gave Benedicto a media and telecommunications monopoly in the Philippines. Before martial law, he had transformed a small radio station that he owned into the Kanlaon Broadcasting System (KBS) (now [[Radio Philippines Network]]), a media empire that consisted of three television stations, 15 radio stations and a national newspaper called the ''[[Philippines Daily Express|Daily Express]]''.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; 

In 1972, news and media outlets were forced to cease operations, and their facilities were taken over by the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/817651/september-1972-recalling-the-last-days-and-hours-of-democracy|title=September 1972: Recalling the last days and hours of democracy|last=Generalao|first=Kate Pedroso, Minerva|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Benedicto was allowed to continue his broadcasts, to serve as the voice of the Marcos dictatorship. His newspaper, the ''Daily Express'', was the first to put out an edition after martial law was announced, three days later on September 25.&lt;ref name="MelaniePinlac20070901"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cmfr-phil.org/media-ethics-responsibility/ethics/marcos-and-the-press/ |title=Marcos and the Press |last=Pinlac |first=Melanie Y. |date=2007-09-01 |website=CMFR |language=en-us |access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This monopoly secured Benedicto's political ties with Marcos and generated income as the owner of the sole running television and radio stations. Benedicto assigned Enrique Romualdez, a relative of the first lady, as chief editor of the paper to ensure that it held the views of the regime.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; {{rp|page=129}}

KBS was the only full-color TV channel in the country, and it was later taken over by [[Imee Marcos]]. Benedicto expanded his media business by acquiring [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] (IBC) which had five television stations, and nine radio stations.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; His growing media empire received government favors from the Marcos administration, with the president granting several Letters of Instruction (LOIs) for Benedicto's benefit. In 1977, Marcos issued LOI&amp;nbsp;640 to allow [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation]], one of Benedicto's companies,&amp;nbsp;to import $3&amp;nbsp;million worth of TV transmission equipment and facilities, without paying taxes or tariffs. The LOI also allowed tax-free importation of $15&amp;nbsp;million worth of 12-inch black-and-white television sets for the next five years, and allowed Banahaw to commission a local company to assemble the television sets, justifying that these sets would be distributed to "critical areas" at lower prices. The LOI then instructed government agencies to market the TV sets. The ministries of Public Information, National Defense, Education and Culture were instructed to use the sets for their public information and educational projects.&lt;ref name="officialgazette19771215"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1977/12/15/letter-of-instruction-no-640-s-1977/|title=Letter of Instruction No. 640, s. 1977 |work=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Marcos issued LOI&amp;nbsp;640-A, to extend the scope and duration of the earlier order. The new instruction directed government ministries to distribute Benedicto's television sets in the countryside areas "on matters pertaining to peace and order". Due to the tax breaks, Benedicto was able to sell 12-inch black-and-white television sets cheaper than the competitors who had to pay taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1981/01/05/executive-order-no-640-a-s-1981/|title=Executive Order No. 640-A, s. 1981 {{!}} GOVPH|work=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Consumer Electronic Products Manufacturers Association (CEPMA) complained that the television sets meant for rural areas were being sold in Manila, greatly affecting their market.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;{{rp|page=130}}

==Compromise deal with the Philippine government ==
Benedicto entered into a compromise agreement with the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] in 1990, surrendering about {{US$|16}}&amp;nbsp;million worth of Swiss bank deposits, shares in 32 corporations including "100% of the California Overseas Bank shares", cash dividends in his firms, and 51 percent of his agricultural land holdings.&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/123667-marcos-cronies-compromise |title=Search for Marcos' wealth: Compromising with cronies |last=Lustre |first=Philip M., Jr. |date=2016-02-25 |work=Rappler |access-date=2018-07-19 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Benedicto died on May 15, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2010/may2010/gr_141508_2010.html|title=ROBERTO S. BENEDICTO and TRADERS ROYAL BANK, vs. MANUEL LACSON and others|publisher=The Lawphil Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rollover''''' is a 1981 American [[political thriller|political thriller film]] directed by [[Alan J. Pakula]] and starring [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' film review; December 9, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for a [[Razzie Award]] for Worst Actor for Kristofferson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=John|title=The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst |year=2005|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=0-446-69334-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Lee Winters is the widow of the Chairman and primary stockholder of Winterchem Enterprises, a [[chemical]] company, who is attempting to obtain financing of the purchase of a processing plant in [[Spain]], while trying to determine why her husband was murdered.

Apparently, her late husband discovered some damning information about an Account Number 21214, a secret [[slush fund]] involving [[asset]] transfers.

Respected financier Hubbell Smith takes over as president of Borough National Bank at the request of First New York Bank [[chairman]] Maxwell Emery, in an attempt to have Smith discover the financial status of Borough National.

Smith discovers that the bank isn't just in trouble, it's essentially so insolvent that it can't even pay its next dividend.  It needs to find a customer who needs to borrow a lot of money and either loan the money or act as broker in the deal in order to raise some quick cash and stave off intervention by the [[Federal Reserve]].

One of the largest customers of Borough National is Winterchem, but because of federal lending limits, the bank "can't loan them a dime" but conceivably could be involved in brokering a deal between Winterchem and some other lender capable of loaning the approximately $500 million needed to buy the plant, and the bank would receive a 1% finder's fee for making the arrangement.

Smith becomes involved, both financially and romantically, with Winters in her attempts to finance the purchase of the petrochemical plant and in the discovery of the mystery of account 21214. They finally do so by brokering a deal with some Arab investors who take control of her stock as security for the transaction.

Smith later discovers that account 21214 is actually a slush fund where Emery is moving money belonging to the Arabs into gold as a safe haven against potential losses if the dollar collapses. The Arabs are extremely worried that if anyone finds out, their assets will vanish in a public [[panic]] as American currency becomes worthless.

Winters also discovers the Arabs are behind account 21214, and wants her stock back in exchange for her silence; she has overheard part of Smith's conversation with Emery and mistakenly believes he was double-crossing her. A fake [[Limousine|limo]] driver who is actually working for the [[Arab]] investors tries to kidnap her with the intent of killing her—as it turns out they did to her husband—to prevent her from disclosing what she knows, and when the attempt on her life fails, the Arabs panic and pull all of their money out of every bank in [[United States|America]], and possibly the entire world.

The globe is gripped by panic and rioting as people discover all of their money is now worthless. Emery is shown in his office - dead, an apparent suicide.  The economic crisis paralyzes the world, but by spilling over boundaries between east and west blocs, and between developing and industrialized nations, it also unites the world in common cause.  In the penultimate scene, workers at Borough National stand idle while listening to a report of the growing economic crisis.  As the camera pans across the trading floor of the bank, the viewer sees that it's now empty of workers, the lights off, the desks and machines covered - completely inactive.  Only Smith remains.  Winters joins him in the final scene.  Smith tells her that he's looking for a way to start anew.  Winters offers to become his partner.

On 29 June 1925, the bill to incorporate the '''Rubber Research Institute of Malaya''' was passed by the government. Dr G. Bryce was appointed the first Director of the institute on 26 September 1926. On 31 October 1926, its laboratory at Petaling Estate was closed down and from 1 November 1926, the institute took over the equipment of the Rubber Growers' Association. Also in 1926, the institute made a request to the government for the temporary laboratory building of the institute at [[Jalan Damansara|Damansara Road]] in [[Selangor]]. The request was granted and the building was leased for five years. In 1936, the institute decided to relocate to a new building at [[Jalan Ampang|Ampang Road]]. The building was officiated by [[Sultan of Selangor|Selangor Sultan]] [[Sulaiman of Selangor|Sulaiman]] on 22 April 1936 and the institute restarted its operation on 19 May 1937.&lt;ref name="lgm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgm.gov.my/general/rrim70yrs.aspx|publisher=lgm.gov.my|title=General Information - The Origin and Establishment of RRIM|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insulflex.com.my/about_us/certificates/certificate_231110/Rubber_Research_Institute_ASTMD1171_(Ozone_Test).pdf|date=27 April 1995|title=Test Report|website=Insulflex|publisher=Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanley E. Bogdan''' (December 16, 1918 – March 27, 2011) was the founder of S.E. Custom Built, a company dedicated to the handmade construction of fly reels.  Bogdan was born in Nashua, NH and lived there throughout his entire life.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Mitch, ["Stanley Bogdan, Maker of Much-Coveted Fly Reels, is Dead at 92"], "New York Times", April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  He became interested in fly fishing at an early age when he began receiving outdated copies of a hunting and fishing magazine from a local sports retailer.  At age 13, Bogdan was tying his own flies and would then become immersed in the sport.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon graduating high school, Bogdan began work at Rollins Engine Company, a local engines manufacturer in Nashua.  Later on, while working as a machinist, he began constructing some of the first prototypes for his reels.  Stanley Bogdan died on March 27, 2011 and is survived by his son Stephen, and his daughter Cheryl Doughty.  His wife Phyllis died in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Mitch, ["Stanley Bogdan, Maker of Much-Coveted Fly Reels, is Dead at 92"], "New York Times", April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  While standing on the shore of one of his favorite rivers; The Grand Cascapedia, Mr Bogdan smiled and said: "I'd die if I could not fish anymore" shortly after Mr. Bogdan could no longer fish he succumbed to pancreatic cancer. 2009

==S.E. Custom Built==
S.E. Custom Built fly reels are primarily known for their ability to greatly reduce drag.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Mitch, ["Stanley Bogdan, Maker of Much-Coveted Fly Reels, is Dead at 92"], "New York Times", April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  This is mostly attributed to Bogdan's unique concept of the double-break shoe, known as the hallmark of any Bogdan reel.  The company is mostly focused on the production of salmon reels, however there have been a few trout reel models made.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Company History===
It wasn't until 1955 that Bogdan sold his first set of reels.  At the New England Sportsmen's Show, he received $150 from Julian Crandall for a set of 10 reels (one of which Crandall gave to professional baseball player, [[Ted Williams]]).  That same year Bogdan would make a deal with [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]], one of the day's leading marketers of sport's goods, for a set of 40 reels.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The deal provided that:
#Three different models were to be made: 100M, 200M, 300M
#An identification code was to be stamped on each reel foot
#Anodized gloss black for the reel feet and handles to be used instead of the aluminum serpentine
#The reels would sell at $100 retail price granting Bogdan 60% of all sales&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, Bogdan would retire work at the factories and begin working entirely on his reel making company.  From 1957 to 1977, S.E. Custom Built would have a relationship with [[Orvis]] including a deal similar to the one with [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]].  The [[Orvis]] reels differed slightly because they decided to use Bogdan's original aluminum serpentine colors.  Bogdan reels have since been marketed by many of the industry's major tackle merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually demands came for a trout reel in the Bogdan style, so S.E. Custom Built released a 5-weight single-action, non-adjustable, pawl-drag reel in 1976.  Demands would come for similar 3-, 4-, and 6-weight reels as well.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Bogdan, Stanley's son, would join S.E. Custom Built in September 1973.  Stephen purchased the company and became the sole owner in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Mitch, ["Stanley Bogdan, Maker of Much-Coveted Fly Reels, is Dead at 92"], "New York Times", April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reels===
Two qualities of Bogdan reels that they are most known for are Bogdan's signature double-brake shoe and the 10 position lever provided that is used to regulate drag.  They also have black anodized side plates with a pale gold anodized frame.&lt;ref&gt;Marchant, Douglas, [http://westslopefly.com/reels/bogdan.cfm "The Bogdan Story"], "West Slope"&lt;/ref&gt;  The prices of a Bogdan reel range from $1,500 to $2,400, depending on the type of fish one plans to catch with it.  Each Bogdan reel was handcrafted by either Stanley or Stephen.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyard, Graydon R., "Bogdan", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  These reels are in very high demand and it is not uncommon for one to wait several years to receive their order.  Avid reel collector and friend of Bogdan's, Douglas Marchant says, "Since each reel is the product of very intensive hand labor, forecasting delivery is virtually impossible."&lt;ref&gt;Marchant, Douglas, [http://westslopefly.com/reels/bogdan.cfm "The Bogdan Story"], "West Slope"&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogdan's reels are owned and praised by some of fly fishing's most notable figures, such as:
*John Olin
*Lee Wulff
*Julian Crandall
*Ted Bates
*R.L. Haig Brown
* Sergey Shakirtov
* Paul Lucas

A '''trade name''', '''trading name''', or '''business name''' is a [[pseudonym]] frequently used by companies to operate under a name different from their registered, [[Legal name (business)|legal name]]. The term for this type of alternative name is a "fictitious" business name. Registering the fictitious name with the relevant government body is often required.

In a number of countries, the phrase "'''trading as'''" (abbreviated to '''t/a''') is used to designate a trade name. In the [[United States]], the phrase "'''doing business as'''" (abbreviated to '''DBA''', '''dba''', '''d.b.a.''' or '''d/b/a''') is used,&lt;ref name="Pinkerton" /&gt; among others, such as '''assumed business name'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Search |work=SOSNC.gov |publisher=[[North Carolina Secretary of State]] |date=2018 |access-date=June 20, 2018 |url= https://www.sosnc.gov/search/index/corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Canada]],  "'''operating as'''" (abbreviated to '''o/a''') and "'''trading as'''" (abbreviated to '''T/A''') are used, although "doing business as" is also sometimes used.&lt;ref name="business-registration"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://businessregistration.ca/business-registration/ | title=Business Registration | publisher=BusinessRegistration.ca | date=2015 | accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A company typically uses a trade name to conduct business using a simpler name rather than using their formal and often lengthier name. Trade names are also used when a preferred name cannot be registered, often because it may already be registered or is too similar to a name that is already registered.

==Legal aspects==
Fictitious business names do not create separate legal entities.&lt;ref name="Pinkerton"&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12111403894102280465 Pinkerton's, Inc. v. Superior Court]'', 49 Cal. App. 4th 1342, 1348-49, 57 Cal. Rptr. 2d 356, 360 (1996) (collecting cases and explaining "doing business as" phrase).&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between a registered legal name and a fictitious business name, or trade name, is important because fictitious business names may not always identify the entity that is [[Legal liability|legally responsible]]. Legal agreements such as [[contracts]] are normally made using the registered legal name of the business; and the legal name must be used whenever a business sues or is being sued.

In English, trade names are generally treated as proper nouns.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 57. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By country ==
===Canada===
In some Canadian [[jurisdiction]]s, such as [[Ontario]], when a businessperson writes a trade name on a contract, invoice, or cheque, he or she must also add the legal name of the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw

[[Numbered company|Numbered companies]] will very often operate as something other than their legal name, which is unrecognizable to the public.

===Chile===
In [[Chile]], a trade name is known as a ''nombre de fantasía'' ('fantasy' or 'fiction' name), and the legal name of business is called a ''razón social'' (social name).

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], a trade name is known as a ''nome fantasia'' ('fantasy' or 'fiction' name), and the legal name of business is called ''razão social'' (social name).

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], the word {{nihongo|[[yagō]]|屋号}} is used.

=== Singapore ===
In [[Singapore]], there is no filing requirement for a "trading as" name, however, there are requirements for disclosure of the underlying business or company's registered name and unique entity number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifaq.gov.sg/askuen/apps/fcd_faqmain.aspx?qst=hRhkP9BzcBImsx2TBbssMsxu7lqt6UJK70a1wAEVmyczNbWS3iHCOd+9jp6z/tCyBUd289/q7wUH3RZ2aKgTzj2xfxhMmzH+sJebak7+y+euidLTw6YNGH9AVCG9zrTcmj5OKSbphKDqoIqjskmydEdqLf5ri0s08vP7byt+oZ5ht92VcG1hl8wvrM0yxnGwpgr74A91GaesKfjj0EYx4QavqIT/OvTw|title=Govt iFAQ|website=www.ifaq.gov.sg|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, there is no filing requirement for a "trading as" name, however, there are requirements for disclosure of the owner's true name and some restrictions on the use of certain names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/gbhtml/gp1.shtml#ch10 Companies House Booklet GP1, Chapter 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In several U.S. states, DBAs are officially referred to using another term.  [[Oregon]] uses '''Assumed Business Names''';&lt;ref&gt;[http://egov.sos.state.or.us/br/!PKG_BC1_WEB_INTERVIEW.DISPLAY_FAQ?p_current_faqcode=DOBIZ&amp;p_current_expanded_id=10#QID10  Oregon Business Information Center FAQ] from the Oregon Secretary of State&lt;/ref&gt; Washington calls DBAs '''trade names''';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.wa.gov/business/faqtradename.html Washington State Department of Licensing FAQ: Trade name registration] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606082016/http://www.dol.wa.gov/business/faqtradename.html |date=2013-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; other states refer to '''trade styles''' or '''fictitious business names'''.

For [[consumer protection]] purposes, many U.S. jurisdictions require businesses operating with fictitious names to file a DBA statement, though names including the first and last name of the owner may be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doing Business As: What Is It and Do You Need It?; Freshbooks Blog May 7, 2013|url=http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2013/05/07/doing-business-as/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also reduces the possibility of two local businesses operating under the same name, although some jurisdictions do not provide exclusivity for  a name, or may allow more than one party to register the same name. Note, though, that this is not a substitute for filing a [[trademark]] application. A DBA filing carries no legal weight in establishing trademark rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protecting Your Trademark|url=http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/BasicFacts.pdf|work=booklet|publisher=US Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., trademark rights are acquired by use in commerce, but there can be substantial benefits to filing a trademark application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanson|first=Mary|title=Corporate Names, Trade Names, Trademarks, and Fictitious Names|url=http://bizadvisor.com/NamesTrademarks.htm|publisher=The Business Advisor|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sole proprietors are the most common users of DBAs.  Sole proprietors are individual business owners who run their businesses themselves, and are typically newer to the small business game. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Since most people in these circumstances use a business name other than their own name, {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} it's often necessary for them to get DBAs.

Generally, a DBA must be registered with a local or state government, or both, depending on the jurisdiction. For example, California, Texas and Virginia require a DBA to be registered with each county (or [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] in the case of Virginia) where the owner does business. Maryland and Colorado have DBAs registered with a state agency. And Virginia requires corporations and LLCs to file a copy of their registration with the county or city to also be registered with the State Corporation Commission.

DBA statements are often used in conjunction with a [[franchising|franchise]].  The franchisee will have a legal name under which it may sue and be sued, but will conduct business under the franchiser's [[brand name]] (which the public would recognize).  A typical real-world example can be found in a well-known pricing [[Mistake (contract law)|mistake]] case, ''Donovan v. RRL Corp.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/26C4t261.htm 26 Cal. 4th 261] (2001), where the named defendant, RRL Corporation, was a [[Lexus]] [[Car dealerships in North America|car dealership]] doing business as "Lexus of Westminster", but remaining a separate legal entity from Lexus, a division of [[Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.]]

In [[California]], filing a DBA statement also requires that a notice of the fictitious name be published in local [[newspaper]]s for some set period of time to inform the public of the owner's intent to operate under an [[assumed name]]. The intention of the law is to protect the public from fraud, by compelling the business owner to first file or register his fictitious business name with the county clerk, and then making a further public record of it by publishing it in a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Publication Requirements For DBA in Los Angeles|url=http://www.signaturefiling.com/blog/dba-filing-county/los-angeles-dba-filing/|website=Signature Filing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other states, such as [[Illinois]], require print notices as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2299&amp;ChapterID=65|title=805 ILCS 405/  Assumed Business Name Act.|website=www.ilga.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
