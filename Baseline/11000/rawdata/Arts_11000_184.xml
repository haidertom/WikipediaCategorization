'''''A Book of Wisdom and Lies''''' ({{lang-ka|წიგნი სიბრძნე სიცრუისა}}) is a collection of fables and tales written by  [[Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani]] between 1686 and 1695.

Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani was 20–25 years old he wrote a collection of fables and tales “Sibrdzne Sitsruisa” (“A Book of Wisdom and Lies”), which is a fruit of his observation over life. The reader feels how ably, deliberately and naturally the great creator interlaces some idea, intelligence and results of living observations in humans and animals. He knows the human nature, all its strong and weak points well. He describes various sides of human actions; he gives answers to many questions and you realize that a human should create kindness in his life.

One of the most famous works by the 17th-18th Century Georgian man of letters, containing Sufic and other narratives, tales and anecdotes. "Racy, clear and humorous--though the serious parts also read convincingly."&lt;ref&gt;http://jrumblr.com/2435469.A_Book_of_Wisdom_and_Lies.html&lt;/ref&gt;—Professor [[David Marshall Lang|David Lang]].

[[File:Herakles Laomedon MCA Valle Sabbia.jpg|thumb|300px|Unusually ambitious [[Samian ware]] flask from Southern Gaul around 100 AD. [[Herucles]] is killing [[Laomedon]].]] 
[[Pottery]] was produced in enormous quantities in [[ancient Rome]], mostly for utilitarian purposes. It is found all over the former [[Roman Empire]] and beyond. [[Monte Testaccio]] is a huge [[mound|waste mound]] in Rome made almost entirely of broken [[amphorae]] used for transporting and storing liquids and other products – in this case probably mostly Spanish olive oil, which was landed nearby, and was the main fuel for lighting, as well as its use in the kitchen and washing in the [[Thermae|baths]].

It is usual to divide Roman domestic pottery broadly into coarse wares and fine wares, the former being the everyday pottery jars, dishes and bowls that were used for cooking or the storage and transport of foods and other goods, and in some cases also as tableware, and which were often made and bought locally. Fine wares were serving vessels or tableware used for more formal dining, and are usually of more decorative and elegant appearance. Some of the most important of these were made at specialised pottery workshops, and were often traded over substantial distances, not only within, but also between, different provinces of the Roman Empire. For example, dozens of different types of [[Roman Britain|British]] coarse and fine wares were produced locally,&lt;ref&gt;[http://potsherd.net/atlas/Class/COAR Potsherd] British coarse wares (accessed November 9, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; yet many other classes of pottery were also imported from elsewhere in the Empire. The manufacture of fine wares such as ''{{lang|la|[[terra sigillata]]}}'' took place in large workshop complexes that were organised along industrial lines and produced highly standardised products that lend themselves well to precise and systematic classification.

There is no direct Roman equivalent to the artistically central [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase-painting of ancient Greece]], and few [[Ceramic art|objects of outstanding artistic interest]] have survived, but there is a great deal of fine tableware, and very many small figures, often incorporated into oil lamps or similar objects, and often with religious or erotic themes. Roman burial customs varied over time and space, so vessels deposited as [[grave good]]s, the usual source of complete ancient pottery vessels, are not always abundant, though all Roman sites produce plenty of broken potsherds. "Fine" rather than luxury pottery is the main strength of Roman pottery, unlike [[Roman glass]], which the elite often used alongside gold or silver tableware, and which could be extremely extravagant and expensive. It is clear from the quantities found that fine pottery was used very widely in both social and geographic terms. The more expensive pottery tended to use [[relief]] decoration, usually moulded, rather than colour, and often copied shapes and decoration from the more prestigious metalwork. Especially in the Eastern Empire, local traditions continued, hybridizing with Roman styles to varying extents. From the 3rd century the quality of fine pottery steadily declined, partly because of economic and political disturbances, and because glassware was replacing pottery for drinking cups (the rich had always preferred silver in any case).

Fired clay or [[terracotta]] was also widely employed in the Roman period for architectural purposes, as structural bricks and tiles, and occasionally as architectural decoration, and for the manufacture of small statuettes and lamps. These are not normally classified under the heading 'pottery' by archaeologists, but the terracottas and lamps will be included in this article. Pottery is a key material in the dating and interpretation of archaeological sites from the Neolithic period onwards, and has been minutely studied by archaeologists for generations. In the Roman period, ceramics were produced and used in enormous quantities, and the literature on the subject, in numerous languages, is very extensive.

[[File:Roman pottery from Britain.jpg|thumb|450px| A selection of pottery found in Roman Britain. The assemblage includes [[Black-burnished ware]] jars, a Rusticated Ware jar, a Central Gaulish Colour-Coated Ware beaker, Trier Black-slipped Ware with white trailed decoration,  [[Nene Valley Colour Coated Ware]], a coarse ware cheese press and other fine wares.]]

==Fine wares==

===Terra sigillata or red-gloss wares===
[[File:Céramique sigillée Metz 100109 3.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Red gloss ''{{lang|la|[[terra sigillata]]}}'' ware with relief decoration. Compare the plain unglossed restored section to the left.]]
The designation 'fine wares' is used by archaeologists for Roman pottery intended for serving food and drink at table, as opposed to pots designed for cooking and food preparation, storage, transport and other purposes. Although there were many types of fine pottery, for example, drinking vessels in very delicate and thin-walled wares, and pottery finished with vitreous lead glazes, the major class that comes first to mind is the Roman red-gloss ware of Italy and Gaul make, and widely traded, from the 1st century BC to the late 2nd century AD, and traditionally known as ''{{lang|la|[[terra sigillata]]}}''. These vessels have fine, fairly hard and well-fired buff to pink fabrics, with a naturally glossy surface slip ranging in colour from light orange to quite a bright red. The variations in the colour and texture of both body fabric and slip, as well as the vessel-shapes and the designs on the decorated forms can enable a trained student to identify source, date and often individual workshop quite accurately. [[Arretine ware]], made at [[Arezzo]] in [[Tuscany]], was the pre-eminent type of fine pottery in the 1st century BC and early 1st century AD, and was succeeded by samian ware, manufactured in a number of centres in Gaul, modern France and Germany. However the definition of all these terms has varied and evolved over the many generations during which the material has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;Varying definitions of some of these terms are discussed at ''{{lang|la|[[terra sigillata]]}}''.&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, red-gloss wares have much in common with earlier Greek painted pottery, but the decorated forms employ raised, relief decoration rather than painting.

[[African Red Slip]] (ARS) ware belonged to the same tradition, and continued to be made much later than Italian and Gaulish sigillata, right through to the [[Muslim conquests|Islamic conquest]].&lt;ref&gt;King, 181–185. Essential detailed works are: John P. Hayes, ''Late Roman Pottery'', London 1972, and ''Supplement to Late Roman Pottery'', London 1980&lt;/ref&gt; ARS in turn influenced the production of [[Phocaean red slip]], which is common in the Eastern Mediterranean and also appeared occasionally as far west as Southern France and Britain.

The production of related types of wares existed in [[Asia Minor]] and in other eastern regions of the Empire (Eastern Sigillata wares), while the Iberian provinces also had local industries producing terra sigillata hispanica, which had some similarities with the Gaulish products.

Most of these wares were widely distributed and produced on an industrial scale (the largest kilns could fire up to 40,000 pieces at a time&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novaesium.de/artikel/keramik.htm JP Hayes article from the Grove Dictionary of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; ), and undoubtedly using a high degree of specialisation within the workshops. The names of many potters and factory-owners are known from the potters' marks frequently applied to fine wares, and can be highly informative. Cnaius Ateius was an especially prominent producer at Arezzo, but wares with his stamps can be shown by modern analysis of their clay to have been produced in [[Pisa]] in Tuscany, and at branch factories at both [[Lyon]] and [[La Graufesenque]] in modern France. However, the interpretation of name-stamps can be more complex than it appears at first sight. Bold name-stamps visible in decorated areas advertise the name of the factory, but the names of individual artisans working within the pottery, the bowl-makers, appear on plain vessels, while the moulds for decorated bowls were also sometimes signed freehand by the mould-makers, and their signatures also sometimes appear on finished vessels. Theoretically, a decorated vessel might bear the mould-maker's name, that of the bowl-maker or finisher (for example, on the rim), and the 'brand-name' of the factory in the decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Johns 1963, 288–289&lt;/ref&gt; The use of slave labour in the Italian workshops is unproven, though some names are certainly of ''{{lang|la|liberti}}'' (freedmen, that is, freed former slaves). The site of La Graufesenque in South Gaul, near [[Millau]], has been extensively studied and excavated.&lt;ref&gt;Wisseman 1994, 37&lt;/ref&gt; Its products had an immensely wide distribution in the later 1st century AD, and sherds have been found from India to the Sudan and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://potsherd.net/atlas/Ware/SGTS Potsherd], La Graufesenque&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Terra Sigillata Museum Formschuesseln.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Moulds for ''{{lang|la|terra sigillata}}'' bowls of form Dragendorff 37, made at the East Gaulish factory of Rheinzabern]]

In 1895, the German scholar [[Hans Dragendorff]] produced a classification of vessel shapes in Roman red gloss pottery that is still used (as e.g. "Drag. 27" or "Dr.27" to refer to the small biconvex-profiled cup).&lt;ref&gt;Dragendorff 1895; [http://potsherd.net/atlas/types/sigillata/gallery Potsherd] has a searchable database by Dragendorff and other classification systems.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars added to his numbered forms, and some archaeologists working on the products of specific manufacturing sites, or the finds from important excavations, initiated their own typologies, so that there are now many other classification systems for Arretine and samian, as there are, indeed, for other classes of Roman pottery, such as the Hayes numbers for African Red Slip forms. Other numbering systems used with Italian and Gaulish sigillata include those of Déchelette, Knorr, Curle, Walters, Loeschcke, Ritterling and Ludowici, to name but a few.&lt;ref&gt;Overviews of the most important types may be obtained by referring to the classic work by Oswald and Pryce in 1920. By far the most useful modern introduction in English to the study of Gaulish samian ware, applicable to all Roman provinces where it is found, not only to Britain, is ''Roman Samian pottery in Britain'', by Peter Webster, (York 1996), {{ISBN|1-872414-56-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common method of making relief decoration on the surface of an open ''{{lang|la|terra sigillata}}'' vessel was to throw a pottery bowl whose interior profile corresponded with the desired form of the final vessel's exterior. The internal surface was then decorated using individual positive stamps (''{{lang|fr|poinçons}}''), usually themselves made of fired clay, or small wheels bearing repeated motifs, such as the [[ovolo]] (egg-and-tongue) design that often formed the upper border of the decoration. Details could also be added by hand with a stylus. When the decoration was complete in intaglio on the interior, the mould was dried and fired in the usual way, and was subsequently used for shaping bowls. As the bowl dried, it shrank sufficiently to remove it from the mould, after which the finishing processes were carried out, such as the shaping or addition of a foot-ring and the finishing of the rim. The details varied according to the form.&lt;ref&gt;Webster 1996, 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; The completed bowl could then be slipped, dried again, and fired. Closed forms, such as jugs and jars, were seldom decorated in relief using moulds, though some vessels of this type were made at La Graufesenque by making the upper and lower parts of the vessel separately in moulds and joining them at the point of widest diameter. Relief-decoration of tall vases or jars was usually achieved by using moulded appliqué motifs (sprigs) and/or [[barbotine]] decoration (slip-trailing). The latter technique was particularly popular at the East Gaulish workshops of [[Rheinzabern]], and was also widely used on other pottery types.
[[File:Roman pottery African Red Slip.jpg|thumb|A typical plain African Red Slip dish with simple rouletted decoration. 4th century AD.]]

Plain sigillata table vessels, which included large platters, shallow dishes in several sizes, slightly deeper bowls, and small cups, were made on the wheel using a range of templates to create very precise profiles. The sizes were also standardised, which would have facilitated the firing, storage and transport of the huge numbers that were made. The evolution in forms matches in many respects that seen in silver and [[Roman glass|glass table vessels]] of the same periods, and the precise forms can sometimes be closely dated. The forms archaeologically classified as 'plain' do sometimes bear decoration of a simple kind, often in the form of a ring of rouletting within the flat interior base of a dish. Plain wares also often bear name-stamps.&lt;ref&gt;Arretine stamps are catalogued in Oxé and Comfort in 1968. Gaulish stamps were originally listed by Felix Oswald, ''Index of potters' stamps on terra sigillata, 'samian ware','' privately published, 1931, now in process of revision and completion by the late Brian Hartley and Brenda Dickinson, ''Names on terra sigillata: an index of makers' stamps and signatures on Gallo-Roman terra sigillata (samian ware), Vol. 1 (A to AXO), Vol.2 (B to CEROTCUS)'', 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-905670-16-1}} and {{ISBN|978-1-905670-17-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARS ([[African Red Slip]]) ware was the most widely distributed representative of the sigillata tradition in the late-Roman period. (Occasional imports of ARS have been found as far afield as Britain in the 5th–6th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Tyers 1996, 80–82&lt;/ref&gt; It was manufactured in the province of {{lang|la|[[Africa Proconsularis]]}} (approximately modern [[Tunisia]]), and similar forms and fabrics were made for more local distribution in Egypt, which had its own very active and diverse ceramic traditions in the Roman period. A wide range of bowls, dishes and flagons were made in ARS, but the technique of making entire relief-decorated vessels in moulds was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;For the detailed typology and distribution maps, see Hayes 1972 and Hayes 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, appliqué motifs were frequently used where decoration in relief was required, separately made and applied to the vessel before drying and firing. Stamped motifs were also a favoured form of decoration, and in the later centuries, Christian subjects and symbols often appear.

===Other fine wares===
[[File:Roman pottery barbotine cup.JPG|thumb|150px|A cup, 65&amp;nbsp;mm high, made at Aswan, Egypt, in the 1st–2nd century AD, and decorated with barbotine patterns]]

Some of the shapes of Arretine plain wares were quite closely copied in the later 1st century BC and early 1st century AD in a class of pottery made in north-east Gaul and known as Gallo-Belgic ware.&lt;ref&gt;Tyers 1996, 161–166&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these plates and dishes in red-slipped (''{{lang|la|terra rubra}}'') and black-slipped (''{{lang|la|terra nigra}}'') fabrics bear potters' stamps. Other fine, thin-walled flagons, drinking beakers, bowls and dishes were made locally in most regions of the Roman Empire, including frontier provinces such as Britain: for example, Romano-British 'colour-coated' (slipped) wares made at Colchester and in the [[River Nene|Nene Valley]] belong to that classification. Several of the pots to the right of the group photograph in the lead section of this article are Nene Valley wares, including the large black beaker decorated with a lively hunting scene of hounds and hares in the barbotine technique.&lt;ref&gt;Tyers 1996, 166–175. This reference work, much of which is also available online at [http://potsherd.net/ Potsherd "Atlas of Roman pottery"], gives a very full picture of the complexity of pottery studies in just one Roman province. That complexity is repeated in each and every region of the Empire.&lt;/ref&gt; Many decorative techniques were used to beautify pottery tableware, including the use of coloured slips, painting, and various textured surfaces. Painted decoration did not, however, continue the Greek and Etruscan traditions as a specialised technique used for elaborate luxury tablewares, though simpler painted designs do appear on many pottery types, both coarse and fine, throughout the Empire. The dividing lines between 'fine' and 'coarse' wares, or tablewares and cooking wares, become a little blurred in the case of some of the local, provincial products, because pottery is often multi-purpose. 
[[File:Roman lead-glazed flask.jpg|thumb|160px|A lead-glazed flask, mould-made in the form of a bunch of grapes. From Syria. 1st century AD.]]

Lead-glazed pottery was made in many regions of the Roman Empire, including Gaul, Italy and the eastern provinces. This type of vitreous glaze was most often used for small, decorative items of tableware, including mould-made cups with relief decoration, lamps and zoomorphic containers.&lt;ref&gt;There is a survey and typology of some of the Italian products by Roberts 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The glazes vary in colour from amber to brown and many shades of green.

Tableware made of [[Egyptian faience]], glazed in vivid blue, turquoise or green, continued to be manufactured in Egypt throughout the Roman period, and the shapes of some of these faience vessels in the 1st century BC and 1st century AD were directly influenced by Arretine ware. Very elaborate, decorated polychrome faience vessels were also produced. Egyptian faience, frit or 'glazed composition', as it is often termed by Egyptologists, has rather more in common technically with glass manufacture than with earthenware, since it is a non-clay ceramic material.&lt;ref&gt;For a very brief summary of the technology and history of Egyptian faience, see Nicholson 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

The dividing line between pottery vessels and terracotta figurines is another that is not always sharp, since certain types of small container, such as oil-pourers, were sometimes moulded in representational forms.

== Coarse wares ==

===Cooking pots===
Pottery was essential for cooking food in antiquity. Although metal utensils made of bronze or iron were widely available in the Roman period, simple, functional earthenware bowls, pans, casseroles and jars were an inexpensive and standard part of the equipment of every kitchen. From Britain to Egypt, from Spain to Syria, over the length and breadth of a vast Empire, local pre-Roman pottery traditions in simple cooking wares often continued without major changes for centuries. Roman cooking pots therefore have to be studied on a regional basis.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Tyers 1996, as above, for Britain; for the Rhineland, see Gose 1950&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the ordinary bowls and pans used for cooking, ceramic utensils were made for many specialised uses, such as the small cheese-press illustrated to the left of the group photograph of Roman pottery from Britain above. The two black jars to the left behind the cheese-press in the same photograph are examples of Romano-British [[black-burnished ware]], first made in south-west England in the late Iron Age, before the Roman conquest: this ware continued to be popular throughout the Roman period, and was made in greater quantities, and marketed more widely, under Roman influence. Other wares made in [[Roman Britain]] were [[Crambeck Ware]], [[Huntcliff ware]], and [[Nene Valley Colour Coated Ware]], which was often decorated.

===Mortaria===
However, one vessel type used in food preparation was closely linked with the spread of Roman culture and Roman cuisine: the ''{{lang|la|[[mortarium]]}}''. This was a robust shallow bowl with a thick, out-curved rim that made it easy to handle, often a pouring lip, and an internal surface deliberately roughened with a coating of grit or coarse sand during manufacture. It was used with a pestle to purée or pulverise ingredients in order to prepare elaborate and carefully seasoned Roman dishes; the Roman culinary tradition made extensive use of herbs and spices. The mortarium was the Roman equivalent of the food-processor, and is a real indicator of 'romanisation';&lt;ref&gt;Potter and Johns 2002, 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, the first mortaria were being imported from Gaulish sources more than a generation before Britain became a Roman province in AD 43, indicating the growing influence of Roman culture in late Iron Age southern Britain, and perhaps the actual presence of immigrants from Gaul. Later, locally-made mortaria produced at specialised potteries in different areas of the province were available throughout Britain, in addition to imported products: Paul Tyers discusses mortaria from no fewer than 16 different manufacturing sources, Romano-British and Continental, that have been found in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Tyers 1996, 116–135&lt;/ref&gt; Like so many other specialised Roman ceramic products, many mortaria also bore workshop or makers' stamps on their rims, and noting their chronology and distribution can help archaeologists understand trading patterns and the Roman economy.

===Amphorae===
[[File:Roman amphorae.jpg|thumb|300px|Types of Roman [[amphora]]e, which were kept in racks]]

====Description and function====
[[Amphora]]e, or amphoras, were used during Roman times to transport food on long and short distances. The content was generally liquid, olive oil or wine in most cases, but also ''{{lang|la|[[garum]]}}'', the popular fish sauce, and fruit sauce. As a container, an amphora was supposed to be strong, not too heavy, shaped in a way suitable for easy storage in the ship, and, at the same time, convenient for handling once arrived to its final destination. Usually, amphorae are two-handled terracotta containers with a globular/cylindrical body, a rim of various shapes, and a spiked or, less commonly, flat base. The spike was suited for a stable storage arrangement in the ship and it worked as a third handle in the process of emptying the container.

====Studies on amphorae====
The first systematic classification of amphorae types was undertaken by the German scholar [[Heinrich Dressel]]. Following the exceptional amphorae deposit uncovered in Rome in Castro Pretorio at the end of the 1800s, he collected almost 200 inscriptions from amphorae and included them in the ''{{lang|la|[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]}}''. In his studies of the amphorae deposit he was the first one to elaborate a classification of types, the so-called Dressel table,&lt;ref&gt;Dressel 1879, 36–112, 143–196&lt;/ref&gt; which is still used today for many types. Subsequent studies on Roman amphorae have produced more detailed classifications which are usually named after the scholar who studied them. For the neo-Phoenician types see the work by Maña published in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;Maña 1951, 203–210&lt;/ref&gt; and the revised classification by van der Werff in 1977–1978.&lt;ref&gt;Amphores de tradition punique à Uzita, in BaBesch 52–53, 171–200&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallic amphorae have been studied by Laubenheimer in a study published in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;Laubenheimer 1986, 105–138&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the Cretan amphorae have been analyzed by Marangou-Lerat.&lt;ref&gt;Marangou-Lerat 1995, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Beltràn studied the Spanish types in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Beltràn 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Adriatic types have been studied by Lamboglia in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;"Sulla cronologia delle anfore romane di età repubblicana" in ''Rivista Studi Liguri 21'', 252–60&lt;/ref&gt; For a general analysis of the Western Mediterranean types see Panella,&lt;ref&gt;Panella 2001, 177–275&lt;/ref&gt; and Peacock and Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Peacock and Williams 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

====Production====
[[File:Amphora Dressel 1B.svg|thumb|left|260px|Dressel type 1B, an early Roman amphora&lt;br/&gt;''Key :'' 1 : rim - 2 : neck - 3 : handle - 4 : shoulder - 5 : belly ''or'' body - 6 : foot]]
Amphorae were wheel-thrown terracotta containers. During the production process the body was made first and then let it partially dry.&lt;ref&gt;Peacock and Williams 1986, 45&lt;/ref&gt; Then, coils of clay would be added to form the neck, the rim, and the handles.&lt;ref&gt;Peacock and Williams 1986, 45&lt;/ref&gt; Once the amphora was completed, the interior was treated with resin in order to ensure a better performance in liquid storage.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo 2003, 141&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstruction of these stages of production is based primarily on ethnographic data coming from the study of modern amphorae production in some areas of the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Peacock and Williams 1986, 45&lt;/ref&gt; Amphorae are often marked with a variety of stamps and graffiti. The function of these stamps are related to the entire life of the vessel. Stamps, graffiti and inscriptions provided information from the production cycle to the content and the commercialisation. A stamp was usually applied to the amphora at a partially dry stage and it often indicated the name of the ''{{lang|la|figlina}}'' (workshop) and/or the name of the owner of the workshop. Painted stamps, ''{{lang|la|[[tituli picti]]}}'', were executed when the amphora was completed and provided indications regarding the weight of the container and the content.

====History====
The first type of Roman amphora, Dressel 1, appears in central Italy in the late 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Panella 2001, 177&lt;/ref&gt; This type had thick walls and a characteristic red fabric. It was very heavy, though also strong. Around the middle of the 1st century BC the so-called Dressel 2–4 starts to become widely used.&lt;ref&gt;Panella 2001, 194&lt;/ref&gt; This type of amphora presented some advantages in being lighter and with thinner walls. It has been calculated that while a ship could accommodate approximately 4,500 Dressel 1, it was possible to fit 6,000 Dressel 2–4 in the same space.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno 2005, 369&lt;/ref&gt; Dressel 2–4 were often produced in the same workshops used for the production of Dressel 1 which almost suddenly ceased to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Panella 2001, 194&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time in [[Cuma (Italy)|Cuma]] (southern Italy) the production of the ''{{lang|la|cadii cumani}}'' type starts (Dressel 21–22). These containers were mainly used for the transportation of fruit and were used until the middle imperial times. At the same time, in central Italy, the so-called [[Spello]] amphorae, small containers, were produced for the transportation of wine. On the Adriatic coast the older types were replaced by the Lamboglia 2 type, a wine amphora commonly produced between the end of the 2nd and the 1st century BC. This type develops later into the Dressel 6A which becomes dominant during Augustan times.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno 2005, 369&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Gallic provinces the first examples of Roman amphorae were local imitations of pre-existent types such as Dressel 1, Dressel 2–4, Pascual 1, and Haltern 70. The more typical Gallic production begins within the ceramic ateliers in [[Marseille]] during the late Augustan times. The type Oberaden 74 was produced to such an extent that it influenced the production of some Italic types.&lt;ref&gt;Panella 2001, 194&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish amphorae became particularly popular thanks to a flourishing production phase in the late Republican times. The ''{{lang|la|[[Hispania Baetica]]}}'' and ''{{lang|la|[[Hispania Tarraconensis]]}}'' regions (south-western and eastern Spain) were the main production areas between the 2nd and the 1st century BC thanks to the land distribution to the veterans and the founding of new colonies. The Spanish amphorae were widely spread in the Mediterranean during the early imperial times. The most common types were all produced in the Baetica and among these there was the Dressel 20, typical olive oil container, the Dressel 7–13, for garum, and the Haltern 70, for the defrutum, fruit sauce. In the Tarraconensis region the Pascual 1 was the most common type, a wine amphora shaped onto the Dressel 1, and imitations of Dressel 2–4.

North-African production was based on ancient tradition which could be traced back to the [[Phoenicia]]n colony of [[Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;Panella 2001, 207&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenician amphorae had characteristic small handles attached directly onto the upper body. This feature becomes the distinctive mark of late-Republican/early imperial productions which are then called neo-Phoenician. The types produced in [[Tripolitania]] and Northern Tunisia are the Maña C1 and C2, later renamed van Der Werff 1, 2, and 3.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Werff 1977–78&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aegean area the types from the island of [[Rhodes]] were quite popular starting from the 3rd century BC thanks to the local wine production which flourished for long time. This types developed into the ''Camulodunum'' 184, an amphora used for the transportation of the Rhodian wine all over the empire. Imitations of the Dressel 2–4 were produced in the island of Cos for the transportation of wine from the 4th BC until the middle imperial times.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno 2005, 374&lt;/ref&gt; Cretan containers were also popular for the transportation of wine and can be found in the Mediterranean from the Augustan times until the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno 2005, 375&lt;/ref&gt; During the late empire north-African types dominated the amphorae production. The so-called African I and II were widely used from the 2nd until the late 4th century AD. Other types from the eastern Mediterranean (Gaza), such as the so-called Late Roman 4, became very popular between the 4th and the 7th century AD, while Italic productions ceased to exist.

===Lamps===
[[File:Oil lamp with Gladiators fighting at the Römisch-Germanisches Museum Cologne.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Gladiator]]s on an [[oil lamp]]]]

Artificial lighting was commonplace in the Roman world. Candles, made from beeswax or [[tallow]], were undoubtedly the cheapest means of lighting, but candles seldom survive archaeologically. Lamps fueled with olive oil and other vegetable oils survive in great numbers, however, and have been studied in minute detail.&lt;ref&gt;For a general, brief introduction, see Bailey 1997, 164–169. For detailed scholarly treatment, see Donald M. Bailey, ''A Catalogue of Lamps in the British Museum, II; Roman Lamps made in Italy'', London 1980, and Donald M. Bailey, '' A Catalogue of Lamps in the British Museum, III; Roman Provincial Lamps'', London 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Some Roman lamps were made of metal, and could be of highly elaborate forms incorporating statuettes and multiple nozzles, but fired clay was the most usual material, and the majority of small, probably inexpensive, clay lamps had a single nozzle for one wick, and therefore one flame.

Most of these clay lamps were shaped using moulds in workshops that turned out large numbers of standardised products. Some of the most popular forms incorporated a central ''{{lang|la|discus}}'', a circular area usually around 4–6&amp;nbsp;cm. in diameter, that incorporated the filling-hole and could be ornamented with pictorial motifs in low relief. The range of decoration included pagan deities, myths and legends, genre scenes from everyday life, animals, hunting, public entertainments such as gladiatorial combat and chariot-racing, erotic encounters, and in late-Roman times, some Christian symbolism: in short, the full range of subjects that occur in the Roman decorative arts (Jewish lamps with symbols such as the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] are also found).&lt;ref&gt;For a close study of lamp production intended to draw conclusions about the emergence of [[Early Christian art]], see Finney, Paul Corby, ''The Invisible God: The Earliest Christians on Art'', Oxford University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0195113810}}, 9780195113815&lt;/ref&gt; Types and decoration initiated at the centre of Empire, in Italy, were often imitated in products made in workshops located in other provinces. Lamps could be directly copied by the process known as ''{{lang|fr|surmoulage}}'', using an existing lamp as the archetype for producing the mould, rather than creating a hand-modelled clay archetype.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey 1997, 168–169&lt;/ref&gt;

The highly organised manufacturing methods, usually using plaster (gypsum) moulds, the volume of production, and the trading and wide distribution all echo in some respects the production of red-gloss wares such as Arretine and samian, as does the existence of name-stamps on some of the lamps. Makers' or workshop names were normally placed on the underside of the lamp, and are common on the usually undecorated lamps known as ''{{lang|de|Firmalampen}}'' ('factory lamps'), a type which was popular in the military zones of the north-west Roman provinces during the 2nd century AD. One well-known name is that of ''Fortis'', and his products were evidently copied outside his own workshop in Italy – or perhaps Fortis had his own branch factories in the provinces. The Gaulish ''{{lang|de|Firmalampe}}'' in the adjacent picture, found in London, is stamped on the base with the name of the maker Atimetus.

In addition to the many basic lamp-shapes, which consisted of a rounded or ovoid body, with one or more projecting nozzles, and sometimes a handle, terracotta lamps were also made in a variety of much more fanciful forms, moulded to represent animals, grotesque heads, feet and many other shapes. These are known traditionally as ''plastic lamps'' ('plastic' meaning 'modelled or moulded').

The close dating and distribution information that can be obtained from the detailed study of forms, makers' marks and decoration makes Roman lamps important and useful finds on archaeological sites. They are not found in quite as great profusion on Roman sites in Britain as on sites elsewhere in the Empire, including Gaul, quite possibly because imported olive oil would probably have been more expensive in Britannia.

===Terracotta figurines===
Italian styles exerted much less influence across the Empire in [[terracotta]] figurines or statuettes than in pottery vessels; here the longstanding traditions of [[Greek terracotta figurines]], and those of Egypt and other Eastern provinces of the Empire, were the dominant influences. In some northern provinces, such as Gaul and Germany, there was no native [[Iron Age]] tradition of making terracotta figurines, but new industries developed under Roman influence manufacturing mould-made figures in fine white [[Clay|pipeclay]]. Like bronze statuettes, which would have been more expensive items, small terracotta figures were generally made for ritual or religious purposes, such as dedication at temples, display in household shrines, or as grave-goods to be deposited with the dead. However, some terracottas were also used as toys by children, even if they were not manufactured for that specific purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey 1983, 191–199&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the small terracotta figurines were mould-made objects manufactured in quite large numbers, and most would have been painted in bright colours when new. These pigments, applied after firing, rarely survive burial except in small and faded patches.

Each region of the Empire produced terracottas in distinctive local styles, but all had rather similar ranges of subjects, above all the standard religious themes of gods, goddesses and their attributes; representations of birds and animals may often be linked with specific deities, though some animal figures may well have been made without any religious or ritual purpose. The religious subjects often include local traditions and cults: for example, the Romano-Egyptian repertoire of terracottas includes Egyptian deities, such as [[Harpocrates]], the Graeco-Roman form of [[Horus]], while Celtic gods appear amongst those made in the Central Gaulish industries, centred in the [[Allier]] Valley and the [[Rhineland]] industry at [[Cologne]].

A Celtic mother-goddess nursing one, or sometimes two, infants, is one of the most popular Central Gaulish types,&lt;ref&gt;Rouvier-Jeanlin 1972, 156–186&lt;/ref&gt; though Venus was also very frequently represented in Gaul. The mother-goddess figurines are shown seated in high-backed basketwork chairs that seem to have been typical of Gaul and Britain. Figurines from the Allier Valley and Cologne sources sometimes bear the signatures of modellers and/or mouldmakers.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey 1983, 198&lt;/ref&gt; As in the case of the Gaulish samian industries, the makers' names and the styles and themes all illustrate the fusion of local and Mediterranean traditions.

===Brick, tile and other architectural ceramics===
[[File:Tiles Fishbourne.JPG|thumb|260px|Tegula and imbrex roofing tiles from [[Fishbourne Roman Palace]]]]

Two manufactured materials were of great importance in Roman architecture: [[concrete]] and fired clay in the form of structural bricks and tiles, and to a lesser extent, in architectural decoration. These materials were used in buildings all over the Roman Empire, and in many areas, they fell out of use again after the Roman period, only to be rediscovered centuries later. Like other mass-produced Roman ceramic objects, bricks and tiles were often marked with inscriptions that indicate their manufacturer, or the organisation or authority, military or civilian, for which they had been made.&lt;ref&gt;The methods and technology of manufacture are described in some detail by  Middleton 1997, pp. 158–163. Although this paper focuses on the Roman province of Britain, the basic methods and organisation described applied all over the Empire.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman brick]]s used for building walls are often referred to as 'tiles', because they are rather thin, flat squares, made in standard sizes, often related to the [[Roman foot]] ({{circa}} {{convert|11|in|disp=or}}), from around 20&amp;nbsp;cm to about 58&amp;nbsp;cm square, and about 5–7&amp;nbsp;cm thick.&lt;ref&gt;For a very brief introduction, see Johns 2005, p. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Even stone-built walls frequently incorporated horizontal tile-courses. Brick-built walls were finished with various types of facing, rendering or plastering on both exterior and interior surfaces, so that the bricks themselves were not visible.

Tiles used for roofing were intended to be seen, however. Roof-tiles were of distinctive shapes, the ''{{lang|la|[[Imbrex and tegula|tegula]]}}'' (pl. ''{{lang|la|tegulae}}''), which was a large, thin tile, almost square, with upturned flanges on its longer sides, and the ''{{lang|la|[[Imbrex and tegula|imbrex]]}}'' (pl. ''{{lang|la|imbrices}}''), of slightly tapered half-cylindrical form. The imbrices, interlocking because of their tapered form, were laid over the raised flanges of the tegulae, and together formed the characteristic ridged tiled roof still to be seen in Italy and southern France today. The pitch of such a roof has to be fairly low, not more than about 30 degrees. The roof was finished with a series of plain ridge-tiles, and often with decorative finials, which could also be of terracotta, at the gable.

Some buildings also featured ''[[antefix]]es'', vertical ornaments of triangular or rounded shape that were placed along the edge of the roof. They, too, were often made of terracotta, and could be decorated with pictorial motifs intended to avert ill-luck, or with inscriptions: those made in military tileries attached to legionary forts bore the number and symbol of the relevant legion. 
[[File:Roman box flue-tile.JPG|thumb|260px|left|A flue-tile with surface decoration that would have been hidden in use]]

Roman [[hypocaust]] heating systems made extensive use of fired clay elements: The space beneath the floor of a room to be heated was supported on robust pillars (''pilae''), usually made of small, square bricks mortared together, so that the heat from the adjacent furnace could circulate freely. In public and private [[Thermae|bath-houses]] (essential to the Roman way of life), heat was also carried up through the walls in flues made of interlocking box-tiles. Though these were covered up by wall facings both inside and out, they were sometimes manufactured with quite elaborate geometric and even figural decoration. Pipes for water and drainage were also often made of fired clay.

Ceramic tiles were not normally used for flooring in Roman buildings, though ''{{lang|la|opus signinum}}'', a favoured flooring material, was composed of concrete and crushed tile, and carefully cut small squares from tiles were often used in [[mosaic]] floors, ''{{lang|la|[[tesserae]]}}'' about 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm. square being used for plain borders, and smaller squares, about 1&amp;nbsp;cm., where a red colour was required in a pictorial mosaic with multi-coloured geometric or figural designs.

The edge of a roof might be embellished with plaques called antefixes, as mentioned above, and some pottery [[relief]] "[[revetment]]" panels with figurative scenes for setting into walls emulate the marble friezes of grand temples. These are still often called "[[Campana reliefs]]", after [[Giampietro Campana]], the 19th-century Italian scholar and collector who first studied them. They were developed from about 50 BC and were used almost entirely in Italy between Tuscany and Campania – areas once in the ambit of the [[Etruscan society|Etruscan]] culture of which they seem a continuation. Initially used on small temples, they are later found on a wide range of public and private buildings. Usually between 22 and 50&amp;nbsp;cm high and 27 to 48&amp;nbsp;cm wide, plaques were perhaps typically arranged in bands or [[frieze]]s. Subjects are usually drawn from mythology. They cease to be found after the middle of the 2nd century; they had to compete with moulded stucco as well as wall-paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 276-77, Price 191–192&lt;/ref&gt;

In archaeology, bricks and tiles, especially when encountered only in fragmentary form, are often classified under the generic term [[ceramic building material]] or CBM.

{{Other uses|Art and Design}}

The '''Art and Design Admissions Registry''' (ADAR) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] administrative body concerned with admissions to [[higher education]] courses in art and design outside universities.  It was founded in 1966 and functioned for thirty years before being absorbed into the [[Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]] (UCAS) in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;UCAS Memorandum to Parliamentary Select Committee on Education and Employment, 26 July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; ADAR was based in the city of [[Hereford]].

Following the introduction of Art Foundation courses from 1963 onwards, interest among potential students increased in the range of higher education courses available nationally.  Like the [[Central Register and Clearing House]] the ADAR scheme operated on a sequential rather than simultaneous basis, so that once a particular applicant had been accepted by their first choice their form did not circulate to further institutions.

In 1996, the scheme had 15,200 applications which led to 9,082 acceptances, compared to 6,900 acceptances in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Patel, Kam, "Designed for Modern Life", Times Higher Education Supplement, 19 September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major branches of [[Higher education in the United Kingdom|British higher education]] merged their [[University and college admission|admissions systems]] in the new UCAS scheme in 1992, but Art and Design admissions presented particular problems since they worked to a later timetable as a result of the important role Art Foundation courses had in developing as fully as possible a student's proposed specialism (painting, sculpture, graphic design and so on).  Work was furthermore generally submitted before a decision was made on whether to interview. A means of absorbing ADAR was found by 1996 although fears were expressed that students might be tempted to try to bypass the Foundation course preparatory route.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, Times Higher Education Supplement, 9 August 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The merger with UCAS allowed that for a period there would be two routes of admission, one generally conforming to the UCAS timetable, and one running later to allow for the special circumstances of many Foundation applicants.  A study in 2002 aimed to test whether the merged scheme had been as beneficial as its proponents had claimed,&lt;ref&gt;Porch, Lisa and Barclay, Martin, "Unifying Higher Education Admissions in Art and Design", Journal of Further and Higher Education, Vol 26, No. 3, August 2002, pp. 241-250&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art in Sierra Leone''' has a long and significant tradition of carving and ceremonial works like masks and cloth for initiation and protection. Although art styles are oftentimes ascribed to a single ethnic group (often the [[Mende people|Mende]]), the styles and processes are spread throughout the country and many artists move between the different ethnic groups in the country.{{sfn|Hart|1989|p=45}}{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}}

Art is often practiced by organized societies, whether the traditional [[Sande society|Sande]] and [[Poro]] societies or the more recent ''odelay'' societies of [[Freetown]], and express a range of spiritual and political meanings. Carving using wood, ivory, and stone has been prominent for many centuries and retains importance today. In addition, since the 1930s, Freetown has had a number of ''lanterns'' competitions where different groups construct large, decorative floats.

==Artistic societies and groups==

===Sande and Poro Societies===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 74.64 Helmet Mask ndoli jowei for Sande Society.jpg|thumbnail|Sande mask. ([[Brooklyn Museum]])]]
{{main|Sande society|Poro}}
The Sande (female) and Poro (male) ceremonial societies have a long history of artistic construction in many different ethnic groups of Sierra Leone. Although most often affiliated with the [[Mende people|Mende]], these societies exist widely in the ethnic groups of Sierra Leone including in the [[Temne people|Temne]], the [[Kono people|Kono]], the [[Vai people|Vai]], and [[Bullom languages]] communities.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}}

The Sande and Poro societies, which are primarily tasked with the initiation ceremonies for women and men to become a part of the community, produce an important range of artwork associated with the ceremony.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}} One of the most prominent artistic forms associated with these societies are the helmet masks (called ''sowei'' in Mende and ''anawu'' in Temne) involved in the initiation rituals.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}}

===Odelay societies===
[[File:Temne. Ode-Lay Mask Brooklyn Museum.jpg|thumb| Odelay mask by [[Temne people]]. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
Sierra Leone did not develop a significant artistic tradition of patriotic imagery during the struggle for independence and after. However, after the [[1992 Sierra Leonean coup d'état]], youth groups (''odelay societies'') formed and began engaging in high-profile art with patriotic themes.{{sfn|Opala|1994|p=198}} Prominent figures depicted were [[Bai Bureh]] or [[Joseph Cinqué|Sengbe Pieh]] in the lanterns and masks by the odelay societies in Freetown.{{sfn|Opala|1994|p=199}} In addition to historical heroes, the art often depicts National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) leaders and symbols (such as [[Valentine Strasser]] and [[Solomon Musa]]).{{sfn|Opala|1994|p=205}}

==Woodworking==
[[File:Apaf5.jpg|thumbnail|Wood figure of the Mende people]]
In general, there are clear regional differences in the wood carving techniques of the forest communities (the Mende, Vai, and Bullom) with smooth edges and intricate details. The savannah style (the Temne Limba, and Loko communities), in contrast, is defined by abstract styles with straight lines and bold contrasts.{{sfn|Hart|1989|p=45}}

Twin figures are prominent in Temne cultural practice and the wood carvings play a key role in the ceremonial life of the community. These figures of no more than a foot tall are created with a twin child passes away, and are used initially as a play partner for the living twin and as a ceremonial site for the mother.{{sfn|Lamp|2008|p=51}}

The twin figures are carved into a number of other ceremonial related wood, including staffs for religious initiation and healing.{{sfn|Lamp|2008|p=53}}  Associated with these figures is the construction of small-scale houses for the twin (called ''ka-bangka'' in Temne) which are spread throughout the area.{{sfn|Lamp|2008|p=51}} This use of twin figures is associated with wider spiritual powers that twins are claimed to possess in Temne beliefs.{{sfn|Lamp|2008|p=56}}

==Stone and ivory carving==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 2000.93.1 Figure of a Man Holding a Crocodile (2).jpg|thumbnail|Nomoli stone carving of a man holding a crocodile. ([[Brooklyn Museum]])]]
Ivory carvings have been produced by many of the ethnic groups in the current area of Sierra Leone and were a primary export to Portuguese traders when they first began the trade networks with the coastal communities.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}} It was not until the 1950s that the stylistic connections between the ivory pieces and the large stone carvings which were discussed significantly by European sources earlier in that century.{{sfn|Lamp|1990|p=48}}

The ''nomoli'' or ''pomdo'' stone carvings of unclear origin have been discovered buried around southern Sierra Leone.  The figures were first described by Europeans in 1852 by missionary George Thompson who discovered a group of five of them on the site of a destroyed village.{{sfn|Fraser|1971|p=393}} The human figures, carved out of [[soapstone]], are found throughout a large area that was controlled primarily by the Temne until the Mende entered in the 1600s.{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=219}} When asked about the statues by early explorers, the people in the region expressed the belief that they were the work of spiritual beings and that no one in the communities knew how to make such a figure.{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=220}}{{sfn|Fraser|1971|p=393}}

The Mende believe the stones are the representations of the people who lived in the region before they came to the area and the Temne people have a ceremony around the stones where they treat them as former chiefs and kings of the region.{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=220}}{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=237}} African art curator Frederick Lamp believes that the stone carvings are a Temne tradition which was lost when the Mende invaded and displaced the communities which had existed there before that.{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=230}}

==Cloth work==
[[File:Sierra Leonian - Ivory Pyx with Scenes from the Passion of Christ - Walters 71108 - View D.jpg|thumb|right|Ivory carving of approximate 1500s origin from Sierra Leone]]
Cloth arts are often used in many of the different groups in Sierra Leone to provide special types of protection. The cloth is provided with specific designs for spiritual protection for the wearer.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}}

==Lanterns==
A prominent modern artistic expression involves the design and floating of ''lanterns'' down the river in [[Freetown]], the capital of the country.{{sfn|Oram|1998|p=50}} From 1961 until 1991, the Young Men's Muslim Association (YMMA) held competitions where various different civil groups would design large floats, often with lights inside or outside, in celebration of Ramadan.{{sfn|Oram|1998|p=50}} The lanterns are constructed out of wood, bamboo, wire, paper, rice and other materials and represent landmarks, animals, or supernatural beings.{{sfn|Oram|1998|p=52}}

The lantern festival began small in the 1930s when the businessman Daddy Maggay witnessed a Catholic lantern festival in the Gambia.{{sfn|Nunley|1985|p=45}} The small processions slowly grew, largely as a result of the reputation for good cooking by Maggay's wife (whose specialty was corn and couscous), and eventually became run by the YMMA.{{sfn|Nunley|1985|p=45}}

As the competition grew, violence occasionally broke out and the event grew larger and larger.{{sfn|Nunley|1985|p=45}} The events and lanterns often have political themes related to the issues in Sierra Leone at the time and are affiliated with various movements.{{sfn|Nunley|1985|p=45}} The regular holding of the lantern competition was ended in 1991 by the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]], but irregular competitions still are held.{{sfn|Oram|1998|p=50}}

[[File:Durasteel fire barrier3.jpg|thumb|right|Asymmetrical [[High-voltage transformer fire barriers|fire barrier]], ''required'' by ASTM E119&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.astm.org/Standards/E119.htm ASTM E119 Standard Test Methods for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials]&lt;/ref&gt; to be [[fire test]]ed on both sides. The lowest result achieved equates to the overall [[fire-resistance rating]] of the [[system]] in order to ensure that the barrier works equally well from both sides.]]
'''Asymmetry''' is the absence of, or a violation of, [[symmetry]] (the property of an object being invariant to a transformation, such as reflection). Symmetry is an important property of both physical and abstract systems and it may be displayed in precise terms or in more aesthetic terms. The absence of or violation of symmetry that are either expected or desired can have important consequences for a system.

==In organisms==
Due to how [[cell (biology)|cell]]s divide in [[organism]]s, asymmetry in organisms is fairly usual in at least one dimension, with [[symmetry (biology)|biological symmetry]] also being common in at least one dimension.

Louis Pasteur proposed that biological molecules are asymmetric because the cosmic [i.e. physical] forces that preside over their formation are themselves asymmetric. While at his time, and even now, the symmetry of physical processes are highlighted, it is known that there are fundamental physical asymmetries, starting with time.

===Evolution of asymmetry in organisms===
Asymmetry is an important and widespread trait, having evolved numerous times in many organisms and at many levels of organisation (ranging from individual cells, through organs, to entire body-shapes). Benefits of asymmetry sometimes have to do with improved spatial arrangements, such as the left [[human]] [[lung]] being smaller, and having one fewer lobes than the right lung to make room for the asymmetrical [[heart]]. In other examples, division of function between the right and left half may have been beneficial and has driven the asymmetry to become stronger. Such an explanation is usually given for mammal hand or paw preference ([[Handedness]]), an asymmetry in skill development in mammals. Training the neural pathways in a skill with one hand (or paw) may take less effort than doing the same with both hands.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Nature also provides several examples of handedness in traits that are usually symmetric. The following are examples of animals with obvious left-right asymmetries:
[[Image:Fiddler Crab Gulf Coast.jpg|thumb|[[Fiddler crab]], ''Uca pugnax'']]
*Most [[snail]]s, because of [[Torsion (gastropod)|torsion]] during development, show remarkable asymmetry in the shell and in the internal organs.
*[[Fiddler crab]]s have one big claw and one small claw.
*The [[narwhal]]'s tusk is a left incisor which can grow up to 10 feet in length and forms a left-handed helix.
*[[Flatfish]] have evolved to swim with one side upward, and as a result have both eyes on one side of their heads.
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:halibut.jpg|thumb|left|150 px|Halibut, a type of flatfish]] --&gt;
*Several species of [[owl]]s exhibit asymmetries in the size and positioning of their ears, which is thought to help locate prey.
*Many animals (ranging from insects to mammals) have asymmetric male [[genitalia]]. The evolutionary cause behind this is, in most cases, still a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schilthuizen|first1=Menno|title=Something gone awry: unsolved mysteries in the evolution of asymmetric animal genitalia|journal=Animal Biology|date=2013|volume=63|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1163/15707563-00002398|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15707563-00002398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an indicator of unfitness===

*Certain disturbances during the development of the organism, resulting in [[birth defect]]s.
*Injuries after cell division that cannot be biologically repaired, such as a lost [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] from an accident.

Since birth defects and injuries are likely to indicate poor health of the organism, defects resulting in asymmetry often put an animal at a disadvantage when it comes to finding a mate. In particular, a degree of [[facial symmetry]] is associated with physical attractiveness, but complete symmetry is both impossible and probably unattractive.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==In structures==
Pre-modern architectural styles tended to place an emphasis on symmetry, except where extreme site conditions or historical developments lead away from this classical ideal. To the contrary, [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[Postmodernism#Architecture|postmodern architects]] became much more free to use asymmetry as a design element.

While most bridges employ a symmetrical form due to intrinsic simplicities of design, analysis and fabrication and economical use of materials, a number of modern bridges have deliberately departed from this, either in response to site-specific considerations or to create a dramatic design statement.

===In fire protection===
In [[Fire-resistance rating|fire-resistance rated wall assemblies]], used in [[passive fire protection]], including, but not limited to, [[high-voltage transformer fire barriers]], asymmetry is a crucial aspect of design. When designing a facility, it is not always certain, that in the event of [[fire]], which ''side'' a fire may come from. Therefore, many building codes and fire test standards outline, that a symmetrical assembly, need only be [[Fire test|tested]] from one side, because both sides are the same. However, as soon as an assembly is asymmetrical, both sides must be tested and the test report is required to state the results for each side. In practical use, the lowest result achieved is the one that turns up in [[certification listing]]s. Neither the test sponsor, nor the laboratory can go by an opinion or deduction as to which side was in more peril as a result of contemplated testing and then test only one side. Both must be tested in order to be compliant with test standards and [[building code]]s

==In mathematics==

There are no ''a'' and ''b'' such that ''a'' &lt; ''b'' and ''b'' &lt; ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Set Theory'', Third Edition, Revised and Expanded: Hrbacek, Jech.{{full|date=October 2014}}&lt;!--missing year, page, publisher, possibly ISBN--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This form of asymmetry is an [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetrical relation]].

==In chemistry==

Certain molecules are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]; that is, they cannot be superposed upon their mirror image. Chemically identical molecules with different chirality are called ''enantiomers''; this difference in orientation can lead to different properties in the way they react with biological systems.

{{Expand section|date=November 2007}}

==In physics==

Asymmetry arises in physics in a number of different realms.

===Thermodynamics===

The original non-statistical formulation of [[thermodynamics]] was [[Entropy (arrow of time)|asymmetrical in time]]: it claimed that the [[entropy]] in a closed system can only increase with time. This was derived from the Second Law (any of the two, [[Clausius]]' or [[Lord Kelvin]]'s statement can be used since they are equivalent) and using the [[Clausius' Theorem]] (see [[Kerson Huang {{ISBN|978-0471815181}}]]). The later theory of statistical mechanics, however, is symmetric in time. Although it states that a system significantly below maximum entropy is very likely to evolve ''towards'' higher entropy, it also states that such a system is very likely to have evolved ''from'' higher entropy.

===Particle physics===

[[Symmetry in physics|Symmetry]] is one of the most powerful tools in [[particle physics]], because it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. Violations of symmetry therefore present theoretical and experimental puzzles that lead to a deeper understanding of nature. Asymmetries in experimental measurements also provide powerful handles that are often relatively free from background or systematic uncertainties.

====Parity violation====
{{Main|parity (physics)}}

Until the 1950s, it was believed that fundamental physics was left-right symmetric; i.e., that interactions were invariant under [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Although parity is conserved in [[electromagnetism]], [[strong interactions]] and [[gravity]], it turns out to be violated in [[weak interactions]]. The [[Standard Model]] incorporates parity violation by expressing the weak interaction as a [[chirality (physics)|chiral]] gauge interaction. Only the left-handed components of particles and right-handed components of antiparticles participate in weak interactions in the Standard Model. A consequence of parity violation in particle physics is that [[neutrinos]] have only been observed as left-handed particles (and antineutrinos as right-handed particles).

In 1956-1957 [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], E. Ambler, R. W. Hayward, D. D. Hoppes, and R. P. Hudson found a clear violation of parity conservation in the beta decay of cobalt-60.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Simultaneously, [[Richard Garwin|R. L. Garwin]], [[Leon Lederman]], and R. Weinrich modified an existing cyclotron experiment and immediately verified parity violation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

====CP violation====
{{Main|CP-violation}}

After the discovery of the violation of parity in 1956-57, it was believed that the combined symmetry of parity (P) and simultaneous [[charge conjugation]] (C), called ''CP'', was preserved. For example, CP transforms a left-handed neutrino into a right-handed antineutrino. In 1964, however, [[James Cronin]] and [[Val Fitch]] provided clear evidence that CP symmetry was also violated in an experiment with neutral [[kaons]].

CP violation is one of the necessary conditions for the generation of a baryon asymmetry in the universe.

Combining the CP symmetry with simultaneous [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] (T) produces a combined symmetry called [[CPT symmetry]]. CPT symmetry must be preserved in any [[Lorentz invariant]] local [[quantum field theory]] with a [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. As of 2006, no violations of CPT symmetry have been observed.

====Baryon asymmetry of the universe====
{{Main|baryogenesis}}

The [[baryons]] (i.e., the [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] and the atoms that they comprise) observed so far in the universe are overwhelmingly [[matter]] as opposed to [[anti-matter]]. This asymmetry is called the [[baryon asymmetry]] of the universe.

====Isospin violation====

[[Isospin]] is the symmetry transformation of the [[weak interactions]]. The concept was first introduced by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in [[nuclear physics]] based on the observations that the masses of the [[neutron]] and the [[proton]] are almost identical and that the strength of the [[strong interaction]] between any pair of nucleons is the same, independent of whether they are protons or neutrons. This symmetry arises at a more fundamental level as a symmetry between up-type and down-type [[quark]]s. Isospin symmetry in the strong interactions can be considered as a subset of a larger [[flavor symmetry]] group, in which the strong interactions are invariant under interchange of different types of quarks. Including the [[strange quark]] in this scheme gives rise to the [[Eightfold way (physics)|Eightfold Way]] scheme for classifying mesons and baryons.

Isospin is violated by the fact that the masses of the up and down quarks are different, as well as by their different electric charges. Because this violation is only a small effect in most processes that involve the strong interactions, isospin symmetry remains a useful calculational tool, and its violation introduces corrections to the isospin-symmetric results.

====In collider experiments====

Because the [[weak interaction]]s violate parity, [[collider]] processes that can involve the weak interactions typically exhibit asymmetries in the distributions of the final-state particles. These asymmetries are typically sensitive to the ''difference'' in the interaction between particles and antiparticles, or between left-handed and right-handed particles. They can thus be used as a sensitive measurement of differences in interaction strength and/or to distinguish a small asymmetric signal from a large but symmetric background.
*A '''forward-backward asymmetry''' is defined as A&lt;sub&gt;FB&lt;/sub&gt;=(N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;)/(N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;+N&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;), where N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of events in which some particular final-state particle is moving "forward" with respect to some chosen direction (e.g., a final-state electron moving in the same direction as the initial-state electron beam in electron-positron collisions), while N&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of events with the final-state particle moving "backward". Forward-backward asymmetries were used by the [[LEP]] experiments to measure the difference in the interaction strength of the [[Z boson]] between left-handed and right-handed fermions, which provides a precision measurement of the [[weak mixing angle]].
*A '''left-right asymmetry''' is defined as A&lt;sub&gt;LR&lt;/sub&gt;=(N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)/(N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;+N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;), where N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of events in which some initial- or final-state particle is left-polarized, while N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the corresponding number of right-polarized events. Left-right asymmetries in Z boson production and decay were measured at the [[Stanford Linear Collider]] using the event rates obtained with left-polarized versus right-polarized initial electron beams. Left-right asymmetries can also be defined as asymmetries in the polarization of final-state particles whose polarizations can be measured; e.g., [[tau lepton]]s.
*A '''charge asymmetry''' or particle-antiparticle asymmetry is defined in a similar way. This type of asymmetry has been used to constrain the [[parton (particle physics)|parton distribution functions]] of protons at the [[Tevatron]] from events in which a produced [[W boson]] decays to a charged lepton. The asymmetry between positively and negatively charged leptons as a function of the direction of the W boson relative to the proton beam provides information on the relative distributions of up and down quarks in the proton. Particle-antiparticle asymmetries are also used to extract measurements of CP violation from [[Meson|B meson]] and anti-B meson production at the [[BaBar experiment|BaBar]] and [[Belle experiment|Belle]] experiments.

==Lexical==
{{references|section|date=November 2015}}

Asymmetry is also relevant to [[grammar]] and [[linguistics]], especially in the contexts of [[lexical analysis]] and [[transformational grammar]].

'''Enumeration example:'''
In [[English language|English]], there are grammatical rules for specifying coordinate items in an enumeration or series. Similar rules exist for [[programming language]]s and [[mathematical notation]]. These rules vary, and some require lexical asymmetry to be considered grammatically correct.

For example, in standard written English:
    We sell domesticated cats, dogs, and goldfish.        ### in-line asymmetric and grammatical
    We sell domesticated animals (cats, dogs, goldfish).  ### in-line symmetric and grammatical
    We sell domesticated animals (cats, dogs, goldfish,). ### in-line symmetric and ungrammatical
    We sell domesticated animals:                         ### outline symmetric and grammatical
      - cats
      - dogs
      - goldfish

Cowper House was built in 1664, following the destruction of many buildings in Chester during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last =Ward | first =Simon | authorlink = | title =Chester: A History |edition= | publisher =Phillimore | year = 2009 | location =Chichester | pages = 74–75|  isbn =978-1-86077-499-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was built above [[undercroft]]s dating from 1350–75, or possibly earlier.  Alterations have been made to the building in the 19th&amp;nbsp;and 20th&amp;nbsp;centuries.  Thomas Cowper had been [[mayor]] of Chester in 1641–42 and a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] supporter in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]].  The rear undercroft was excavated in 1839, and it is thought that the front undercroft is older than that in the rear.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Cowper House 5.jpg|thumb|Detail of Cowper House showing the inscription]]

===Exterior===
The house is constructed in [[sandstone]], brick, and [[timber framing]] with plaster panels.  The roof is of grey [[slate]].  It has four storeys and a [[gable]] overlooking the street.  The street level consists of a modern shop front on the right of which is a flight of 11&amp;nbsp;stone steps leading to the Row level above.  At the Row level is another modern shop front.  Between this and the street is a walkway, a sloping stallboard and a rail with [[baluster]]s overlooking the street.  Above the Row opening is a carved [[Fascia (architecture)|fascia]].  In the storey above is a window running almost the whole width of the building.  Its frame projects from the wall and is carried on eight [[corbel]]s.  The window has 14&amp;nbsp;lights, is [[mullion]]ed and [[Transom (architectural)|transomed]], and contains [[Leadlight|leaded lights]].  Below and on each side of the window are timber-framed panels.  The top storey is [[jettying|jettied]].  At its base is a [[bressummer]] carved centrally with "•T•C•1664" (the initials are those of Thomas Cowper), on each side of which are carved patterns.  The top storey has a ten-light mullioned and transomed [[casement window]] containing leaded lights.  Below the window are eight panels containing wooden carvings, and two similar panels are on each side of the window.  Above the window are [[Quadrant (architecture)|quadrant]]-braced panels.  The [[bargeboard]] is decorated with carvings and at its peak is a [[finial]].&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

===Interior===
Two steps lead down from the street to the front undercroft which is 16m long.  At its rear, six steps lead down to the rear undercroft which is 13m long.  This undercroft has six bays and is [[rib vault]]ed.  At the far end is a three-light window.  On the left side in the fifth bay is a stone stairway. In the third storey is a sandstone fireplace with a beam inscribed "TC 1661" on each side of a blank shield.

'''Crystal Cubism''' (French: ''Cubisme cristal'' or ''Cubisme de cristal'') is a distilled form of [[Cubism]] consistent with a shift, between 1915 and 1916, towards a strong emphasis on flat surface activity and large overlapping geometric planes. The primacy of the underlying geometric structure, rooted in the abstract, controls practically all of the elements of the artwork.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916&amp;ndash;1928'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

This range of [[Style (visual arts)|styles]] of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920 (also referred to as the ''Crystal Period'', ''classical Cubism'', ''pure Cubism'', ''advanced Cubism'', ''late Cubism'', ''synthetic Cubism'', or the ''second phase of Cubism''), was practiced in varying degrees by a multitude of artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector [[Léonce Rosenberg]]—[[Henri Laurens]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Juan Gris]] and [[Jacques Lipchitz]] most noticeably of all. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the French poet and art critic [[Maurice Raynal]] as 'crystal' Cubism.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020545 Christopher Green, ''Late Cubism'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of [[World War I]]—such as the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]], dynamism of modern life, the occult, and [[Henri Bergson]]'s concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference that proceeded from a cohesive stance toward art and life.

As post-war reconstruction began, so too did a series of exhibitions at Léonce Rosenberg's [[Léonce Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]]: order and the allegiance to the aesthetically pure remained the prevailing tendency. The collective phenomenon of Cubism once again—now in its advanced revisionist form—became part of a widely discussed development in French culture. Crystal Cubism was the culmination of a continuous narrowing of scope in the name of a [[return to order]]; based upon the observation of the artists relation to nature, rather than on the nature of reality itself.&lt;ref name="Inside Modernism"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=gpPDpEYRA90C&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Crystal+Cubism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HsCDYfw3KE&amp;sig=nw_h8YuUu7Q9HjoPJIFfwCbTsgE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pKpiVZiMGszcUfGjgKgN&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Crystal%20Cubism%22&amp;f=false Thomas Vargish, Delo E. Mook, ''Inside Modernism: Relativity Theory, Cubism, Narrative'', Yale University Press, 1999], p. 88, {{ISBN|0300076134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal Cubism, and its associative ''rappel à l’ordre'', has been linked with an inclination—by those who served the armed forces and by those who remained in the civilian sector—to escape the realities of the Great War, both during and directly following the conflict. The purifying of Cubism from 1914 through the mid-1920s, with its cohesive unity and voluntary constraints, has been linked to a much broader [[Ideology|ideological]] transformation towards [[conservatism]] in both French society and [[Culture of France|French culture]]. In terms of the separation of culture and life, the Crystal Cubist period emerges as the most important in the history of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

==Background==

===Beginnings: Cézanne===
[[File:Paul Cézanne, 1888, Mardi gras (Pierrot et Arlequin), oil on canvas, 102 x 81 cm, Pushkin Museum.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Paul Cézanne]], 1888, ''Mardi gras (Pierrot et Arlequin)'', oil on canvas, 102 x 81 cm, [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow]]
Cubism, from its inception, stems from the dissatisfaction with the ''idea of form'' that had been in practiced since the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, ''L'Epopée'', written in 1925, published in ''Le Rouge et le Noir'', 1929. First published under the title ''Kubismus'', 1928.  English translation, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form'', by Peter Brooke]&lt;/ref&gt; This dissatisfaction had already been seen in the works of the [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] [[Eugène Delacroix]], in the [[Realism (art)|Realism]] of [[Gustave Courbet]], in passing through the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]], [[Les Nabis]], the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] and the [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionists]]. [[Paul Cézanne]] was instrumental, as his work marked a shift from a more representational art form to one that was increasingly abstract, with a strong emphasis on the simplification of geometric structure. In a letter addressed to [[Émile Bernard]] dated 15 April 1904, Cézanne writes: "Interpret nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone; put everything in perspective, so that each side of an object, of a plane, recedes toward a central point."&lt;ref name="Erle Lora"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpbEHESVx9cC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Cézanne,+le+cylindres,+sphères,+et+le+cônes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWN2A52aTk&amp;sig=kFqKvxXeu6Q_DgjHn2GAb6TDbFE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VpsqUenwBom3hAfVvIGADg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=cylinder%2C%20sphere%2C%20cone&amp;f=false Erle Lora, ''Cézannes Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs''], Forward by Richard Shiff, University of California Press, 30 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Cézanne was preoccupied by the means of rendering volume and space, surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes. Increasingly in his later works, Cézanne achieves a greater freedom. His work became bolder, more arbitrary, more dynamic and increasingly nonrepresentational. As his color planes acquired greater formal independence, defined objects and structures began to lose their identity.&lt;ref name="Erle Lora" /&gt;

===The first phase===
{{main article|Proto-Cubism}}
[[File:Georges Braque, 1908, Maisons et arbre, oil on canvas, 40.5 x 32.5 cm, Lille Métropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art.jpg|thumb|Georges Braque, 1908, ''Maisons et arbre'' (''[[Houses at l'Estaque]]''), oil on canvas, 40.5 x 32.5 cm, [[Lille Métropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art]]]]
Artists at the forefront of the Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would not fail to notice the tendencies toward abstraction inherent in the work of Cézanne, and ventured still further.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert L. Herbert, 1968, ''Neo-Impressionism'', The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; A reevaluation in their own work in relation to that of Cézanne had begun following a series of retrospective exhibitions of Cézanne's paintings held at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904, the Salon d'Automne of 1905 and 1906, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Moser"&gt;Daniel Robbins, Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; By 1907, representational form gave way to a new complexity; subject matter progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]], an exhibition which officially introduced "Cubism" to the public as an organized group movement, and extending through 1913, the [[fine art]]s had evolved well beyond the teachings of Cézanne. Where before, the foundational pillars of academicism had been shaken, now they had been toppled.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; "It was a total regeneration", writes Gleizes, "indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realized that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it".&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; 
The evolution towards rectilinearity and simplified forms continued through 1909 with greater emphasis on clear geometric principles; visible in the works of [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] and [[Robert Delaunay]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (First English edition: Cubism, Unwin, London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-war: analysis and synthesis====
The Cubist method leading to 1912 has been considered 'analytical', entailing the decomposition of the subject matter (the study of things), while subsequently 'synthetic', built on geometric construction (free of such primary study). The terms Analytic Cubism and Synthetic Cubism originated through this distinction.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; By 1913 Cubism had transformed itself considerably in the range of spatial effects.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; At the 1913 Salon des Indépendants Jean Metzinger exhibited his monumental ''[[L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)|L'Oiseau bleu]]''; Robert Delaunay ''L'équipe du Cardiff F.C.''; [[Fernand Léger]] ''Le modèle nu dans l'atelier''; Juan Gris ''L'Homme au Café''; and Albert Gleizes ''[[Les Joueurs de football]]''. At the 1913 Salon d'Automne, a salon in which the predominating tendency was Cubism, Metzinger exhibited ''[[En Canot]]''; Gleizes ''Les Bâteaux de Pêche''; and [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] ''La Conquête de l'Air''.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; In these works, more so than before, can be seen the importance of the geometric plane in the overall composition.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt;

Historically, the first phase of Cubism is identified as much by the inventions of Picasso and Braque (amongst the so-called Gallery Cubists) as it is with the common interests towards geometrical structure of Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay and Le Fauconnier (the Salon Cubists).&lt;ref name="Gris"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=QsMZQW1LpCkC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=correspondence+Juan+Gris,+Maurice+Raynal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=omG4wHCpDC&amp;sig=jyC3HCXNGm4X7vTF98ybQOyk3Wc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qeprVfHJBMz9Ur-NgLAI&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=correspondence%20Juan%20Gris%2C%20Maurice%20Raynal&amp;f=false Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin von Maur, Whitechapel Art Gallery, ''Juan Gris: Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 18 September -29 November 1992: Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, 18 December 1992 - 14 February 1993: Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, 6 March - 2 May 1993'', Yale University Press, 1992, pp. 6, 22-60]. {{ISBN|0300053746}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Cubism would evolve pictorially, so too would the crystallization of its theoretical framework advance beyond the guidelines set out in the Cubist manifesto ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', written by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger in 1912; though ''Du "Cubisme"'' would remain the clearest and most intelligible definition of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;

===War years: 1914-1918===

At the outset of the First World War many artists were mobilized: Metzinger, Gleizes, Braque, Léger, de La Fresnaye, and [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon|Duchamp-Villon]]. Despite the brutal interruption, each found the time to continue making art, sustaining differing types of Cubism. Yet they discovered a ubiquitous link between the Cubist syntax (beyond pre-war attitudes) and that of the anonymity and novelty of mechanized warfare. Cubism evolved as much a result of an ''evasion'' of the inconceivable atrocities of war as of nationalistic pressures. Along with the evasion came the need to diverge further and further away from the depiction of things. As the rift between art and life grew, so too came the burgeoning need for a process of distillation.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Josette 1916 Juan Gris.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Gris]], October 1916, ''Portrait of Josette Gris'', 116 x 73 cm, [[Museo Reina Sofia]]]]
This period of profound reflection contributed to the constitution of a new [[mindset]]; a prerequisite for fundamental change. The ''flat surface'' became the starting point for a revaluation of the fundamental principles of painting.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; Rather than relying on the purely intellectual, the focus now was on the immediate experience of the senses, based on the idea according to Gleizes, that form, 'changing the directions of its movement, will change its dimensions' ["La forme, modifiant ses directions, modifiait ses dimensions"], while revealing the "basic elements" of painting, the "true, solid rules - rules which could be generally applied". It was Metzinger and Gris who, again according to Gleizes, "did more than anyone else to fix the basic elements... the first principles of the order that was being born".&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; "But Metzinger, clear-headed as a physicist, had already discovered those rudiments of construction without which nothing can be done."&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; Ultimately, it was Gleizes who would take the synthetic factor furthest of all.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

The divers Cubist considerations manifested prior to World War I—such as the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]], dynamism of modern life, and [[Henri Bergson]]'s concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]—had now been replaced by a formal reference frame which constituted the second phase of Cubism, based upon an elementary set of principles that formed a cohesive Cubist aesthetic.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; This clarity and sense of order spread to almost all of the artists exhibiting at [[Léonce Rosenberg]]'s gallery—including Jean Metzinger, Juan Gris, [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Henry Laurens]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Gino Severini]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]—leading to the descriptive term 'Crystal Cubism', coined by [[Maurice Raynal]],&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; an early promoter of Cubism and continuous supporter during the war and post-war phase that followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/research/leonard-lauder-research-center/programs-and-resources/index-of-cubist-art-collectors/lipchitz Anna Jozefacka, Leonard A.

The other was Juan Gris, who was 'certainly the fiercest of the purists in the group'.&lt;ref name="Cottington 2004" /&gt;

In 1915, while serving on the front line, Raynal suffered a minor shrapnel wound to the knee from exploding enemy artillery fire, though the injury did not necessitate his evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers/issue/L'Intransigeant/1915/7/9 ''L'Intransigeant'', 9 July 1915, p. 2, National Library of France]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning from the front line, Raynal served briefly as director for publications of Rosenberg's l'Effort moderne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers/issue/ ''Le Siècle'', 8 April 1919, p. 3, National Library of France]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k74806n/f108.image ''Lectures'', Le Nouveau Spectateur, No. 5, 10 July 1919, Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France]&lt;/ref&gt; For Raynal, research into art was based on an eternal truth, rather than on the ideal, on reality, or on certitude. Certitude was nothing more than based on a relative belief, while truth was in agreement with fact. The only belief was in the veracity of philosophical and scientific truths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k56993423/texteBrut Maurice Raynal, ''Quelques Intentions du Cubisme'', éditions de L'Effort moderne, Paris, 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Direct reference to observed reality" is present, but the emphasis is placed on the "self-sufficiency" of the artwork as objects unto themselves. The priority on "orderly qualities" and the "autonomous purity" of compositions are a prime concern, writes art historian Christopher Green.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; Crystal Cubism also coincided with the emergence of a methodical framework of theoretical essays on the topic,&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; by Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, Fernand Léger, [[Gino Severini]], Pierre Reverdy, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, and Maurice Raynal.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

===Metzinger===
Even before Raynal coined the term Crystal Cubism, one critic by the name of Aloës Duarvel, writing in ''L'Elan'', referred to Metzinger's entry exhibited at Galerie [[Bernheim-Jeune]] as 'jewellery' ("joaillerie").&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaf191601-01.2.19&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------# ''La Tombola artistique au profit des artistes polonais victimes de la guerre'', 28 décembre 1915 au 15 janvier 1916, Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, 25, boulevard de la Madeleine, published in L'Elan, Number 8, January 1916]&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic, Aurel, writing in ''L'Homme Enchaîné'' about the same December 1915 exhibition described Metzinger's entry as "a very erudite divagation of horizon blue and old red of glory, in the name of which I forgive him" [''une divagation fort érudite en bleu horizon et vieux rouge de gloire, au nom de quoi je lui pardonne''].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k75938157/f1.image ''Échos, 1915 et la peinture'', L'Homme Enchaîné, Paris, A3, No. 455, Saturday, 8 January 1916 (front page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the year 1916, Sunday discussions at the studio of Lipchitz, included Metzinger, Gris, Picasso, [[Diego Rivera]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], [[André Salmon]], [[Max Jacob]], and [[Blaise Cendrars]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9–24&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter written in Paris by Metzinger to Albert Gleizes in Barcelona during the war, dated 4 July 1916, he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;After two years of study I have succeeded in establishing the basis of this new perspective I have talked about so much. It is not the materialist perspective of Gris, nor the romantic perspective of Picasso. It is rather a metaphysical perspective—I take full responsibility for the word. You can't begin to imagine what I've found out since the beginning of the war, working outside painting but for painting. The geometry of the fourth space has no more secret for me. Previously I had only intuitions, now I have certainty. I have made a whole series of theorems on the laws of displacement [''déplacement''], of reversal [''retournement''] etc. I have read [[Pieter Hendrik Schoute|Schoute]], [[Bernhard Riemann|Rieman]] (sic), [[Jean-Robert Argand|Argand]], [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] etc.

The actual result? A new harmony. Don't take this word harmony in its ordinary [''banal''] everyday sense, take it in its original [''primitif''] sense. Everything is number. The mind [''esprit''] hates what cannot be measured: it must be reduced and made comprehensible.

That is the secret. There in nothing more to it [''pas de reste à l'opération'']. Painting, sculpture, music, architecture, ''lasting art'' is never anything more than a mathematical expression of the relations that exist between the internal and the external, the self [''le moi''] and the world. (Metzinger, 4 July 1916)&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/Du%20Cubisme/Part%20One/analytical%20and%20synthetic.html#anchor212039 Peter Brooke, ''Higher Geometries, Precedents: Charles Henry and Peter Lenz, The subjective experience of space, Metzinger, Gris and Maurice Princet'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 'new perspective' according to [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "was a mathematical relationship between the ideas in his mind and the exterior world".&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; The 'fourth space' for Metzinger was the space of the mind.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;
 
In a second letter to Gleizes, dated 26 July 1916, Metzinger writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If painting was an end in itself it would enter into the category of the minor arts which appeal only to physical pleasure... No. Painting is a language—and it has its syntax and its laws. To shake up that framework a bit to give more strength or life to what you want to say, that isn't just a right, it's a duty; but you must never lose sight of the End. The End, however, isn't the subject, nor the object, nor even the picture—the End, it is the idea. (Metzinger, 26 July 1916)&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Continuing, Metzinger mentions the differences between himself and Juan Gris:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone from whom I feel ever more distant is Juan Gris. I admire him but I cannot understand why he wears himself out with decomposing objects. Myself, I am advancing towards synthetic unity and I don't analyze any more. I take from things what seems to me to have meaning and be most suitable to express my thought. I want to be direct, like Voltaire. No more metaphors. Ah those stuffed tomatoes of all the St-Pol-Roux of painting.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the ideas expressed in these letters to Gleizes were reproduced in an article written by the writer, poet, and critique [[Paul Dermée]], published in the magazine ''[[Pierre Albert-Birot|SIC]]'' in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaz19190330-01.2.14&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------# ''Jean Metzinger, Une Esthétique'', by Paul Dermée, SIC, Volume 4, Nos. 42, 43, March 30 and April 15, 1919, p. 336]. Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt; but the existence of letters themselves remained unknown until the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

While Metzinger's process of distillation is already noticeable during the latter half of 1915, and conspicuously extending into early 1916, this shift is signaled in the works of Gris and Lipchitz from the latter half of 1916, and particularly between 1917 and 1918. Metzinger's radical geometrization of form as an underlying architectural basis for his 1915-16 compositions is already visible in his work circa 1912-13, in paintings such as ''[[Au Vélodrome]]'' (1912) and ''[[Le Fumeur]]'' (c.1913). Where before, the perception of depth had been greatly reduced, now, the depth of field was no greater than a bas-relief.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Metzinger's evolution toward synthesis has its origins in the configuration of flat squares, trapezoidal and rectangular planes that overlap and interweave, a "new perspective" in accord with the "laws of displacement". In the case of ''[[Le Fumeur]]'' Metzinger filled in these simple shapes with gradations of color, wallpaper-like patterns and rhythmic curves. So too in ''[[Au Vélodrome]]''. But the underlying armature upon which all is built is palpable. Vacating these non-essential features would lead Metzinger on a path towards ''[[Soldier at a Game of Chess]]'' (1914–15), and a host of other works created after the artist's demobilization as a medical orderly during the war, such as ''L'infirmière'' (''The Nurse'') location unknown, and ''[[Femme au miroir]]'', private collection.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the beauty of a painting solely depends on its pictorial qualities: only retaining certain elements, those that seem to suit our need for expression, then with these elements, building a new object, an object which we can adapt to the surface of the painting without subterfuge. If that object looks like something known, I take it increasingly for something of no use. For me it is enough for it to be "well done", to have a perfect accord between the parts and the whole. (Jean Metzinger, quoted in ''Au temps des Cubistes, 1910-1920'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/jean-metzinger-femme-et-paysage-a-laqueduc-5556907-details.aspx#top Jean Metzinger, quoted in ''Au temps des Cubistes, 1910-1920'', exhibition catalogue, Paris, Galerie Berès, 2006, p. 432. Reproduced in Christie's Paris, 2 May 2012, Lot 23 notes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Metzinger, the Crystal period was synonymous with a return to "a simple, robust art".&lt;ref name="Metzinger"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/modernfrenc00rayn Jean Metzinger, quoted in [[Maurice Raynal]], ''Modern French Painters'', Tudor Publishing Co., New York, 1934, p. 125] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606010101/https://archive.org/details/modernfrenc00rayn |date=2015-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal Cubism represented an opening up of possibilities. His belief was that technique should be simplified and that the "trickery" of [[chiaroscuro]] should abandoned, along with the "artifices of the palette".&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt; He felt the need to do without the "multiplication of tints and detailing of forms without reason, by feeling":&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

:"Feeling! It is like the expression of the old-school tragedian in acting! I want clear ideas, frank colors. 'No color, nothing but nuance', [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]] used to say; but Verlaine is dead, and Homer is not afraid to handle color". (Metzinger)&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

Juan Gris' late arrival on the Cubist scene (1912) saw him influenced by the leaders of the movement: Picasso, of the 'Gallery Cubists' and Metzinger of the 'Salon Cubists'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=d5wXeMFxA2IC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=John+Golding,+Visions+of+the+Modern,+seen+by+many+as+the+leader+of+the+%27Salon%27+Cubists John Golding, ''Visions of the Modern''], University of California Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0520087925}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aN9MriMKsE ''Picasso Posse: The Mona Lisa of Cubism'', Michael Taylor, 2010, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1 Audio Stop 439, Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt; His entry at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants, ''Hommage à Pablo Picasso'', was also an homage to Metzinger's ''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)#The total image|Le goûter (Tea Time)]]''. ''Le goûter'' persuaded Gris of the importance of mathematics (numbers) in painting.&lt;ref&gt;''John Richardson: A Life of Picasso, volume II, 1907–1917'', ''The Painter of Modern Life'', Jonathan Cape, London, 1996, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

As art historian Peter Brooke points out, Gris started painting persistently in 1911 and first exhibited at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants (a painting entitled ''Hommage à Pablo Picasso''). "He appears with two styles", writes Brooke, "In one of them a grid structure appears that is clearly reminiscent of the ''Goûter'' and of Metzinger's later work in 1912. In the other, the grid is still present but the lines are not stated and their continuity is broken".&lt;ref name="P. Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/Du%20Cubisme/Part%20One/geometries Peter Brooke, ''On "Cubism" in context'', online since 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Christopher Green writes that the "deformations of lines" allowed by mobile perspective in the head of Metzinger's ''Tea-time'' and Gleizes's ''[[Portrait of Jacques Nayral]]'' "have seemed tentative to historians of Cubism. In 1911, as the key area of likeness and unlikeness, they more than anything released the laughter." Green continues, "This was the wider context of Gris's decision at the Indépendants of 1912 to make his debut with a ''Homage to Pablo Picasso'', which was a portrait, and to do so with a portrait that responded to Picasso's portraits of 1910 through the intermediary of Metzinger's ''Tea-time''.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QsMZQW1LpCkC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=juan+gris+portrait+of+Picasso,+Metzinger+tea-time Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin Von Maur, ''Juan Gris: &amp;#91;catalogue of the Exhibition&amp;#93;'', 1992, London and Otterlo, p. 160]&lt;/ref&gt; While Metzinger's distillation is noticeable during the latter half of 1915 and early 1916, this shift is signaled in the works of Gris and Lipchitz from the latter half of 1916, and particularly between 1917 and 1918.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

[[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|Kahnweiler]] dated the shift in style of Juan Gris to the summer and autumn of 1916, following the ''[[Pointillism|pointilliste]]'' paintings of early 1916;&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; in which Gris brought into practice [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] theory via the incorporation of colored dots into his Cubist pictures.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; This timescale corresponds with the period after which Gris signed a contract with Léonce Rosenberg, following a rally of support by [[Henri Laurens]], Lipchitz and Metzinger.&lt;ref name="Derouet, 1996"&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rvart_0035-1326_1996_num_113_1_348280 Christian Derouet, ''Le cubisme "bleu horizon" ou le prix de la guerre.

"Here is the man who has meditated on everything modern", writes [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] in his 1913 publication ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations]]'', "here is the painter who paints to conceive only new structures, whose aim is to draw or paint nothing but materially pure forms". Apollinaire compares the work of Gris with the "scientific cubism" of Picasso... "Juan Gris is content with purity, scientifically conceived. The conceptions of Juan Gris are always pure, and from this purity parallels are sure to spring".&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=UZ4Gu7a7V9UC&amp;pg=PA220 Herschel Browning Chipp, Peter Selz, ''Theories of Modern Art: A Source Book by Artists and Critics'', University of California Press, 1968, pp. 221-248], {{ISBN|0-520-01450-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2"&gt;[http://modjourn.org/render.php?id=1299783137937502&amp;view=mjp_object The Little Review: Quarterly Journal of Art and Letters, Vol. 9, No. 2: Miscellany Number, Anderson, Margaret C.

In 1916, drawing from black and white postcards representing works by [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] and [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], Gris created a series of classical (traditionalist) Cubist figure paintings, employing a purified range of pictorial and structural features. These works set the tone for his quest of an ideal unity for the next five years.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;

"These themes of pictorial architecture and the "constants" of tradition were consolidated and integrated", writes Green ''et al''; "The inference was there to be drawn: to restore tradition was to restore not only an old subject-matter in new terms, but to find the unchanging principles of structure in painting. Cohesion in space (composition) and cohesion in time (Corot ''in'' Gris) were presented as a single, fundamental truth".&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; Gris himself stressed the relativity and ephemerality of "truth" in his paintings (as a function of him) as in the world itself (as a function of society, culture and time); always susceptible to change.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;

From 1915 to late 1916, Gris transited through three different styles of Cubism, writes Green: "starting with a solid extrapolation of the structures and materials of objects, moving into the placement of brilliant coloured dots drifting across flat signs for still-life objects, and culminating in a flattened 'chiaroscoro' realised in planar contrasts of a monochromatic palette".&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;

Gris's works from late 1916 through 1917, more so than before, exhibit a simplification of geometric structure, a blurring of the distinction between objects and setting, between subject matter and background. The oblique overlapping planar constructions, tending away from equilibrium, can best be seen in the artists ''Woman with Mandolin, after Corot'' (September 1916) and in its epilogue ''Portrait of Josette Gris'' (October 1916).&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

[[File:27. Mujer sentada.jpg|thumb|left|Juan Gris, 1917, ''Seated Woman'' (''Mujer sentada''), 116 × 73 cm, [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]]]
The clear-cut underlying geometric framework of these works seemingly control the finer elements of the compositions; the constituent components, including the small planes of the faces, become part of the unified whole. Though Gris certainly had planned the representation of his chosen subject matter, the abstract armature serves as the starting point. The geometric structure of Juan Gris's Crystal period is already palpable in ''Still Life before an Open Window, Place Ravignan'' (June 1915). The overlapping elemental planar structure of the composition serves as a foundation to flatten the individual elements onto a unifying surface, foretelling the shape of things to come. In 1919 and particularly 1920, artists and critics began to write conspicuously about this 'synthetic' approach, and asserting its importance in the overall scheme of advanced Cubism.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

In April 1919, following exhibitions by Laurens, Metzinger, Léger and Braque, Gris present nearly fifty works at Rosenberg's Galerie de l'Effort moderne.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; This first [[Solo show (art exhibition)|solo exhibition]] by Gris&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_artista/248 Juan Gris, Biography and Works, Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/1076 Juan Gris, Collection Online, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; coincided with his prominence among the Parisian avant-garde. Gris was presented to the public as one of the 'purest' and one of the most 'classical' of the leading Cubists.&lt;ref name="Gris, MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection//browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A2349&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=6&amp;sort_order=1&amp;section_id=T034990 Christopher Green, Juan Gris, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gris claimed to manipulate flat abstract planar surfaces first, and only in subsequent stages of his painting process would he 'qualify' them so that the subject-matter became readable. He worked 'deductively' on the global concept first, then consecrated on the perceptive details. Gris referred to this technique as 'synthetic', in contradistinction from the process of 'analysis' intrinsic to his earlier works.&lt;ref name="Gris, MoMA" /&gt;

Gris's open window series of 1921-22 appears to be a response to Picasso's open windows of 1919, painted in St. Raphael.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; By May 1927, the date of his death, Gris had been considered ''the'' leader of the second phase of Cubism (the Crystal period).&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;

===Picasso===
While Metzinger and Gris were painting in advanced geometric form during the second phase of Cubism,  Picasso worked on several projects simultaneously. Between 1915 and 1917, he began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of collage. "Hard-edged square-cut diamonds", notes art historian John Richardson, "these gems do not always have upside or downside".&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=AxcsQXDHd7YC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22crystal+cubism%22,+A+Life+of+Picasso:+The+Triumphant+Years,+1917-1932&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hQhsVb6sG8K8UeuVg8AP&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22crystal%20cubism%22%2C%20A%20Life%20of%20Picasso%3A%20The%20Triumphant%20Years%2C%201917-1932&amp;f=false John Richardson, ''A Life of Picasso: The Triumphant Years, 1917-1932'', Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, Dec 24, 2008, pp. 77-78], {{ISBN|030749649X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Juan Gris to Maurice Raynal, 23 May 1917, Kahnweiler-Gris 1956, 18&lt;/ref&gt; "We need a new name to designate them," wrote Picasso to [[Gertrude Stein]]: Maurice Raynal suggested "Crystal Cubism".&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Morand, 1996, 19 May 1917, p. 143-4&lt;/ref&gt; These "little gems" may have been produced by Picasso in response to critics who had claimed his defection from the movement, through his experimentation with classicism within the so-called [[return to order]].&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;

===Csaky, Laurens and Lipchitz===
[[File:Joseph Csaky, Deux figures, 1920, relief, limestone, polychrome, 80 cm, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Holland.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Csaky]], ''Deux figures'', 1920, relief, limestone, polychrome, 80&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], Otterlo]]
[[Joseph Csaky]] enlisted as a volunteer in the French army in 1914, fighting alongside French soldiers during [[World War I]], and remained for the duration. Returning to Paris in 1918, Csaky began a series of [[Cubist sculpture]]s derived in part from a machine-like aesthetic; streamlined with geometric and mechanical affinities. By this time Csaky's artistic vocabulary had evolved considerably from his pre-war Cubism: it was distinctly mature, showing a new, refined sculptural quality. Few works of early modern sculpture are comparable to the work Csaky produced in the years directly succeeding World War I. These were nonrepresentational freely-standing objects, i.e., abstract three-dimensional constructions combining organic and geometric elements. "Csaky derived from nature forms which were in concordance with his passion for architecture, simple, pure, and psychologically convincing." (Maurice Raynal, 1929)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0T8LAAAAIAAJ Edith Balas, 1998, ''Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture''], Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar Edith Balas writes of Csaky's sculpture following the war years:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Csáky, more than anyone else working in sculpture, took Pierre Reverdy's theoretical writings on art and cubist doctrine to heart. "Cubism is an eminently plastic art; but an art of creation, not of reproduction and interpretation." The artist was to take no more than "elements" from the external world, and intuitively arrive at the "idea" of objects made up of what for him constant in value. Objects were not to be analyzed; neither were the experiences they evoked. They were to be re-created in the mind, and thereby purified. By some unexplained miracle the "pure" forms of the mind, an entirely autonomous vocabulary, of (usual geometric) forms, would make contact with the external world." (Balas, 1998, p. 27)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These 1919 works (e.g., ''Cones and Spheres, Abstract Sculpture'', Balas, pp.&amp;nbsp;30–41)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt; are made of juxtaposing sequences of rhythmic geometric forms, where light and shadow, mass and the void, play a key role. Though almost entirely abstract, they allude, occasionally, to the structure of the human body or modern machines, but the semblance functions only as "elements" (Reverdy) and are deprived of descriptive narrative. Csaky's polychrome reliefs of the early 1920s display an affinity with [[Purism (arts)|Purism]]—an extreme form of the Cubism aesthetic developing at the time—in their rigorous economy of architectonic symbols and the use of crystalline geometric structures.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

Csaky's ''Deux figures'', 1920, [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], employs broad planar surfaces accented by descriptive linear elements comparable to Georges Valmier's work of the following year (''Figure'' 1921).&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpdubs.hautetfort.com/archive/2007/04/04/cubisme.html Georges Valmier, ''Figure'', 1921, oil on canvas, 97.1 x 74.9 cm]&lt;/ref&gt; Csaky's influences were drawn more from the [[art of ancient Egypt]] rather than from French [[Neoclassicism]].&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

[[File:Jacques Lipchitz, 1918, Le Guitariste (The Guitar Player).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacques Lipchitz]], 1918, ''Le Guitariste'' (''The Guitar Player'')]]
With this intense flurry of activity, Csaky was taken on by [[Léonce Rosenberg]], and exhibited regularly at the Galerie l'Effort Moderne. By 1920 Rosenberg was the sponsor, dealer and publisher of [[Piet Mondrian]], Léger, Lipchitz and Csaky. He had just published ''Le Néo-Plasticisme''—a collection of writings by Mondrian—and Theo van Doesburg's ''Classique-Baroque-Moderne''. Csaky's showed a series of works at Rosenberg's gallery in December 1920.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

[[File:Jacques Lipchitz, 1918, Still Life, bas relief, stone.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Jacques Lipchitz]], 1918, ''Instruments de musique'' (''Still Life''), bas relief, stone]]
For the following three years, Rosenberg purchased Csaky's entire artistic production. In 1921 Rosenberg organized an exhibit titled ''Les maîtres du Cubisme'', a group show that featured works by Csaky, Gleizes, Metzinger, Mondrian, Gris, Léger, Picasso, Laurens, Braque, Herbin, Severini, Valmier, Ozenfant and Survage.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

Csaky's works of the early 1920s reflect a distinct form of Crystal Cubism, and were produced in a wide variety of materials, including marble, onyx and rock crystal. They reflect a collective spirit of the time, "a puritanical denial of sensuousness that reduced the cubist vocabulary to rectangles, verticals, horizontals," writes Balas, "a Spartan alliance of discipline and strength" to which Csaky adhered in his ''Tower Figures.'' "In their aesthetic order, lucidity, classical precision, emotional neutrality, and remoteness from visible reality, they should be considered stylistically and historically as belonging to the [[De Stijl|De Stijl movement]]." (Balas, 1998)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

[[Jacques Lipchitz]] recounted a meeting during the First World War with the poet and writer close to the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], [[Jules Romains]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I remember in 1915 when I was deeply involved in cubist sculpture but was still in many ways not certain of what I was doing, I had a visit from the writer Jules Romains, and he asked me what I was trying to do. I answered, "I would like to make an art as pure as a crystal." And he answered in a slightly mocking way, "What do you know about crystals?" At first I was upset by this remark and his attitude, but then, as I began to think about it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3258970.pdf.bannered.pdf ''Jacques Lipchitz, his life in sculpture'', The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series, Vol. 30, No. 6 (Jun. - Jul., 1972), published by The Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 285] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both Lipchitz and [[Henri Laurens]]—late adherents to Cubist sculpture, following [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Otto Gutfreund]] and Picasso—began production in late 1914, and 1915 (respectively), taking Cubist paintings of 1913-14 as a starting point.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up Douglas Cooper, "The Cubist Epoch"], Phaidon Press Limited, 1970, in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Lipchitz and Laurens retained highly figurative and legible components in their works leading up to 1915-16, after which naturalist and descriptive elements were muted, dominated by a synthetic style of Cubism under the influence of Picasso and Gris.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

Between 1916 and 1918 Lipchitz and Laurens developed a breed of advanced wartime Cubism (primarily in sculpture) that represented a process of purification. With observed reality no longer the basis for the depiction of subject, model or motif, Lipchitz and Laurens created works that excluded any starting point, based predominantly on the imagination, and continued to do so during the transition from war to peace.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

In December 1918 Laurens, a close friend of both Picasso and Braque, inaugurated the series of Cubist exhibitions at L'Effort Moderne (Lipchitz showed in 1920), by which time his works had wholly approached the Cubist ''[[Return to order|retour à l'ordre]]''. Rather than descriptive, these works were rooted in geometric abstraction; a species of architectural, polychromed multimedia Cubist constructions.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

==Criticism==
[[File:Pablo Picasso, reproduced in L'Elan, Number 9, 12 February 1916.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, ''Femme assise dans un fauteuil'' (''Woman sitting in an armchair''), reproduced in ''L'Elan'', Number 9, 12 February 1916]]
From its first public exhibition in 1911, art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] had voiced his contempt for Cubism. In June 1918, Vauxcelles, writing under the pseudonym Pinturrichio, continued his attack:&lt;ref name="Vauxcelles"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6544512p/f11.image Louis Vauxcelles (Pinturrichio), Le Carnet des ateliers, ''Le Carnet de la Semaine'', 9 June 1918, p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Integral Cubism is crumbling, vanishing, evaporating. Defections, every day, reach the headquarters of pure painting. Soon Metzinger will be the last of his species, representative of an abandoned doctrine. "And if one shall remain, he'll whisper painfully, I'll be the one". (Vauxcelles, 1918)&lt;ref name="Vauxcelles" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following month, Vauxcelles forecast the final demise of Cubism by the fall of 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Vauxcelles (Pinturrichio), De Profundis, ''Le Carnet de la Semaine'', 28 July 1918, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall came the end of the war, and in December, a series of exhibitions at Galerie l'Effort Moderne of Cubist works demonstrated that Cubism was still alive.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Defections by [[Diego Rivera]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|André Favory|fr}} from the Cubist circle, cited by Pinturrichio, proved to be insufficient grounds upon which to base his prediction. Vauxcelles even went as far as organizing a small exhibition at the galerie Blot (late 1918) of artists that appeared to be anti-Cubist; Lhote, Rivera and Favory among them. Allies in Vauxcelles ongoing battle against Cubism included Jean-Gabriel Lemoine (''L'Intransigeant''), Roland Chavenon (''L'Information''), [[Gustave Kahn]] (''L'Heure''), and Waldemar George ({{Interlanguage link multi|Jerzy Waldemar Jarocinski|fr}}), who would soon become one of the leading post-war supporters of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Inversely, once a steadfast supporter of Cubism, [[André Salmon]] in 1917-18 predicted too its demise; claiming it to have been merely a phase leading to a new art-form more closely attuned with nature. Two more former advocates of Cubism had also defected, {{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Allard|fr}} and [[Blaise Cendrars]], joining the ranks of Vauxcelles in frontline attacks on Cubism. Allard reproached the visible distancing of Cubism from the dynamism and diversity of lived experience toward a universe of purified objects. Similarly, Cendrars wrote in an article published May 1919 "The formulae of the Cubists' are becoming too narrow, and can no longer embrace the personality of the painters".&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blaise Cendrars, ''Modernités, I, Quelle sera la nouvelle peinture?'', La Rose Rouge, 3 May 1919. Reproduced in Aujourd'hui, Paris 1931, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter attacks===

The poet and theorist [[Pierre Reverdy]] had surpassed all rivals in his attacks on the anti-Cubist campaign between 1918 and 1919. He had been in close contact with the Cubists prior to the war, and in 1917 joined forces with two other poets who shared his points of view: [[Paul Dermée]] and [[Vicente Huidobro]]. In March of the same year Reverdy edited ''Nord-Sud''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/title.html?titleURN=urn:PUL:bluemountain:bmtnaaw Pierre Reverdy, ''Nord-Sud''], Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the magazine was inspired by the [[Paris Métro]] line that extended from Montmartre to Montparnasse, linking these two focal points of artistic creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Breton]], ''Œuvres complètes No. 1'', Gallimard, La Pléiade, 1988, note 3, p. 1075&lt;/ref&gt; Reverdy began this project towards the end of 1916, with an art world still under the pressures of war, to show the parallels between the poetic theories of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] of [[Max Jacob]] and himself in marking the burgeoning of a new era for poetry and artistic reflection. In ''Nord-Sud'' Reverdy, with the help of Dermée and [[Georges Braque]], exposed his literary theories, and outlined a coherent theoretical stance on the latest developments in Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;Étienne-Alain Hubert, note au tome 1 des ''Œuvres complètes'' de Pierre Reverdy, [[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]], page 1298&lt;/ref&gt; His treatise ''On Cubism'', published in the first issue of ''Nord-Sud'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaw19170315-01&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- Pierre Reverdy, ''Sur le Cubisme'', Nord-Sud, Volume 1, Number 1, 15 March 1917, pp. 5-7], Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt; did so perhaps most influentially.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reverdy"&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaw191810-01.2.5&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------# Pierre Reverdy, ''Arts'', Nord-Sud, Volume 2, Number 16, October 1918, p. 4], Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt; With his characteristic preference for offense rather than defense, Reverdy launched an attack against Vauxcelles' anti-Cubist crusade:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How many times has it been said that the art movement called Cubism is extinguished? Each time that a purge occurs the critics of the other side, who ask only that their desires be taken as facts, shout defection and howl for its death. This is nothing basically but a ruse, because Pinturrichichio [''sic''], of the ''Carnet de la Semaine'' and the others know very well that the serious artists of this group are extremely happy to see go... those opportunists who have taken over creations the significance of which they do not even comprehend, and were attracted only by the love of buzz and personal interest. It was predictable that these unrecommendable and compromising people would renounce their endeavors sooner or later. (Reverdy, 1918)&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reverdy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Pablo Picasso, reproduced in L'Elan, Number 10, 1 December 1916.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, reproduced in ''L'Elan'', Number 10, 1 December 1916]]
Another vigorous supporter of Cubism was the art dealer and collector [[Léonce Rosenberg]]. By the end of 1918—filling in the vacuum left in the wake of [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|D.-H. Kahnweiler]]'s imposed exile—Rosenberg purchased works by almost all of the Cubists. His defense of Cubism would prove to be longer-lasting and wider-ranging than Reverdy's. His first tactical maneuver was to address a letter to ''Le Carnet de la Semaine'' denying the chimerical claim made by Vauxcelles that both Picasso and Gris had defected. Much more poignant and difficult to combat, however, was his second tactical maneuver: a succession of prominent Cubist exhibitions held at the [[Léonce Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]], in Rosenber's [[Hôtel particulier]], 19, rue de la Baume, located in the elegant and stylishly fashionable [[8th arrondissement of Paris]].&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

This series of large exhibitions—including works created between 1914 and 1918 by almost all the major Cubists—began 18 December with Cubist sculptures by Henri Laurens, followed in January 1919 with an exhibition of Cubist paintings by Jean Metzinger, Fernand Léger in February, Georges Braque in March, Juan Gris April, Gino Severini May, and Pablo Picasso in June, marking the climax of the campaign. This well-orchestrated program showed that Cubism was still very much alive,&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; and it would remain so for at least a half-decade. Missing from this sequence of exhibitions were Jacques Lipchitz (who would exhibit in 1920), and those who had left France during the Great War: Robert Delaunay and Albert Gleizes most obviously. Nonetheless, according to Christopher Green, "this was an astonishingly complete demonstration that Cubism had not only continued between 1914 and 1917, having survived the war, but was still developing in 1918 and 1919 in its "new collective form" marked by "intellectual rigor". In the face of such a display of vigour, it really was difficult to maintain convincingly that Cubism was even close to extinction".&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Further evidence to bolster the prediction made by Vauxcelles could have been found in a small exhibition at the Galerie Thomas (in a space owned by a sister of [[Paul Poiret]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Germaine Bongard|fr}}). ''The first exhibition of [[Purism|Purist]] Art'' opened on 21 December 1918, with works by [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and [[Le Corbusier|Charles-Édouard Jeanneret]] (later called Le Corbusier), who claimed to be successors of pre-war Cubism.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers/issue/L'Intransigeant/1921/1/31 ''L'Intransigeant'', 31 January 1921, p. 2, National Library of France]&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings of a Purist manifesto in book-form had been published to coincided with the exhibition, titled ''Après le cubisme'' (After Cubism):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/corbuweb/morpheus.aspx?sysId=13&amp;IrisObjectId=6448&amp;sysLanguage=en-en&amp;itemPos=3&amp;itemSort=en-en_sort_string1%20&amp;itemCount=47&amp;sysParentName=&amp;sysParentId=25 Amédée Ozenfant, Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, ''Après le cubisme'', Éditions des Commentaires, Paris, 1918]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozenfant and Jeanneret felt that Cubism had become too decorative,&lt;ref name="Speiser"&gt;[http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/CorbuCache/2049_2489.pdf Philip Speiser, ''Villa La Rocca'', Fondation Le Corbusier, September 2009, p. 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193059/http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/CorbuCache/2049_2489.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; practiced by so many individuals that it lacked unity, it had become too fashionable. Their clarity of subject matter (more figurative, less abstract than the Cubists) had been welcomed by members of the anti-Cubist camp. They showed works that were a direct result of observation; perspectival space only slightly distorted. Ozenfant and Jeanneret, like Lhote, remained faithful to the Cubist idiom that form should not be abandoned. Some of the works exhibited related directly to the Cubism practiced during the war (such as Ozenfant's ''Bottle, Pipe and Books'', 1918), with flatted planar structures and varying degrees of multiple perspective.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

For Ozenfant and Jeanneret only Crystal Cubism had conserved the geometric rigor of the early Cubist revolution.&lt;ref name="Speiser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La peinture moderne"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lapeinturemodern00ozenuoft Amédée Ozenfant, Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, ''La peinture moderne'', Éditions G. Crès et Cie, 1925]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, in collaboration with [[Max Jacob]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], Ozenfant founded the magazine ''L'Élan'', which he edited until late 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/title.html?titleURN=urn:PUL:bluemountain:bmtnaaf ''L'élan'', Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://modernist-magazines.org/?q=category/categories/lelan Michelle Parker, ''L'Élan and Amédée Ozenfant: Art for Art's Sake?'', DH and Literary Studies, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/571 Amédée Ozenfant, Solomon R. Guggenheim Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 he met Jeanneret, with whom he would join forces between 1918 and 1925 on a venture called [[Purism]]: a variation of Cubism in both painting and architecture.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Susan|title=Ozenfant and Purism: The Evolution of a style 1915–1930|year=1981|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with the pro-Cubist writer, poet, and critique [[Paul Dermée]], Ozenfant and Jeanneret founded the avant-garde journal ''L'Esprit Nouveau'', published from 1920 to 1925. In the last issue, Jeanneret, under the pseudonym Paul Boulard, writes of how the laws of nature were manifested in the shape of crystals; the properties of which were hermetically coherent, both interiorly and exteriorly. In ''La peinture moderne'', under the title ''Vers le crystal'', Ozenfant and Jeanneret liken the properties of crystals with the true Cubist, whose œuvre tends toward the crystal.&lt;ref name="La peinture moderne" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=8qy52T7AJfUC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=%22Toward+the+crystal%22,+Ozenfant+and+Jeanneret&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w1KaVAijYh&amp;sig=XRCGCRUSYeWbnBJprAJ5lTONEQM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3YBqVeLJEYzZU8-RgcgP&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=crystal&amp;f=false Jan de Heer, ''The Architectonic Colour: Polychromy in the Purist Architecture of Le Corbusier'' 010 Publishers, 2009, p. 139], {{ISBN|906450671X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain Cubists have created paintings that can be said to tend toward the perfection of the crystal. These works seem to approach our current needs. The crystal is, in nature, a phenomenon that affects us most because it clearly shows the path to geometric organization. Nature sometimes shows us how forms are built through a reciprocal interplay of internal and external forces... following the theoretical forms of geometry; and man delights in these arrangements because he finds in them justification for his abstract conceptions of geometry: the spirit of man and nature find a factor of common ground, in the crystal... In true Cubism, there something organic that proceeds from the inside to the outside... The universality of the work depends on its plastic purity. (Ozenfant and Jeanneret, 1923-25)&lt;ref name="Speiser" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A second Purist exhibition was held at the Galerie Druet, Paris, in 1921. In 1924 Ozenfant opened a free studio in Paris with [[Fernand Léger]], where he taught with [[Aleksandra Ekster]] and [[Marie Laurencin]].&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Judi Freeman, "Ozenfant, Amédée", Grove Art Online. Retrieved 26 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ozenfant and Le Corbusier wrote ''La Peinture moderne'' in 1925.&lt;ref name="La peinture moderne" /&gt;

In final issue of ''L'élan'', published December 1916, Ozenfant writes: "Le Cubisme est un movement de purism'' (Cubism is a movement of purism).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaf19161201-01&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- Amédée Ozenfant, ''Notes sur le cubisme'', L'élan, Number 10, 1 December 1916, p. 3]. Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt;

And in ''La peinture moderne'', 1923-25, with Cubism visibly still alive and in highly crystalline form, Ozenfant and Jeanneret write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We see the real cubists continue their work, imperturbable; they are also seen to continue their influence on spirits... They will arrive more or less strongly depending on the oscillations of their nature, their tenacity or their concessions and analysis [''tâtonnement''] that are characteristic of artistic creation, to search for a state of clarification, condensation, firmness, intensity, synthesis; they will arrive at a true virtuosity of the game of shapes and colors, as well as a highly developed science of the composition. Overall and despite the personal coefficients, one can discern a tendency towards what might be imaged in saying: ''tendency toward the crystal''.&lt;ref name="La peinture moderne" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Crystal Cubists embraced the stability of everyday life, the enduring and the pure, but too the classical, with all that it signified respecting art and ideal. Order and clarity, right to the core of its Latin roots, was a dominant factor within the circle of Rosenberg's L'Effort moderne. While Lhote, Rivera, Ozenfant and Le Corbusier attempted to attain a compromise between the abstract and nature in their search for another Cubism, all of the Cubists shared common goals. The first, writes Green: "that art should not be concerned with the description of nature... The rejection of [[Realism (arts)|Naturalism]] was intimately bound up with the second basic principle shared by them all: that the work of art, being not an interpretation of anything else, was something in its own right with its own laws". These same sentiments observable from the outset of Cubism were now essential and prevailing to an extent never before seen. There was a third principle that followed from the former that came to light during the Crystal period, again according to Green: "the principle that nature should be approached as no more than the supplier of 'elements' to be pictorially or sculpturally developed and then freely manipulated according to the laws of the medium alone".&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Gleizes' mobilization was not a major obstacle to his production of artwork, though, working primarily on small scale, he did produce one relatively large piece: ''Portrait of an Army Doctor''.&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=QG9wNyIlEAgC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=gleizes,+%22simultaneous+movements+of+translation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8EIKQ9bxba&amp;sig=Ddnuo643ki8Urc433IuNhY4KzwE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9XovVdD_Gor-ygPcioGIBA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gleizes%2C%20%22simultaneous%20movements%20of%20translation%22&amp;f=false Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century'', Yale University Press, 2001], {{ISBN|0300089643}}&lt;/ref&gt; An admirer of his work, his commanding officer—the regimental surgeon portrayed by Gleizes in this painting—made arrangements so that Gleizes could continue to paint while mobilized at Toul.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Guggenheim"&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1445 Albert Gleizes, ''Portrait of an Army Doctor'', Solomon R.

He had now undertaken a path that lead to 'synthesis', with its starting point in 'unity'.&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''Souvenirs: le Cubisme, 1908-1914'', ''La guerre'', Cahiers Albert Gleizes, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Lyon, 1957, p. 15.

This unity, and the highly crystalline geometricized materialization consisting of superimposed constituent planes of Crystal Cubism would ultimately be described by Gleizes, in ''La Peinture et ses lois'' (1922–23), as 'simultaneous movements of translation and rotation of the plane'.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001" /&gt; The synthetic factor was ultimately taken furthest of all from within the Cubists by Gleizes.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Gleizes believed that the Crystal Cubists—specifically Metzinger and Gris—had found the principles on which an essentially non-representational art could be built. He felt that the earlier abstract works of artists such as [[František Kupka]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Henry Valensi|fr}}, lacked a solid foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francisboutle.co.uk/pages.php?cID=9&amp;pID=51 ''July 09: Futurism at the Tate Modern: a review by Peter Brooke'', ''From Cubism to Classicism, Painting and its Laws'', From Cubism to Classicism by Gino Severini / Painting and its laws by Albert Gleizes, Francis Boutle, 2001], {{ISBN|1903427053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1920 publication, ''Du Cubisme et les moyens de le comprendre'', Gleizes explained that Cubism was now at a stage of  development in which fundamental principles could be deduced from particular facts, applicable to a defined class of phenomena, drawn and taught to students. These basic theoretical postulates could be as productive for future developments of the fine arts as the mathematically based principles of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] had been since the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org/form-and-history/poznanski/ Peter Brooke, ''Victor Poznanski and the exhibition L'art d'aujourd'hui, 1925'', ''Gleizes - ups and downs of Cubism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Painting and its Laws''===
[[Albert Gleizes]] undertook the task of writing the characterizations of these principles in ''Painting and its Laws'' (''La Peinture et ses lois''), published by gallery owner Jacques Povolozky in the journal ''La Vie des lettres et des arts'', 1922-3, and as a book in 1924.&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org/form-and-history/poznanski/painting-and-its-laws.html Albert Gleizes, ''Painting and Its Laws'', summary by Peter Brooke]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alibert"&gt;Pierre Alibert, ''Gleizes, Naissance et avenire du cubisme'', Aubin-Visconti, Edition Dumas, Saint-Etienne, October 1982, {{ISBN|2-85529-000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''La Peinture et ses lois'' Gleizes deduces the fundamental laws of painting from the picture plane, its proportions, the movement of the human eye and the physical laws. This theory, subsequently referred to as ''translation-rotation'', "ranks with the writings of Mondrian and Malevich", writes art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "as one of the most thorough expositions of the principles of abstract art, which in his case entailed the rejection not only of representation but also of geometric forms".&lt;ref name="Gleizes, MoMA" /&gt;

One of Gleizes's primary objectives was to answer the questions: How will the planar surface be animated, and by what logical method, independent of the artists ''fantaisie'', can it be attained?&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois"&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''La Peinture et ses lois, Ce qui devait sortir du cubisme'', La Vie des lettres et des arts, 1922-3, 1924 in book form&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes, Action, Cahiers Individualistes de philosophie et d'art, Volume 1, No. 1, February 1920.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Gleizes]], front cover of ''Action, Cahiers Individualistes de philosophie et d'art'', Volume 1, No. 1, February 1920]]
'''The approach:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Gleizes bases these laws both on truisms inherent throughout the history of art, and especially on his own experience since 1912, such as: "The primary goal of art has never been exterior imitation" (p.&amp;nbsp;31); "Artworks come from emotion... the product of individual sensibility and taste" (p.&amp;nbsp;42); "The artist is always in a state of emotion, sentimental exaltation [ivresse]" (p.&amp;nbsp;43); "The painting in which the idea of abstract creation is realized is no longer an anecdote, but a concrete fact" (p.&amp;nbsp;56); "Creating a painted artwork is not the emission of an opinion" (p.&amp;nbsp;59); "The plastic dynamism will be born out of rhythmic relations between objects... establishing novel plastic liaisons between purely objective elements that compose the painting" (p.&amp;nbsp;22).&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''Le Cubisme et la Tradition'', Montjoie, Paris, 10 February 1913, p. 4. Reprinted as ''A Propos du Salon d'Automne'', in ''Tradition et Cubisme'', Paris, 1927. Gleizes outlines what he perceives as the 'decadence' inherent in the modern art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing, Gleizes states that the 'reality' of a painting is not that of a mirror, but of the object... issue of imminent logic (p.&amp;nbsp;62). "The subject-pretext tending toward numeration, inscribed following the nature of the plane, attains a tangent intersections between known images of the natural world and unknown images that reside within intuition" (p.&amp;nbsp;63).&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

'''Defining the laws:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Rhythm and space are for Gleizes the two vital conditions. Rhythm is a consequence of the continuity of certain phenomena, variable or invariable, following from mathematical relations. Space is a conception of the human psyche that follows from quantitative comparisons (pp.&amp;nbsp;35, 38, 51). This mechanism  is the foundation for artistic expression. It is therefor both a philosophical and scientific synthesis. For Gleizes, Cubism was a means to arrive not only at a new mode of expression but above all a new way of thinking. This was, according to art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Alibert (art historian)|fr|Pierre Alibert|lt=Pierre Alibert}}, the foundation of both a new species of painting and an alternative relationship with the world; hence another principle of civilization.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

The problem set out by Gleizes was to replace ''anecdote'' as a starting point for the work of art, by the sole means of using the elements of the painting itself: line, form and color.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

Beginning with a central rectangle, taken as an example of elementary form, Gleizes points out two mechanical ways of juxtaposing form to create a painting: (1) either by reproducing the initial form (employing various [[Symmetry (geometry)|symmetries]] such as reflectional, rotational or translational), or by modifying (or not) its dimensions.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt; (2) By displacement of the initial form; pivoting around an imaginary axis in one direction or another.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

The choice of position (through translation and/or rotation), though based on the inspiration of the artist, is no longer attributed to the anecdotal. An objective and rigorous method, independent of the painter, replaces emotion or sensibility in the determination the placement of form, that is through ''translation'' and ''rotation''.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

'''Schematic illustrations:'''&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 1. Mouvements de translation du plan sur un côté.jpg|thumb|center|500px||&lt;div align="center"&gt;1. Movements of translation of the plane to one side&lt;/div&gt;]]

Space and rhythm, according to Gleizes, are perceptible by the extent of movement (displacement) of planar surfaces. These elemental transformations modify the position and importance of the initial plane, whether they converge or diverge ('recede' or 'advance') from the eye, creating a series of new and separate spatial planes appreciable physiologically by the observer.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 2. Mouvements simultanés de rotation et de translation du plan.jpg|thumb|center|500px|&lt;div align="center"&gt;2. Simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane&lt;/div&gt;]]

Another movement is added to the first movement of translation of the plane to one side: Rotation of the plane. Fig. I shows the resulting formation that follows from simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the initial plane produced on the axis. Fig II and Fig. III represent the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle, inclined to the right and to the left. The axis point at which movement is realized is established by the observer. Fig. IV represents the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle plane, with the position of the eye of the observed displaced left of the axis. Displacement toward the right (though not represented) is straightforward enough to imagine.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 3. Mouvements simultanés de rotation et de translation du plan aboutissant à la création d'un organisme plastique spatial et rythmique.jpg|thumb|center|500px|&lt;div align="center"&gt;3. Simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane resulting in the creation of a spatial and rhythmic plastic organism&lt;/div&gt;]]

With these figures Gleizes attempts to present, under the most simple conditions possible (simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane), the creation of a spatial and rhythmic organism (Fig. VIII), with practically no initiative taken on the part of the artist who controls the evolutionary process. The planar surfaces of Fig. VIII are filled with hatching espousing the 'direction' of the planes. What emerges in the inert plane, according to Gleizes, through the movement followed by the eye of the observer, is "a visible imprint of successive stages of which the initial rhythmic cadence coordinated a succession of differing states". These successive stages permit the perception of space. The initial state, by consequence of the transformation, has become a spatial and rhythmic organism.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 4.

Plastic spatial and rhythmic system obtained by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side&lt;/div&gt;]]

Fig. I and Fig. II obtain mechanically, Gleizes writes, with minimal personal initiative, a "plastic spatial and rhythmic system", by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side. The result is a spatial and rhythmic organism more ''complex'' than shown in Fig. VIII; demonstrating through mechanical, purely plastic means, the realization of a material universe independent of intentional intervention by the artist. This is sufficient to demonstrate, according to Gleizes, the ''possibilities of the plane'' to serve spatially and rhythmically by its own power.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt; [''L'exposé hâtif de cette mécanique purement plastique aboutissant à la réalisation d'un univers matériel en dehors de l'intervention particulière intentionnelle, suffit à démontrer la ''possibilité du plan'' de signifier spatialement et rythmiquement par sa seule puissance''].&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

==The end-product==
Throughout the war, to [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] and the series of exhibitions at [[Léonce Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]] that followed, the rift between art and life—and the overt distillation that came with it—had become the canon of Cubist orthodoxy; and it would persist despite its antagonists through the 1920s:&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Order remained the keynote as post-war reconstruction commenced. It is not surprising, therefore, to find a continuity in the development of Cubist art as the transition was made from war to peace, an unbroken commitment to the Latin virtues along with an unbroken commitment to the aesthetically pure. The new Cubism that emerged, the Cubism of Picasso, Laurens, Gris, Metzinger and Lipchitz most obviously of all, has come to be known as "crystal Cubism". It was indeed the end-product of a progressive closing down of possibilities in the name of a "call to order". (Christopher Green, 1987, p. 37)&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inside Modernism" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More so than the pre-war Cubist period, the Crystal Cubist period has been described by Green as the most important in the history of [[Modernism]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In terms of a Modernist will to aesthetic isolation and of the broad theme of the separation of culture and society, it is actually Cubism ''after'' 1914 that emerges as most important to the history of Modernism, and especially... Cubism between around 1916 and around 1924... Only after 1914 did Cubism come almost exclusively to be identified with a single-minded insistence on the isolation of the art-object in a special category with its own laws and its own experience to offer, a category considered above life. It is Cubism in this later period that has most to tell anyone concerned with the problems of Modernism and post-modernism now, because it was only then that issues emerged with real clarity in and around Cubism which are closely comparable with those that emerged in and around Anglo-American Modernism in the sixties and after. (Green, 1987, Introduction, p. 1)&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Art historian Peter Brooke has commented on Crystal Cubism, and more generally on the Salon Cubists: 
:"A general history of Salon Cubism, however, still needs to be written, a history that could be extended to include the wonderful collective phenomenon which Christopher Green has called 'Crystal Cubism' — the highly structured work of the Cubist painters... who remained in Paris during the war, most notably Metzinger and Gris. An opening up of this early Cubism in all its intellectual fullness would... reveal it as being not only the most radical movement in painting of the past century but, still, the most rich in possibilities for the future".

'''''Deux Nus''''' ('''''Two Nudes''''', '''''Two Women''''' and '''''Dones en un paisatge''''') is an early [[Cubist]] painting by the French artist and theorist [[Jean Metzinger]]. The work was exhibited at the first Cubist manifestation, in Room 41 of the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]], Paris. At this exhibition the Cubist movement was effectively launched before the general public by five artists: [[Jean Metzinger|Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes|Gleizes]], [[Henri le Fauconnier|Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay|Delaunay]] and [[Fernand Léger|Léger]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TU0KwJuBvAsC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=metzinger,+%22two+nudes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mcE1UpfFPMWdtQam9oGgAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=metzinger%2C%20%22two%20nudes%22&amp;f=false, Steve Edwards, Paul Wood, ''Art of the Avant-gardes'', Yale University Press, 2004] {{ISBN|9780300102307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first exhibition during which artists, writers, critics and the public at large encountered and spoke about Cubism.&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the group show is a ''[[succès de scandale]]''.

The following year Metzinger's ''Deux Nus'', titled ''Dones en un paisatge'', was exhibited at [[Galeries Dalmau]], ''Exposició d'Art Cubista'', in Barcelona, 20 April through 10 May 1912 (cat. 45). This was the first [[avant-garde]] art exhibition in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qd60qRgFrrAC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=Exposici%C3%B3+d%27Art+Cubista,+metzinger,+%22Dones+en+un+paisatge%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wQdmvtEYAa&amp;sig=hVt5kegQaCn8gRCJA5GG_C837MY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XB_zVPaMD9PYaoDRgqAI&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Exposici%C3%B3%20d'Art%20Cubista%2C%20metzinger%2C%20%22Dones%20en%20un%20paisatge%22&amp;f=false Mercè Vidal i Jansà, ''1912, l'Exposició d'art cubista de les Galeries Dalmau'', Volume 6 of Les Arts i els artistes: Breviari, Edicions Universitat Barcelona, 1996] {{ISBN|8447513831}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bvsfioiQ8k8C&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=The+Oxford+Critical+and+Cultural+History+of+Modernist,+Exposici%C3%B3+d%27Art+Cubista&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gijzVNmVMsiWatvlgvAF&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Peter Brooker, Sascha Bru, Andrew Thacker, Christian Weikop, ''The Oxford Critical and Cultural History of Modernist Magazines: Europe 1880 - 1940'', Oxford University Press, May 19, 2013] {{ISBN|0199659583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging from stylistic similarities with works such as ''[[Nu à la cheminée]]''—exhibited in Paris at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1910—and the fact that ''Two Nudes'' was exhibited in the spring of 1911 (18 March - 1 May) at the Salon des Indépendants, the painting is believed to have been painted during the latter half of 1910 or the outset of 1911.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt; Metzinger's ''Deux Nus'' (''Two Women'') is in the permanent collection of the [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]] (Göteborgs konstmuseum), Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emp-web-34.zetcom.ch/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=8474&amp;viewType=detailView Gothenburg Museum of Art, Jean Metzinger, ''Two Women'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Metzinger appears to have placed aside his [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] style in favor of the faceting of form associated with analytic Cubism around 1908 or early 1909.&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt; A resident of [[Montmartre]] early on, Metzinger frequented the [[Bateau Lavoir]] and exhibited with [[Georges Braque]] at the [[Berthe Weill]] gallery. By 1910, the robust form of early analytic Cubism of [[Picasso]], Braque and Metzinger (''Nu à la cheminée, Nude'', 1910) had become practically indistinguishable.&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of depicting the two nudes in the foreground, the rocks and trees in the background, from one point of view, Metzinger used a concept he wrote about for the first time in ''Note sur la peinture'' (published in ''Pan'', 1910),&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture'', Pan (Paris), October–November 1910&lt;/ref&gt; of 'mobile perspective' to portray objects from a variety of angles, resulting in a multitude of image fragments or facets. In ''Two Nudes'' the models are captured from multiple spatial view-points and at successive intervals in time shown simultaneously on the canvas.&lt;ref name="Joann Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, Cubist Works, 1910–1921, p.&amp;nbsp;43, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art (J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Patricia Railing writes of Metzinger's ''Two Nudes'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ''Two Nudes'', Metzinger has treated the human body, trees and rocks in exactly the same manner. They are differentiated only by size, or by emphasising planes, from which the Russian term, plos'kost, plane surface, comes directly from the French, surface plane (in distinction to the curved plane). Metzinger sees everything as cubic multiples with which he "builds", as it were, stacking them, interlocking them, and bonding them together. Thus he creates a total environment where figures and setting make up a pictorial unit. [...] Although not particularly apparent due to the haziness of the contemporary photograph of Metzinger’s ''Two Nudes'', such a linear framework was the fundamental ordering principle of his painting and it can be seen clearly in his 1911 canvas, ''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)|Tea Time / Le Goûter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incorm.eu/journal2009/metzinger.pdf Patricia Railing, ''Jean Metzinger and Liubov Popova’s Cubist "Figures"'', InCoRM Journal Vol. 1, No. 1, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The similarity between Metzinger's work of 1910 and that of Picasso is exemplified in his ''[[Nu à la cheminée]]''. Though less so in ''Two Nudes'', both pictures merge the model with the environment, blurring the distinction between background and foreground. Metzinger, however—in contrast to the extreme faceting, simultaneous views and multiple perspective—has rendered his elegant nudes with grace; the tall and slender models expressing tenderness towards one another (with a hand placed on the shoulder).&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;[http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical and philosophical inferences known to have been essential aspects of Metzinger's work had little in common with the paintings of Picasso or Braque. Metzinger's interpretation targeted a wide audience—as opposed to private gallery collectors—exhibiting in abundance an underlying idealism, a temporal reconstruction of dissected subjects based on the principles of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. These inferences were compelling because they offered a stimulating and intelligible rationale for his innovations—consistent with contemporary intellectual trends in literature; notably with the [[Abbaye de Créteil]] group and [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]]'s philosophy.&lt;ref name="Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=%22Nude%22+1910,+Metzinger&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EDDDUfrWCOPL4ATvuYGgDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nude%22%201910%2C%20Metzinger&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism and its Histories'', Manchester University Press, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Two Nudes'', Metzinger depicts motion, not of the subject matter relative to the observer as the [[Futurism|Futurists]] would later portray, but by successive superimposed images captured by the artist in motion relative to (or around) the subject matter. The [[Chronophotography]] of [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]]. Muybridge's sequential photography of movements broken down frame by frame produced in the late 19th century depicting such as ''Females (nude)'', an animation showing two nude women kissing, were known in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. Muybridge often traveled to Europe to promote his work and he met Étienne-Jules Marey in 1881. His freeze-framed images evoked time and motion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Helios.html?id=bwBMAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Philip Brookman, ''Helios: Eadweard Muybridge in a Time of Change'', Corcoran Gallery of Art] in Washington, DC, 2010 {{ISBN|978-3-86521-926-8}} (Steidl).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2010/04/13/125899013/muybridge-the-man-who-made-pictures-move [[Neda Ulaby]], ''Muybridge: The Man Who Made Pictures Move'', 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Eadweard_Muybridge.html?id=VIUaQwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Philip Brookman, with contributions by Marta Braun, Andy Grundberg, Corey Keller and Rebecca Solnit, ''Eadweard Muybridge'', San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Tate Pub., 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1911 Indépendants==

Reproduced frontispiece catalogue Galeries Dalmau, Barcelona, 1912.jpg|Paysage, Landscape]]''. Published in La Publicidad, 26 April 1912 for the occasion of the first Cubist exhibition in Spain, held at Galeries J. Dalmau, ''Exposició d'Art Cubista'', Barcelona]]
In the spring of 1911 the artists soon to be label Cubists made sure they were shown together by infiltrating the placement committee. Le Fauconnier's role as secretary of the salon facilitated the goal of hanging their works together. The result created a scandale. Until then, works hung in alphabetical order of the artists names. In ''Salle 41'' were placed the works of Metzinger, Gleizes, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and [[Marie Laurencin]] (at the request of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]). In room 43 hung works by [[André Lhote]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]], Luc-Albert Moreau and [[André Mare]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Kubisme.info, Salon des Indépendants]&lt;/ref&gt;

This exhibition involved more than 6,400 paintings. In room 42 was a retrospective exhibition of [[Henri Rousseau|Henri (Le Douanier) Rousseau]], who died 2 September 1910. Articles and reviews were numerous and extensive in sheer words employed; including in Gil Blas, Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, L'Oeuvre, and Cri de Paris. Apollinaire wrote a long review in the 20 April 1911 issue of L'Intransigeant.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

Henri Le Fauconnier's ''Abundance'', 1910–11 (Haags Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag), partly due to its large size and partly to the treatment of its subject matter caused a sensation. This painting was soon bought by the Dutchman art critic and painter Conrad Kickert (1882-1965), who was secretary of the Contemporary Art Society ([[:es:Moderne Kunstkring|Moderne Kunstkring]]). In 1934 he donated the painting to the Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

According to Gleizes, the public is outraged by the representation of subject matter as cones, cubes and spheres, resulting in the obscurity of the subject matter. The predominance of sharp geometrical faceting and the fact that a group of artists are all working in similar directions, gives rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although this and similar terms have been used before in artistic circles (usually in relation to the works of Metzinger, Delaunay and Braque), this is the first time the use of the term becomes widespread.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:fr:Roger Allard|Roger Allard]], in his review of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, writes of Metzinger and his ''Two Nudes'':&lt;ref name="Allard"&gt;Roger Allard, ''Sur quelques peintre'', Les Marches du Sud-Ouest, June 1911, pp. 57-64. In Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten, ''A Cubism Reader, Documents and Criticism, 1906-1914'', The University of Chicago Press, 2008, pp. 113-122&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Last year, Jean Metzinger caused an excessive degree of alarm. In carefully considering the canvas of his that caused the scandal ['[[Nu à la cheminée]]'], I found that the most daring possibilities were only barely indicated, and that one ought to be grateful to this poet for certain reserve in applying [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmism]] to painting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In any case, the poetic, and hence instructive, feature of his art has since become sharper. I confess I am very sensitive to the precious charm that surrounds his two figures of nude women. This canvas exudes a real intimacy, thanks to the integration of the setting into the principal strokes, common in Vuillard, for example. (Roger Allard, 1911)&lt;ref name="Allard" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Devil Survivor 2: The Animation'''''|デビルサバイバーツー ジ・アニメーション|Debiru Sabaibā Tsū Ji Animēshon|lead=yes}} is a 2013 Japanese [[anime]] series based on the [[Nintendo DS]] video game, ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2]]'' by [[Atlus]]. The series was directed by [[Seiji Kishi]], with series composition by [[Makoto Uezu]], based on the original story by Atlus and animated by [[Bridge (studio)|Bridge]]. The series stars voice actors [[Hiroshi Kamiya]] as Hibiki Kuze along with [[Nobuhiko Okamoto]], [[Aya Uchida]], [[Junichi Suwabe]] and [[Takahiro Sakurai]]. When a mysterious calamity plunges the world into a state of chaos, Hibiki Kuze and his friends Daichi Shijima and Io Nitta are suddenly thrown from their normal lives into a battle of survival against creatures called Septentriones seeking to bring the world to ruin. Gaining the ability to summon [[demons]] from a [[Mobile app|cell phone app]], Hibiki and his friends team up with an organization known as the JP's to help protect Japan and above all else—survive.

The thirteen episode series premiered in Japan on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] on April 4, 2013 and was subsequently licensed by [[Section23 Films#Sentai Filmworks|Sentai Filmworks]] in North America, Hanabee Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand and by [[MVM Entertainment]] in the United Kingdom for English home video releases. A manga adaptation was serialized in ''[[Gangan Comics#Monthly GFantasy|Monthly GFantasy]]'' between December 2012 and October 2014. A light novel prequel was also published by [[Kodansha Box]]. In addition, two supplementary books and three Drama CDs along with a host of other merchandise were released. Critics praised the series for its dark animation styles and backgrounds. However the majority of reviewers had mixed feelings towards the cast of characters since they felt that while the characters were either not appealing or developed enough, their deaths were impactful to the viewer.

==Plot==
One Sunday afternoon, Hibiki Kuze and Daichi Shijima receive macabre videos from the {{Nihongo foot|Nicaea|ニカイア|Nikaia|group=J}} website which predict their deaths mere seconds before they are involved in a gruesome train accident. They are spared however, when a {{nihongo foot|Demon Summoning App|悪魔召喚アプリ|Akuma Shōkan Apuri|group=J}} installs itself on their phones and allows the duo and schoolmate Io Nitta to escape from carnivorous monsters feasting on the dead in the wrecked subway station. The trio are shocked to discover a massive catastrophe on the surface and take refuge in Roppongi with other panicked citizens. Suddenly, when a creature known as {{Nihongo4|Dubhe|ドゥベ|Duube}} appears and attacks the crowd, Hibiki puts a stop to the carnage by summoning a demon from the app and destroying the creature. This prompts the {{nihongo foot|Japan Meteorological Agency, Geomagnetism Research Department - JP's|気象庁・指定地磁気調査部、「ジプス」|Kishōchō. Shitei Chijiki Chōsa bu, 'Jipusu'|group=J}} to detain Hibiki and his friends and they are brought before its head—Yamato Hotsuin, who enlists their aid in defeating the remaining {{nihongo foot|Septentriones|セプテントリオン|Seputentorion|group=J}} to prevent the end of the world in one week.

Yamato then dispatches them on a mission to retrieve the JP's scientist Fumi Kanno with fellow demon summoners Hinako Kujou and Keita Wakui, which ends up as a success at the cost of Keita's life. Following a devastating battle with {{Nihongo4|Merak|メラク|Meraku}}, Hibiki joins the Resistance leader—Ronaldo Kuriki and learns of [[meritocracy|Yamato's true intentions]] as opposed to [[Egalitarianism|his own]]. As events progress, Airi Ban and Jungo Torii attempt to recapture the JP's base from the Resistance but chaos ensues when {{Nihongo4|Phecda|フェクダ|Fekuda}} appears and targets a defenseless Hibiki. However Yamato arrives and slays the Septentrione, saving Hibiki's life. In the aftermath, Yamato and Ronaldo engage in a heated debate over their ideals and the situation only escalates when Alcor appears and proclaims himself to be the creator of both Nicaea and the Demon Summoning App, which he had hoped would aid humanity in their darkest hour.

An unlikely alliance between the JP's, Resistance and the unaffiliated demon summoners result in the destruction of {{Nihongo4|Megrez|メグレズ|Megurezu}} the following day. While a somber Hibiki struggles to cope with the steep cost of victory, Alcor reveals the true nature of events thus far. He explains it all to be the will of an entity known as {{Nihongo4|Polaris|ポラリス|Porarisu}} as it seeks to erase humanity's "artificial" reality using its Void phenomenon and hence restore the "natural" order. Therefore, it sent the Septentriones to destroy the spiritual barriers protecting Japan from the Void. When Hinako and Airi defeat {{Nihongo4|Alioth|アリオト|Arioto}} the next day, its massive shell plummets from orbit and crushes the city—killing thousands more people and sparking outrage from Hibiki over the lengths Yamato will go to achieve his goal. Unperturbed, Yamato uses Io to summon a demon called Lugh and defeats the next Septentrione—{{Nihongo4|Mizar|ミザール|Mizaaru}}. However, when the demon possesses Io and attempts to kill Yamato for its imprisonment, Hibiki wields the {{Nihongo foot|Dragon Stream|龍脈|Ryumyaku|group=J}} and saves Io.

As the week draws to a close, {{Nihongo4|Benetnasch|ベネトナシュ|Benetonashu}} appears on Saturday and completely destroys the barriers. Upon engaging the creature, Yamato allows the other summoners to die by ignoring them in the battle and ultimately defeats it with Hibiki and Daichi's help. In the aftermath, Alcor decides to support Hibiki and Yamato ends up killing him. Finally, Yamato activates the Transport Terminal to seek an audience with Polaris and Io and Daichi forfeit their lives to give Hibiki a chance at going after Yamato and saving the world. Facing each other in another dimension, Hibiki desperately tries to reach out to Yamato and ultimately overpowers him with aid from his fallen comrades. Polaris then appears and Hibiki asks it to restore the world to the way it was. He then finds himself one week in the past, with his revived friends and his memory intact and reifies the will of humanity to keep on living.

==Production==
[[File:SH-60B helicopter flies over Sendai.jpg|thumb|Director Seiji Kishi compared the destruction depicted in the anime to the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] which struck Japan.]]

[[Makoto Uezu]] was selected as both the script writer and series composer for the anime. In an interview, Uezu commented that he had been a huge fan of the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series since his childhood and that his interests in the [[occult]] and electronic technology aided in the composition. Uezu further remarked that the story followed a "hard path" whereby the heroes were forced into making difficult choices at key points in the plot whilst the characters simultaneously explored sensitive issues related to human ethics and morality.&lt;ref name="DS2A Staff Comments 01"/&gt;

The series' character designs were drawn by Etsushi Sajima and were based on the original designs by Suzuhito Yasuda which received praise from Director Kishi.&lt;ref name="DS2A Staff Comments 01"/&gt; The original designs of the Septentriones were created by Mohiro Kitoh who remarked that since he was not directly engaged in the production process, he had to wait until the finished product was released before he could see the animated versions of his designs.&lt;ref name="DS2A Staff Comments 02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ds2a.jp/special/comment02.html|title=Special｜TVアニメ「デビルサバイバー2」公式サイト［DEVIL SURVIVOR2 the ANIMATION］|publisher=[[Pony Canyon]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=August 25, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815140805/http://ds2a.jp/special/comment02.html|archivedate=August 15, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other half of the series' creatures i.e. the various ''devils'' (demons) used were designed by Hiroyuki Kanbe, while prop designs were done by Hatsue Nakayama and color designs were done by Keiichi Funada. Finally leaving Kazuto Shimoyama to oversee this area of production as the art director. The musical score was composed by [[Kōtarō Nakagawa]]. Nakagawa was initially surprised to have been offered to be the musical composer but took up the role as a challenge.&lt;ref name="DS2A Staff Comments 02"/&gt; In addition to Nagakawa, Sound Direction was done by Satoki Iida along with Sound Effects by Iki Okuda. Other staff members included Assistant Director Yoshimichi Hirai, Animation Designer Eriko Ito, Composite Director Katsufumi Sato, CG Director Yuji Koshida and Ayumu Takahashi as the series Editor and Producer Yasuo Suda.&lt;ref name="DS2A Staff"/&gt;

===Music and audio===

''Devil Survivor 2: The Animation'' uses three pieces of [[theme music]]: one opening theme, one closing theme and one insert song. The theme sequences are not used consistently throughout the series since the episode producers decided to prioritize story-telling to their use which helped keep the plot within thirteen episodes.&lt;ref name="Silverman Review 01"/&gt; The anime debuted with "Take Your Way" by [[Livetune]] feat. [[Sekai no Owari|Fukase]] as the opening theme for the first eight episodes and then from the eleventh.&lt;ref name="Op/Ed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-03-27/devil-survivor-2-anime-theme-songs-previewed-in-2-more-ads|title=''Devil Survivor 2'' Anime's Theme Songs Previewed in 2 More Ads|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=March 27, 2013|accessdate=September 7, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913175411/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-03-27/devil-survivor-2-anime-theme-songs-previewed-in-2-more-ads|archivedate=September 13, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme is not played but credited in both the ninth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Thursday of Shock|series=''Devil Survivor 2: The Animation''|credits=Makoto Uezu|network=[[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]]|airdate=May 30, 2013|time=02:11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tenth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Friday of Farewells|series=''Devil Survivor 2: The Animation''|credits=Makoto Uezu|network=[[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]]|airdate=June 6, 2013|time=03:43}}&lt;/ref&gt; episodes.

A seasonal review column on the [[Anime News Network]] called ''The Stream'' generally made light remarks of the first four episodes. Written by Bamboo Dong, the editor called the series mindlessly fun; jokingly citing how the cell phones are always pointed directly at the demons as if they would be incapable of fighting if it were otherwise. Dong also likened the series as watching someone else play the video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-05-06#ds2|title=#11 - ''Devil Survivor 2 The Animation'' [ep. 1-4]|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=May 6, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2015|first=Bamboo|last=Dong|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309024236/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-05-06#ds2|archivedate=March 9, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designs of the various demons and Septentriones were described as the most interesting part of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-06-03#ds2|title=#14 - ''Devil Survivor 2 The Animation'' [ep. 5-8]|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 3, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2015|first=Bamboo|last=Dong|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405024311/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-06-03#ds2|archivedate=April 5, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the editor described the immense amount of [video game] plot packed into the next batch of four episodes as messy. Dong also referred to the central premise as being pretty dark since it involved the main characters constantly receiving videos showing exactly how their friends would die. The editor gave the series props for not dabbling in the destruction porn taking place since all of the widespread death around Japan is implied, but added that showing some of it would have aided the realism of the story. After reviewing twelve episodes Dong was not able to develop any interest in the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-06-24#ds2|title=#10 - ''Devil Survivor 2 The Animation'' [ep. 9-12]|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 24, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2015|first=Bamboo|last=Dong|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418055358/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-06-24#ds2|archivedate=April 18, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This continued into the series finale and Dong still felt that the characters were not fleshed out as much as they could have been. Dong explained that since there was basically no time to explore how the characters reacted to a ''disappearing world'', it was essentially dehumanizing to such an extent that their deaths carried no emotional weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-07-15#ds2|title=#12 - ''Devil Survivor 2 The Animation'' [ep. 13]|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 15, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2015|first=Bamboo|last=Dong|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711021924/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-07-15#ds2|archivedate=July 11, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dong presented a full series review in their ''Shelf Life'' column and expressed that viewers who like brawn, action and some emotion will enjoy the series as long as they can come to terms with the fact that they'll pretty much just be watching someone play a video game for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2014-06-30/.76151#ds2|title=Rental Shelf ''Devil Survivor 2: The Animation'' BD|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 30, 2014|accessdate=April 24, 2015|first=Bamboo|last=Dong|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424134442/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2014-06-30/.76151#ds2|archivedate=April 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanto-daishinsai.jpg|right|thumb|The destruction caused in the series was thought of as being similar to the real-world devastation brought to Japan by the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]].]]
''The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide'' written by Rebecca Silverman, also of the Anime News Network, expressed differing sentiments than that of Dong. Silverman was quick to mention that she had not previously played the game to which the series was based on. With that being said, she described the first episode as not feeling like a game adaptation since you at no point have the sensation of watching someone else play. She also noted that the transformation from the everyday world to one of total chaos and destruction as both swift and impressive. She supported this by citing similar descriptions of the destruction caused by the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] of the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Silverman Review 00"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2013/the-spring-anime/rebecca|title=The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide / ''Devil Survivor 2 The Animation''|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=April 3, 2013|accessdate=November 22, 2013|first=Rebecca|last=Silverman|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407042606/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2013/the-spring-anime/rebecca|archivedate=April 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her full series review, Silverman went into detail about how noticeably dark the series as a whole is when taking into account its animated depictions coupled with the death themes used. Unlike fellow reviewer Bamboo Dong, Silverman felt that character deaths would hit viewers more personally since they get to know them as the story progress and are then suddenly torn down. She further wrote that nearly every character death can potentially pack a punch since they are removed from the ending animation upon their demise. On the other hand, Silverman remarked that some of the characters were truly unlikable as they did not appear to grow and change.&lt;ref name="Silverman Review 01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/devil-survivor-2-the-animation|title=Review: ''Devil Survivor 2 The Animation'' by Rebecca Silverman|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 18, 2013|accessdate=September 8, 2013|first=Rebecca|last=Silverman|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825031135/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/devil-survivor-2-the-animation|archivedate=August 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seven episodes, Richard Eisenbeis of [[Kotaku]] disliked the series so much that he discouraged viewers from watching it for that particular season. He supported this by stating that the premise of teenagers summoning monsters has been done to death and that the adaptation has no compelling mysteries nor are there deeper psychological dilemmas being explored.&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis Review 00"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/four-anime-you-can-skip-this-season-507970495|title=Four Anime You Can Skip This Season|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=May 17, 2013|accessdate=November 26, 2013|first=Richard|last=Eisenbeis|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122063852/http://kotaku.com/four-anime-you-can-skip-this-season-507970495|archivedate=November 22, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenbeis shared sentiments with the Anime News Network reviewers when he elaborated on what he called the "woefully underdeveloped" characters of ''Devil Survivor 2'' who are only given rudimentary back-stories. This had the added effect of making it nearly impossible to figure out who exactly is a one-off character and who is a main character since they are all equally subjected to the threat of death. Eisenbeis noted that this made their demise genuinely shocking as it added to the viewing tension. Eisenbeis went on to write that the other characters were contrast to the main villain (or [[antihero]]) Yamato Hotsuin since he gets so much development that much of the series' runtime is spent on his backstory and goals than all the other characters combined. This helps give an in-depth understanding of the character and simultaneously made him an excellent villain.&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/devil-survivor-2-is-much-better-than-i-expected-958700348|title=''Devil Survivor 2'' Is Much Better Than I Expected|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=September 8, 2013|first=Richard|last=Eisenbeis|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906060219/http://kotaku.com/devil-survivor-2-is-much-better-than-i-expected-958700348|archivedate=September 6, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK Anime Network had Andy Hanley review the first four episodes and he expressed a much more positive outlook than previous reviewers. Hanley wrote about how fast the series was in setting up its premise and described it as an ''in at the deep end'' experience. Hanley cited the ruination of Tokyo at the end of the first episode and the countless deaths that occur by episode four to support this. Hanley argued that while this pace leaves the series open to being labelled as shallow, it's actually very effective in keeping the viewer engaged.&lt;ref name="Hanley Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-anime.net/anime/Devil_Survivor_2:_The_Animation_-_Eps._1-4.html|title=ANIME REVIEW: ''Devil Survivor 2: The Animation'' - Eps. 1-4|publisher=UK Anime Network|date=|accessdate=July 22, 2014|first=Andy|last=Hanley|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403234942/http://uk-anime.net/anime/Devil_Survivor_2:_The_Animation_-_Eps._1-4.html|archivedate=April 3, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal law}}

'''Forgery''' is a [[white-collar crime]] that generally refers to the false making or material alteration of a [[legal instrument]] with the specific [[mens rea|intent]] to [[wikt:defraud#English|defraud]] anyone (other than himself or herself).&lt;ref name="United States"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tooby"/&gt; Copies, studio replicas, and reproductions are not considered forgeries, though they may later become forgeries through knowing and willful [[misrepresentation]]s. Forging [[money]] or [[currency]] is more often called [[counterfeit]]ing. But [[consumer good]]s may also be ''counterfeits'' if they are not manufactured or produced by the designated manufacturer or producer given on the [[label]] or flagged by the [[trademark]] symbol. When the object forged is a record or document it is often called a [[false document]].

This usage of "forgery" does not derive from [[Metalworking|metalwork]] done at a forge, but it has a parallel history. A sense of "to [[counterfeit]]" is already in the Anglo-French verb ''forger'', meaning "falsify".

A forgery is essentially concerned with a produced or altered object. Where the prime concern of a forgery is less focused on the object itself &amp;ndash; what it is worth or what it "proves" &amp;ndash; than on a tacit statement of criticism that is revealed by the reactions the object provokes in others, then the larger process is a [[hoax]]. In a hoax, a [[rumor]] or a genuine object planted in a concocted situation, may substitute for a forged physical object.

The similar crime of [[fraud]] is the crime of deceiving another, including through the use of objects obtained through forgery. Forgery is one of the techniques of fraud, including [[identity theft]]. Forgery is one of the threats addressed by [[security engineering]].

In the 16th century, imitators of [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s style of printmaking improved the market for their own prints by [[signature forgery|signing]] them "AD", making them forgeries. In the 20th century the art market made forgeries highly profitable. There are widespread forgeries of especially valued artists, such as drawings originally by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Henri Matisse]].

A special case of double forgery is the forging of [[Vermeer]]'s paintings by [[Han van Meegeren]], and in its turn the forging of Van Meegeren's work by his son [[Jacques van Meegeren]].

==Criminal law==
{{expand section|date=August 2012}}

===England and Wales and Northern Ireland===
In [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], forgery is an offence under section 1 of the [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]], which provides:

{{Blockquote|A person is guilty of forgery if he makes a false instrument, with the intention that he or another shall use it to induce somebody to accept it as genuine, and by reason of so accepting it to do or not to do some act to his own or any other person’s prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Legislation.gov.uk]]. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/45/section/1 Digitised copy of section 1].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Instrument" is defined by section 8, "makes" and "false" by section 9, and "induce" and "prejudice" by section 10.

Forgery is [[triable either way]]. A person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on [[indictment]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or, on [[summary conviction]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[statutory maximum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/45/section/6 sections 6(1) to (3)(a)]&lt;/ref&gt;

For offences akin to forgery, see [[English criminal law#Forgery, personation, and cheating]].

The [[common law offence]] of forgery is abolished for all purposes not relating to offences committed before the commencement of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.&lt;ref&gt;The Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/45/section/13 section 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
Forgery is not an official offence under the law of Scotland, except in cases where statute provides otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;W J Stewart and Robert Burgess. Collins Dictionary of Law. HarperCollins Publishers. 1996. {{ISBN|0 00 470009 0}}. Pages 176 and 398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Forgery of Foreign Bills Act 1803]] was repealed in 2013.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], forgery is an offence under section 25(1) of the [[Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001]] which provides:

{{Blockquote|A person is guilty of forgery if he or she makes a false instrument with the intention that it shall be used to induce another person to accept it as genuine and, by reason of so accepting it, to do some act, or to make some omission, to the prejudice of that person or any other person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irish Statute Book]]. [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0025.html Digitised copy of section 25].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or to a fine, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001]], section 25(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Any offence at common law of forgery is abolished. The abolition of a common law offence of forgery does not affect proceedings for any such offence committed before its abolition.&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0003.html sections 3(2) and (3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Except as regards offences committed before the commencement of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 and except where the context otherwise requires, without prejudice to section 65(4)(a) of that Act, references to forgery must be construed in accordance with the provisions of that Act.&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0065.html section 65(4)(b)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Forgery is an offence under sections 366, 367 and 368 of the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].  The offence is a [[Hybrid offence#Canada|hybrid offence]], subject to a maximum prison sentence of:
*if tried [[Summary offence#Canada|summarily]]: 6 months
*if tried [[:wikibooks:Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Forgery|on indictment]]: 10 years

===United States===
{{Further|Crimes Act of 1790}}
Forgery is a crime in all jurisdictions within the [[United States]], both state and federal.&lt;ref name="United States"&gt;''United States v. Hunt'', [https://casetext.com/case/us-v-hunt-74#p1260 456 F.3d 1255], 1260 ([[10th Cir.]] 2006) ("Historically, forgery was defined as the false making, '''with the intent to defraud''', of a [[legal instrument|document]] which is not what it purports to be, as distinct from a document which is genuine but nevertheless contains a term or representation known to be false.")

==Civil law==
As to the effect, in the United Kingdom, of a forged signature on a bill of exchange, see section 24 of the [[Bills of Exchange Act 1882]].

==Documentary art==
Before the invention of [[photography]], people commonly hired painters and engravers to "re-create" an event or a scene. Artists had to imagine what to illustrate based on the information available to them about the subject. Some artists added elements to make the scene more exotic, while others removed elements out of modesty. In the 18th century, for example, Europeans were curious about what North America looked like and were ready to pay to see illustrations depicting this faraway place. Some of these artists produced prints depicting North America, despite many having never left Europe.

==In popular culture==

'''''Frederick Douglass and the White Negro''''' is a documentary telling the story of ex-slave, [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], writer and politician [[Frederick Douglass]] and his escape to Ireland from America in the 1840s.

==Synopsis==
The film follows Douglass' life from slavery as a young man through to his time in [[Ireland]] where he befriended [[Daniel O'Connell]], toured the country spreading the message of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] and was treated as a human being for the first time by white people. His arrival in Ireland coincided with the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] and he witnessed white people in what he considered to be a worse state than his fellow [[African Americans]] back in the US. The film follows Douglass back to [[United States|America]] where he buys his freedom with funds raised in Ireland and Britain. Fellow passengers on his return journey include the Irish escaping the famine who arrive in their millions and would go on to play a major role in the [[New York Draft Riot]] of 1863 which Douglass could only despair over. The film examines (with contributions from the author of ''How The Irish Became White'' [[Noel Ignatiev]] amongst others) the turbulent relationship between [[African Americans]] and [[Irish Americans]] during the [[American Civil War]], what drew them together and what drove them apart and how this would shape the America of the twentieth century and beyond.

'''Graphic design''' is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of [[typography]], [[photography]] and [[illustration]]. The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term "graphic [[design]]" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]] and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common uses of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]] and [[signage]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of graphic design}}
[[Image:KellsFol114vTuncDicit.gif|thumb|Page from the [[Book of Kells]]: Folio 114v, Decorated text. ''Tunc dicit illis'']]The term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In "Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. "The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the "true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men"" &lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the Nile, on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]", from 500 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt; to 1450 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt;, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.

In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience."&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. "Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named called the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. "&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

American advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making "headlines". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===The advent of printing===
{{Main article|History of printing}}
During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).&lt;ref&gt;" Printing" The Silk Road Foundation. Retrieved May 31, 2008. [http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml Silk-road.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509141910/http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th-18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.

In Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.

The printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''"squis"'' or ''"pin up" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the Roman era when public notices were posted stating ''"if anybody..."'', which is Latin for ''"si quis"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed "advices". The "Advices" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.

In 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick'&lt;nowiki/&gt;]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.

John Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''"Weeklies"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.'''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The initial use of the ''Boston News-Letter'' carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the [[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.

===Design industry===
In late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.

In 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.

From 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].&lt;ref name=mccarthy&gt;Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "graphic design" first appeared in print in the 1922 essay "New Kind of Printing Calls for New Design" by [[William Addison Dwiggins]], an American book designer in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. Pearson Education, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Raffe's ''Graphic Design'', published in 1927, was the first book to use "Graphic Design" in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Steve |year=1990|title=The Sign of the Self in the Metropolis |journal=Journal of Design History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |volume= 3|jstor=1315763|issue= 4|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, Soviet [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] applied 'intellectual production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Jan Tschichold]] codified the principles of [[modern typography]] in his 1928 book, ''New Typography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CPmMRRx1DEC&amp;pg=PT333&amp;dq=Jan+Tschichold+codified+the+principles+of+modern+typography+in+his+1928+book,+New+Typography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0luGFltDYAhVGLmMKHdq3B18Q6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Jan%20Tschichold%20codified%20the%20principles%20of%20modern%20typography%20in%20his%201928%20book,%20New%20Typography&amp;f=false|title=Advertising Design and Typography|last=White|first=Alex W.|date=2010-09-21|publisher=Allworth Press|isbn=9781581158205|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111150056/https://books.google.com/books?id=8CPmMRRx1DEC&amp;pg=PT333&amp;dq=Jan+Tschichold+codified+the+principles+of+modern+typography+in+his+1928+book,+New+Typography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0luGFltDYAhVGLmMKHdq3B18Q6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Jan%20Tschichold%20codified%20the%20principles%20of%20modern%20typography%20in%20his%201928%20book,%20New%20Typography&amp;f=false|archivedate=2018-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained influential.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Tschichold, [[Bauhaus]] typographers such as [[Herbert Bayer]] and [[László Moholy-Nagy]] and [[El Lissitzky]] greatly influenced graphic design.

The following years saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance and application.&lt;ref&gt;Crouch, Christopher. 2000. ''Modernism in Art Design and Architecture'', New York: [[St. Martins Press]]. {{ISBN|0-312-21830-3}} (cloth) {{ISBN|0-312-21832-X}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt; The post-World War II American economy revealed a greater need for graphic design, mainly in advertising and packaging. The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a "mass-produced" minimalism to America; sparking "modern" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef Müller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.

The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]]. First launched by [[Ken Garland]] in 1964, it was re-published as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]] in 1999 in the magazine ''[[Emigre (magazine)|Emigre]]'' 51&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&amp;id=14 |title=฿Emigre Essays |publisher=Emigre.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106152041/http://emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&amp;id=14 |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating "We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm |title=max bruinsma |publisher=Maxbruinsma.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219160927/http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm |archivedate=2011-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both editions attracted signatures from practitioners and thinkers such as [[Rudy VanderLans]], [[Erik Spiekermann]], [[Ellen Lupton]] and [[Rick Poynor]]. The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.

==Applications==
[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]
Graphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].

Design can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.

Graphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.

From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].

==Skills==
A graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.

The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these message. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.

===Typography===
{{Main article|Typography}}

Typography includes type design, modifying type [[glyphs]] and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).

Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.&lt;ref&gt;Butterick, Matthew. "Butterick's Practical Typography." Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Page layout===
{{Main article|Page layout}}
[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]
Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].

===Printmaking===
{{Main article|Printmaking}}

Printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]

Aside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.

==Tools==
The method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as "scissors" or "[[pen]]". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.

In the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19&lt;/ref&gt; Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws &amp; Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computers and software===
Designers disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].&lt;ref&gt;Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.

Most designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.

Graphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and "industry standard" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design. These include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).

==Related design fields==
===Interface design===
{{Main article|User interface design}}
Since the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].

===User experience design===
{{Main article|User experience design}}
User experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.

===Experiential graphic design===
{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}

Experiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.

Experiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.

==Occupations==
{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}

Graphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no|access-date=2018-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as "[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]" or "[[Graphic Artist]]". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].

Employment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.

A graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.

===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===
{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}
Jeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term "[[crowdsourcing]]" in his 2006 article, "The Rise of Crowdsourcing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&amp;topic=crowds&amp;topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&amp;topic=crowds&amp;topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing – and Why You’re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2307">The '''Hessian Bibliography''' ({{lang-de|Hessische Bibliographie}}) is a German regional bibliography. Its aim is to completely capture all the literature connected with the geography, history and culture of the German federal state of [[Hesse]] from the year 1974. It is based on the holdings of the [[legal deposit|copyright libraries]] at [[Kassel University Library|Kassel]], [[Fulda]], [[Frankfurt University Library|Frankfurt]], [[Hessian State Library|Wiesbaden]] and [[Hessian State Library|Darmstadt]].

By 2000 a total of 24 indexed year books had appeared in print; since then it has only been available in electronic form as a freely accessible database of the Hessian library information system ([[HEBIS]]). The titles are recorded in accordance with the Rules for Alphabetic Cataloguing and accessed using a comprehensive system of about 1,200 system sites and keywords. About 6,500 bibliographic records are added per year. 

The Hessian bibliography is part of the [[Virtual German National Bibliography]], which has its own web portal.

For the period before 1974, the "Literature on the History and Historic Geograph and Culture of Hesse"&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Demandt, Winfried Leist, Wolfgang Podehl (Bearb.): ''Schrifttum zur Geschichte und geschichtlichen Landeskunde von Hessen.'' Marburg/Wiesbaden 1965–1984. ([http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=1.1/SET=5/TTL=1/CLK?IKT=12&amp;TRM=011043458 Titelnachweis]).&lt;/ref&gt; is used. This consists of seven printed volumes by Karl Ernst Demandt (covering the period to 1964) and by Winfried Leist and Wolfgang Podehl (covering the period 1965-1976). Currently, the volumes of Podehl and Leist are gradually being added retrospectively to the database.

'''''Hip, Hip, Hurrah!''''' (Danish: ''Hip, hip, hurra! Kunstnerfest på Skagen'') is an oil-on-canvas painting from 1888 by Norwegian-Danish painter [[Peder Severin Krøyer]].

==Description==
The work shows various members of what Krøyer referred to as the "guild" of [[Skagen Painters]]: a group of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish artists who formed a loose community in Skagen at the northern tip of [[Jutland]] in the 1880s and early 1890s. ''Hip, Hip, Hurrah!'' is typical of the work produced by the Skagen Painters; very much in the style of the French [[Impressionist]]s and [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalists]], it celebrates the play of light in the scene (and in composition and subject draws obvious comparisons to [[Renoir]]'s ''[[Luncheon of the Boating Party]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Berman p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; but at the same time it harks back to the ''freundschaftbild'' tradition of artists of the [[Danish Golden Age]] such as [[Ditlev Blunck]] and [[Wilhelm Bendz]] in depicting artistic communities spontaneously drawing together.&lt;ref&gt;Berman p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of Krøyer's Skagen style can be seen by comparing ''Hip, Hip, Hurrah!'' with [[:File:Ved Frokosten Krøyer 1883.jpg|''Ved frokosten'']] (''Artists' Luncheon at Skagen''), a similarly themed 1883 painting which features many of the same people;&lt;ref&gt;Berman p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; and with later works like ''[[:File:P S Krøyer 1899 - Sommeraften ved Skagens strand. Kunstneren og hans hustru.jpg|Sommeraften ved Skagens strand. Kunstneren og hans hustru]]'' (''Summer Evening at Skagen beach. The Artist and his Wife'') and ''[[Roses (Krøyer)|Roser]]'' (''Roses'').

The painting was started in 1884 after a party at [[Michael Ancher]]'s house;&lt;ref&gt;Aruna Vasudevan in ''1001 Paintings'' p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; the composition was inspired by photographs taken at the celebration by the German artist [[Fritz Stoltenberg]], although the individuals featured are not all the same.&lt;ref name="b161"&gt;Berman p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Krøyer returned uninvited to Ancher's house the morning after the gathering with his easel and paints, eager to start sketching and expecting the freedom to come and go as he pleased. His lack of consideration annoyed Ancher, who had only recently moved to the house in an attempt to escape the hustle and bustle of town life; as a result, the two artists suffered their first serious falling-out. Although they reconciled soon afterwards, Krøyer did not get the unlimited access to Ancher's garden that he had expected and, frustrated, he struggled to progress with the work. He made do with the garden at Ancher's old apartment and worked from photographs and from life when he got the chance. It was four years before he could complete the picture. [[Helga Ancher|Helga]], Ancher's daughter, who had been less than a year old at the time of the original festivities, is shown to be older in the final painting, suggesting she was not included until later in the composition.&lt;ref name="NL"&gt;Svanholm pp. 85–9.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[:File:Studio of Peder Severin Krøyer.jpg|photo of the painting]] in Krøyer's studio shows an earlier composition before the older Helga was added. Swedish art collector [[Pontus Fürstenberg]] bought the painting unseen (or at least before it was completed). It was displayed at [[Charlottenborg Palace|Charlottenborg]] in 1888, and Fürstenberg later donated it to the [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]], where it has hung ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:Venus de Milo Louvre Ma399 n4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Venus de Milo]] on display at the [[Louvre]].]]

The '''history of art criticism''', as part of art history, is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts, i.e. [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]], which include aesthetic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the "major" arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture as well as the "minor" arts of ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.

As a term, the history of art history (also [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying and assessing the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the history of art criticism is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement from the standpoint of its history and of its major scholars. It is also distinguished from [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and How did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of art criticism is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. The history of art criticism often roots its studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. It attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
The history of art criticism as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians, in performing their assessment within the history of art criticism,  employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Practitioners of art criticism often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Practitioners of art criticism also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many practitioners of art criticism use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

==Timeline of Prominent Methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history or art criticism are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/xenocrates.htm Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''. Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were "Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome (Fuseli published an English translation in 1765 under the title Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks), and Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (History of Art in Antiquity), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyone Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Nochlin and feminism===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "Why have there been no great women artists?" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. In it she applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training. Nochlin argues that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields. The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success.[[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above. While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women.

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the [[Mona Lisa]]. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum Studies and Collecting===

Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New Materialism===

Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

[[Contemporary Art History]] refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fra Carnevale - The Ideal City - Walters 37677.jpg|thumb|500px|''The Ideal City'' by [[Fra Carnevale]], c. between 1480-1484.]]
An '''ideal city''' is the concept of a [[City planning|plan]] for a [[city]] that has been conceived in accordance with a particular rational or moral objective.

==Concept==
The "ideal" nature of such a city may encompass the [[moral]], [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[juridical]] qualities of [[citizenship]] as well as the ways in which these are realised through urban structures including buildings, street layout, etc.  The ground plans of ideal cities are often based on grids (in imitation of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town planning) or other geometrical patterns.  The ideal city is often an attempt to deploy [[Utopian]] ideals at the local level of urban configuration and living space and amenity rather than at the culture- or civilisation-wide level of the classical Utopias such as [[St Thomas More]]'s [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]].

==History==
[[File:Formerly_Piero_della_Francesca_-_Ideal_City_-_Galleria_Nazionale_delle_Marche_Urbino_2.jpg|thumb|350px|The ideal city attributed to [[Luciano Laurana]] or [[Melozzo da Forlì]].]]
Several attempts to develop ideal city plans are known from the [[Renaissance]], and appear from the second half of the fifteenth century. The concept dates at least from the period of [[Plato]], whose ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' is a philosophical exploration of the notion of the 'ideal city'.   The nobility of the Renaissance, seeking to imitate the qualities of [[Classical antiquity|Classical civilisation]], sometimes sought to construct such ideal cities either in reality or notionally through a reformation of manners and culture.

==Examples==
[[File:Idealstadt.jpg|thumb|200px|Plan of [[Sforzinda]], Filarete, c. 1465]]
[[Image:Palmanova1600.jpg|thumb|left|Map of [[Palmanova]] in 1593. The town is encircled by massive [[Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar|Venetian Defensive Systems]] that are a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/331/|title=The city of Bergamo - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Examples of the ideal cities include [[Filarete]]'s "[[Sforzinda]]", a description of which was included in his ''Trattato di Architettura'' (c. 1465).  The city of Sforzinda was laid out within an eight-pointed star inscribed within a circular [[moat]].  Further examples may have been intended to have been read into the so-called "Urbino" and "Baltimore" panels (second half of the fifteenth century), which show [[Classical architecture|Classically]] influenced architecture disposed in logically planned [[piazza]]s. The cities of [[Palmanova]] and [[Nicosia]], whose [[Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar|Ventian Fortess]] were built in the 1590s by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], are considered to be practical examples of the concept of the ideal city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosmescu|first1=Dragos|title=Nicosia|url=http://fortified-places.com/nicosia/|website=fortified-places.com|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable example of the concept is [[Zamość]] in eastern [[Poland]] founded in the late 16th century, modelled by the Italian architect [[Bernardo Morando]].

[[James Oglethorpe]] synthesized Classical and Renaissance concepts of the ideal city with new [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of scientific planning, harmony in design, and social equality in his plan for the [[Province of Carolina]]. The physical design component of the famous [[Oglethorpe Plan]] remains preserved in the [[Savannah Historic District (Savannah, Georgia)|Savannah Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas D. ''The Oglethorpe Plan: Enlightenment Design in Savannah and Beyond''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late nineteenth-century examples of the ideal city include the [[Garden city movement]] of Sir [[Ebenezer Howard]], realised at [[Letchworth Garden City]] and [[Welwyn Garden City]] in England.  [[Poundbury]], [[Prince Charles]]' architectural vision established in [[Dorset]], is among the most recent examples of ideal city planning.

The '''''Immaculate Conception'''''  is a painting by [[Zurbarán]] conserved at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Guide of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The [[Immaculate Conception]] represents Mary as the only mortal being free of [[original sin]]. This is a long-established Catholic doctrinal argument, frequently depicted in the painting of the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. Mary appears standing on five cherubim occupying a half moon. She is wearing a necklace with the anagram A(ve) M(aria), while a host of stars and angels emerge from the clouds in the halo around her head. On either side are angels with lilies, roses (attributes of purity) and tablets with inscriptions from the 'Song of Songs'. At the sides are two collegiates and symbols alluding to Mary: the Unblemished Mirror, Jacob's Ladder, Gates of Heaven and Morning Star. Zurbarán painted several versions of this theme, but this one is unquestionably the best.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=47ebcd8e6d370c6926ffc938f57f3dd871295ffedac166160908977bcfde952b?inventoryNumber=065578-000  The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3258470.pdf.bannered.pdf|title=Immaculate Conception|publisher=www.metmuseum.org|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Common Sense Media]] gave the book a three out of five stars, saying, "Some portions of the book are more engaging than others. The sections on his childhood are riveting, but when he tries to make his first forays into dating sound more dramatic than they are, the narrative falls flat. ...Many kids who feel that other people don't understand what they're going through will connect with this book and find it helpful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= In Real Life: My Journey to a Pixelated World Book Review|url= https://www.commonsensemedia.org/book-reviews/in-real-life-my-journey-to-a-pixelated-world#|website= Common Sense Media|accessdate= June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5182">[[File:LeidenArateaFOlio48vOrion.jpg|thumb|Folio 58v, [[Orion (constellation)|Orion the Hunter]]]]
'''Leiden, Universiteitsbibliotheek, VLQ 79''', also called the '''Leiden Aratea''', is an [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] copy of an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] treatise by [[Germanicus]] based on the ''Phaenomena'' of [[Aratus]]. The manuscript was created in the region of [[Lotharingia|Lorraine]] and has been dated to around 816.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mostert and Marco Mostert, "Using astronomy as an aid to dating manuscripts, The example of the Leiden Aratea planetarium", ''[[Quaerendo]]'', 20 (1999): 248–261.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 99 extant folios measuring {{Convert|225|by|200|mm|in|0}}; four were lost before 1600; this apart, the manuscript is apparently complete. The work contains 39 [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] including some of the first artistic depictions on paper of the Greek constellations. The artist has made no effort to place the stars correctly according to their positions in the sky so the images cannot be considered true star charts.&lt;ref&gt;Ridpath&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Leiden Aratea was created for a wealthy patron, possibly [[Louis the Pious]] or his wife [[Judith, daughter of Welf|Judith]]. Two copies were made of the manuscript in northern [[France]] around the year 1000. [[Jacob Susius]] acquired the manuscript in Ghent in 1573. It was owned by [[Hugo Grotius]] in 1600 and was used as a source for his edition of ''Syntagma Arateorum''.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[:w:c:Category:Prints from Hugo de Groot Syntagma Arateorum at the Peace Palace Library|associated prints from Grotius' ''Syntagma Arateorum'']] on Wikimedia Commons&lt;/ref&gt; It was later in the library of [[Christina of Sweden]] and was subsequently in the possession of [[Isaac Vossius]]. It was acquired by the [[Leiden University Library]] along with the rest of Vossius's collection around 1690.

A facsimile was published in 1989. That same year the book was rebound by Lucie Gimbrére.&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; A digital reproduction of this manuscript can be found on ''Digital Special Collections'' (DISC) of University Library Leiden: [https://socrates.leidenuniv.nl/webclient/DeliveryManager?custom_att_2=simple_viewer&amp;pid=1739618]

==Manuscript==
Constellations, planets and the seasons are depicted in 39 full-page miniatures, all on the verso pages, with corresponding poetical descriptions on the recto. At least five miniatures are lost, including those of the Sun and Moon, Jupiter, and the constellations of Centaurus and Virgo. 
The illustrations are probably copied from a [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] version of Germanicus' treatise; the subjects modeled in a "lively, illusionistic" manner typical of ancient painting.&lt;ref&gt;Katzenstein &amp; Savage-Smith, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is written in the ''[[capitalis rustica]]'' script used by the Romans for literary manuscripts and kept by the Carolingians for secular works.&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; An exception is folio 93v, the planetarium, where the routes of the planets are inscribed with quotes from Pliny's ''Natural History'' in [[Carolingian minuscule]].&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9770">This is a list of [[Publishing|publishers]] dedicated either wholly or to a significant degree to publishing material written for, by, or about women. Many of them started during the "[[Second-wave feminism|second wave]]" of [[feminism]]. The focus of this list is not on publishers which market to women, but on publishers who have a stated commitment to publishing feminist and other [[women's studies]] texts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22072">{{Muhammad}}

During the [[Early Middle Ages]], [[Christendom]] largely viewed [[Islam]] as a [[list of Christian heresies|Christological heresy]] and [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] as a [[false prophet]]. By the [[Late Middle Ages]], Islam was more typically grouped with [[Paganism|heathenism]], and [[Muhammad]] was viewed as inspired by the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]]. A more relaxed or benign view of Islam only developed in the modern period, after the Islamic empires ceased to be an acute military threat to Europe.  See [[Orientalism]].

The earliest documented Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] sources, written shortly after Muhammad's death in 632. With the [[Crusades]] of the [[High Middle Ages]], and the wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Late Middle Ages]], the Christian reception of Muhammad became more [[polemic]]al, moving from the classification as a heretic to depiction of Muhammad as a servant of [[Satan]] or as the [[Antichrist]], who will be suffering tortures in [[Christian views on hell|Hell]].

== Overview ==

=== Early Middle Ages ===
The earliest written Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] sources, written shortly after Muhammad's death in 632. In the anti-Jewish polemic the ''[[Teaching of Jacob]]'', a dialogue between a recent Christian convert and several [[Jews]], one participant writes that his brother "wrote to [him] saying that a deceiving prophet has appeared amidst the [[Saracen]]s". Another participant in the ''Doctrina'' replies about Muhammad: "He is deceiving. For do prophets come with sword and [[chariot]]?, …[Y]ou will discover nothing true from the said prophet except human bloodshed".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Emil Kaegi, Jr., "Initial Byzantine Reactions to the Arab Conquest", ''[[Church History (journal)|Church History]]'', Vol. 38, No. 2 (June , 1969), p. 139–149, p. 139–142, quoting from ''Doctrina Jacobi nuper baptizati'' 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; Though Muhammad is never called by his name,&lt;ref&gt;''Mahomet'', among other [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] forms (such as [[Mahound]]), were popular for rendering of the Arabic name Muhammad, borne by the founder of the religion of Islam (died 633). In literary use now superseded by the more correct form Mohammed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[New English Dictionary on Historical Principles]]'', Volume 6. By [[Philological Society|Philological Society (Great Britain)]]. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=iakjAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA38 38]&lt;/ref&gt; there seems to have been knowledge of his existence. It also appears that both [[Judaism's views on Muhammad|Jews]] and Christians viewed him in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;Kaegi p. 139–149, p. 139–142&lt;/ref&gt; Other contemporary sources, such as the writings of [[Sophronius of Jerusalem]], show there was no knowledge of the Saracens having their own prophet or faith, and only remark that the Saracen attacks must be a punishment for Christian [[sin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kaegi p. 139–149, p. 139–141,&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of Muhammad was available in [[Christendom]] from after the early expansion of his religion&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Stubbe]] ''An account of the rise and progress of Mahometanism'' Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG1AAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA211 211]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought''. Edited by Adrian Hastings, Alistair Mason, Hugh Pyper. Pg 330.&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, the translation of a polemical work by [[John of Damascus]], who used the phrase "[[false prophet]] in "Heresies in Epitome: How They Began and Whence They Drew Their Origin.".&lt;ref&gt;http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/stjohn_islam.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Source: "The Fountain of Wisdom" (''pege gnoseos''), part II: "Concerning Heresy" (''peri aipeseon'')&lt;/ref&gt;   According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' Christian knowledge of Muhammad's life "was nearly always used abusively".&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Another influential source was the [[Epistolae Saraceni]] or the “Letters of a Saracen” written by an Oriental Christian and translated into Latin from Arabic.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; From the 9th century onwards, highly negative biographies of Muhammad were written in Latin,&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; such as the one by [[Álvaro of Córdoba (Mozarab)|Álvaro of Córdoba ]] proclaiming him the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name="meyer2"/&gt;  Christendom also gained some knowledge of Muhammad through the [[Mozarabs]] of Spain, such as the 9th-century [[Eulogius of Córdoba]],&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; who was one of the [[Martyrs of Córdoba]].

=== High Middle Ages ===
{{see|Vita Mahumeti}}
[[File:Mohammed2.jpg|Mohammed and the Murdered Monk|thumb|left|250px|"Mohammed and the Murdered Monk", 1508 engraving by [[Lucas van Leyden]] – an incident unattested in Islamic accounts of the Prophet's life]]
In the 11th century [[Petrus Alphonsi]], a Jew who converted to Christianity, was another Mozarab source of information on Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Later during the 12th century [[Peter the Venerable]], who saw Muhammad as the precursor to the Antichrist and the successor of [[Arius]],&lt;ref name="meyer2"/&gt; ordered the translation of the [[Quran]] into Latin (''[[Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete]]'') and the collection of information on Muhammad so that Islamic teachings could be refuted by Christian scholars.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

During the 13th century European biographers completed their work on the life of Muhammad in a series of works by scholars such as [[Peter Pascual]], [[Riccoldo da Monte di Croce]], and [[Ramon Llull]]&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; in which Muhammad was depicted as an Antichrist while [[Islam]] was shown to be a Christian [[heresy]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; The fact that Muhammad was unlettered, that he married a wealthy widow, that in his later life he had several wives, that he was involved in several wars, and that he died like an ordinary person in contrast to the Christian belief in the supernatural end of [[Jesus]]' earthly life were all arguments used to discredit Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

Medieval scholars and churchmen held that Islam was the work of Muhammad who in turn was inspired by Satan. [[Kenneth Setton]] wrote that Muhammad was frequently calumniated and made a subject of legends taught by preachers as fact.&lt;ref name="meyer1"&gt;Kenneth Meyer Setton (July 1, 1992). "[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0871692015&amp;id=hk4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage Western Hostility to Islam and Prophecies of Turkish Doom]". Diane Publishing. {{ISBN|0-87169-201-5}}. pg 1–5&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in order to show that Muhammad was the anti-Christ, it was asserted that Muhammad died not in the year 632 but in the year 666 – the [[number of the beast]] – in another variation on the theme the number "666" was also used to represent the period of time Muslims would hold sway of the land.&lt;ref name="meyer2"/&gt; A verbal expression of Christian contempt for Islam was expressed in turning his name from Muhammad to [[Mahound]], the "devil incarnate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Reeves, Minou | title=Muhammad in Europe: A Thousand Years of Western Myth-Making | year=2003 | publisher=NYU Press | isbn=978-0-8147-7564-6}}, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Others usually confirmed to pious Christians that Muhammad had come to a bad end.&lt;ref name="meyer1"/&gt; According to one version after falling into a drunken stupor he had been eaten by a herd of swine, and this was ascribed as the reason why Muslims proscribed consumption of alcohol and pork.&lt;ref name="meyer1"/&gt; In another account of the alcohol ban, Muhammad learns about the Bible from a Jew and a heretical [[Arianism|Arian]] monk. Muhammad and the monk get drunk and fall asleep. The Jew kills the monk with Muhammad's sword. He then blames Muhammad, who, believing he has committed the crime in a drunken rage, bans alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Bushkovich, Paul, "Orthodoxy and Islam in Russia", Steindorff, L. (ed) ''Religion und Integration im Moskauer Russland: Konzepte und Praktiken, Potentiale und Grenzen 14.-17. Jahrhundert'', Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2010, p.128.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Leggenda di Maometto'' is another example of such a story. In this version, as a child Muhammad was taught the black arts by a heretical Christian villain who escaped imprisonment by the [[Christian Church]] by fleeing to the [[Arabian Peninsula]]; as an adult he set up a false religion by selectively choosing and perverting texts from the [[Bible]] to create Islam. It also ascribed the Muslim holiday of Friday "dies Veneris" (day of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]), as against the Jewish (Saturday) and the Christian (Sunday), to his followers' depravity as reflected in their multiplicity of wives.&lt;ref name="meyer1"/&gt; A highly negative depiction of Muhammad as a heretic, false prophet, renegade cardinal or founder of a violent religion also found its way into many other works of European literature, such as the [[chansons de geste]], [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', and [[John Lydgate]]'s ''The Fall of the Princes''.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;
[[File:Dante and Virgil Meet Muhammad and His Son-in-law, Ali in Hell.jpg|thumb|right|Muhammad pulling his chest open in [[William Blake]]'s illustration of [[Dante Alighieri]]'s "[[Divine Comedy]]"]]

The thirteenth century ''[[Golden Legend]]'', a best-seller in its day containing a collection of hagiographies, describes "Magumeth (Mahomet, Muhammad)" as "a false prophet and sorcerer", detailing his early life and travels as a merchant through his marriage to the widow, Khadija and goes on to suggest his "visions" came as a result of epileptic seizures and the interventions of a renegade [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] monk named Sergius.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=GNWZgIL5ZCoC&amp;pg=PA753&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Divine Comedy====
In  [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'',  Muhammad is in the ninth ditch of [[Malebolge]], the eighth realm, designed for those who have caused schism; specifically, he was placed among the Sowers of Religious Discord.  Muhammad is portrayed as split in half, with his entrails hanging out, representing his status as a [[heresiarch]] (Canto 28):
:No barrel, not even one where the hoops and staves go every which way, was ever split open like one frayed Sinner I saw, ripped from chin to where we fart&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove--&gt; below.
:His guts hung between his legs and displayed His vital organs, including that wretched sack Which converts to shit&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove --&gt; whatever gets conveyed down the gullet.
:As I stared at him he looked back And with his hands pulled his chest open, Saying, ''"See how I split open the crack in myself! See how twisted and broken Mohammed is! Before me walks [[Ali]], his face Cleft from chin to crown, grief–stricken."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seth Zimmerman|title=The Inferno of Dante Alighieri |page=191 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3hWDEjN7JcC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2003 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=0-595-28090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad is represented in a 15th-century [[fresco]] ''[[Last Judgment]]'' by Giovanni da Modena and drawing on Dante, in the [[San Petronio Basilica]] in [[Bologna]],&lt;ref name=fresco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,742914,00.html|title=Al-Qaida plot to blow up Bologna church fresco|date=2002-06-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Philip Willan}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in artwork by [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[William Blake]], and [[Gustave Doré]].&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/02/11/MNGRCH6UQK1.DTL|title=What's behind Muslim cartoon outrage|date=2006-02-11|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Ayesha Akram}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common allegation laid against Muhammad was that he was an impostor who, in order to satisfy his ambition and his lust, propagated religious teachings that he knew to be false.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Watt, Montgomery, ''Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman.'' Oxford University Press, 1961. From p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural critic]] and author [[Edward Said]] wrote in ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' regarding Dante's depiction of Muhammad:
{{quote|Empirical data about the Orient […] count for very little [i.e., in Dante's work]; what matters and is decisive is […] by no means confined to the professional scholar, but rather the common possession of all who have thought about the Orient in the West […]. What […] Dante tried to do in the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', is […] to characterize the Orient as alien and to incorporate it schematically on a theatrical stage whose audience, manager, and actors are […] only for Europe. Hence the vacillation between the familiar and the alien; Mohammed is always the imposter (familiar, because he pretends to be like the Jesus we know) and always the Oriental (alien, because although he is in some ways "like" Jesus, he is after all not like him).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Said|title=Orientalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zvJ3YwOkZAYC|year=1979|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-394-74067-6|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A more positive interpretation appears in the 13th-century ''Estoire del Saint Grail'', the first book in the vast [[Matter of Britain]], the [[Lancelot-Grail]]. In describing the travels of [[Joseph of Arimathea]], keeper of the [[Holy Grail]], the author says that most residents of the Middle East were pagans until the coming of Muhammad, who is shown as a true [[prophet]] sent by God to bring Christianity to the region. This mission however failed when Muhammad's pride caused him to alter God's wishes, thereby deceiving his followers. Nevertheless, Muhammad's religion is portrayed as being greatly superior to paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, Norris J. (Ed.) (December 1, 1992). ''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation,'' Volume 1 of 5. New York: Garland. {{ISBN|0-8240-7733-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later presentations====
The depiction of Islam in the ''Travels of Sir [[John Mandeville]]'' is also relatively positive, though with many inaccurate and mythical features. It is said that Muslims are easily converted to Christianity because their beliefs are already so similar in many ways, and that they believe that only the Christian revelation will last until the end of the world. The moral behaviour of Muslims at the time is shown as superior to that of Christians, and as a standing reproach to Christian society.&lt;ref name="travel"&gt;[http://www.romanization.com/books/mandeville/chap15.html The Travels of Sir John Mandeville], CHAPTER XV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of Muhammad in the form of [[picaresque novel]]  began to appear from the 13th century onward, such as in Alexandre du Pont's ''Roman de Mahom'', the translation of the Mi'raj, the ''Escala de Mahoma'' (“The Ladder of Muhammad”) by the court physician of Alfonso X of Castile and León and his son.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

Medieval European literature often referred to Muslims as "[[infidel]]s" or "pagans", in sobriquets such as the ''paynim foe''. These depictions such as those in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' represent Muslims worshiping Muhammad (spelt e.g. 'Mahom' and 'Mahumet') as a god, and depict them worshiping various deities in the form of "[[cult image|idols]]", ranging from [[Abaddon|Apollyon]] to [[Lucifer]], but ascribing to them a chief deity known as "[[Termagant]]".&lt;ref name="meyer2"&gt;Kenneth Meyer Setton (July 1, 1992). "[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0871692015&amp;id=hk4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage Western Hostility to Islam and Prophecies of Turkish Doom]". Diane Publishing. {{ISBN|0-87169-201-5}}. pg 4-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'', "[http://www.bartleby.com/81/16352.html Termagant]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, in medieval romances such as the French Arthurian cycle, pagans such as the ancient Britons or the inhabitants of "Sarras" before the conversion of King Evelake, who presumably lived well before the birth of Muhammad, are often described as worshipping the same array of gods and as identical to the imagined (Termagant-worshipping) Muslims in every respect. In the same vein, the definition of "[[Saracen]]" in [[Raymond of Penyafort]]'s ''Summa de Poenitentia'' starts by describing the Muslims but ends by including every person who is neither a Christian nor a Jew.

When the [[Knights Templar]] were being tried for [[heresy]] reference was often made to their worship of a demon [[Baphomet]], which was notable by implication for its similarity to the common rendition of Muhammad's name used by Christian writers of the time, Mahomet.&lt;ref&gt;''Mahomet'' still is the Polish and French word for the English "Muhammad".&lt;/ref&gt; All these and other variations on the theme were all set in the "temper of the times" of what was seen as a Muslim-Christian conflict as Medieval Europe was building a concept of "the great enemy" in the wake of the quickfire success of the [[early Muslim conquests]] shortly after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], as well as the lack of real information in the West of the mysterious East.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt;

Muhammad is characterized as "''pseudo-prophet''" in Byzantine and post-Byzantine religious and historic texts, as for example by [[Niketas Choniates]] (12th-13th c.).&lt;ref name="Mai1840"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mai|first=Angelo|authorlink=Angelo Mai|title=Spicilegium romanum ...: Patrum ecclesiasticorum Serapionis, Ioh.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2246">The '''Minneapolis Arts Commission''' is the [[arts council]] for the city of [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota in the United States. It was established in 1974. The 17 volunteer commissioners are appointed by the mayor and city council. The commission's role includes finding support for the arts from both public and private sources.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of the Minneapolis Arts Commission |url=http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/dca/mac/dca_art_commission_history |publisher=City of Minneapolis, MN |date=29 January 2010 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the mid 1970s the Arts Commission looked for a project to provide space for arts activities in an area the city wanted to redevelop economically. They received a grant from the Design Arts program of [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to fund a feasibility study for converting the historic Masonic Temple into an arts center. The result was the opening of the [[Hennepin Center for the Arts]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="Gibans1982"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibans |first=Nina Freedlander |title=The Community Arts Council Movement: History, Opinions, Issues |date=1982 |publisher=Praeger |pages=141–142 |isbn=0-03-062052-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the commission became part of the new Office of Cultural Affairs, along with the Office of Film, Video and New Media.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; In 2002 this new office was cut back significantly by the mayor as part of reducing the city debt.&lt;ref name=Combs2005&gt;{{cite news |last=Combs |first=Marianne |title=Minneapolis unveils new plan for the arts |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/09/22_combsm_mplsartsplan/?refid=0 |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio |date=22 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s the Arts Commission developed the new Minneapolis 10-year plan for the arts. The ''Minneapolis Plan for Arts and Culture'' was made public in September 2005.&lt;ref name=Combs2005 /&gt;

Mori Sosen is famous for his many paintings depicting [[Japanese macaque|monkeys]]. He also painted other animals, such as deer, boars, and peafowl. [[Robert van Gulik]] called him "an undisputed master" of the painting of the Japanese macaque. When a [[gibbon]] was brought in Japan by the Dutch in 1809, creating somewhat of a sensation (gibbons had long been depicted by Japanese artists, based on Chinese paintings of the animal, but no one in Japan had seen a live gibbon for centuries), it was Mori who had created a graphic record of this event as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert van Gulik]], ''The gibbon in China. An essay in Chinese animal lore''. E.J.&amp;nbsp;Brill, Leiden, Holland. (1967). Pages 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nea Moni''' ({{lang-el|Νέα Μονή}}, lit. "New Monastery") is an 11th-century monastery on the island of [[Chios]] that has been recognized as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. It is located on the Provateio Oros Mt. in the island's interior, about 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chios (town)|Chios town]]. It is well known for its [[mosaic]]s, which, together with those at [[Daphni Monastery|Daphni]] and [[Hosios Loukas]], are among the finest examples of [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|"Macedonian Renaissance" art]] in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/537 Monasteries of Daphni, Hosios Loukas and Nea Moni of Chios], World Heritage site&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The monastery was built in the mid-11th century, by [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine IX Monomachos]] and his wife, Empress [[Zoe (empress)|Zoe]]. According to tradition, it is built on the location where three monks, Nikitas, Ioannes and Iosif, miraculously found an [[icon]] of the [[Virgin Mary]], hanging from a branch of [[Myrtus|myrtle]].&lt;ref name=Church&gt;[http://www.ecclesia.gr/greek/monshrines/neamonihiou.html The Nea Moni of Chios], from the Church of Greece website&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Constantine was exiled in nearby [[Lesbos]], and the monks visited him and told of a vision according to which he would eventually become emperor. Constantine promised to build a church if this should come to pass. Indeed, in 1042, Constantine became emperor, and in gratitude began constructing the monastery, dedicated to the [[Theotokos]].&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; The main church (the ''[[katholikon]]'') was inaugurated in 1049, and the complex finished in 1055, after Constantine's death.&lt;ref name=Ministry&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/h/2/gh251.jsp?obj_id=1044 The Nea Moni of Chios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023090712/http://www.culture.gr/h/2/gh251.jsp?obj_id=1044 |date=2007-10-23 }}, from the Greek Ministry of Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arrest of Jesus (mosaic in Nea Moni, detail).jpg|thumb|Arrest of Jesus mosaic (11th)]]
[[File:Εσωτερικό - Νέα Μονή Χίου.jpg|thumb|View of the interior]]

The monastery was early on endowed with privileges: in a [[chrysobull]] of July 1049, Constantine Monomachos granted the monastery the head tax of all [[Jews]] of the island of Chios, and set the monastery apart from any superior ecclesiastic or secular hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Linder, Amnon: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nSZmYFmjwlwC The Jews in the Legal Sources of the Early Middle Ages]'', pp. 160-163&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of land grants, tax exemptions and other privileges granted by successive emperors, the monastery prospered during the Byzantine period.&lt;ref name=Ministry/&gt; Over the centuries, the monastery amassed substantial riches and became one of the wealthiest monasteries in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. At its peak, around 1300, its estates covered one third of Chios and it is estimated that up to 800 monks belonged to it.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; The subsequent Genoese domination reduced its wealth, but the monastery prospered again during the Ottoman era, when it was subject directly to the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], and enjoyed considerable autonomy. The late 16th-century traveler [[Samuel Purchas]] recounts that it had 200 monks, and that "alone in all Greece they had the right to use bells." During the 17th century the number of monks decreased further, but recovered in the next century. The Patriarch of Jerusalem, Chrysanthos Notaras, and the French priest Fourmont, who visited the monastery in 1725 and 1729 respectively, commented on the large numbers of monks, the quantity of relics preserved, and the beauty of the church and its decoration.

The monastery's decline began only after the [[Chios massacre|destruction of Chios]] by the Ottomans in 1822, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The monastery was sacked and looted, and never recovered its former glory. In 1881, an [[1881 Chios earthquake|earthquake]] added further damage to the main church, leading to the collapse of its dome, while several other buildings, like the 1512 bell-tower, were destroyed.&lt;ref name=Ministry/&gt; In 1952, due to the shortage of monks, Nea Moni was converted to a [[convent]]. According to the 2001 census, it is inhabited by only three nuns.

== Structures and architecture ==
[[File:Nea Moni (plan of kafolikon).jpg|thumb|Plan of the katholikon]]

The monastery complex covers an area of approximately 17,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and consists of the katholikon, two smaller churches (dedicated to the [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]] and to [[Saint Pantaleon|St Panteleimon]]) the dining hall ("trapeza"), the monks' cells ("kelia"), the reception hall or "[[triclinium|triklinon]]" and underground water [[cistern]] ("kinsterna"). The complex is surrounded by a wall (the original Byzantine wall was destroyed in 1822), and in the northeastern corner stands a defensive tower, in earlier times used as a library.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; In addition, outside the walls, near the monks' cemetery, there is a small chapel to [[St Luke]].&lt;ref name=Ministry/&gt;

The katholikon is the monastery's central structure, dedicated to the [[Dormition]] of the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; It is composed of the main church, the [[narthex|esonarthex]] and the [[narthex|exonarthex]]. The main church is of an [[octagon]]al shape, the so-called "insular" type, found in Chios and Cyprus. Although all three sections date to the 11th century, the main church suffered significant damage in 1822 and 1881, with the result that its current, rebuilt, form is different from the original. The bell tower was constructed in 1900, replacing an older one built in 1512.&lt;ref name=Ministry/&gt; Originally, the remains of the three founders were kept in the exonarthex, but most of these were destroyed during the sack of 1822.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt;

Along with the katholikon, the only remaining 11th century buildings are the partially ruined tower, the chapel of St Luke, the cistern and parts of the trapeza.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt; The cells, most of which are in a ruined state, date to the Venetian and Genovese periods. A small museum, opened in 1992, exists to the NW of the katholikon, housed in a renovated cell. The displayed artifacts date mostly from the latter 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/h/1/gh151.jsp?obj_id=3342 The Musemum of the Nea Moni of Chios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605061209/http://www.culture.gr/h/1/gh151.jsp?obj_id=3342 |date=2010-06-05 }}, from the Greek Ministry of Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|imagination|the album by Washed Out|Paracosm (album)}}

A '''paracosm''' is a detailed [[imaginary world]]. Paracosms are thought generally to originate in childhood and to have one or numerous creators. The creator of a paracosm has a complex and deeply felt relationship with this subjective universe, which may incorporate real-world or imaginary characters and conventions. Commonly having its own geography, history, and language, it is an experience that is often developed during childhood and continues over a long period of time, months or even years, as a sophisticated reality that can last into adulthood.&lt;ref name="petrella"&gt;Kristin Petrella, "[http://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1440&amp;context=honors_capstone A Crucial Juncture: The Paracosmic Approach to the Private Worlds of Lewis Carroll and the Brontës]". In ''Surface'', Syracuse University Honors Program, Spring 2009-05-01. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Origin and usage ==
The concept was first described by a researcher for the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], Robert Silvey, with later research by British psychiatrist Stephen A. MacKeith and British [[psychologist]] David Cohen. The term "paracosm" was coined by Ben Vincent, a participant in Silvey's 1976 study and a self-professed paracosmist.&lt;ref&gt;The Paracosm: a special form of fantasy, in Morrison, D.C. (Ed.), ''Organizing Early Experience: Imagination and cognition in Childhood''. New York: Baywood, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Cohen and Stephen MacKeith, ''The Development of Imagination: The Private Worlds of Childhood'' (Concepts in Developmental Psychology). Routledge, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alexander"&gt;Christine Alexander, "Playing the author: children's creative writing, paracosms and the construction of family magazines." In Kate Darian-Smith, Carla Pascoe (eds.), ''Children, Childhood and Cultural Heritage''. Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrists Delmont Morrison and Shirley Morrison mention paracosms and "paracosmic fantasy" in their book ''Memories of Loss and Dreams of Perfection'', in the context of people who have suffered the death of a loved one or some other tragedy in childhood. For such people, paracosms function as a way of processing and understanding their early loss.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Delmont C. and Shirley L., ''Memories of Loss and Dreams of Perfection: Unsuccessful Childhood Grieving and Adult Creativity''. Baywood, 2005. {{ISBN|0-89503-309-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They cite [[James M. Barrie]], [[Isak Dinesen]] and [[Emily Brontë]] as examples of people who created paracosms after the deaths of family members.

Marjorie Taylor is another child development psychologist who explores paracosms as part of a study on [[imaginary friend]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Marjorie, ''Imaginary Companions and the Children Who Create Them ''. Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-514629-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Adam Gopnik]]'s essay, "Bumping Into Mr. Ravioli", he consults his sister, a child psychologist, about his three-year-old daughter's imaginary friend. He is introduced to Taylor's ideas and told that children invent paracosms as a way of orienting themselves in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Gopnik, Adam, "Bumping Into Mr. Ravioli: A Theory of Busyness, and Its Hero". In ''The Best American Magazine Writing 2003'', ed. by the American Society of Magazine Editors (Harper Perennial, 2003), p. 251. Originally appeared in the ''New Yorker'' September 30, 2002, and also found in Gopnik's collection of autobiographical essays, ''Through the Children's Gate: A Home in New York'' (Vintage Canada, 2007). {{ISBN|1-4000-7575-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, creativity scholar Michele Root-Bernstein discusses her daughter's invention of an imaginary world, one that lasted for over a decade, in the 2014 book, ''Inventing Imaginary Worlds: From Childhood Play to Adult Creativity''.&lt;ref&gt;Root-Bernstein, Michele, ''Inventing Imaginary Worlds: From Childhood Play to Adult Creativity Across the Arts and Sciences''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2014. {{ISBN|978-1-4758-0979-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paracosms are also mentioned in articles about types of childhood creativity and problem-solving. Some scholars believe paracosm play indicates high intelligence. A Michigan State University study undertaken by Root-Bernstein revealed that many [[MacArthur Fellows Program]] recipients had paracosms as children, thus engaging in what she calls worldplay. Sampled MacArthur Fellows were twice as likely to have engaged in childhood worldplay as MSU undergraduates. They were also significantly more likely than MSU students to recognize aspects of worldplay in their adult professional work.&lt;ref&gt;Root-Bernstein, M. &amp; Root-Bernstein, R. 2006. Imaginary Worldplay in Childhood and Maturity and Its Impact on Adult Creativity, ''Creativity Research Journal'', 18(4): 405-425.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, paracosm play is recognized as one of the indicators of a high level of creativity, which educators now realize is as important as intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Po Bronson and Ashley Merrin, [http://www.newsweek.com/2010/07/10/the-creativity-crisis.html The Creativity Crisis]. In ''Newsweek'', 2010-07-10, page found 2010-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in the ''International Handbook on Giftedness'', Root-Bernstein writes about paracosm play in childhood as an indicator of considerable creative potential, which may "supplement objective measures of intellectual giftedness ... as well as subjective measures of superior technical talent."&lt;ref&gt;Root-Bernstein, Michele, "Imaginary Worldplay as an Indicator of Creative Giftedness". In the ''International Handbook on Giftedness'', ed. by Larissa Shavinina. Springer, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a chapter on paracosm play in the 2013 textbook ''Children, Childhood and Cultural Heritage'', written by Christine Alexander. She sees it, along with independent writing, as attempts by children to create [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] for themselves.&lt;ref name="alexander"/&gt;

Paracosms are one of the subjects of interest to the emerging field of literary [[juvenilia]], studying the childhood writings of well-known and lesser-known authors. Joetta Harty in her essay "Imagining the Nation, Imagining an Empire: A Tour of Nineteenth-Century British Paracosms" contextualizes the paracosms of 19th-century British children, including the [[Brontë family]], [[Thomas De Quincey]]'s Gombroon and [[Hartley Coleridge]]'s Ejuxria, with then-current events. Nike Sulway in "'A Date with Barbara': Paracosms of the Self in Biographies of Barbara Newhall Follett" explores adult reaction to [[Child prodigy|children perceived as prodigies or geniuses]], focusing on how their biographies often focus on their imaginations and paracosmic creations rather than on their daily lives, citing as an example adult reactions to child author [[Barbara Newhall Follett]]. &lt;ref&gt;Nike Sulway, "'A Date with Barbara: Paracosms of the Self in Biographies of Barbara Newhall Follett." In Dallas John Baker, Donna Lee Brien and Nike Sulway, eds., ''Recovering History through Fact and Fiction: Forgotten Lives''. Cambridge Scholars, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;In ''Home and Away: The Place of the Child Writer'', ed. by David Owen and Lesley Peterson. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of paracosms include:

* [[Middle-earth]], the highly detailed fantasy world created by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], as expressed in his novels ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'', as well as a sizable body of writings published posthumously containing fictional histories, languages and other reference material. Tolkien had been  [[Conlang|inventing languages]] since his teen years, only later imagining the people who spoke them or their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Specifically referred to as a paracosm by Joseph P. Laycock in ''Dangerous Games:  What the Moral Panic over Role-Playing Games Says about Play, Religion, and Imagined Worlds'' (Univ. of California Press, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Carpenter, ''Tolkien: A Biography.''

Am J Psychiatry 111:410-418, December 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg wrote about it as the Kingdom of Yr in her novel ''[[I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (novel)|I Never Promised You a Rose Garden]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Joanne, ''I Never Promised You a Rose Garden''. {{ISBN|0-8124-1588-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* As children, novelist [[C. S. Lewis]] and his brother [[Warren Lewis|Warren]] together created a paracosm called [[Boxen (C. S. Lewis)|Boxen]] which was in turn a combination of their respective private paracosms Animal-Land and India.

'''Psychogeography''' is an exploration of urban environments that emphasizes playfulness and "drifting".  It has links to the [[Situationist International]].  Psychogeography was defined in 1955 by [[Guy Debord]] as "the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals."&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/2 Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography, 1955]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been defined as "a total dissolution of boundaries between art and life". Another definition is "a whole toy box full of playful, inventive strategies for exploring cities... just about anything that takes [[pedestrians]] off their predictable paths and jolts them into a new [[awareness]] of the urban landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Joseph (July/August 2004). [http://www.utne.com/2004-07-01/a-new-way-of-walking.aspx "A New Way of Walking"]. ''[[Utne Reader]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychogeography was originally developed by the avant-garde movement [[Lettrist International]] in the journal ''Potlatch''.  The originator of what became known as [[unitary urbanism]], psychogeography, and the [[dérive]] was [[Ivan Chtcheglov]], in his highly influential 1953 essay "Formulaire pour un urbanisme nouveau" ("Formulary for a New Urbanism").&lt;ref&gt;Chtcheglov, Ivan. [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/Chtcheglov.htm "Formulary for a New Urbanism"]. Full text at bopsecrets.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lettrists' reimagining of the city has its precursors in aspects of [[Dadaism]] and [[Surrealism]].  The idea of urban wandering relates to the older concept of the [[flâneur]], theorized by [[Charles Baudelaire]].  Following Chtcheglov's exclusion from the Lettrists in 1954, [[Guy Debord]] and others worked to clarify the concept of unitary urbanism, in a bid to demand a revolutionary approach to architecture.  At a conference in Cosio di Arroscia, [[Italy]] in 1956, the Lettrists joined the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] to set a proper definition for the idea announced by [[Gil J. Wolman]]: "Unitary Urbanism - the synthesis of art and technology that we call for — must be constructed according to certain new values of life, values which now need to be distinguished and disseminated."&lt;ref&gt;Wolman, Gil (1956). ''Address by the Lettrist International Delegate to the Alba Conference of September 1956'' ALba: Lettrist International.&lt;/ref&gt;  It demanded the rejection of functional, [[Euclid]]ean values in [[architecture]], as well as the separation between art and its surroundings.  The implication of combining these two negations is that by creating abstraction, one creates art, which, in turn, creates a point of distinction that unitary urbanism insists must be nullified.  This confusion is also fundamental to the execution of unitary urbanism as it corrupts one's ability to identify where "function" ends and "play" (the "ludic") begins, resulting in what the Lettrist International and [[Situationist International]] believed to be a utopia where one was constantly exploring, free of determining factors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}&lt;!-- These last few sentences need referencing. Who is making these arguments? --&gt;

In "Formulary for a New Urbanism", Chtcheglov had written "Architecture is the simplest means of articulating time and space, of modulating reality, of engendering dreams".&lt;ref&gt;Chtcheglov, Ivan (1953). [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/Chtcheglov.htm "Formulary for a New Urbanism"].&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the Situationists found contemporary architecture both physically and ideologically restrictive, combining with outside cultural influence, effectively creating an undertow, and forcing oneself into a certain system of interaction with their environment: "[C]ities have a psychogeographical relief, with constant currents, fixed points and vortexes which strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones".{{Sfn|Knabb|1995|p=50}}

The Situationists' response was to create designs of new urbanized space, promising better opportunities for experimenting through mundane expression.  Their intentions remained completely as abstractions.  Guy Debord's truest intention was to unify two different factors of "ambiance" that, he felt, determined the values of the urban landscape: the soft ambiance — light, sound, time, the association of ideas — with the hard, the actual physical constructions.  Debord's vision was a combination of the two realms of opposing ambiance, where the play of the soft ambiance was actively considered in the rendering of the hard.  The new space creates a possibility for activity not formerly determined by one besides the individual.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

However, the Situationist International may have been [[tongue-in-cheek]] about some parts of psychogeography.  "This apparently serious term 'psychogeography'", writes Debord biographer Vincent Kaufman, "comprises an art of conversation and drunkenness, and everything leads us to believe that Debord excelled at both."{{Sfn|Kaufman|2006|p=114}}

Eventually, Debord and [[Asger Jorn]] resigned themselves to the fate of "urban relativity".  Debord readily admits in his 1961 film ''A Critique of Separation'', "The sectors of a city…are decipherable, but the personal meaning they have for us is incommunicable, as is the secrecy of private life in general, regarding which we possess nothing but pitiful documents".  Despite the ambiguity of the theory, Debord committed himself firmly to its practical basis in reality, even as he later confesses, "none of this is very clear. It is a completely typical drunken monologue…with its vain phrases that do not await response and its overbearing explanations. And its silences."&lt;ref&gt;''A Critique of Separation'' (1961). Complete Cinematic Works ([[AK Press]], 2003, Trans. Knabb. K)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before settling on the impossibility of true psychogeography, Debord made another film, ''On the Passage of a Few Persons Through a Rather Brief Unity of Time'' (1959), the title of which suggests its own subject matter.  The film's narrated content concerns itself with the evolution of a generally passive group of unnamed people into a fully aware, anarchistic assemblage, and might be perceived as a biography of the situationists themselves.  Among the rants which construct the film (regarding art, ignorance, consumerism, militarism) is a desperate call for psychogeographic action:
{{cquote
|When freedom is practised in a closed circle, it fades into a dream, becomes a mere image of itself. The ambiance of play is by nature unstable. At any moment, "ordinary life" may prevail once again. The geographical limitation of play is even more striking than its temporal limitation. Every game takes place within the boundaries of its own spatial domain.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Moments later, Debord elaborates on the important goals of unitary urbanism in contemporary society:
{{cquote
|The atmosphere of a few places gave us a few intimations of the future powers of an architecture that it would be necessary to create in order to provide the setting for less mediocre games.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Quoting [[Karl Marx]], Debord says:
{{cquote
|People can see nothing around them that is not their own image; everything speaks to them of themselves. Their very landscape is animated. Obstacles were everywhere. And they were all interrelated, maintaining a unified reign of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

While a reading of the texts included in the journal ''Internationale Situationniste'' may lead to an understanding of psychogeography as dictated by Guy Debord, a more comprehensive elucidation of the term would come from research into those who have put its techniques into a more developed practise.  While Debord's influence in bringing Chtchglov's text to an international audience is undoubted, his skill with the 'praxis' of unitary urbanism has been placed into question by almost all of the subsequent protagonists of the Formulary's directives.  Debord was indeed a notorious drunk (see his Panegyrique, Gallimard 1995) and this altered state of consciousness must be considered along with assertions he made regarding his attempts at psychogeographical activities such as dérive and constructed situation.  The researches undertaken by WNLA, AAA and the London Psychogeographical Association during the 1990s support the contention of Asger Jorn and the Scandinavian Situationniste (Drakagygett 1962 - 1998) that the psychogeographical is a concept only known through practise of its techniques.  Without undertaking the programme expounded by Chtchglov, and the resultant submission to the urban unknown, comprehension of the Formulary is not possible.  As Debord himself suggested, an understanding of the 'beautiful language' of situationist urbanism necessitates its practice.

==Dérive==
{{Main|Dérive}}
Psychogeography combines subjective and objective knowledge and studies.  Debord struggled to stipulate the finer points of this theoretical paradox, ultimately producing "Theory of the Dérive" in 1958, a document which essentially serves as an instruction manual for the psychogeographic procedure, executed through the act of dérive ("drift").

{{cquote
|In a dérive one or more persons during a certain period drop their usual motives for movement and action, their relations, their work and leisure activities, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there… But the dérive includes both this letting go and its necessary contradiction: the domination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of their possibilities.{{Sfn|Knabb|1995|p=50}}
}}

In the SI's 6th issue, [[Raoul Vaneigem]] writes in a manifesto of unitary urbanism, "All space is occupied by the enemy.  We are living under a permanent curfew.  Not just the cops — the geometry".&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christopher, ed. (1998). ''Leaving the 20th Century: the Incomplete Work of the Situationist International'', London: Rebel Pub.. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dérive, as a previously conceptualized tactic in the French military, was "a calculated action determined by the absence of a greater locus", and "a maneuver within the enemy's field of vision".{{Sfn|McDonough|2004|p=259}}  To the SI, whose interest was inhabiting space, the dérive brought appeal in this sense of taking the "fight" to the streets and truly indulging in a determined operation.  The dérive was a course of preparation, reconnaissance, a means of shaping situationist psychology among urban explorers for the eventuality of the {{clarify|text=situationist city|date=August 2016}}.

==Contemporary psychogeography==
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] serves as the focal point of local psychogeography oriented groups]]Since the 1990s, as situationist theory became popular in artistic and academic circles, [[avant-garde]], [[neoist]], and [[revolutionary]] groups emerged, developing psychogeographical [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in various ways.  Influenced primarily through the re-emergence of the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] and the foundation of [[The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture]], these groups have assisted in the development of a contemporary psychogeography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychogeography.org |title=psychogeography.org weblog and archive |date= |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1992 and 1996 The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture undertook an extensive programme of practical research into classic (situationist) psychogeography in both [[Glasgow]] and London.  The discoveries made during this period, documented in the group's journal ''Viscosity'', expanded the terrain of the psychogeographic into that of [[urban design]] and architectural performance.

The journal ''[[Transgressions: A Journal of Urban Exploration]]'' (which appears to have ceased publication sometime in 2000) collated and developed a number of post-avant-garde revolutionary psychogeographical themes.  The journal also contributed to the use and development of psychogeographical maps&lt;ref&gt;"The production of psychogeographical maps, or even the introduction of alterations such as more or less arbitrarily transposing maps of two different regions, can contribute to clarifying certain wanderings that express not subordination to randomness but total insubordination to habitual influences (influences generally categorized as tourism, that popular drug as repugnant as sports or buying on credit)." from ''Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography'', Debord 55&lt;/ref&gt; which have, since 2000, been used in political actions, drifts and projections, distributed as flyers. Since 2003 in the [[United States]], separate events known as [[Provflux]] and [[Psy-Geo-conflux]] have been dedicated to action-based participatory experiments, under the academic umbrella of psychogeography.

Psychogeography also become a device used in [[performance art]] and [[literature]].  In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in particular, psychogeography has become a recognised descriptive term used in discussion of successful writers such as [[Iain Sinclair]] and [[Peter Ackroyd]] and the documentaries of filmmaker [[Patrick Keiller]].  The popularity of Sinclair drew the term into greater public use in the United Kingdom.  Though Sinclair makes infrequent use of the jargon associated with the Situationists, he has certainly popularized the term by producing a large body of work based on pedestrian exploration of the urban and suburban landscape.  Sinclair and similar thinkers draw on a longstanding British literary tradition of the exploration of urban landscapes, predating the Situationists, found in the work of writers like [[William Blake]], [[Arthur Machen]], and [[Thomas de Quincey]].  The nature and history of [[London]] were a central focus of these writers, utilising [[Romanticism|romantic]], [[gothic novel|gothic]], and [[occult]] ideas to describe and transform the city.  Sinclair drew on this tradition combined with his own explorations as a way of criticising modern developments of urban space in such key texts as ''Lights Out for the Territory''.  Peter Ackroyd's bestselling ''London: A Biography'' was partially based on similar sources.  [[Merlin Coverley]] gives equal prominence to this literary tradition alongside Situationism in his 2006 book ''Psychogeography'', not only recognising that the situationist origins of psychogeography are sometimes forgotten, but that via certain writers like [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Daniel Defoe]], and Charles Baudelaire, they had a shared tradition. Novelist [[Will Self]] had a column "Psychogeography" which started out in the [[British Airways]] [[Inflight magazine]] and then appeared weekly in the Saturday magazine of ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper until October 2008.

The concepts and themes seen in popular comics writers such as [[Alan Moore]] in works like ''[[From Hell]]'' are also now seen as significant works of psychogeography.  Other key figures in this version of the idea are [[Walter Benjamin]], [[J. G. Ballard]], and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]].  Part of this development saw increasing use of ideas and terminology by some psychogeographers from [[Charles Fort|Fort]]ean and occult areas like [[earth mysteries]], [[ley lines]], and [[chaos magic]], a course pioneered by Sinclair.  A core element in virtually all these developments remains a dissatisfaction with the nature and design of the modern environment and a desire to make the everyday world more interesting.

After a few years of practicing, the psychogeography group that gravitates around the Urban Squares Initiative and Aleksandar Janicijevic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbansquares.com/07author.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327033354/http://urbansquares.com/07author.html |date=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbansquares.com/12psychomaps.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330183148/http://urbansquares.com/12psychomaps.html |date=March 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the initiator of, and main figure in organizing and leading this group, came up with the working definition of this procedure as: "The subjective analysis–mental reaction, to neighbourhood behaviours related to geographic location. A chronological process based on the order of appearance of observed topics, with the time delayed inclusion of other relevant instances". In 2013 Aleksandar Janicijevic published "Urbis - Language of the urban fabric" as a visual attempt to rediscover lost or neglected urban symbols. In 2015 another book was published "MyPsychogeography", an attempt to synthesize sketches and ideas which have informed his art practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photoblog.urbansquares.com/?page_id=170 |title=psychogeography now – window to the urban future &amp;#124; …… |publisher=Photoblog.urbansquares.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606150623/http://photoblog.urbansquares.com/?page_id=170 |archivedate=2013-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate making dérives, a number of applications for mobile devices have been created over the last few years.  Most notably, Dérive app,&lt;ref&gt;[http://deriveapp.com/ Dérive app]&lt;/ref&gt; Serendipitor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serendipitor.net/ Serendipitor]&lt;/ref&gt; Drift,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brokencitylab.org/drift/ Drift]&lt;/ref&gt; and Random GPS&lt;ref&gt;[http://nogovoyages.com/random_gps.html Random GPS]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''public bookcase''' is a cabinet which may be freely and anonymously used for the exchange and storage of books without the formalities associated with [[Library|libraries]]. When in public places these cabinets are of a robust and weatherproof design which are available at all times. However, cabinets installed in public or commercial buildings may be simple, unmodified book-shelves and may only be available during certain periods.

== Origin ==
Closely allied with the [[BookCrossing]] concept, the original public bookcases were conceived as artistic acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reticon.de/reporte/book-crossing-offene-buecherschraenke-in-bonn_121--1.html ''Book Crossing: Offene Bücherschränke in Bonn'', reticon-Report von Martin Ragg, 2. April 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103044019/http://www.reticon.de/reporte/book-crossing-offene-buecherschraenke-in-bonn_121--1.html |date=2009-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very early examples are the creations of performance artist duo Clegg &amp; Guttmann in 1991. Collections of bookcases were conceived as "free open-air libraries" in Darmstadt and Hannover in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hannover.de/de/kultur_freizeit/stadtteilkultur/stadtteilkultur/buechersch/geschichte/ ''Die Geschichte der Offenen Bibliotheken'' auf hannover.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819054002/http://www.hannover.de/de/kultur_freizeit/stadtteilkultur/stadtteilkultur/buechersch/geschichte/ |date=2011-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[Bonn]] Community Foundation awarded Trixy Royeck funding for her idea "outdoor books&amp;nbsp;– books in the open" which she submitted while studying interior design in Mainz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buergerstiftung-bonn.de/cms/download/pressetexte/pressemeldung_031115.pdf ''Bürgerstiftung Bonn stellt offenen Bücherschrank auf'', Presseerklärung der Bürgerstiftung Bonn, 15. November 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and since this time the concept has been widely replicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/aktuell/pressebox/archiv_volltext.shtml?arch_0806/nachricht3102.html ''Bücherwald&amp;nbsp;– erstes öffentliches Bücherregal im Berliner Straßenraum'', Presseerklärung Berliner Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung, 27. Juni 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; A public bookcase opened in 2010 in Vienna, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=offener Bücherschrank – Wien
 |url = http://www.offener-buecherschrank.at/ |date=2010 |access-date=8 February 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Basel, Switzerland, where many coffee shops and other venues host open bookshelves,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.öffentliche-bücherregale.ch/ Öffentliche Bücherregale]&lt;/ref&gt; a public bookcase was unveiled in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merianstiftung.ch/presse/detail.cfm?ObjectID=8563D8F6-E24F-56B8-C18F4E451AFDC6D3 Medienmitteilung der [[Christoph Merian Stiftung]] vom 14. Juni 2011.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108234709/http://www.merianstiftung.ch/presse/detail.cfm?ObjectID=8563D8F6-E24F-56B8-C18F4E451AFDC6D3 |date=2014-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://3landinfo.blogspot.com/2011/06/dies-das-ein-neuer-bucherschrank.html 3land.info: ''dies &amp; das &amp; ein neuer Bücherschrank'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Open bookcases are financed by a wide range of organisations (individuals, foundations, Lions Clubs, civic associations, and so on).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.das-juelicht.de/nachrichten/artikel/10465.php Das JüLichT: ''Jülich ganz „sozial“''] Beitrag 2. September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors to the bookcases decide which books to deposit and borrow, and whether to return or exchange borrowed books for others.

== Use and acceptance ==
If a public bookcase is centrally and accessibly located and is stocked with sufficient material, public bookcases are quickly and widely appreciated. Vandalism has occurred in some places and, in successful cases, is countered by "bookcase sponsors" or "godfathers" who devote their time and attention to care of the collection.

The acceptance, motivation and user-profile of public bookshelves was examined in 2008 by a study at the University of Bonn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huk.uni-bonn.de/pdf-dateien/bonner-buecherschrank-artikel''Der Bonner Bücherschrank auf der PoppelsdorferAllee – Ein merkwürdiges Versorgungssystem . Kurzfassung der Ergebnisse des Projekts „Das Nutzungsverhalten am Poppelsdorfer Bücherschrank“''] (pdf) Autoren: Prof. Dr. Michael-Burkhard Piorkowsky, Sandra Bichler, Kerstin Hilt, Olga Reger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.uni-bonn.de/die-universitaet/publikationen/forsch/forsch-2-april-2009/lernen_und_lehren.pdf''Bonner "Gemeinschaftsmöbel" Studienobjekt: Offener Bücherschrank als soziales System'' (pdf) Autorin: Ulrike Klopp. In: forsch / Bonner Universitäts-Nachrichten 2/2009. (S.27)]&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that the system had developed as a notable alternative to conventional bookstores. One cannot equate public bookcases with classic peer-to-peer exchange, but they certainly represent the voluntary transfer of goods. Surveyed users also indicated that they believed that regular use of public bookcases could function as an example for similar schemes for other desirable goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10004&amp;detailid=552233 ''Poppelsdorfer Bücherschrank: Die Frauen geben, die Männer nehmen''; Bonner General-Anzeiger, 3. February 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825024252/http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10004&amp;detailid=552233 |date=2011-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This acceptance has led to a rapid dissemination of public bookshelves throughout Germany. It has been found that durable construction and storm-resistance promote sustained use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10490&amp;detailid=525497 ''Ein Schrank für ausgesetzte Bücher/Bürgerstiftung Bonn eröffnet in den kommenden Tagen zwei weitere Freiluft-Bibliotheken'', Bonner General-Anzeiger, 20. November 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823113855/http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10490&amp;detailid=525497 |date=2011-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==
In Oerlinghausen there is a modified version of the public bookcase. A small bookcase has been installed in Simon Square by the Friends of The Public Library, in collaboration with the Cohabitation/Society/Culture group of the local Agenda 21. These groups stock the bookcase as needed from a so-called "book exchange", a larger public event which has taken place in the Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Haus in Oerlingsausen-South every Saturday since 2007. One may also deposit book requests to be matched from stock by the operators of the exchange.

The Salbke Bookmark is a large, open-air construction which includes a number of public bookcases. Originally built on the site of a demolished library in a depopulated district of Magdeburg, the local civic association has moved much of the stock to a nearby vacant shop where more than 10000 donations are securely housed.

A cafe in Marburg includes a public bookcase. The city library now includes a cabinet of books which may be freely taken or exchanged by patrons rather than organising complex book disposal events. The operation of this variant combines the library's daily operations with community control. As the bookcase is located in a protected space it does not require sponsorship or weather protection.

== Catalogs and mapping ==
[[File:Pizza Hut themed Little Free Library in Gillette, Wyoming.jpg|upright|thumb|right|A [[Pizza Hut]] themed Little Free Library in [[Gillette, Wyoming]]]]

In the United States, small enclosed bookcases, usually in front of residences, have become a common sight in many cities. Some of these are officially registered with the [[Little Free Library]] network. In Europe many public bookcases are registered via the [[Open Book Case]] project. The Open source /crowdsourcing mapping project [[OpenStreetMap]] has a designated tag for registering the location types and more of public bookcases.

==Biography==

===Family and military service===
Gill was born in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], London, the son of a stockbroker. He joined the [[Madras Army|44th Madras Native Infantry]] as a cadet in 1824 and became an [[ensign (military rank)|ensign]] on 6 May 1825. Promotion to Lieutenant followed in September 1826, and to Captain on 6 May 1840; finally he was promoted to Major.  On 25 May 1841, he married Frances Flowerdew Rickerby at [[St Luke's Church, Chelsea]], in London.&lt;ref&gt;Parish registers of St Luke's, Chelsea.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madras Military Fund records (1808–1862)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was discharged as an invalid on 1 October 1852.&lt;ref name="RootsWeb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"&gt;Gordon, 234–238&lt;/ref&gt; His first child, a daughter called Frances Eliza Minchin Gill (1842-1930), was born in Madras. His first son, the soldier, explorer and intelligence officer [[William John Gill]] (1843-1882), was born in [[Bangalore]].  A second daughter, Rose Matilda Gill, was born in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in 1845 but died when less than three weeks old. A second son, the lawyer Robert Thomas Gill (1847-1927) was born in [[Jalna, Maharashtra|Jaulnah]], as was a third daughter, Lucy Annie Gill (1849-1903). Robert Gill may have had several children who died in infancy by his first Indian mistress, Paro. He had two daughters by his second Indian mistress: Mildred Mary Gill (1866-1923) and Annie Gill (c.1864-1934).&lt;ref&gt;Family history research by Tony Hadland, a descendant of Robert Gill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Gill was a member of [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|The Royal Asiatic Society]], and this association was eventually parlayed into copying the murals that had first been published in a lecture by [[James Fergusson (architect)|James Fergusson]] to the Bombay branch of the Society, and later inclusion and illustration in his book in [[Indian rock-cut architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson's book was ''The Rock-cut Temples of India'', published in 1845. Gibson, pp 230–234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"/&gt; From 1844, Gill was taken away from military service to copy the Ajanta murals for the [[Asiatic Society of Bombay]], at an additional salary of 200 [[rupee]]s a year.  He spent thirty years measuring, mapping, cataloguing, photographing, and painting in the caves, despite dangers from wild animals and the local [[Bhil people]].&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"/&gt;

Arriving at Ajanta in early 1845, he completed an initial survey and inspection, submitting a report the same year. He began to ship completed paintings back to London in 1847, where many were exhibited at the museum of the [[East India Company]].  A number of them were reproduced, somewhat crudely, in an article in 1849 in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 235&lt;/ref&gt; He had copied about 30 of the principal [[fresco]]es on canvas at almost full-size by 1863, when the painting phase of his work largely ended; these works were sent to London.&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"/&gt; Unfortunately, twenty-five of his pictures were burnt during the 1866 fire at [[The Crystal Palace]], where they were on loan and being exhibited.&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Pauline |last1=Rohatgi |first2=Pheroza |last2=Godrej |date=March 2009 |chapter-url=http://www.illwa.org/chapter_8.htm |chapter=Reflections of Change |title=Indian Life and Landscapes by Western Artists |publisher=Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS) |location=Mumbai |access-date=24 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907050817/http://www.illwa.org/chapter_8.htm |archive-date=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was destroyed by a fire in a storeroom in the South Kensington Museum (now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]) in 1885.  This was the same fire that destroyed most of the next generation of Ajanta copies, just completed by a team from the Bombay School of Art. None of Gill's lost copies had been photographed.  The four surviving Gill copies are in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London; a number of his drawings are in the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"/&gt;

Gill remained based at Ajanta for the rest of his life, also making tours to other ancient sites in India. He took up photography, including [[stereoscopy]], in about 1856, and much of his photographic work is published in two books, ''The Rock-Cut Temples of India'',&lt;ref name="Bonhams"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/16200/lot/383/ |first1=James |last1=Ferguson |work=India and Beyond in Books and Photography |date=9 April 2008|format=[[Albumen print]]s|title=The Rock Cut Temples of India |publisher=[[Bonhams]] Auctioneer |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''One Hundred Stereoscopic Illustrations of Architecture and Natural History in Western India'', with notes by [[James Fergusson (architect)|James Fergusson]].&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 236–238; {{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho0001000s4u00455000.html |first1=Robert |last1=Gill |title=General view of Buddhist Caves II-XXVI, Ajanta|date=26 March 2009 |format=Photographic print |publisher=British Library |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=One hundred stereoscopic illustrations of architecture and natural history in western India |first1=Robert, photographer |last1=Gill |first2=James, description |last2=Fergusson |year=1864 |publisher=Cundall, Downes |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gill's surviving photographs, drawings, and paintings are constantly cited by scholars of Ajanta and [[Indian art]] generally, as they have preserved the memories of original painted surfaces that have undergone significant flaking.  Accelerated deterioration began immediately upon the caves' rediscovery starting in 1819. According to the Victoria and Albert Museum, even in Gill's time the original cave paintings could be seen suffering damage from frequent, unsupervised visitation and also from "swarms of bees and bats."&lt;ref name="Patel"/&gt; Gill's works also record the condition of the stonework at the time; some sections have since been lost, such as the portico to Cave 1,&lt;ref&gt;Compare [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho0001000s4u00462000.html Gill's photo] with a [[:File:AjantaHoehle1VerandaPanorama.jpg|modern view]]&lt;/ref&gt; and others considerably repaired and tidied.  Many of his plans, drawings, and photographs are available online at the [[British Library]] and other places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/index.html Search page for British Library online collections]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and burial===
Like many other British Indian officers of those days, Gill was an avid hunter and killed about 150 [[tigers]], mostly on foot.&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt; He died in 1879&lt;ref name="Tombstone"/&gt; while being transported from Ajanta to [[Bhusawal]] in a very ill condition,&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"/&gt; and was buried at the Catholic Cemetery at Bhusawal.&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"/&gt;

==Modern interpretations==
In 2012, a [[Marathi language]] film, [[Ajintha (film)|Ajintha]], was made based on his work and love story with a native girl Paro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajinthathefilm.com|title=Ajintha-the film|last=|first=|date=|year=2012|website=|publisher=Chandrakant Production Pvt.

'''Shell gorgets''' are a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] art form of polished, carved [[mollusc shell|shell]] [[pendant]]s worn around the neck. The gorgets are frequently engraved, and are sometimes highlighted with pigments, or fenestrated (pierced with openings).

Shell gorgets were most common in [[Eastern Woodlands]] of the [[United States]], during the [[Hopewell tradition]] (200 BCE– 500 CE) and [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian cultural period]] (ca. 800–1500 CE); however, tribes from other regions and time periods also carved shell gorgets. The earliest shell gorgets date back to 3000 years [[Before present|BP]]. They are believed to have been insignia of status or rank,&lt;ref name=tn&gt;C. Andrew Buchner, [http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=325 "Cox Mound Gorget."] ''The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture.'' (retrieved 23 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; either civic, military, or religious, or amulets of protective medicine. Due to the placement of the holes in the gorgets, they are also thought to be [[Bullroarer (music)|spinners]] that could produce whistling sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Dozier, Debye. [http://daphne.palomar.edu/ddozier/course_notes/regions/woodland_files/woodlands.htm "Northern, Eastern, and Southern Woodlands."] ''Palomar College, American Indian Department.'' 16 June 2005 (retrieved 6 Feb 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials and techniques==
[[File:Busycon-contrarium.jpg|thumb|left|Views of a ''Sinistrofulgur perversum'' shell]]

[[Lightning whelk]] (''[[Sinistrofulgur perversum]]'') is the most common shell used for gorgets. Other shells, such as the true conch or ''[[Strombus]]'', as well as [[freshwater mussel]]s, are also carved into gorgets.&lt;ref name=tx&gt;Dreiss, Meredith L. [http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/coast/nature/images/shell-ornaments.html "Marine Shell Ornaments, Icons and Offerings."] ''Texas Beyond History.'' (retrieved 24 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, due to environmental causes, harvested lightning whelks are significantly smaller than in precontact times. These earlier shells typically ranged from 6 to 12 inches in length.&lt;ref name=tx/&gt;

Harvested off the coasts of Florida and the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the shells were traded through the Eastern Woodlands.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, 154&lt;/ref&gt; This native trade continued into the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Dubin, 163"&gt;Dubin, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorgets are carved from the penultimate [[whorl (mollusc)|whorl]] of the shell.&lt;ref&gt;Fundaburk and Foreman, Pl. 155-6&lt;/ref&gt; A blank is cut or broken out, then ground smooth. Holes for suspension and decoration are drilled, sometimes with a bow drills or [[chert]] drills.&lt;ref name=tx/&gt; The gorget forms a concave shape and, when engraved, the interior is polished and decorated.

While most gorgets are circular, some are shaped as rectangles with rounded corners, maskettes, or other novel shapes. An extremely elaborate pendant from [[Spiro Mounds]] is shaped as two hands connected by a common beaded bracelet.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin 162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaic and Hopewell==
[[Adena culture|Adena]] cultures created gorgets from slate and copper, but the [[Hopewell Exchange System]] brought exotic shells from the Gulf northward. Initially, Hopewellian peoples carved plain shell gorgets around 1000 BCE. Engraved gorgets appeared in the late Hopewell.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin 159&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Glacial Kame Culture]] marine-shell gorget from the [[Great Lakes]] dates from 1000 BCE and features an engraved bear or opossum with an umbilical cord.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mississippian==
[[File:Buffalo style mask gorget Nodena site HRoe 2006.jpg|thumb|Mask gorget with forked-eye motifs, from the [[Nodena Site]] in [[Arkansas]]]]
As Mississippian shell gorgets were traded widely, common designs have a widespread geographical distribution. [[Calusa]] people of southern Florida harvested and carved gorgets.&lt;ref name=d202&gt;Dubin, 202&lt;/ref&gt; Coiled rattlesnakes gorgets were found among the [[Guale]] Indians of [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Mask gorgets, although rare,&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Smith were only able to secure and examine 69 masks in their 1989 study.&lt;/ref&gt; are found throughout the southeast, with the most prominent site clusters occurring in the Ohio River valley, eastern Tennessee, and the Arkansas delta, although finds have been found as far afield as North Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Smith, table 1&lt;/ref&gt; The masks have bas-relief noses, drilled eyes, engraved or drill mouths, and sometimes forked-eye motifs or zigzags under the eyes. Small shell [[cameo (carving)|cameos]], under two inches wide, were found at Spiro Mounds.&lt;ref&gt;Fundaburk and Foreman, Plates 157 and 158&lt;/ref&gt; Although dating is difficult in the current archaeological context, these masks are likely to be a later phenomenon (c. 1500-1700): although they are often found in sites that also produce 16th century Spanish trade goods, they are entirely absent from classic mound sites, which were active until the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Smith, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
[[File:Dan townsend gorget.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary miniature gorget by Dan Townsend (non-tribally affialized Muscogee Creek-Cherokee descent) featuring a cross-in-circle motif]]
Iconography on the shell gorgets comes from the [[Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere]]. Extremely common designs include the [[triskele]], coiled rattlesnake, spider, [[chunkey]] player, and birdman, sometimes called a Falcon Impersonater.

Native Americans, art historians, and anthropologists all have a wide range of often conflicting interpretations of the Mississippian iconography. Coiled rattlesnake gorgets were often found in the graves of young people and are believed to relate to age as opposed to status.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin 161&lt;/ref&gt; The forked-eye motif, commonly identified as markings from a [[peregrine falcon]], dates back to the [[Hopewell exchange]], and the symbol references excellent vision and hunting skill among [[Muscogee Creek]] people.&lt;ref name="Dubin, 163"/&gt; "Strength of Life" design is interpreted by Kvokovtee Scott and Phillip Deer (Muscogee medicine man) as referencing a whirlwind and [[stomp dance|dancing movement]].&lt;ref name=d202/&gt;

[[File:Cox style gorget HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|''Cox style'' gorget]]
There are over 30 pre-contact examples of the Cox Mound gorget style, found in [[Tennessee]] and northern [[Alabama]] and dating from 1250-1450 CE.&lt;ref name=tn/&gt; The Cox Mound gorget style features four woodpecker heads facing counter-clockwise, a four-lopped square motif, and a sometimes a cross within a rayed circle. It has been interpreted as a visualization of the [[Yuchi]] myth of the winds. The four-looped square, or [[guilloche]], is considered by some to be a "whirling sun" motif, or a priestly or chiefly [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]];&lt;ref name=d204&gt;Dubin 204&lt;/ref&gt; by some, the earth held up by cords to the Sky Vault at the four cardinal points;&lt;ref&gt;Townsend and Sharp, 208&lt;/ref&gt; and by others, the path of life with four stages of maturity. Woodpeckers are associated with the four winds&lt;ref name=tn/&gt; and are medicine birds that can extract illnesses among Muscogee Creeks.&lt;ref name=d204/&gt; The birds are also sometimes interpreted as the four winds.&lt;ref name=tn/&gt; The rayed circle or  sun is interpreted literally, a deity or ancestors, council, and/or sacred fire.&lt;ref name=tn/&gt; The entire design could also illustrate the [[Yuchi]] myth of the winds.&lt;ref name=tn/&gt;

A gorget from the [[Castalian Springs Mound Site]] in Tennessee features a man holding a mace and severed head. This has been interpreted by some anthropologists as a "flying shaman."&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, 196&lt;/ref&gt;

Some agreement can be found in interpreting the cross-in-circle design, which references the sun&lt;ref name=d202/&gt; and the ceremonial fire, fed by four logs aligned to cardinal directions. Another design widely agreed upon is the water spider with a cross-in-circle design on its [[cephalothorax]]. Spider gorgets have a widespread distribution but are commonly found in what is now [[Illinois]].

==Historic gorgets==
[[File:Bennie pokemire gorget.jpg|thumb|Contemporary gorget by Bennie Pokemire ([[Eastern Band Cherokee]]), featuring a Mississippian warrior with a forked eye motif]]
Turtle shells and stones have also infrequently been carved into gorgets. In the 18th century, metal medallions replaced shell gorgets among Eastern tribes.&lt;ref name=p214&gt;Power (2007), 214&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, women from tribes along the [[Colorado River]], such as the [[Quechan]] wore defenestrated gorgets made from bivalve shells and strung on vegetal cordage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3704">'''SoFlo Superflat''' describes an art genre started in Miami in the 1990s. It is an urban pop [[art movement]] in South Florida that combines super bright colors and ultra flat images. The subject matters are very diverse. It is an outcrop of the Japanese [[Superflat]] movement, founded by the artist [[Takashi Murakami]].

[[File:Sunshine and moon (Caron Bowman painting).jpg|thumb|Sunshine and Moon Caron Bowman, 40x60, Pastel, Example of SoFlo Superflat art]]
These artists emphasize outlines and flat areas of color. What is important is the feeling of flatness. Many of the artists involved in SoFlo Superflat art believe that the culture in SoFlo is not three-dimensional; therefore, it can be better interpreted in very flat brightly colored two-dimensional images. SoFlo Superflat was born out of the compression of genres which is shown through the pop-inflected work of younger artists. The artists in this genre have very specific styles that can be best described as a consistent pictorial language. Repetition of images and pattern is used create a signature look. For example, Britto's "squiggle lines" and geometric patterns are consistent themes in his work.   Artists whose work is regarded as "SoFlo Superflat" include: [[Romero Britto|Britto]], [http://karonbowman.webs.com/ Caron Bowman], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110616225953/http://www.crematagallery.com/ Raul Cremata], Ceron, Ed King, Jose Alvares. 

This new generation of artist does not think about what is art or what is illustration or what is graffiti. Faced with a level of economic uncertainty, SoFlo Superflat artists create their own version of popular culture to draw attention to the dominance of the media, entertainment and consumption.

'''Sun printing''' may refer to various printing techniques which use sunlight as a developing or fixative agent.

==Techniques==

===Cyanotype===
{{main|Cyanotype}}
[[Cyanotype]], also referred to as "blueprinting", is the oldest non-silver photographic printing process.&lt;ref name="House"/&gt; It involves exposing materials which have been treated with a solution of [[potassium ferricyanide]] and [[ferric ammonium citrate]] to a UV light source such as the sun. Negative or positive images can be obtained by blocking UV light from reaching the sensitized material. For example, a negative image can be produced by placing a leaf upon paper treated with this solution and exposing to sunlight for 10 to 20 minutes. The paper will retain the image of the leaf after it has been rinsed with water. Once the paper dries, parts that were exposed to the sun will turn a shade of [[Prussian blue|Prussian blue (ferric ferrocyanide)]], while parts that were covered by the leaf will remain white.

===Light-sensitive vat dyes===

A specialized type of [[vat dye]] called [[Inkodye]] is also used for sun-printing due to its light-sensitive quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pburch.net/dyeing/howtodyewithlight.shtml How to Dye and Paint Fabric with Light]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other vat dyes which use oxygen to develop their color, Inkodyes are developed by light.&lt;ref name="Epp"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Chemistry of Vat Dyes|first=Diane|last=Epp|publisher=Terrific Science Press|year=1995|isbn=1-883822-05-X|pages=5–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-f8KAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Chemistry+of+Vat+Dyes&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hxAxTpPfJYjTiAKWxcW6Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dyes are suspended in [[Leuco dye|leuco form]] appearing colorless until they are exposed to UV. Their usage resembles that of cyanotype, but unlike cyanotype Inkodyes are primarily used on textiles and exist in a full range of colors.&lt;ref name="House"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artistic Photographic Processes|first=Suda|last=House|publisher=Amphoto Books|year=1981|isbn=0-8174-3541-7|pages=84–88|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=iA0xTpLcGenRiAK7mvyEBg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=7NtTAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Suda+House%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure times vary from 3 to 15 minutes depending on the desired color and intensity of light.&lt;ref name="Ray Laury"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imagery on Fabric: A Complete Surface Design Handbook|first=Jean|last=Ray Laury|publisher=C&amp;T Publishing|year=2010|isbn=1-57120-034-7|pages=122–123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZexEXQM_sIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Imagery+on+Fabric&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0BIxTumIJoXUiAKosqGiBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once exposed, the sensitized material is washed in soapy water to remove dye from unexposed areas. Such dyes are typically used by craftspeople, fabric printers and artists and can be printed with [[Negative (photography)|photographic negatives]], [[Resist dyeing|resist paste]] or through a [[Screen Printing|silk screen]].

===Potassium dichromate===

Sun printing may also refer to a [[photographic]] process using [[potassium dichromate]] which produces a negative plate for conventional [[Lithography|lithographic printing]]. The process uses a film of [[gelatine]] spread on a flat and rigid surface. This is coated with a dilute solution of potassium dichromate and dried in low light conditions.  A translucent positive is secured in tight contact with the treated gelatine layer and exposed to bright sunlight for a period of up to 30 minutes. During this time the sunlight and potassium dichromate tan the gelatine exposed to light. The plate is developed by washing in warm water and removing the untanned gelatine. Once dry, a [[relief print]] is revealed on the plate. The surface can be [[ink]]ed and printed in a hand press to produce any number of identical prints of the original subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4958">The '''Symphony No. 1''' or '''Symphony: 'Vigil'''' is an [[orchestra]]l [[symphony]] by the Scottish composer [[James MacMillan]].  It is the last of three interrelated compositions in MacMillan's Easter triptych ''Triduum'' commissioned by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].  The piece was first performed at the [[Barbican Centre]] on 28 September 1997 by the London Symphony Orchestra under the conductor [[Mstislav Rostropovich]].&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{cite web |last=MacMillan |first=James |authorlink=James MacMillan |year=1997 |title=MacMillan, James: Symphony: 'Vigil' |publisher=[[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] |url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/James-MacMillan-Symphony-Vigil/771 |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

===Background===
The Symphony: 'Vigil' was the third of three pieces comprising MacMillan's Easter triptych ''Triduum'', which also included the composer's oboe concerto ''[[The World's Ransoming]]'' and his [[Cello Concerto (MacMillan)|Cello Concerto]].  MacMillan described his inspiration for the symphony in the score program notes, writing:{{quote|The initial inspiration for Symphony: 'Vigil' came through the potential interplay of the elements of fire and water, which are central to the liturgy of the [[Easter Vigil]]. This ceremony is also known as the Service of Light and it was the light-giving aspect of fire which especially caught my imagination, including the possibilities of playing with the differences in light and shade, from complete darkness and bleakness to blazing illumination and everything in between.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;}}

===Structure===
The symphony has a duration of roughly 53 minutes and is composed in three [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Light
#Tuba insonet salutaris
#Water

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for an orchestra comprising three [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (3rd doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s, [[cor anglais]], two [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], three percussionists, [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[piano]] (doubling [[celesta]]), and [[String section|strings]] and a separate [[brass quintet]] comprising a horn, two trumpets, trombone, and tuba.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
[[Arnold Whittall]] of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' gave the symphony moderate praise, writing:{{quote|The 48-minute Symphony which completes the triptych sets itself the task of moving from images of suffering and death to those of rebirth and transcendent affirmation. Its structure, with two preliminary movements lasting around 22 minutes and a grand finale running for 26, led me to wonder whether the last movement on its own might not have performed the formal and expressive task required. Certainly it contains enough diversity, with elements of [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysian]] celebration and solemn, aspiring ceremonial before a protracted, turbulent crisis dissolves into the sweet soulfulness of the ending. Or you could argue that all three movements are needed to provide an adequate balance to ''[[The World's Ransoming]]'' and the [[Cello Concerto (MacMillan)|Cello Concerto]] together. Any early verdict on a work as substantial and wide-ranging as this is bound to be provisional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Whittall |first=Arnold |authorlink=Arnold Whittall |title=MacMillan (The) World's Ransoming; Cello Concerto |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |date=May 1999 |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/macmillan-the-worlds-ransoming-cello-concerto |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Reviewing the complete ''Triduum'' triptych, ''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'' similarly wrote:{{quote|Listening to the trilogy, one steps decisively into MacMillan's serious, heartfelt sound-world: the three works are contemplations of [[Maundy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday]], expressed in music of searing intensity and extreme contrasts. One may feel that some of the effects MacMillan uses – the overlaid screaming brass fanfares, the extensive use of percussion – are excessive, but they are contained within a tautly argued, tightly structured whole, and possessed of a thrillingly direct – and profoundly affecting – musicality. I defy anyone not to be moved by this music, whether for its considerable emotional impact or purely the artistry of its musical structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Macmillan: Symphony 'Vigil' |work=[[BBC Music Magazine]] |date=20 January 2012 |url=http://www.classical-music.com/review/macmillan-12 |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

They work in collaboration with biologists, ecologists, historians, activists, architects, urban planners and fellow artists to initiate dialogues and create works exploring biodiversity and community development. Helen and Newton Harrison are both Professors Emeriti at University of California, Santa Cruz, and University of California, San Diego. They have had numerous international solo exhibitions, and their work is in the collections of many public institutions, including the [[Pompidou Center]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Nevada Museum of Art]], and the [[Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art]]. In 2013, the Harrisons became the first recipients of the Corlis Benefideo Award for Imaginative Cartography.

== Early life and education ==
Helen Mayer was a gifted student born on July 1, 1927, in New York City in the city's easternmost borough of [[Queens]].  There, her parents worked as schoolteachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Genzlinger|first1=Neil|authorlink1=Neil Genzlinger|title=Helen Mayer Harrison, Leader in Eco-Art Movement, Dies at 90|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/obituaries/helen-mayer-harrison-leader-in-eco-art-movement-dies-at-90.html|accessdate=16 April 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating from [[Forest Hills High School (New York)|Forest Hills High School]] in 1943 at sixteen years old, she earned a full tuition scholarship to attend [[Cornell University]]. She enrolled at Cornell and majored in Psychology for two years, but ultimately returned home to earn her bachelor's degree in English from [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] in 1948. She also earned a master's degree in the philosophy of education from [[New York University]] (NYU) in 1952.

Newton Abner Harrison was born on October 20, 1932 in New York City in the borough of [[Brooklyn]] and then raised in the nearby suburb of [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]]. Newton's grandfather Simon W. Farber was an enterprising tinsmith from Russia who immigrated to America in the late 19th century and established a small business for manufacturing kitchen utensils in downtown Manhattan. His initial idea in 1897 was to set up a shop on the Lower East Side to make brassware and ornamental objects for nearby families because it had been customary to import such items up to that time. Business grew slowly and steadily in the first decade until he transitioned from hand hammering to metal spinning with an automated machine lathe, which reduced the cost of labor and dramatically increased both production and sales. In 1907, Farber acquired a manufacturing plant in Brooklyn to further expand his line of cookware and branded the company [[Farberware]]. Newton attended Peddie Prep High School, a college preparatory school in New Jersey, and first expressed interest in becoming an artist at age fifteen. His parents abided, and arranged an apprenticeship for their son with a local sculptor in New Rochelle named [[Michael Lantz]]. Newton continued to assist Lantz in his studio in the off intervals of his schooling during the years 1948 through 1953 with plaster casting, building wood armatures, modeling, woodwork and building architectural scale models, as well as drafting and reading architectural blueprints. He then completed several years of schooling at [[Antioch College]] in Yellow Springs, Ohio before reaffirming to his parents his intention to become a professional artist. In 1952 he transferred to the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] to continue his study of sculpture. Local art collectors praised and encouraged the young artist to develop his Rodin-like approach to the human figure, his ability to convey the poetic motions of the body and soul.&lt;ref&gt;Mrs. Catherine Biddle Cadwalader Scull, whom along with her husband Mr. Richard Barclay Scull commissioned Newton to create a rooftop sculpture for their home in the Radnor Township of Villanova, likened Newton's ''Love Groups'' (1957) to the work of Auguste Rodin, citing ''The Kiss'' (1889) as a comparable example of two nudes embracing. See Mrs. Scull quoted in "Nude Statues on Roof Cause Traffic Jam on Main Line" and Thomas Hovenden, "Plastic Nudes in Quaker Land: Ups and Downs of Works Raise Stock of Plymouth Mtg. Sculptor," ''The Times Herald'' (undated) in Scrapbook 1 (1957-1958). Series 7, Early Work by Newton Harrison, Flat Box 290. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections &amp; University Archives, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Helen and Newton married in 1953. There is a notable collection of letters in the [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8qj7ntt/ Harrison Papers at Stanford] written and received by the Harrisons as a young married couple on their first trip abroad to [[Florence|Florence, Italy]] where they lived for three years, from 1957 to 1960, with partial funding from the Scheidt Memorial Scholarship awarded to Newton by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the rest financed by Newton's parents Estelle and Harvey Harrison. The Florence letters express the couple's experience coming of age as young Americans living abroad and honing their career ambitions in the postwar era. "Many thanks," begins one letter to Estelle and Harvey, for you both "enable us to find ourselves. The way of the artist is not an easy one, but the rewards for us are many, and the promise of being able to use ourselves significantly according to our capacities is the only promise that holds meaning for us."&lt;ref&gt;"Dearest Mother and Dad, Much Love, Us" (undated). Series 4. Correspondence, Box 121, Folders 2-4. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections &amp; University Archives, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harrisons returned from Florence to the bustling New York City art scene in 1960. Newton initially found work teaching experimental painting to children at housing settlement projects and neighborhood centers. He then enrolled at the [[Yale University]] School of Art and Architecture to complete his bachelor's degree, which he had left unfinished when he and Helen moved to Florence. [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/08/arts/sewell-sillman-67-artist-and-publisher-is-dead.html Sewell Sillman] and [[Al Held]] were two key mentors for Newton during his time at Yale. He graduated in 1965 at age thirty-two with both a bachelor's and master's degree in fine art, and secured his first faculty position as Assistant Professor in Charge of Visual Fundamentals at the [[University of New Mexico]] (UNM). Now with four school-aged children and her own set of credentials and qualifications, Helen also went back to work at UNM teaching literature and acclimating to the world of higher education. However, she oriented her work in the field of education more broadly, endeavoring to raise the issue of equality and access to good education at every level of society. In 1965, she and Newton collaborated on writing an essay exploring new directions in education for high school dropouts, entitled "Dropouts and a 'Design for Living'," published in the book ''New Perspectives on Poverty''.&lt;ref&gt;Shostak, Arthur B. and William Gomberg, eds. (1965). ''New Perspectives on Poverty''. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harrisons moved to [[La Jolla, California]] in 1967 when the founding chair of the Visual Arts Department at [[University of California, San Diego|UC San Diego]], abstract expressionist painter [[Paul Brach]], offered Newton a faculty position. And for the past fifty years, California has been their home. Helen began collaborating with Newton on the occasion of the "Furs and Feathers" exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York City, experimenting with new approaches to the production as well as display of knowledge in a work called ''An Ecological Nerve Center'' (1970-1971). 1972 is the year that Helen resigned from her director position with UC Extension Division's Education Programs to pursue art full-time. In her resignation letter, she wrote with affection, "I have had too much fun here! However, I am becoming an artist in my old age and I am doing what we have offered a number of Extension courses about - 'switching careers midstream'."&lt;ref&gt;Resignation letter from Helen to Dr. Martin N. Chamberlain, University Extension (August 25, 1972). Series 10, University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Box 178, Folder 1. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections &amp; University Archives, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; A decade or two later, the Harrisons both became tenured faculty in the Visual Arts Department at UC San Diego and subsequently emeriti faculty in the Art Department at [[UC Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The "Early Life and Education" segment of this page is adapted from Eliasieh, Laura (née Rogers).

==  Switching Careers Midstream ==
Helen and Newton proceeded along different paths and at different speeds to solidify their career as artists after arriving at UC San Diego in 1967. The relatively unsettled period of critical self-reflection and career development in the 1950s and 1960s is key to appreciating their decision to collaborate with one another beginning in 1970. For even within the UC system, the Harrisons have maintained a reputation as self-critical and inquiry-based learners. They have tirelessly posed questions that challenge institutional norms and advanced a new model of [[artistic research]] that engages with both social and environmental issues.

In 1968, growing concern for equality and social justice initially motivated Helen to matriculate at United States International University (known today as [[Alliant International University]]) to begin an interdisciplinary doctoral program in the Graduate School of Leadership and Human Behavior. Her aim with this second graduate degree was to refresh and synthesize three domains of expertise—language, learning, and social psychology—so that she could contribute research towards ensuring that all students have equal prospects for living well. However, Helen joined UC Extension Division as an education program coordinator in 1969 and after promoting to a director position in 1970 she withdrew from the doctoral program to work directly with young educators seeking guidance in career development. During her tenure as director of UC Extension Division's education programs, enrollment and course offerings rose from an average of forty-two classes to fifty-five classes per quarter. Helen's goal was to provide teachers of [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] with courses to enhance their level of expertise in subject areas, while also providing them with a deeper understanding of psychology and childhood intellectual development. She expanded the reach of UC Extension Division's education programs to more than ten school districts in the county, and she introduced one-day and two-week conferences that drew participants from across the country.

While studying at United States International University, Helen collected writings by the vanguard of the [[Women's Liberation Movement]] including: [[Alice S. Rossi]]'s "Status of Women in Graduate Departments of Sociology: 1968-1969," accepted for publication in ''The American Sociologist'' (Fall 1969) and made available through the Women's Caucus of the American Sociological Association at their San Francisco convention; Beverly Jones and Judith Brown's "Toward a Female Liberation Movement," published by New England Free Press; and [[Naomi Weisstein]]'s "Kinde, Kuche, Kirche as Scientific Law: Psychology Constructs the Female," published by New England Free Press.&lt;ref&gt;"On Women" paper notes (1968-1969). Series 1, Personal/Biographical, Subseries 5, Harrison Family, Box 218, Folder 9. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections &amp; University Archives, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of second wave feminism, Helen's concern for equality and social justice had grown to include, in a more direct way, her own rights as a woman to use herself significantly according to her own capacities and to be recognized for her contributions. It is this alchemy of ambition and social consciousness that led Helen to begin collaborating with Newton in the conceptualization and making of ''An Ecological Nerve Center'' (1970-1971) at the [[Museum of Contemporary Crafts]] in New York City, and subsequently to resign from UC Extension Division to pursue art full-time. Yet it would take many more years for Helen to be recognized by her peers as fully equal with her collaborator and husband.

Helen actually took the lead in producing ''An Ecological Nerve Center'' for the "Furs and Feathers" exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts. She assembled students from the Visual Arts Department at UC San Diego into a small research team to expand on information that she had requested from the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] regarding the destruction of natural habitats and resident species that suffer from that destruction; their fleshy bodies subject to the insatiable demands of the world market economy. Her influence is especially apparent in the team's approach to presenting the information in the context of a museum. Artists experimenting with art and technology in the late 1960s, including Newton, had been working with information. They had been using new computer technologies to program sculptures as self-regulating [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] systems built on the concept of feedback to explore the relationship of machines (perhaps as proxies for humans) to their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;''Plasma Chambers'' (1969–1971), designed in collaboration with engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) as part of the Art and Technology Program at Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), is the most distinguished of Newton’s art and technology projects. Newton began working with a student in the Physics Department at UC San Diego to experiment with glow discharge demonstrations, which show how an electric force introduced to a medium of noble gas plasma will produce colored light—orange in the case of neon gas—in a process called ionization. A neon light is a miniature glow discharge environment. JPL engineers helped Newton design an even larger glow discharge chamber to increase the visibility of ionization, which can form diffuse shapes and patterns. ''Plasma Chambers'' traveled to the 1970 World Exposition in Osaka along with seven other esteemed works from LACMA’s Art and Technology Program before the opening of the official “Art and Technology” exhibition in Los Angeles on May 16, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Helen's approach was different. She worked with students to produce a [[Rolodex]] (appreciating the simplicity of the rotating desktop card index invented in 1956 by the Danish engineer Hildaur Neilsen) as a sculptural object containing didactic yet poetic descriptions of species extinct, endangered, formerly endangered, and in over supply, and constructed in a way that would permit change as new data became available. She and the students then created a 4'x14' chart visualization of the data contained in the Rolodex to be hung on the wall of the museum gallery, as if a painting, alongside a 14'x14' world map produced by Newton interpreting the Rolodex data as a spatial narrative. It is important to recognize the work that Helen and the students produced for ''An Ecological Nerve Center'' as politically entangled, unspectacular, and strong because of it. The Rolodex invited people to participate in the tactile process of retrieving and making sense of information, rather than stand in awe before an eye-catching digital media display. The chart asserted that people are already equipped to process the gravity of species extinction and take decisive action. "The numbers always change" explained Newton in the exhibition catalog "and research shows that an endangered form can regenerate itself when protection is enforced, and again assume its role in the life cycle."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Newton (1971). "An Ecological Proposal" in ''Furs and Feathers'', ed. Paul J. Smith. New York: Museum of Contemporary Crafts of the American Crafts Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of the "Furs and Feathers" exhibition, [[Richard Elman]] described gazing at "a large white map of the world in the main entranceway that was annotated densely with print, especially the U.S. portion, in tones of red and gray to distinguish 'endangered' from 'exterminated' species of wildlife." Even more impressionable was an accompanying audio recording that Elman recalls as "a litany, a casualty list, intoned in a flat dispirited voice. On and on it went for quite some fifteen minutes about the hunting pursuits of the sheiks of the Arabian peninsula, entire populations of sea birds, monkeys, lions, vincuñas, and the great auk."&lt;ref&gt;Elman, Richard. "Furs and Feathers." ''Craft Horizons'' 31, 2 (April 1971): 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

So why, after many months of working with students to prepare ''An Ecological Nerve Center'' for exhibition, is Helen's name conspicuously absent from the exhibition catalog, Elman's review, and other promotional materials? Neither the curator nor critic acknowledged her contributions. It would take yet more time and dedication, in the wake of second wave feminism, for Helen to come forth as an artist equal to Newton.

Pivotal to the story of Helen solidifying her career as an artist are two solo works through which she arrived at her own avant-garde understanding of participation in growth form and growth activism. ''Strawberry Jam'' (1973), the first solo work, began when Dextra Frankel, Director of the Art Gallery of [[California State University, Fullerton|California State University at Fullerton]], contacted Helen in February 1973 to inquire if she would like to participate as a solo artist in a large group exhibition entitled "In a Bottle." As Helen recalls in a typewritten statement reflecting back on the exhibition: “I had just finished assisting Newton Harrison with a work called ''Strawberry Wall'' and he suggested that I do a performance of making jam, since I did the feasts for his growth works, and I thought—what goes in a bottle but Jam.” On a separate piece of paper, torn from an old notepad of the English Language and Literature Department at the University of New Mexico (where Helen taught from 1965 to 1967), she recorded a [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] that further elaborates on her creative process: “One of the things to do with a bottle is fill it. One of the basic things to fill a bottle with is food. One makes the food and preserves it in the bottle. Collecting bottles and filling them with food…imagine there is no food for us this year and we have to make next year’s food—Food Wall—give up its yield to other people in a series of feasts—abundance ritual—record it.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Materials from ''Strawberry Jam'' at the Woman's Building, Los Angeles, CA (March 23, 1974). Series 5, Performances and Exhibitions, Box 136, Folder 8-9. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections &amp; University Archives, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Strawberry Jam'' thus became an endurance performance in which Helen made fifteen jars of strawberry jam per day for six consecutive days using only natural ingredients like lemon juice and wine to thicken the mixture, and as little sugar as possible to acquaint herself with the sweet flavor of the fruit itself. The recipes varied each day based on the sweetness of the berries plucked from the plants, and the jam became increasingly tart as Helen came to appreciate the way lemon and wine enhanced the acidic undertone of the berries. The initial five days of the performance took place in private. On the sixth day, Helen staged the making of ''Strawberry Jam'' for an audience at the Art Gallery of California State College at Fullerton. And on the seventh day, she rested.

Six months later Helen resumed making strawberry jam as an artistic research project. She had continued ruminating on the conceptual imagery of the bottle and its attendant ideology of preservation. She wondered how the medium of photography would serve as a tool of preservation or perhaps continuity, not of the fruit itself, but of the knowledge and skill required to plant, grow, and harvest strawberries in cycles of regeneration with moments of abundance and scarcity. As a studio experiment, Helen used square wall-mounted shelves to arrange a canvas-like grid composition of jars filled with jam left over from the Fullerton exhibition. She then entreated Philip Steinmetz, a conceptual artist and photographer who in 1971 had joined the Visual Arts Department faculty at UC San Diego, to make two color images: one of abundance with all the jars in place so as to fill the shelves, and one of scarcity with only a few jars in place. She also produced a third and compelling image in which she placed just three jars on top of a short stack of books, including [[Jack Burnham]]’s ''The Structure of Art'', and printed several copies such that she could modify the composition using collage techniques. With collage, Helen could adjust the quantity of jars and stack them in different cumulative formations as a way of reflecting on the merits of growth form and growth activism by women in relation to the so-called structure of art.

''Off Strawberry Wall'' (1974), Helen's second solo work, began when feminist art historian [[Arlene Raven]] invited Helen to participate in the exhibition program at the [[The Women's Building|Women's Building]] of Los Angeles. Helen paired up with Joyce Shaw for a three-week exhibition at Grandview One Gallery inside the Women's Building. The artist statement that she produced for this show further demonstrates the fluidness of her thinking about time, labor, culture, art, preservation, and continuity of life. In this statement, she explained that both strawberry works are “spin-offs and amusements from feasts and performances that I have done in other contexts. I am interested in the relationship between the morphologies and transformations that happen in living and growing and cooking and the transformations that we call art. I am especially interested in those intentional transformations that make objects stand for process. The play of time, nature and artifice is an important element in my work and I am intrigued by the juxtaposition of real growth strawberries, shelf-life for the jam and the instantaneous transformations of the camera and collage.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On the largest wall of Grandview One Gallery, Helen hung the Steinmetz photographs alongside her exploratory collage that questioned the merits of work by women in relation to the structure of art. On an adjacent wall, she installed a low-lying horizontal pasture of strawberry plants in modular container-like forms that Newton had designed for ''Survival Pieces''. But the closing of the exhibition on March 23, 1974 would coincide with a special celebration explicitly called "A Woman Made Day" to include an array of events such as a gynecological self-help slideshow by the Feminist Women's Health Center, a karate and self-defense demonstration by Karen Iwafuchi, an open forum on survival and power by the Commission Against Rape, a presentation about the creation of the Feminist Studio Workshop (the entity that founded the Women's Building), and a jamming performance by Helen.

With ''Strawberry Jam'' (1973) and ''Off Strawberry Wall'' (1974), Helen reaffirmed the work of art as an opening for participants to learn, sense, and even bond with their food sources as precious—and in turn to see themselves as capable of making growth and form choices that benefit society without degrading the earth. These two strawberry works also signaled a turning point in a new politics of knowledge—an affirmative politics—by which Helen and Newton Harrison began combining scientific research on environmental issues like pollution and global warming with self-critical introspection, mixed media technologies, and the live action of performance art to energize the epistemologies and ontologies of academia and civic life.&lt;ref&gt;The "Switching Careers Midstream" segment of this page is adapted from Eliasieh, Laura (née Rogers).

== Collaborative Studio Practice ==
Helen and Newton recruited their youngest son Gabriel Harrison and Vera Westergaard to join them in establishing the Harrison Studio in 1993. The Studio relocated from La Jolla to Santa Cruz in 2004. The Harrison Studio's subject matter ranges across a large number of disciplines, yet always has at its core the eco-social well-being of place and community. Whether dealing with the reclamation of watersheds, reforestation, or modest projects in cities and their surrounds, whole systems thinking guides the conceptual processes of their research. They have exhibited broadly and internationally with large-scale installations using diverse media that have critical and propositional thinking in them. They use the exhibition format in several ways, often in the sense of a town meeting, always with the intention of seeing their proposals moving off the walls, landing in planning processes, and ultimately resulting in interventions towards social and environmental justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Helen and Newton Harrison - InterSciWiki|url = http://128.200.18.105/wiki/index.php/Helen_and_Newton_Harrison|website = 128.200.18.105|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harrison Studio locates their work within the domains of both art and science. By operating in the domain of art, the Harrisons teach the ecological dimensions of the human condition better than they could were they working in the domain of science. By doing art with ecological content, the Studio implies that the human species should treat the planet as a sculpture. The first major collaborative work Helen and Newton produced in the early 1970s is known collectively as ''Survival Pieces'', so named because they intended each installation in the series to contribute to the design of a productive and sustainable food system (e.g. hog pasture, a catfish farm, and a citrus and avocado orchard). The ''Survival Pieces'' were exhibited in reputable galleries, commissioned by major museums, praised by influential critics, and studied by historians as well as philosophers. The work heralded future histories of [[BioArt]] and debates over the ethics, ontologies, and affects of non-human or posthuman life. The Harrisons worked with living entities as art mediums, and adopted biofunctions like waste, procreating, growing, evolving, dying, and decaying as art processes. Helen and Newton began working with global warming in the late 1970s as a result of a career-defining work called “The Lagoon Cycle”. All the work the Harrison Studio does involving this issue assumes that the world's oceans are indeed rising and reshaping the planet; they too are sculptors. This poetic idea is especially prominent in the Harrison Studio’s ongoing series “The Force Majeure” (2007–Present).

The [http://www.centerforforcemajeure.org/ Center for the Study of the Force Majeure], founded by Helen and Newton Harrison at UC Santa Cruz, operates on the principle that "We as a species must adapt ourselves to a very different world...proceed[ing] on our assertion that ecologically based, large-scale systems of adaptation to the extreme changes in the ever-warming environment are necessary for collective survival and so must be invented. Seen metaphorically, two frontiers are emergent and evolving exponentially: One is a wave front of water, advancing on the edges of all continents that touch the oceans; the other is a heat wave that is increasingly (apparently slowly, but in fact exponentially) and covering, touching, and affecting the whole planet and the lives on it. These are different from all other frontiers that have been part of human experience, frontiers that we have advanced toward, most often by conquering or exploiting to our own advantage. These new frontiers move toward us, and our habitual responses of exploiting resources for production, consumption, and profit are no longer meaningful behaviors. Rather, we must adapt ourselves to meet these two frontiers on the scale on which they operate."

One of the Harrison Studio projects from 1993, entitled ''Serpentine Lattice'', was quite successful. It was an installation that measured 10’x36′, and consisted of a dissolving slide mural of the disappearing North American Pacific Coast Temperate Rain Forest. The installation also included a 12’x36′ hand drawn map, text and forest image photo panels. At the time, 95% of the old forest growth had been harvested, and the cutting of the trees had left around 75 thousand miles of disturbed river and stream. The Studio created a design that would require controlling the high ground from the San Francisco Bay to Yakutat Bay in Alaska. This would create a scaffolding for the sustainable reclaiming of the Pacific Northwest Temperate Coastal Rain Forest. The main idea was to generate an eco-friendly security system, not too different from the social security system, and to use 1% of the Gross National Product to try and fight against the seemingly endless destruction of the environment. Included in this installation was a piece of writing to better explain their ideas and reasoning. This project took place at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Susan Fillin-Yeh supported the Harrisons in this endeavor. Douglas F. Cooley, from the Memorial Art Gallery of the college, commissioned the project. ''Serpentine Lattice'' is now in the permanent collection of the [[San Jose Museum of Art]].

Harrison Studio works are mainly done by invitation and commission. They often come when they are asked to begin research, propose ideas, and discuss with leaders in the area to try to make a change. They leave when they feel their work is done, or they have done all they are able to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = To Life!

'''''Tit-Bits from all the interesting Books, Periodicals, and Newspapers of the World''''', more commonly known as '''''Tit-Bits''''', was a British weekly magazine founded by an early father of popular journalism [[George Newnes]] on 22 October 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bridget Griffen-Foley|title=From Tit-Bits to Big Brother: a century of audience participation in the media|journal=Media Culture and Society|date=2004|volume=26|issue=4|url=http://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/MEDIA165/%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%89%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B5%CF%82%20%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85-audience%20research-%CF%84%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%B7/big%20brother.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the magazine's headquarters moved from [[Manchester]] to [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Howard Cox|author2=Simon Mowatt|title=Technology, Organisation and Innovation: The Historical Development of the UK Magazine Industry|url=http://aut.researchgateway.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10292/1129/Technology_organisation.pdf?sequence=1&amp;origin=publication_detail|work=Auckland University of Technology|accessdate=25 June 2016|format=Research paper|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it paved the way for popular journalism — most significantly, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' was founded by [[Alfred Harmsworth]], a contributor to ''Tit-Bits'', and the ''[[Daily Express]]'' was launched by [[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|Arthur Pearson]], who worked at ''Tit-Bits'' for five years after winning a competition to get a job on the magazine.&lt;ref name = "Hulda"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Friederichs, Hulda|authorlink= | coauthors= | title=George Newnes| year=1911 | publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton (1911) Kessinger Publishing (2008) | location=London | isbn=978-0-548-88777-6 | pages=}} (republished 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the outset, the magazine was a mass-circulation commercial publication on cheap newsprint which soon reached sales of between 400,000 and 600,000. Like a mini-encyclopedia it presented a diverse range of tit-bits of information in an easy-to-read format, with the emphasis on human interest stories concentrating on drama and sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Conboy ''Journalism: A Critical History''&lt;/ref&gt; It also featured short stories and full-length fiction, including works by authors such as [[Henry Rider Haggard|Rider Haggard]] and [[Isaac Asimov]], plus three very early stories by [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]].

The first humorous article by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], "Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings", appeared in ''Tit-Bits'' in November 1900.&lt;ref&gt;From the chronology maintained by the [http://wodehouse.ru/chrono.htm Russian Wodehouse Society]&lt;/ref&gt; During the first world war [[Ivor Novello]] won a ''Titbits'' competition to write a song soldiers could sing at the front: he penned ''[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)|Keep the Home Fires Burning]]''.&lt;ref name="MagfTB"&gt;{{cite web|title= Tit-Bits/Titbits |url=http://www.magforum.com/mens/mensmagazinesatoz11.htm |work= Magforum |accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pin-ups appeared on the magazine's covers from 1939 and by 1955 circulation peaked at 1,150,000.  At the beginning of 1973 ''Tit-Bits'' lost the hyphen from its masthead. In 1979 ''[[Reveille (newspaper)|Reveille]]'' (a weekly tabloid with a virtually identical demographic) was merged into ''Titbits'', and the magazine was briefly rebranded as ''Titbits incorporating Reveille''. This however was dropped in July 1981. On 18 July 1984,&lt;ref name="MagfTB"/&gt; under its last editor Paul Hopkins, ''Titbits'' was selling only 170,000 copies and was taken over by Associated Newspapers' ''Weekend''. At the time, the ''Financial Times'' described ''Titbits'' as “the 103-year-old progenitor of Britain's popular press”&lt;ref name="MagfTB"/&gt;. ''Weekend'' itself closed in 1989.

==Cultural influence ==
In ''All Things Considered'' by [[G. K. Chesterton]], the author contrasts ''Tit-Bits'' with the ''Times'', saying: "Let any honest reader... ask himself whether he would really rather be asked in the next two hours to write the front page of ''The Times'', which is full of long leading articles, or the front page of ''Tit-Bits'', which is full of short jokes." Reference to the magazine is also made in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"In the tabledrawer he found an old number of Titbits." ''[[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 4.2C Calypso|Calypso]]'' episode of ''Ulysses'' by James Joyce.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'', [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]]'s ''[[Lost Horizon]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Moments of Being]]'', [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'' and AJ Cronin's ''The Stars Look Down''. It has been also mentioned in [[Stanley Houghton]]'s play [[The Dear Departed]]. Wells also mentioned it in his book ''Experiment in Autobiography''. The magazine is burlesqued as "Chit Chat" in [[George Gissing]]'s ''[[New Grub Street]]''. In the closing scene of the film ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949), the protagonist Louis Mazzini ([[Dennis Price]]) is approached by a journalist ([[Arthur Lowe]]) from ''Tit-Bits''.

The magazine name survived as a glossy adult monthly ''Titbits International''.

'''Tyeb Mehta''' (25 July 1925&amp;nbsp;– 2 July 2009) was an Indian painter, sculptor and film maker. He was part of the [[Bombay Progressive Artists' Group]] and the first [[post-colonial]] generation of artists in India, like John Wilkins who also broke free from the nationalist [[Bengal school]] and embraced [[Modernism]] instead, with its [[post-impressionist]] colours, [[cubist]] forms and [[wikt:brusque|brusque]], [[expressionistic]] styles.

Among his most noted later paintings were his [[triptych]] ''[[Celebration (painting)|Celebration]]'', which when sold for Rs 15&amp;nbsp;million ($317,500) at a [[Christie's]] auction in 2002, was not only the highest sum for an Indian painting at an international auction, but also triggered the subsequent great Indian art boom;{{cn|date=June 2016}} his other noted works were the 'Diagonal Series', ''Santiniketan triptych'' series, ''[[Kali (painting)|Kali]]'', ''Mahishasura'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idINIndia-40764420090702 Artist Tyeb Mehta dies after long illness] [[Reuters]], 2 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed and worked in [[Mumbai]] for much of his life, except for three spells at London, New York, and [[Santiniketan]], each having a distinct impact upon his work. He received several awards during his career including the [[Padma Bhushan]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=nin&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-07-03/india/28178801_1_tyeb-mehta-koodal-rickshaw-puller Tyeb Mehta stood for hope over hype] Nina Martyris, [[Times of India]], 3 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ET-Cetera/Artist-Tyeb-Mehta-passes-away/articleshow/4730972.cms Tyeb Mehta, who weaved metaphor into images passes away] [[The Economic Times]], 3 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/tyeb-mehta-was-indias-most-expensive-living-artist-also-its-finest/362810/ Tyeb Mehta was Indias most expensive living artist, also its finest] Kishore Singh, [[Business Standard]], 3 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Tyeb Mehta was born on 26 July  1925 in [[Kapadvanj]], a town of [[Kheda district]], the Indian state of [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000056541|title=Mehta, Tyeb {{!}} Grove Art|language=en|doi=10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000056541|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought up in the [[Crawford Market]] neighbourhood of Mumbai, populated by [[Dawoodi Bohras]]. At 22 years, during the [[Partition of India|partition]] riots of 1947 in Mumbai, while staying at Lehri House, Mohammed Ali Road, he witnessed a man being stoned to death by a mob, this he not only expressed in a drawing but it was to have lasting impact on his work, leading to stark and often disturbing depiction of his subjects.&lt;ref name=nin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Svaraj: a journey with Tyeb Mehta's "Shantiniketan triptych"''. by [[Ramchandra Gandhi]]. Vadehra Art Gallery, 2002. {{ISBN|81-87737-02-6}}. ''Page 60''&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while initially, he worked as a film editor in a cinema laboratory at Famous Studios, in [[Tardeo]], Mumbai. Later, he received his diploma from [[Sir J.J. School of Art|Sir J. J. School of Art]] in 1952, and was part of the [[Bombay Progressive Artists' Group]], which drew stylistic inspiration from Western [[Modernism]], and included greats of Indian paintings such as [[F.N. Souza]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[M.F. Husain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/I-dont-paint-for-money-Tyeb-Mehta/articleshow/4654123.cms 'I don't paint for money'] [[The Times of India]], 14 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He left for London in 1959, where he worked and lived till 1964. Thereafter, he visited the New York City, when he was awarded a fellowship from the [[Asian Cultural Council|John D. Rockefeller 3rd Fund]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-09-20/news-interviews/27324810_1_tyeb-mehta-filmfare-critic-s-award-film-editor Tyeb Mehta: From filmmaker to painter] [[The Times of India]], 20 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; During the years the artist spent in London, Mehta's style was influenced by the expressionist works of Francis Bacon, but while in New York his work came to be characterised by minimalism.&lt;ref&gt;Tully, Judd. "[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/33077/tyeb-mehta/ Tyeb Mehta]" ''[[Art+Auction]]'', November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He made a three-minute film, ''Koodal'' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]] for 'meeting place'), which he shot at the [[Bandra]] slaughter house, it won the [[Filmfare Awards|Filmfare Critics Award]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"/&gt; He also remained an Artist-in-Residence at the [[Santiniketan]] between 1984–85, and returned to Mumbai with significant changes in his work. Common themes of his works were trussed bulls, the rickshaw puller, from here he moved to the ''Diagonal series'', which he created through the 1970s, after accidentally discovering it in 1969, when in a moment of creative frustration he flung a black streak across his canvas.&lt;ref name=nin/&gt; Later in life, he added ''Falling Figures'' made in 1991, based on his experience of witnessing the violent death of a man in the street during the [[Partition of India]] riots of 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Christie's First India Auction Offers Lots from The Gandhys' Collection |publisher= BLOUIN ''[[Art+Auction]]'' magazine| url = http://in.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/987054/christies-first-india-auction-offers-lots-from-the-gandhys |date=20 November 2013| accessdate = 24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides adding several mythological figures into his work, highlighted by the depictions of goddess [[Kali]] and demon [[Mahishasura]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestatesman.net/page.news.php?clid=2&amp;theme=&amp;usrsess=1&amp;id=259876 Tyeb Mehta passes away] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709150919/http://www.thestatesman.net/page.news.php?clid=2&amp;theme=&amp;usrsess=1&amp;id=259876 |date=9 July 2009 }} Press Trust of India, [[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]], 2 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyeb Mehta held the then record for the highest price an [[Indian painting]] has ever sold for at auction ($317,500 USD or 15 million [[Indian rupee]]s) for ''[[Celebration (painting)|Celebration]]'' at [[Christie's]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In December 2005, Mehta's painting ''Gesture'' was sold for 31 million Indian rupees to Ranjit Malkani, chairman of Kuomi Travel, at the Osian's auction.

Mehta's were the first works by a contemporary Indian artist to sell for over a million dollars, and indicated a burgeoning interest in Indian art by the international market; as a result, Mehta became a cultural hero.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2135">'''Upuh Ulen-Ulen,''' also known as '''kerawang gayo,''' is a traditional cloth of the [[Gayonese]] people in [[Aceh]], [[Indonesia]].
[[File:Upuh Ulen-Ulen.jpg|thumb|300 px| Upuh Ulen-Ulen from the collection of the Indonesian poet [[Deknong Kemalawati]]]]

The cloth is traditionally placed on a young couple during a wedding ceremony, as well as on the shoulders of guests of honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kodamim-tniad.mil.id/2016/11/21/kenakan-upuh-ulen-ulen-pangdam-im-dan-ibu-jadi-warga-kehormatan-gayo/ Kenakan Upuh Ulen-Ulen, Pangdam IM dan Ibu Jadi Warga Kehormatan Gayo]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2018, the Acheh poet [[Lesik Kati Ara]] presented [[Joko Widodo]], the president of Indonesia, with a cloth in the [[Istana Negara (Jakarta)|State Palace]] in [[Jakarta]]. &lt;ref&gt; Fikar W Eda. [http://aceh.tribunnews.com/2018/04/07/penyair-lk-ara-baca-puisi-bandara-rembela-lalu-serahkan-upuh-ulen-ulen-kepada-presiden-jokowi Penyair LK Ara Baca Puisi «Bandara Rembela» Lalu Serahkan Upuh Ulen-Ulen kepada Presiden Jokowi]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloth has many components. Traditionally, the background is meant to be the same as 'the contrast and color of the Earth'. According to a Gayonese proverb, God created man from the earth, who then lives on the earth and ultimately returns to the earth after death. The white circle in the center symbolizes a full moon.&lt;ref&gt;Andrian Kausyar. [http://www.lintasgayo.com/7936/upuh-ulen-ulen.html Upuh Ulen-Ulen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other motifs found in Upuh Ulen-Ulen are: 

# A fence (''jang''), since everything in the world has a certain limit, beyond which one should not go.
# Sprouts of bamboo (''tuwis''), which are symbols of persistence, longevity, and happiness.
# A string of clouds (''enum beriring''), which is an allegory of our path through life.&lt;ref&gt; Rosmala Dewi, Irsanti.

==Biography==

===Early years===
{{American socialism}}
Phillips was born in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, to Edwin Deroger Phillips and Frances Kathleen Coates.   His father, Edwin Phillips, was a labor organizer, and his parents' activism influenced much of his life's work.  Phillips was a card-carrying member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (Wobblies) headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.  His parents divorced and his mother remarried.  Phillips was adopted by his stepfather, Syd Cohen, at the age of five.  Cohen managed the Hippodrome Theater in Cleveland, one of the last vaudeville houses in the city.  Cohen moved the family to [[Salt Lake City]], Utah, where he managed the Lyric Theater, another vaudeville house.  Phillips attributes his early exposure to vaudeville through his stepfather as being an important influence on his later career.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Utah. [http://www.clownzen.com/clownofit/utahphillips.html clownzen.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218092632/http://www.clownzen.com/clownofit/utahphillips.html |date=December 18, 2013 }} June 2002 interview. Retrieved December 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips attended [[East High School (Salt Lake City)|East High School]] in Salt Lake City, where he was involved in the arts and plays.&lt;ref name="folkworks.org"&gt;[http://folkworks.org/columns/how-can-i-keep-from-talking-ross-altman/40229-polly-stewart-salt-lake-folk-revival "Folk Revival in Salt Lake City?"], folkworks.org. Retrieved 7 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[United States Army]] for three years in the 1950s. Witnessing the devastation of [[Korean War|post-war]] [[Korea]] greatly influenced his social and political thinking.  After discharge from the army, Phillips rode the railroads, and wrote songs.&lt;ref name="theunion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theunion.com/article/20080526/NEWS/88594631 |title=From hobo to fame |accessdate=14 April 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530183331/http://www.theunion.com/article/20080526/NEWS/88594631 |archivedate=May 30, 2008 |last=Pelline |first=Jeff |author2=Butler, Pat |date=May 26, 2008 |work=[[The Union (newspaper)|The Union]] |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
While riding the rails and tramping around the west, Phillips returned to Salt Lake City, where he met [[Ammon Hennacy]] from the [[Catholic Worker Movement]].  He gave credit to Hennacy for saving him from a life of drifting to one dedicated to using his gifts and talents toward activism and public service.&lt;ref name="folkworks.org"/&gt; Phillips assisted him in establishing a mission [[house of hospitality]] named after the activist [[Joe Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rattler |first=Fast |title=Utah Phillips on the Catholic Worker, Polarization, and Songwriting |url=http://www.olywip.org/site/page/article/2006/02/01.html |format=interview |accessdate=1 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212051908/http://www.olywip.org/site/page/article/2006/02/01.html |archivedate=December 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Crane |first=Carolyn |title=Interview with Utah Phillips |url=http://zmagsite.zmag.org:80/JulAug2004/crane0804.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120080529/http://zmagsite.zmag.org:80/JulAug2004/crane0804.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 January 2008 |format=interview, Z Magazine |accessdate=1 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips worked at the [[Joe Hill House]] for the next eight years, then ran for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] as a candidate of Utah's [[Peace and Freedom Party]] in 1968. He received 2,019 votes (0.5%) in an election won by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Wallace F. Bennett]].  He also ran for president of the United States in 1976 for the Do-Nothing Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawthorn |first=Tom |title=Unapologetic Wobbly folk singer found a second home in Canada |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/incoming/unapologetic-wobbly-folk-singer-found-a-second-home-in-canada/article17987785/?service=print |accessdate=16 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He adopted the name '''U. Utah Phillips''' in keeping with the [[hobo]] tradition of adopting a moniker that included an initial and the state of origin, and in emulation of country vocalist [[T. Texas Tyler]].&lt;ref&gt;Direct quotation from his biography in [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/29/AR2008052902087.html The Washington Post], May 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips met folk singer [[Rosalie Sorrels]] in the early 1950s, and remained a close friend of hers.  Sorrels started playing the songs that Phillips wrote, and through her his music began to spread. After leaving Utah in the late 1960s, he went to [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], where he was befriended by the folk community at the [[Caffè Lena]] coffee house.  He became a staple performer there for a decade, and would return throughout his career.
[[File:HayMarket100a.jpg|thumb|right|Phillips speaking at Waldheim Cemetery, Forest Park (outside Chicago) in May 1986 during ceremonies commemorating the 100th anniversary of the [[Haymarket affair]].]]
Phillips was a member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World|Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or Wobblies)]].  His views of unions and politics were shaped by his parents, especially his Mom who was a labor organizer for the CIO.  But Phillips was more of a [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] and a [[Pacifism|pacifist]], so found the modern-day Wobblies to be the perfect fit for him, an iconoclast and artist.  In recent years, perhaps no single person did more to spread the [[Industrial Workers of the World|Wobbly]] gospel than Phillips, whose countless concerts were, in effect, organizing meetings for the cause of labor, unions, anarchism, pacifism, and the Wobblies.  He was a tremendous interpreter of classic Wobbly tunes including "[[Hallelujah, I'm a Bum]]," "[[The Preacher and the Slave]]," and "[[Bread and Roses]]."

An avid [[Freighthopping|trainhopper]], Phillips recorded several albums of music related to the railroads, especially the era of steam locomotives. His 1973 album, ''Good Though!'', is an example, and contains such songs as "[[Daddy, What's a Train?]]" and "Queen of the Rails" as well as what may be his most famous composition, "Moose Turd Pie"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips |first=Bruce |title=Moose Turd Pie |url=http://www.utahphillips.org/stuff/mooseturdpie.mp3 |format=mp3 |accessdate=12 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613095956/http://www.utahphillips.org/stuff/mooseturdpie.mp3 |archivedate=June 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein he tells a [[tall tale]] of his work as a [[gandy dancer]] repairing track in the Southwestern United States desert.

In 1991 Phillips recorded, in one take, an album of song, poetry and short stories entitled ''I've Got To Know'', inspired by his anger at the first [[Gulf War]]. The album includes "Enola Gay," his first composition written about the United States' atomic attack on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

Phillips was a mentor to [[Kate Wolf]]. He recorded songs and stories with [[Rosalie Sorrels]] on a CD called ''The Long Memory'' (1996), originally a college project "Worker's Doxology" for 1992 'cold-drill Magazine' Boise State University. His protégée, [[Ani DiFranco]], recorded two CDs, ''[[The Past Didn't Go Anywhere]]'' (1996) and ''[[Fellow Workers]]'' (1999), with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Merritt |first=Stephanie |title=Life Support |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/apr/22/features.magazine47 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 28, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for his work with DiFranco. His "Green Rolling Hills" was made into a country hit by [[Emmylou Harris]], and "[[Goodnight-Loving Trail (song)|The Goodnight-Loving Trail]]" became a classic as well, being recorded by [[Ian Tyson]], [[Tom Waits]], and others.

===Later years===
Though known primarily for his work as a concert performer and labor organizer, Phillips also worked as an archivist, dishwasher, and warehouse-man.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theunion.com/article/20080529/OBITUARIES/482688530/1046&amp;parentprofile=1058 |title=Bruce Phillips |accessdate=7 June 2008 |date=May 29, 2008 |work=[[The Union (newspaper)|The Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips was a member of various socio-political organizations and groups throughout his life. A strong supporter of labor struggles, he was a member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), the [[Western Federation of Miners|International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers]] (Mine Mill), and the [[Travelling Musician's Union AFM Local 1000]]. In solidarity with the poor, he was also an honorary member of [[Dignity Village]], a homeless community. A pacifist, he was a member of [[Veterans for Peace]] and the [[Peace Center of Nevada County]].&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

In his personal life, Phillips enjoyed varied hobbies and interests. These included [[Egyptology]]; amateur [[chemistry]]; [[linguistics]]; history ([[History of Asia|Asian]], [[History of Africa|African]], [[History of the Latter Day Saint movement|Mormon]] and [[World history|world]]); [[Runes|futhark]]; [[debate]]; and poetry. He also enjoyed culinary hobbies, such as [[pickling]], cooking and gardening.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

He married Joanna Robinson on July 31, 1989, in Nevada City.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;
[[Image:Utah Phillips death note.png|thumb|Acetate stencil commemorating the life and death of Utah Phillips (1935–2008)]]
Phillips became an elder statesman for the folk music community, and a keeper of stories and songs that might otherwise have passed into obscurity. He was also a member of the great [[Traveling Nation]], the community of hobos and railroad bums that populates the Midwest United States along the rail lines, and was an important keeper of their history and culture. He also became an honorary member of numerous folk societies in the U.S.A. and Canada.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

When Kate Wolf grew ill and was forced to cancel concerts, she asked Phillips to fill in. Suffering from an ailment which makes it more difficult to play guitar, Phillips hesitated, citing his declining guitar ability. "Nobody ever came just to hear you play," she said. Phillips told this story as a way of explaining how his style over the years became increasingly based on storytelling instead of just songs. He was a gifted storyteller and monologist, and his concerts generally had an even mix of spoken word and sung content. He attributed much of his success to his personality. "It is better to be likeable than talented," he often said, self-deprecatingly.

Until it lost its funding, Phillips hosted his own weekly radio show, ''Loafer's Glory: The Hobo Jungle of the Mind,'' originating on [[KVMR]] and nationally syndicated.

Phillips lived in [[Nevada City, California]], for 21 years where he worked on the start-up of the [[house of hospitality|Hospitality House]], a homeless shelter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Utah Phillips: Folksinger, songwriter and bard of the last days of the US railroad |first= Tony |last=Russell |newspaper= [[The Guardian]]|date= June 24, 2008

In August 2007, Phillips announced that he would undergo [[catheter ablation]] to address his heart problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |last=Phillips |first=U.Utah |title=The Latest From FW Utah Phillips |url=http://www.iww.org/en/node/3587 |format=announcement |accessdate=24 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that autumn, Phillips announced that due to health problems he could no longer tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Utah |title=Retirement Announcement |url=http://www.utahphillips.org/podcast/utah20071011.mp3 |format=mp3 |accessdate=1 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227205154/http://www.utahphillips.org/podcast/utah20071011.mp3 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2008, he decided against a [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]].&lt;ref name="theunion"/&gt;

Phillips died May 23, 2008 in [[Nevada City, California]], from complications of heart disease, at the age of 73,&lt;ref name="kvmr" /&gt; and is buried in Forest View Cemetery in Nevada City.&lt;ref name="theunion"/&gt;

==Personal papers==
Archival materials related to Phillips' personal and professional life are open for research at the [[Walter P. Reuther Library]] in Detroit, Michigan.  The papers include correspondence, interviews, writings, notes, contracts, flyers, publications, articles, clippings, photographs, audiovisual recordings, and other materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pillen|first1=Dallas|title=Collection Spotlight: The Utah Phillips Papers|url=http://reuther.wayne.edu/node/12357|website=Walter P.

'''vbeauté''' was founded by [[Julie Macklowe]] to provide women with Swiss made anti-age skincare products. vbeauté is a skin care line based on advanced botanical technology using [[plant stem cell]] complexes. Julie Macklow launched vbeauté on November 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belle of it All|url=https://vbeaute.com/index.php/profile/news/read/id/54/|work=Quest Magazine|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  vbeauté's range of products include: peptide-based anti-aging face and eye serums, moisturizers, eye cream, sunscreen, and a face cleanser and exfoliator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Sarah|title=Jet Setter|work=magazine article|publisher=Vogue|accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187B9D7ShGY|title=Skin Care: The "It" Kit For Traveling|date=10 January 2012|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arnoldy|first=Lindley|title=From finance to fashion|url=http://houston.culturemap.com/newsdetail/02-10-12-from-finance-to-fashion-julie-macklowe-uses-her-250-million-hedge-fund-wizardry-in-the-beauty-world/|work=Online article|publisher=Culture Map Houston|accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
vbeauté’s key ingredient in all of their products is Swiss Alpine Rose, a cold-resistant plant from the [[Swiss Alps]]. The plant is known to provide anti-oxidant protection and protection against UV rays. vbeauté formulas also contain stem cells extracted from [[Nicotiana sylvestris]] plant. Together, along with several other botanical ingredients, these plant extracts combine to form a complex compound which has anti-aging and protective properties. All vbeauté products are formulated in Switzerland, free of fragrance and parabens, and dermatologist and allergy tested. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Alexandra|title=Career Rejuvination|work=Magazine article|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
vbeauté was launched by investor and former hedge fund manager [[Julie Macklowe]] in 2011. During her travels, Macklowe could not find a suitable skincare product to meet her everyday needs. She then partnered with molecular scientists from the Centre de Recherches Biocosmétiques (CRB High Performance Care) of [[Geneva]] to formulate her products. By 2011, Macklowe had raised over $4,000,000 for lab work and testing.  The skin care line's main ingredient contains stem cells from the Alpine Rose flower.  The Alpine Rose is a small pink flower which is known for its resilient properties and  can only be found in the harsh climate of the Swiss alps, where it endures high altitudes, extreme temperatures, and dryness.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=Vbeaute|url=http://www.vbeaute.com/about|accessdate=8 March 2014|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="businessweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/after-hedge-funds-a-career-rejuvenation-02022012.html|title=After Hedge Funds, a Career Rejuvenation|author=Alexandra Wolfe|work=Businessweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially, vbeauté was launched at Bergdorf Goodman's, a luxury goods department store based in New York City.  After two years at Bergdorf's, the company appeared on the Home Shopping Network.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weiss|first1=Zachary|title=Why Julie Macklowe Is Society’s Breakout Star|url=http://observer.com/2015/04/why-julie-macklowe-is-societys-breakout-star/|website=observer.com|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; vbeauté is the first luxury skincare line that took exactly the same products, ingredients, and packaging offered at higher price points at [[Bergdorf Goodman]], and brought the same quality at more affordable pricing via HSN. At HSN, customers' describe vbeauté as an affordable skincare line, which is something Macklowe believes "no other brand has really done."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Macklowe says that she learned the company was spending a lot of money on advertising and selling expenses, however the company's vision was "that all women should have the best skincare."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''''What Just Happened''''' is a 2008 American [[satire|satirical]] [[comedy-drama]] directed by [[Barry Levinson]] and starring [[Robert De Niro]]. The supporting cast includes [[Catherine Keener]], [[Robin Wright Penn]], [[Stanley Tucci]], and [[Sean Penn]].

''What Just Happened'' is an independent film, produced by [[2929 Productions]], [[Art Linson|Art Linson Productions]] and [[Tribeca Productions]], and was released on October 17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.yahoo.com/2008-cannes-film-festival-lineup-1463981.html 2008 Cannes Film Festival Lineup. voices.yahoo.com. December 10, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film is based on the book ''What Just Happened? Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line'' by [[Art Linson]], about his experiences as a producer in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;"What Just Happened?: Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line".Author Art Linson
{{ISBN|1-58234-240-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This film was shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on May 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.yahoo.com/2008-cannes-film-festival-lineup-1463981.html 2008 Cannes Film Festival Lineup. voices.yahoo.com. December 10, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Ben ([[Robert De Niro]]), a veteran [[Hollywood]] producer, is suffering a number of professional and personal problems. His latest film, ''Fiercely'', has a disastrous test screening, mostly because of its ending which features the murder of its main character (played by [[Sean Penn]], who plays himself elsewhere in the film) along with his pet dog.

Ben and his maverick [[United Kingdom|British]] director, Jeremy Brunell ([[Michael Wincott]]), plead their case to studio executive Lou Tarnow ([[Catherine Keener]]). She accuses Ben of filming the dog's killing only so he could use it as a "bargaining chip" - to make it easier to negotiate against cutting other problematic scenes. Lou threatens to pull Ben's movie from [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and take over editing unless at least the dog's death is removed. Jeremy adamantly refuses, throwing a tantrum.

Adding to Ben's problems, he is having trouble making a clean break from Kelly, his second wife. Ben later discovers his wife is having an affair with Scott Solomon, a married screenwriter who Ben has previously worked with. Scott has a screenplay that he's trying to get off the ground, to which [[Brad Pitt]] later becomes attached.  

Lastly the studio is threatening to cancel a planned [[Bruce Willis]] movie because of the star's unwillingness to shave the large, thick beard that he has grown. Ben's career hinges on the fate of the film, but any attempt to reason with Willis inevitably meets a violent, foul-mouthed response.

Ultimately Jeremy relents and re-edits the ending of ''Fiercely'' to have the dog survive. Ben tries to get Willis's agent, Dick Bell, to reason with him and get the beard removed, but his efforts only get Ben fired. Nonetheless, Willis does eventually shave his beard off, and the film goes ahead.

A week later, Ben, Lou and Jeremy attend Cannes, hopeful that they might take a [[Palme D'Or]] award. Unfortunately, and without telling Ben or Lou, Jeremy has re-edited ''Fiercely'' again, not only killing the dog, but adding nearly a full minute of bullets being shot into their bodies. While the new ending destroys the film's chances of a Palme d'Or and angers many in the audience, others eagerly applaud the final version of the film, including Sean Penn (playing himself). Lou is not impressed, and immediately flies out of Cannes on the studio's private jet, leaving Ben stranded in [[France]].

Ben eventually does make it back home, in time for a photo-shoot of Hollywood's top thirty producers with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', although after the magazine's publishers hear about the debacle in Cannes, Ben is relegated to the far edge of the photo, meaning he will be barely noticeable.

==Critical reception==
Based on 139 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has received an overall "Rotten" rating of 51%, with a [[weighted average]] score of 5.8/10.&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/what_just_happened/ |title=What Just Happened |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Flixster |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sites consensus states: "''What Just Happened'' has some inspired comic moments, but this inside-baseball take on Hollywood lacks [[satire|satirical]] bite."

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Monk Testing Wine - Antonio Casanova y Estorach.jpg|thumb|''Monk Testing Wine'' by [[:es:Antonio Casanova y Estorach|Antonio Casanova y Estorach]] (c.1886)]]
'''Wine tasting''' is the sensory examination and evaluation of [[wine]]. While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters (such as [[sommelier]]s or buyers for [[retailer]]s) use a constantly evolving specialized terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Peynaud, Émile (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nzehk2Vu5K8C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=wine+tasting+aims&amp;ei=_9nIRvLrCJSS7QKiu9zfDw&amp;sig=LmyRAwE8FKHf-N4Bz3rOWXEkGsY#PPA2,M1  ''The Taste of Wine: The Art and Science of Wine Appreciation'', London: Macdonald Orbis, p1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Results contradicting the reliability of wine tasting in both experts and consumers have surfaced through scientific [[blind wine tasting]], such as inconsistency in identifying wines based on region and price.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Robert T., [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8545711 "How Expert are "Expert" Wine Judges?"], ''Journal of Wine Economics'', Vol. 4; Issue 02 (Winter 2009), pp. 233–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Sumer|Sumerian]] stories of [[Gilgamesh]] in the 3rd millennium BCE differentiate the popular beers of [[Mesopotamia]], as well as wines from [[Zagros Mountains]] or [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;Émile Peynaud, '' The taste of wine '', p.1 Dunod, 2013 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=Wfb7AAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=le%20gout%20du%20vin%20peynaud&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google books link]&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth century BCE, [[Plato]] listed the main flavors of wine, and classified the aromas as "species", or families.

[[Aristotle]] proposed a sensory tasting defined by the [[four elements]] (air, water, fire, and earth) further deepened by the Roman noblewoman [[Lucretia]] in the first century BCE.

Although the practice of tasting is as old as the history of wine, the term "tasting" first appeared in 1519.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tasting: Definition and etymology | url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/degustation | website=cnrtl.fr | date = | accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology of wine tasting was formalized by the 18th century when [[Linnaeus]], Poncelet, and others brought an understanding of tasting up to date.

In 2004, [[Richard Axel]] and [[Linda B. Buck]], won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their contribution to the knowledge of the senses of taste and smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Cell |date=1991 Apr 5 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=175-87 |pmid=1840504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tasting stages==
[[File:Porto.Grahams02.jpg|thumb|right|Ready tasting room of [[port wine]] in a [[wine cellar]] of a producer]]
The results of the four recognized stages to wine tasting:
* appearance
* "in glass" the [[aroma of the wine]]
* "in mouth" sensations
* "finish" ([[aftertaste]])&lt;ref&gt;Ronald S. Jackson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=n0z8XCvAS9EC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=wine+tasting+aims&amp;ei=md3IRrebI5SE7AKk6tzfDw&amp;sig=_ynh2E9B7eRT7ta9AbrpOL5qpaE#PPA2,M1 ''Wine Tasting: A Professional Handbook'', pp 2–3]&lt;/ref&gt;
– are combined in order to establish the following properties of a wine: 
* complexity and character
* potential (suitability for [[aging (wine)|aging]] or drinking)
* possible [[Wine fault|faults]]
A wine's overall quality assessment, based on this examination, follows further careful description and comparison with recognized standards, both with respect to other wines in its price range and according to known factors pertaining to the region or vintage; if it is typical of the region or diverges in style; if it uses certain [[wine-making]] techniques, such as barrel [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] or [[malolactic fermentation]], or any other remarkable or unusual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Peynaud, Émile (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nzehk2Vu5K8C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=wine+tasting+aims&amp;ei=_9nIRvLrCJSS7QKiu9zfDw&amp;sig=LmyRAwE8FKHf-N4Bz3rOWXEkGsY#PPA2,M1  ''The Taste of Wine: The Art and Science of Wine Appreciation'', London: Macdonald Orbis, p2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NorCal2018 Castello di Amorosa Wine Tasting Napa Valley S0151015.jpg|thumb|Wine tasting at [[Castello di Amorosa]], Napa Valley]]

Whereas wines are regularly tasted in isolation, a wine's quality assessment is more objective when performed alongside several other wines, in what are known as tasting "flights". Wines may be deliberately selected for their [[vintage]] ("horizontal" tasting) or proceed from a single [[winery]] ("vertical" tasting), to better compare [[vineyard]] and vintages, respectively. Alternatively, in order to promote an unbiased analysis, bottles and even glasses may be disguised in a "blind" tasting, to rule out any prejudicial awareness of either vintage or winery.

==Blind tasting==
{{Main|Blind wine tasting}}
To ensure impartial judgment of a wine, it should be served ''blind'' – that is, without the taster(s) having seen the label or bottle shape. Blind tasting may also involve serving the wine from a black wine glass to mask the [[wine color|color]] of the wine. A taster's judgment can be prejudiced by knowing details of a wine, such as geographic origin, price, reputation, color, or other considerations.

Scientific research has long demonstrated the [[Placebo|power of suggestion in perception]] as well as the strong effects of expectancies. For example, people expect more expensive wine to have more desirable characteristics than less expensive wine. When given wine that they are falsely told is expensive they virtually always report it as tasting better than the very same wine when they are told that it is inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928231853/http://www.academie-amorim.com/us/laureat_2001/brochet.pdf Chemical Object Representation in the Field of Consciousness – Frédéric Brochet]&lt;/ref&gt; French researcher Frédéric Brochet "submitted a mid-range Bordeaux in two different bottles, one labeled as a cheap table wine, the other bearing a grand cru etiquette." Tasters described the supposed grand cru as "woody, complex, and round" and the supposed cheap wine as  "short, light, and faulty."

Similarly, people have expectations about wines because of their [[List of wine producing regions|geographic origin]], [[winery|producer]], vintage, color, and many other factors. For example, when Brochet served a white wine he received all the usual descriptions: "fresh, dry, honeyed, lively." Later he served the same wine dyed red and received the usual red terms: "intense, spicy, supple, deep."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210308/http://www.seattleweekly.com/2002-02-20/news/wine-snob-scandal.php Wine Snob Scandal – Brochet's work on dyed wine]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous instances of blind testing is known as the [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Judgment of Paris]], a [[wine competition]] held in 1976 where French judges blind-tested wines from [[France]] and [[California]]. Against all expectations, [[California wines]] bested [[French wines]] according to the judges, a result which would have been unlikely in a non-blind contest. This event was depicted in the 2008 movie ''[[Bottle Shock]]''.

===Price bias===
Another well-publicized double-blind taste test was conducted in 2011 by [[Richard Wiseman|Prof. Richard Wiseman]] of the [[University of Hertfordshire]].  In a wine tasting experiment using 400 participants, Wiseman found that general members of the public were unable to distinguish expensive wines from inexpensive ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Georgiou | first = Maroulla | title = Expensive and inexpensive wines taste the same, research shows | publisher = [[Phys.Org]] | date = Apr 15, 2011 | url = http://phys.org/news/2011-04-expensive-inexpensive-wines.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "People just could not tell the difference between cheap and expensive wine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Sample | first = Ian | title = Expensive wine and cheap plonk taste the same to most people | publisher = The Guardian | date = April 14, 2011 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/apr/14/expensive-wine-cheap-plonk-taste?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color bias===
In 2001, the [[University of Bordeaux]] asked 54 undergraduate students to test two glasses of wine: one red, one white. The participants described the red as "jammy" and commented on its crushed red fruit.  The participants failed to recognize that both wines were from the same bottle.  The only difference was that one had been colored red with a flavorless dye.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/23/wine-tasting-junk-science-analysis Wine-tasting: it's junk science; The Guardian; June 22, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0093934X01924939/1-s2.0-S0093934X01924939-main.pdf?_tid=c6c9ffa6-bc7a-11e5-ae11-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1452967301_69c3ad144ba81882e1b68bbb498d79d2 The Colour of Odors; Morrot, Brochet and Dubourdeiu; 28 August 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Geographic origin bias===
For 6 years, [[Texas A&amp;M University]] invited people to taste wines labeled "France", "California", "Texas", and while nearly all ranked the French as best, in fact, all three were the same Texan wine.  The contest is built on the simple theory that if people do not know what they are drinking, they award points differently than if they do know what they are drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/2005-04-08/265667/ Liquid Assets - A fair competition; The Austin Chronicle; April 8, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertical and horizontal tasting==
'''Vertical and horizontal wine tastings''' are wine tasting events that are arranged to highlight differences between similar wines.
* In a '''vertical tasting''', different vintages of the same [[Wine#Wine styles|wine type]] from the same winery are tasted. This emphasizes differences between various vintages.
* In a '''horizontal tasting''', the wines are all from the same vintage but are from different wineries. Keeping wine variety or type and [[List of wine producing regions|wine region]] the same helps emphasize differences in winery styles.

==Tasting flights==
'''Tasting flight''' is a term used by wine tasters to describe a selection of wines, usually between three and eight glasses, but sometimes as many as fifty, presented for the purpose of sampling and comparison.

==Tasting notes==
A '''tasting note''' refers to a taster's written testimony about the aroma, taste identification, acidity, structure, texture, and balance of a wine. Online wine communities like [[Bottlenotes]] allow members to maintain their tasting notes online and for the reference of others.

==Serving temperature==
The temperature that a wine is served at can greatly affect the way it tastes and smells. Lower temperatures will emphasize [[acidity]] and [[tannins (wine)|tannin]]s while muting the [[aromatic]]s. Higher temperatures will minimize acidity and tannins while increasing the aromatics.

== Glassware ==
{{Main|Wine glass}}
The shape of a wineglass can have a subtle impact on the perception of wine, especially its bouquet.&lt;ref name="glass1"&gt;Huttenbrink, K., Schmidt, C., Delwiche, J., &amp; Hummel, T. (2001). The aroma of red wine is modified by the form of the wine glass. ''Laryno-Rhino-Otologie'', 80(2), 96–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glass2"&gt;Delwiche, J., &amp; Pelchat, M. (2002). Influence of glass shape on wine aroma. ''Journal of Sensory Studies'', 17(1), 19–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glass3"&gt;Hummel, T., Delwiche, J., Schmidt, C., &amp; Huttenbrink, K. (2003). Effects of the form of glasses on the perception of wine flavors: a study in untrained subjects. ''Appetite'', 41(2), 197–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the ideal shape is considered to be wider toward the bottom, with a narrower aperture at the top (tulip or egg shaped). Glasses which are widest at the top are considered the least ideal. Many wine tastings use [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] XL5 glasses,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} which are "egg"-shaped. The effect of glass shape does not appear to be related to whether the glass is pleasing to look at.&lt;ref name="glass3"/&gt;

== Wine color ==
Without having tasted the wines, one does not know if, for example, a white is heavy or light. Before taking a sip, the taster tries to determine the order in which the wines should be assessed by appearance and nose alone. Heavy wines will be deeper in [[wine color|color]] and generally more intense on the nose. Sweeter wines, being denser, will leave thick, [[viscous]] streaks (called ''legs'' or ''[[Tears of wine|tears]]'') down the inside of the glass when swirled.

==Process==
[[File:Tempranillowine.jpg|thumb|right|Judging [[wine color|color]] is the first step in tasting wine.]]
There are five basic steps in tasting wine: color, swirl, smell, taste, and savor.&lt;ref name=course&gt;Zraly, Kevin. ''Windows on the World: Complete Wine Course''; Sterling Publishing, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; These are also known as the "five S" steps: see, swirl, sniff, sip, savor. During this process, a taster must look for clarity, varietal character, integration, expressiveness, complexity, and connectedness.&lt;ref name=winebible&gt;MacNeil, Karen. ''The Wine Bible''; Workman Publishing, New York (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

A wine's color is better judged by putting it against a white background. The wine glass is put at an angle in order to see the colors. Colors can give the taster clues to the grape variety, and whether the wine was aged in wood.

===Characteristics assessed during tasting===
Varietal character describes how much a wine presents its inherent grape aromas.&lt;ref name="winebible"/&gt; A wine taster also looks for integration, which is a state in which none of the components of the wine ([[Acids in wine|acid]], tannin, alcohol, etc.) is out of balance with the other components. When a wine is well balanced, the wine is said to have achieved a harmonious fusion.&lt;ref name="winebible"/&gt;

Another important quality of the wine to look for is its expressiveness. Expressiveness is the quality the "wine possesses when its aromas and flavors are well-defined and clearly projected."&lt;ref name=winebible5&gt;MacNeil, Karen. ''The Wine Bible''; Workman Publishing, New York, p.5 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of the wine is affected by many factors, one of which may be the multiplicity of its flavors. The connectedness of the wine, a rather abstract and difficult to ascertain quality, describes the bond between the wine and its land of origin (terroir).&lt;ref name="winebible"/&gt;

===Connoisseur wine tasting===
A wine's quality can be judged by its bouquet and taste. The bouquet is the total aromatic experience of the wine. Assessing a wine's bouquet can also reveal faults such as [[cork taint]]; [[oxidation]] due to age, overexposure to oxygen, or lack of preservatives; and wild [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] or bacterial contamination, such as those due to [[Acetobacter]] or ''[[Brettanomyces]]'' yeasts.  Although low levels of ''Brettanomyces'' aromatic characteristics can be a positive attribute, giving the wine a distinctive character, generally it is considered a wine spoilage yeast.

The bouquet of wine is best revealed by gently swirling the wine in a wine glass to expose it to more oxygen and release more [[aromaticity|aromatic]]&lt;ref name=Gluckstern&gt;{{cite book | last=Gluckstern |first=Willie |title=The Wine Avenger |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; etheric, ester, and aldehyde molecules that comprise the essential components of a wine's bouquet.&lt;ref name=course/&gt; [[Sparkling wine]] should not be swirled to the point of releasing bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maisons-champagne.com/encyclopedie/vignes_au_plaisir/erreurs.htm |title=Eviter les erreurs Encyclopédie des Vignes au plaisir |publisher=Maisons-champagne.com |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pausing to experience a wine's bouquet aids the wine taster in anticipating the wine's flavors. The "nose" of a wine – its bouquet or aroma – is the major determinate of perceived flavor in the mouth. Once inside the mouth, the aromatics are further liberated by exposure to body heat, and transferred [[Human nose|retronasally]] to the [[olfactory receptor]] site. It is here that the complex taste experience characteristic of a wine actually commences.

Thoroughly tasting a wine involves perception of its array of taste and [[mouthfeel]] attributes, which involve the combination of textures, flavors, weight, and overall "structure". Following appreciation of its olfactory characteristics, the wine taster savors a wine by holding it in the mouth for a few seconds to saturate the [[taste bud]]s. By pursing ones lips and breathing through that small opening oxygen will pass over the wine and release even more esters. When the wine is allowed to pass slowly through the mouth it presents the connoisseur with the fullest gustatory profile available to the human palate.

The acts of pausing and focusing through each step distinguishes wine tasting from simple quaffing. Through this process, the full array of aromatic molecules is captured and interpreted by approximately 15 million olfactory receptors,&lt;ref name=Gluckstern /&gt; comprising a few hundred olfactory receptor classes. When tasting several wines in succession, however, key aspects of this fuller experience (length and finish, or aftertaste) must necessarily be sacrificed through expectoration.

Although taste qualities are known to be widely distributed throughout the oral cavity, the concept of an anatomical "[[tongue map]]" yet persists in the wine tasting arena, in which different tastes are believed to map to different areas of the tongue. A widely accepted example is the misperception that the tip of the tongue uniquely tells how sweet a wine is and the upper edges tell its acidity.&lt;ref name=Gluckstern /&gt;

==Scoring wine==
{{main|wine rating}}
{{See also|Wine tasting descriptors}}
As part of the tasting process, and as a way of comparing the merits of the various wines, wines are given scores according to a relatively set system. This may be either by explicitly weighting different aspects, or by global judgment (although the same aspects would be considered). These aspects are 1) the appearance of the wine, 2) the nose or smell, 3) the palate or taste, and 4) overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winepros.org/wine101/sensory_guide.htm Professional Friends of Wine]&lt;/ref&gt; Different systems weight these differently (e.g., appearance 15%, nose 35%, palate 50%). Typically, no modern wine would score less than half on any scale (which would effectively indicate an obvious fault). It is more common for wines to be scored out of 20 (including half marks) in Europe and parts of Australasia, and out of 100 in the US. However, different critics tend to have their own preferred system, and some gradings are also given out of 5 (again with half marks).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wine-searcher.com/wine-scores.lml Wine-Searcher]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visiting wineries ==
Traveling to wine regions is one way of increasing skill in tasting. Many wine producers in wine regions all over the world offer tastings of their wine. Depending on the country or region, tasting at the winery may incur a small charge to allow the producer to cover costs.

It is not considered rude to spit out wine at a winery, even in the presence of the wine maker or owner. Generally, a [[spittoon]] will be provided. In some regions of the world, tasters simply spit on the floor or onto gravel surrounding barrels. It is polite to inquire about where to spit before beginning tasting.

== Attending wine schools ==
A growing number of wine schools can be found, offering wine tasting classes to the public. These programs often help a wine taster hone and develop their abilities in a controlled setting. Some also offer professional training for sommeliers and winemakers. It is even possible to learn how to assess wine methodically via e-learning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wine Campus]] offers an Honours Brevet via e-learning&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expectoration ==
[[File:Crachoir by JM Rosier.JPG|thumb|upright|Spitting into a [[spittoon]] at a wine tasting.]]
Because intoxication can affect the consumer's judgment, wine tasters generally spit the wine out after they have assessed its quality at formal tastings, where dozens of wines may be assessed. However, since wine is absorbed through the skin inside the mouth, tasting from twenty to twenty-five samplings can still produce an intoxicating effect, depending on the alcoholic content of the wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Walton| first =Stuart| title =Cook's Encyclopedia of Wine| year=2005| publisher =Anness Publishing Limited 2002, 2005| pages = 10, 11| isbn = 0-7607-4220-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sensory analysis ==
Tasting plays an important role in the [[sensory analysis]] (also referred to as [[organoleptic]] analysis) of wine. Employing a [[trained panel|trained]] or consumer panel, [[Oenology|oenologists]] may perform a variety of tests on the taste, aroma, mouthfeel and appeal of wines. [[Discrimination testing|Difference tests]] are important in determining whether different fermentation conditions or new vineyard treatments alter the character of a wine, something particularly important to producers who aim for consistency. Preference testing establishes consumer preference, while descriptive analysis determines the most prominent traits of the wine, some of which grace back labels. Blind tasting and other laboratory controls help mitigate bias and assure statistically significant results. Many large wine companies now boast their own sensory team, optimally consisting of a Ph.D. sensory scientist, a flavor chemist and a trained panel.

== Grape varieties ==
Wine grape varieties are variously evaluated according to a wide range of descriptors which draw comparisons with other, non-grape flavors and aromas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winepros.org/wine101/grape_profiles/varietals.htm Varietal Profiles | Professional Friends of Wine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winestore.com/grape-varieties.php Grape Varieties Explained&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The following table provides a brief and by no means exhaustive summary of typical descriptors for the better-known varietals.
