      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3492">A '''sex strike''', a form of [[nonviolent protest]], was held by [[Kenya]]n female activists in 2009 to end the deteriorating relationship between the country’s [[President of Kenya|President]], [[Mwai Kibaki]], and [[Prime Minister of Kenya|Prime Minister]], [[Raila Odinga]], who agreed to share leadership powers in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/5245040/Kenyan-women-go-on-sex-strike-to-force-politicians-to-talk.html|title=Kenyan women go on sex strike to force politicians to talk|author=Mike Pflanz in Nairobi|date=29 April 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a seven-day [[sex strike]], which involved thousands of women who vowed to withhold sex from their partner. This sex strike was aimed at forcing the leaders to reconcile as they had different views on how Kenya should be run as well as issued conflicting policies that did not focus on urgent issues that mattered in Kenya such as dealing with corruption and poverty.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8025457.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Kenyan women hit men with sex ban |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-04-29 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the strike was to revive Kenya and fix the bickering leadership. The women had a set of demands they wanted to be fulfilled which involved principles such as respect and good faith from the leaders. The strike lasted seven days, after which it ended with a joint prayer session where the conflicting leaders finally agreed to talk.

==Tribal violence==
{{main|2007–08 Kenyan crisis}}
In 2009, Kenya was experiencing an [[2007–08 Kenyan crisis|enormous amount of post-election violence]] once the President and Prime Minister were appointed as leaders. This resulted in communal violence between tribes. Kenya had a [[Kenyan general election, 2007|disputed election]] that led to tribal conflict, which killed more than a thousand people and left more than six hundred thousand people homeless.

==Movement==
The sex strike was enforced by a women's group called Women's Development Organization, a group in Kenya that is a prominent women’s rights group.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The Women's Development Organization group has been around for the longest in Kenya as a form of women’s rights movements. Eleven other women's groups also joined the strike, eventually involving thousands of women. The movement was significant and caused a major challenge because many men in Kenya are [[Polygamy|polygamous]], as it is allowed by law. The sex strike lasted a full week, from May 1, 2009 until May 7. The nonviolent action was the omission of sex by women from men and their husbands.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

The act of resisting sex was enough for the government to reconsider the leadership and how Kenya was being run.

 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversial book by [[Stephen Wolfram]], published by his own company in 2002. It contains an empirical and systematic study of computational systems such as [[cellular automata]]. Wolfram calls these systems ''simple programs'' and argues that the [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] and methods appropriate for the study of simple programs are relevant to other fields of science.

== Contents ==

=== Computation and its implications===
The thesis of ''A New Kind of Science'' (''NKS'') is twofold: that the nature of [[computation]] must be explored experimentally, and that the results of these experiments have great relevance to understanding the [[physical world]]. Since its nascent beginnings in the 1930s, computation has been primarily approached from two traditions: [[engineering]], which seeks to build practical systems using computations; and [[mathematics]], which seeks to prove theorems about computation.  However, as recently as the 1970s, computing has been described as being at the crossroads of mathematical, engineering, and empirical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Peter | last = Wegner | title = Research Paradigms in Computer Science | booktitle = Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering | pages = 322–330 | publisher = IEEE Press | year = 1976 | location = San Francisco, CA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last = Denning | first = Peter J. | title = Computing as a Discipline | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–23 | year = 1989| doi = 10.1145/63238.63239|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram introduces a third tradition that seeks to empirically investigate computation for its own sake: He argues that an entirely new method is needed to do so because traditional mathematics fails to meaningfully describe [[complex systems]], and that there is an upper limit to complexity in all systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/emergence/DBergerNKS.pdf The World According to Wolfram]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple programs===
The basic subject of Wolfram's "new kind of science" is the study of simple abstract rules—essentially, elementary [[computer program]]s. In almost any class of a computational system, one very quickly finds instances of great complexity among its simplest cases (after a time series of multiple iterative loops, applying the same simple set of rules on itself, similar to a self-reinforcing cycle using a set of rules). This seems to be true regardless of the components of the system and the details of its setup. Systems explored in the book include, amongst others, cellular automata in one, two, and three dimensions; [[Mobile automaton|mobile automata]]; [[Turing machine]]s in 1 and 2 dimensions; several varieties of substitution and network systems; primitive recursive functions; nested [[recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]]; [[combinator]]s; [[tag system]]s; [[register machine]]s; [[Palindromic number|reversal-addition]]. For a program to qualify as simple, there are several requirements:
# Its operation can be completely explained by a simple graphical illustration.
# It can be completely explained in a few sentences of [[human language]].
# It can be implemented in a computer language using just a few lines of code.
# The number of its possible variations is small enough so that all of them can be computed.

Generally, simple programs tend to have a very simple abstract framework. Simple cellular automata, Turing machines, and combinators are examples of such frameworks, while more complex cellular automata do not necessarily qualify as simple programs. It is also possible to invent new frameworks, particularly to capture the operation of natural systems. The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things.  This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program's definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs can be seen as a minimal example of [[emergence]]. A logical deduction from this phenomenon is that if the details of the program's rules have little direct relationship to its behavior, then it is very difficult to directly engineer a simple program to perform a specific behavior. An alternative approach is to try to engineer a simple overall computational framework, and then do a [[brute-force search]] through all of the possible components for the best match.

Simple programs are capable of a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be [[universal computer]]s. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] behavior, [[continuum mechanics|continuum]] behavior, conserved quantities, [[percolation]], [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], and others. They have been used as models of [[traffic]], material fracture, [[crystal growth]], biological growth, and various [[sociology|sociological]], [[geology|geological]], and [[ecology|ecological]] phenomena. Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall [[complexity]]. ''A New Kind of Science'' argues that this is evidence that simple programs are enough to capture the essence of almost any [[complex system]].

===Mapping and mining the computational universe===
In order to study simple rules and their often complex behaviour, Wolfram argues that it is necessary to systematically explore all of these computational systems and document what they do. He further argues that this study should become a new branch of science, like [[physics]] or [[chemistry]].  The basic goal of this field is to understand and characterize the computational universe using experimental methods.

The proposed new branch of scientific exploration admits many different forms of scientific production. For instance, qualitative classifications are often the results of initial forays into the computational jungle. On the other hand, explicit proofs that certain systems compute this or that function are also admissible. There are also some forms of production that are in some ways unique to this field of study. For example, the discovery of computational mechanisms that emerge in different systems but in bizarrely different forms.

Another kind of production involves the creation of programs for the analysis of computational systems. In the ''NKS'' framework, these themselves should be simple programs, and subject to the same goals and methodology. An extension of this idea is that the human mind is itself a computational system, and hence providing it with raw data in as effective a way as possible is crucial to research. Wolfram believes that programs and their analysis should be visualized as directly as possible, and exhaustively examined by the thousands or more. Since this new field concerns abstract rules, it can in principle address issues relevant to other fields of science. However, in general Wolfram's idea is that novel ideas and mechanisms can be discovered in the computational universe, where they can be represented in their simplest forms, and then other fields can choose among these discoveries for those they find relevant.

Wolfram has since expressed "A central lesson of ''A New Kind of Science'' is that there’s a lot of incredible richness out there in the computational universe. And one reason that’s important is that it means that there’s a lot of incredible stuff out there for us to 'mine' and harness for our purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/|title=A New Kind of Science: A 15-Year View—Stephen Wolfram|last=|first=|date=|website=blog.stephenwolfram.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic abstract science===
While Wolfram advocates simple programs as a scientific discipline, he also argues that its methodology will revolutionize other fields of science. The basis of his argument is that the study of simple programs is the minimal possible form of science,  grounded equally in both [[abstraction]] and empirical experimentation. Every aspect of the methodology advocated in ''NKS'' is optimized to make experimentation as direct, easy, and meaningful as possible while maximizing the chances that the experiment will do something unexpected. Just as this methodology allows computational mechanisms to be studied in their simplest forms, Wolfram argues that the process of doing so engages with the mathematical basis of the physical world, and therefore has much to offer the sciences.

Wolfram argues that the computational realities of the universe make science hard for fundamental reasons. But he also argues that by understanding the importance of these realities, we can learn to use them in our favor. For instance, instead of [[reverse engineering]] our theories from observation, we can [[enumeration|enumerate]] systems and then try to match them to the behaviors we observe. A major theme of ''NKS''  is investigating the structure of the possibility space. Wolfram argues that science is far too ad hoc, in part because the models used are too complicated and unnecessarily organized around the limited primitives of traditional mathematics. Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.

===Philosophical underpinnings===

====Computational irreducibility====
Wolfram argues that one of his achievements is in providing a coherent system of ideas that justifies computation as an organizing [[Philosophy of science|principle of science]]. For instance, he argues that the concept of ''[[computational irreducibility]]'' (that some complex computations are not amenable to short-cuts and cannot be "reduced"), is ultimately the reason why computational models of nature must be considered in addition to traditional [[mathematical models]]. Likewise, his idea of intrinsic randomness generation—that natural systems can generate their own randomness, rather than using chaos theory or stochastic perturbations—implies that computational models do not need to include explicit randomness.

====Principle of computational equivalence====
Based on his experimental results, Wolfram developed the '''principle of computational equivalence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''PCE'''): the principle states that [[systems]] found in the [[natural environment|natural world]] can perform [[computation]]s up to a [[maximum|maximal]] ("universal") level of [[computational power]]. Most systems can attain this level. Systems, in principle, compute the same things as a computer. Computation is therefore simply a question of translating [[Input/output|input and outputs]] from one system to another. Consequently, most systems are computationally equivalent. Proposed examples of such systems are the workings of the human brain and the evolution of weather systems.

The principle can be restated as follows: almost all processes that are not obviously simple are of equivalent sophistication. From this principle, Wolfram draws an array of concrete deductions which he argues reinforce his theory. Possibly the most important among these is an explanation as to why we experience [[randomness]] and [[complexity]]: often, the systems we analyze are just as sophisticated as we are. Thus, complexity is not a special quality of systems, like for instance the concept of "heat,"  but simply a label for all systems whose computations are sophisticated. Wolfram argues that understanding this makes possible the "normal science" of the ''NKS'' paradigm.

At the deepest level, Wolfram argues that—like many of the most important scientific ideas—the principle of computational equivalence allows science to be more general by pointing out new ways in which humans are not "special"; that is, it has been claimed that the complexity of human intelligence makes us special, but the Principle asserts otherwise. In a sense, many of Wolfram's ideas are based on understanding the scientific process—including the human mind—as operating within the same universe it studies, rather than being outside it.

===Applications and results===
There are a number of specific results and ideas in the ''NKS'' book, and they can be organized into several themes. One common theme of examples and applications is demonstrating how little complexity it takes to achieve interesting behavior, and how the proper methodology can discover this behavior.

First, there are several cases where the ''NKS'' book introduces what was, during the book's composition, the simplest known system in some class that has a particular characteristic. Some examples include the first primitive recursive function that results in complexity, the smallest universal [[Turing Machine]], and the shortest [[axiom]] for [[propositional calculus]]. In a similar vein, Wolfram also demonstrates many simple programs that exhibit phenomena like [[phase transition]]s, [[conserved quantity|conserved quantities]], continuum behavior, and [[thermodynamics]] that are familiar from traditional science. Simple [[computational model]]s of natural systems like [[shell growth]], [[fluid turbulence]], and [[phyllotaxis]] are a final category of applications that fall in this theme.

Another common theme is taking facts about the computational universe as a whole and using them to reason about fields in a [[holistic]] way. For instance, Wolfram discusses how facts about the computational universe inform [[evolutionary theory]], [[SETI]], [[free will]], [[computational complexity theory]], and philosophical fields like [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and even [[postmodernism]].

Wolfram suggests that the theory of computational irreducibility may provide a resolution to the existence of free will in a nominally [[deterministic]] universe.  He posits that the computational process in the [[brain]] of the being with free will is actually [[Complexity|complex]] enough so that it cannot be captured in a simpler computation, due to the principle of computational irreducibility.  Thus, while the process is indeed deterministic, there is no better way to determine the being's will than, in essence, to run the experiment and let the being exercise it.

The book also contains a vast number of individual results—both experimental and analytic—about what a particular automaton computes, or what its characteristics are, using some methods of analysis.

The book contains a new technical result in describing the [[Turing completeness]] of the [[Rule 110]] cellular automaton. Very small Turing machines can simulate Rule 110, which Wolfram demonstrates using a 2-state 5-symbol [[universal Turing machine]]. Wolfram conjectures that a particular [[Wolfram's 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine|2-state 3-symbol Turing machine]] is universal. In 2007, as part of commemorating the book's fifth anniversary, Wolfram's company offered a $25,000 prize for proof that this Turing machine is universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Research Prize | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/ | accessdate=2011-03-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515032324/http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/| archivedate= 15 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alex Smith, a computer science student from [[Birmingham]], UK, won the prize later that year by proving Wolfram's conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Is Universal! | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_news.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Technical Commentary [on Wolfram 2,3 Turing machine universality proof] | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_technical.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NKS Summer School==
Every year, Wolfram and his group of instructors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2009/faculty.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2009: Faculty|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; organize a summer school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/|title=Wolfram Science Summer School|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2006, these classes were held at [[Brown University]]. In 2007, the summer school began being hosted by the [[University of Vermont]] at Burlington, with the exception of 2009 which was held at the Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione of the CNR in [[Pisa, Italy]].  In 2012, the program was held at [[Curry College]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Since 2013, the Wolfram Summer School has been held annually at [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. After 14 consecutive summer schools, more than 550 people have participated, some of whom continued developing their 3-week research projects as their Master's or Ph.D theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2006/participants/letourneau.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2006: Alumni—Paul-Jean Letourneau|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research done in the summer school has resulted in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Rowland | title=A natural prime-generating recurrence | year=2008 | volume=11 | issue=08 | journal=Journal of Integer Sequences| arxiv=0710.3217 | bibcode=2008JIntS..11...28R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m624350kj28305u9/|title=Planar Trivalent Network Computation | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-74593-8_13 | journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=146–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Palasek , S. | title=Information flow in cellular automata | year=2013 | volume=22 | issue=2 | pages=193–202 | journal=Complex Systems | url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/22-2-4.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published on April 3, 2018, ''A New Kind of Science'' was listed among the 190 books recommended by Bill Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolinsky|first=Jacob|title=190 Books Recommended by Bill Gates|url=https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/04/bill-gates-books/|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific philosophy===
A tenet of ''NKS'' is that the simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur in a wide variety of more complicated contexts. Therefore, ''NKS'' argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. ''NKS'' has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.

===Methodology===
A common criticism of ''NKS'' is that it does not follow established [[scientific methodology]]. For instance, ''NKS'' does not establish [[rigorous]] mathematical definitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=David|title=A Reclusive Kind of Science|journal=Computing in Science and Engineering|pages=79–81|date=September 2002|url = http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-wolfram.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; nor does it attempt to prove [[theorem]]s; and most formulas and equations are written in [[Mathematica]] rather than standard notation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Mathematician Looks at Wolfram's New Kind of Science|last=Gray|first=Lawrence|journal=Notices of the AMS|year=2003|volume=50|issue=2|pages=200–211|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200302/fea-gray.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, ''NKS'' has also been criticized for being heavily visual, with much information conveyed by pictures that do not have formal meaning.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; It has also been criticized for not using modern research in the field of [[complexity]], particularly the works that have studied complexity from a rigorous mathematical perspective.&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt; And it has been criticized for misrepresenting [[chaos theory]]: "Throughout the book, he equates chaos theory with the phenomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC)."&lt;ref name=Drysdale&gt;{{cite web|last=Drysdale|first=David|title=Review of "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.lurklurk.org/wolfram/review.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
''NKS'' has been criticized for not providing specific results that would be immediately applicable to ongoing scientific research.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; There has also been criticism, implicit and explicit, that the study of simple programs has little connection to the physical universe, and hence is of limited value. [[Steven Weinberg]] has pointed out that no real world system has been explained using Wolfram's methods in a satisfactory fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/In+search+of+a+scientific+revolution%3A+controversial+genius+Stephen...-a0107699603 | work=Science News | title=In search of a scientific revolution: controversial genius Stephen Wolfram presses onward | first=Peter | last=Weiss | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PCE===
The '''Principle of computational equivalence''' has been criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;!-- However, Wolfram's group has described the principle as such, not a law, theorem or formula. [They described it as being vague, unmathematical, and not able to make directly verifiable predictions?] --&gt; It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Moreover, critics such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they might run are also equivalent.&lt;ref name=Kurzweil/&gt; Others suggest it is little more than a rechristening of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt;&lt;!--  However, the Church-Turing thesis imposes an upper limit while Wolfram's PCE suggests the nonexistence of intermediate degrees of computation sending a computational system either to the upper level (universal) or to the lowest degree. [No. The claim is that intermediate degrees are derived from the complete degree, hence equivalent in "sophistication".] --&gt;

===The fundamental theory (''NKS'' Chapter 9)===
Wolfram's speculations of a direction towards a fundamental theory of physics have been criticized as vague and obsolete. [[Scott Aaronson]], Professor of Computer Science at University of Texas Austin, also claims that Wolfram's methods cannot be compatible with both [[special relativity]] and [[Bell's theorem]] violations, and hence cannot explain the observed results of [[Bell test experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|title=Book Review of ''A New Kind of Science''|journal=Quantum Information and Computation|volume=2|issue=5|year=2002|pages=410–423|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/nks.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aaronson's arguments are either right and apply to the entire scientific field of [[Quantum gravity]] that seeks to find theories unifying relativity and quantum mechanics or they are fundamentally flawed (e.g. under a non-local hidden variable theory of superdeterminism acknowledged by Bell himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = J. S. | year = 1981 | title = Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality | url = | journal = Journal de Physique | volume = 42 | issue = C2| pages = 41–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and even explored by e.g. physics Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]],&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|author='t Hooft, G.|title=Discreteness and Determinism in Superstrings |date=15 Sep 2012|eprint=1207.3612}}&lt;/ref&gt; see also replies to [[Digital physics#Locality|criticism of digital physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Wheeler]], 1990, "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links" in W. Zurek (ed.) ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. Redwood City, CA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201031 Matrix models as non-local hidden variables theories]", 2002; also published in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26669-0_10 Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics? The Frontiers Collection], [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 2005, pp 121-152, {{ISBN|978-3-540-22188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|date=April 2017}}

[[Edward Fredkin]] and [[Konrad Zuse]] pioneered the idea of a [[Cellular automaton#CA as models of the fundamental physical reality|computable universe]], the former by writing a line in his book on how the world might be like a cellular automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/ANKOS_zuse_fredkin_thesis.html|title=ZUSE-FREDKIN-THESIS|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that ''NKS'' tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe is a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-9.7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] has also charged that his work on [[Turing machine]]-computable [[physics]] was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.&lt;ref name=Schmid&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jurgen|title=Origin of main ideas in Wolfram's book "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/wolfram.html|publisher=CERN Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 review of ''NKS'', the Nobel laureate and elementary particle physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] wrote, "Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and I suppose he can't resist trying to apply his experience with digital computer programs to the laws of nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that this is the sort of system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|title=Is the Universe a Computer?|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=24 October 2002|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]] has more recently also suggested a cellular automaton-based unifying theory of quantum gravity as an interpretation of superstring theory where the evolution equations are classical, "[b]oth the bosonic string theory and superstring theory can be reformulated in terms of a special basis of states, defined on a [[space-time]] [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] with lattice length &lt;math&gt;2\pi\sqrt{\alpha'.}&lt;/math&gt;"&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"/&gt;

===Natural selection===
Wolfram's claim that [[natural selection]] is not the fundamental cause of complexity in biology has led non-scientist journalist Chris Lavers to state that Wolfram does not understand the [[theory of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavers|first=Chris|title=How the cheetah got his spots|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 August 2002|url= https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4473834,00.html|accessdate=28 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Originality===
''NKS'' has been heavily criticized as not being original or important enough to justify its title and claims.

The authoritative manner in which ''NKS'' presents a vast number of examples and arguments has been criticized as leading the reader to believe that each of these ideas was original to Wolfram;&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt; in particular, one of the most substantial new technical results presented in the book, that the [[Rule 110|rule 110 cellular automaton]] is [[Turing complete]], was not proven by Wolfram, but by his research assistant, [[Matthew Cook]]. However, the notes section at the end of his book acknowledges many of the discoveries made by these other scientists citing their names together with historical facts, although not in the form of a traditional bibliography section. Additionally, the idea that very simple rules often generate great complexity is already an established idea in science, particularly in [[chaos theory]] and [[complex systems]].&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt;

[[Image:Euclid flowchart.svg|thumb|right| [[Flowchart]] of an algorithm ([[Euclid's algorithm]]) for calculating the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of two numbers ''a'' and ''b'' in locations named A and B. The algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B ≥ A yields "yes" (or true) (more accurately the ''number'' ''b'' in location B is greater than or equal to the ''number'' ''a'' in location A) THEN, the algorithm specifies B ← B − A (meaning the number ''b'' − ''a'' replaces the old ''b''). Similarly, IF A &gt; B, THEN A ← A − B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the g.c.d. in A. (Algorithm derived from Scott 2009:13; symbols and drawing style from Tausworthe 1977).]]

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], an '''algorithm''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-algorithm.ogg|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|ə|r|ɪ|ð|əm}}) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform [[calculation]], [[data processing]] and [[automated reasoning]] tasks.

As an [[effective method]], an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time&lt;ref&gt;"Any classical mathematical algorithm, for example, can be described in a finite number of English words" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; and in a well-defined formal language&lt;ref&gt;Well defined with respect to the agent that executes the algorithm: "There is a computing agent, usually human, which can react to the instructions and carry out the computations" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; for calculating a [[Function (mathematics)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;"an algorithm is a procedure for computing a ''function'' (with respect to some chosen notation for integers) ... this limitation (to numerical functions) results in no loss of generality", (Rogers 1987:1).&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps [[Empty string|empty]]),&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has [[zero]] or more inputs, i.e., [[quantity|quantities]] which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; the instructions describe a [[computation]] that, when [[Execution (computing)|executed]], proceeds through a finite&lt;ref&gt;"A procedure which has all the characteristics of an algorithm except that it possibly lacks finiteness may be called a 'computational method'" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has one or more outputs, i.e. quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily [[deterministic]]; some algorithms, known as [[randomized algorithms]], incorporate random input.&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not a process with random interior processes (not including the input) is an algorithm is debatable. Rogers opines that: "a computation is carried out in a discrete stepwise fashion, without use of continuous methods or analogue devices . . . carried forward deterministically, without resort to random methods or devices, e.g., dice" Rogers 1987:2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of algorithm has existed for centuries. Greek mathematicians used algorithms in, for example, the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]] for finding prime numbers and the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.&lt;ref name=Cooke2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooke |first=Roger L. |title=The History of Mathematics: A Brief Course |date=2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118460290}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word ''algorithm'' itself derives from the 9th century mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]], Latinized ''Algoritmi''. A partial formalization of what would become the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to solve the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] (decision problem) posed by [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define "[[effective calculability]]"&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:274&lt;/ref&gt; or "effective method".&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:225&lt;/ref&gt; Those formalizations included the [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]–[[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]]–[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]] of 1930, 1934 and 1935, [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[lambda calculus]] of 1936, [[Emil Post]]'s [[Formulation 1]] of 1936, and [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Turing machines]] of 1936–37 and 1939.

About 825, al-Khwarizmi wrote an [[Arabic language]] treatise on the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]], which was translated into [[Latin]] during the 12th century under the title ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum''. This title means "Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians", where "Algoritmi" was the translator's [[Latinisation of names|Latinization]] of Al-Khwarizmi's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Brezina| first = Corona| title = Al-Khwarizmi: The Inventor Of Algebra| url = https://books.google.com/?id=955jPgAACAAJ| year = 2006| publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group| isbn = 978-1-4042-0513-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through another of his books, the [[Al-Jabr|Algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Boyer_Foremost_Text.html Foremost mathematical texts in history], according to [[Carl B. Boyer]].&lt;/ref&gt; In late medieval Latin, ''algorismus'', English '[[algorism]]', the corruption of his name, simply meant the "decimal number system". In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός 'number' (''cf.'' 'arithmetic'), the Latin word was altered to ''algorithmus'', and the corresponding English term 'algorithm' is first attested in the 17th century; the modern sense was introduced in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Third Edition, 2012 [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/4959 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, it was first used in about 1230 and then by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] in 1391. English adopted the French term, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that "algorithm" took on the meaning that it has in modern English.

Another early use of the word is from 1240, in a manual titled ''Carmen de Algorismo'' composed by [[Alexander of Villedieu|Alexandre de Villedieu]]. It begins thus:

{{quote|''Haec algorismus ars praesens dicitur, in qua / Talibus Indorum fruimur bis quinque figuris.''}}
which translates as:
{{quote|Algorism is the art by which at present we use those Indian figures, which number two times five.}}

The poem is a few hundred lines long and summarizes the art of calculating with the new style of Indian dice, or Talibus Indorum, or Hindu numerals.

==Informal definition==
{{about||a detailed presentation of the various points of view on the definition of "algorithm"| Algorithm characterizations}}
An informal definition could be "a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations."&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1973:4&lt;/ref&gt; which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations. Generally, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually.&lt;ref&gt;Stone simply requires that "it must terminate in a finite number of steps" (Stone 1973:7–8).&lt;/ref&gt;

A prototypical example of an algorithm is the [[Euclidean algorithm]] to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the [[flowchart]] above and as an example in a later section.

{{Harvtxt|Boolos|Jeffrey|1974, 1999|ref=CITEREFBoolosJeffrey1999}} offer an informal meaning of the word in the following quotation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough† ( †"smaller and smaller without limit ...you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give ''explicit instructions for determining the '''n'''th member of the set'', for arbitrary finite ''n''. Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which ''they could be followed by a computing machine'', or by a ''human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.''&lt;ref&gt;Boolos and Jeffrey 1974,1999:19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An "enumerably infinite set" is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that "creates" output integers from an ''arbitrary'' "input" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily large. Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as ''y = m + n'' – two arbitrary "input variables" ''m'' and ''n'' that produce an output ''y''. But various authors' attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this, something on the order of (for the addition example):
:Precise instructions (in language understood by "the computer")&lt;ref&gt;cf Stone 1972:5&lt;/ref&gt; for a fast, efficient, "good"&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:7 states: "In practice we not only want algorithms, we want ''good'' algorithms ... one criterion of goodness is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm ... other criteria are the adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity, and elegance, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; process that specifies the "moves" of "the computer" (machine or human, equipped with the necessary internally contained information and capabilities)&lt;ref&gt;cf Stone 1973:6&lt;/ref&gt; to find, decode, and then process arbitrary input integers/symbols ''m'' and ''n'', symbols ''+'' and ''='' ... and "effectively"&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1973:7–8 states that there must be, "...a procedure that a robot [i.e., computer] can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction." Stone adds finiteness of the process, and definiteness (having no ambiguity in the instructions) to this definition.&lt;/ref&gt; produce, in a "reasonable" time,&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, loc. cit&lt;/ref&gt; output-integer ''y'' at a specified place and in a specified format.

The concept of ''algorithm'' is also used to define the notion of [[decidability (logic)|decidability]]. That notion is central for explaining how [[formal system]]s come into being starting from a small set of [[axiom]]s and rules. In [[logic]], the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related to our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of ''algorithm'' that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.

==Formalization==
&lt;!-- [[Computer program]] links here. --&gt;
Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data. Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a [[Turing reduction|Turing-complete]] system. Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):
&lt;blockquote&gt; Minsky: "But we will also maintain, with Turing . . . that any procedure which could "naturally" be called effective, can, in fact, be realized by a (simple) machine. Although this may seem extreme, the arguments . . . in its favor are hard to refute".&lt;ref name="Minsky 1967:105"&gt;{{harvnb|Minsky|1967|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;Gurevich: "...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine ... according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine".&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich 2000:1, 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data can be read from an input source, written to an output device and stored for further processing. Stored data are regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more [[data structure]]s.

For some such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).

Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting "from the top" and going "down to the bottom", an idea that is described more formally by ''[[control flow|flow of control]]''.

So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of [[imperative programming]]. This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, "mechanical" means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the [[assignment operation]], setting the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of "[[memory]]" as a scratchpad. There is an example below of such an assignment.

For some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see [[functional programming]] and [[logic programming]].

===Expressing algorithms===
Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including [[natural language]]s, [[pseudocode]], [[flowchart]]s, [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]], [[programming language]]s or [[control table]]s (processed by [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreters]]). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]] and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.

There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given [[Turing machine]] program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at [[finite-state machine]], [[state transition table]] and [[control table]]), as flowcharts and [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]] (see more at [[state diagram]]), or as a form of rudimentary [[machine code]] or [[assembly code]] called "sets of quadruples" (see more at [[Turing machine]]).

Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description:&lt;ref&gt;Sipser 2006:157&lt;/ref&gt;
; 1 High-level description
: "...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level, we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head."
; 2 Implementation description
: "...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level, we do not give details of states or transition function."
; 3 Formal description
: Most detailed, "lowest level", gives the Turing machine's "state table".

For an example of the simple algorithm "Add m+n" described in all three levels, see [[Algorithm#Examples]].

==Design==

{{See also|Algorithm#By design paradigm}}

Algorithm design refers to a method or mathematical process for problem-solving and engineering algorithms. The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories of [[operation research]], such as [[dynamic programming]] and [[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer]]. Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://ww3.algorithmdesign.net/ch00-front.html|title=Algorithm Design: Foundations, Analysis, and Internet Examples|last1=Goodrich|first1=Michael T.|author1-link=Michael T. Goodrich|last2=Tamassia|first2=Roberto|author2-link=Roberto Tamassia|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=0-471-38365-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the template method pattern and decorator pattern.

One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is creating an algorithm that has an efficient run-time, also known as its [[Big O notation|Big O]].

Typical steps in the development of algorithms:
# Problem definition
# Development of a model
# Specification of the algorithm
# Designing an algorithm
# Checking the correctness of the algorithm
# Analysis of algorithm
# Implementation of algorithm
# Program testing
# Documentation preparation

==Implementation==
[[Image:TTL npn nand.svg|right|thumb|[[Logical NAND]] algorithm implemented electronically in [[7400 series|7400]] chip]]
Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as [[computer programs]]. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a [[biological neural network]] (for example, the [[human brain]] implementing [[arithmetic]] or an insect looking for food), in an [[electrical circuit]], or in a mechanical device.

==Computer algorithms==
[[File:Euclid's algorithm structured blocks 1.png|thumb|right|176px|Flowchart examples of the canonical [[Structured program theorem|Böhm-Jacopini structures]]: the SEQUENCE (rectangles descending the page), the WHILE-DO and the IF-THEN-ELSE. The three structures are made of the primitive conditional GOTO (&lt;tt&gt;IF ''test''=true THEN GOTO step xxx&lt;/tt&gt;) (a diamond), the unconditional GOTO (rectangle), various assignment operators (rectangle), and HALT (rectangle). Nesting of these structures inside assignment-blocks result in complex diagrams (cf Tausworthe 1977:100,114).]]

In [[computer systems]], an algorithm is basically an instance of [[logic]] written in software by software developers, to be effective for the intended "target" computer(s) to produce ''output'' from given (perhaps null) ''input''. An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher [[time complexity]]) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.

''"Elegant" (compact) programs, "good" (fast) programs '': The notion of "simplicity and elegance" appears informally in [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]] and precisely in [[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]]:
:Knuth: ". . .we want ''good'' algorithms in some loosely defined aesthetic sense. One criterion . . . is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm . . .. Other criteria are adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc"&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:7&lt;/ref&gt;

:Chaitin: " . . . a program is 'elegant,' by which I mean that it's the smallest possible program for producing the output that it does"&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin 2005:32&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaitin prefaces his definition with: "I'll show you can't prove that a program is 'elegant'"—such proof would solve the [[Halting problem]] (ibid).

''Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm'': For a given function multiple algorithms may exist. This is true, even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer. Rogers observes that "It is . . . important to distinguish between the notion of ''algorithm'', i.e. procedure and the notion of ''function computable by algorithm'', i.e. mapping yielded by the procedure. The same function may have several different algorithms".&lt;ref&gt;Rogers 1987:1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness)—an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant. An example that uses Euclid's algorithm appears below.

''Computers (and computors), models of computation'': A computer (or human "computor"&lt;ref&gt;In his essay "Calculations by Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis" Seig 2002:390 credits this distinction to Robin Gandy, cf Wilfred Seig, et al., 2002 ''Reflections on the foundations of mathematics: Essays in honor of Solomon Feferman'', Association for Symbolic Logic, A. K Peters Ltd, Natick, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a restricted type of machine, a "discrete deterministic mechanical device"&lt;ref&gt;cf Gandy 1980:126, Robin Gandy ''Church's Thesis and Principles for Mechanisms'' appearing on pp. 123–148 in [[Jon Barwise|J. Barwise]] et al. 1980 ''The Kleene Symposium'', North-Holland Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; that blindly follows its instructions.&lt;ref&gt;A "robot": "A computer is a robot that performs any task that can be described as a sequence of instructions." cf Stone 1972:3&lt;/ref&gt; Melzak's and Lambek's primitive models&lt;ref&gt;Lambek's "abacus" is a "countably infinite number of locations (holes, wires etc.) together with an unlimited supply of counters (pebbles, beads, etc). The locations are distinguishable, the counters are not". The holes have unlimited capacity, and standing by is an agent who understands and is able to carry out the list of instructions" (Lambek 1961:295). Lambek references Melzak who defines his Q-machine as "an indefinitely large number of locations . . . an indefinitely large supply of counters distributed among these locations, a program, and an operator whose sole purpose is to carry out the program" (Melzak 1961:283). B-B-J (loc. cit.) add the stipulation that the holes are "capable of holding any number of stones" (p. 46). Both Melzak and Lambek appear in ''The Canadian Mathematical Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3, September 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced this notion to four elements: (i) discrete, distinguishable ''locations'', (ii) discrete, indistinguishable ''counters''&lt;ref&gt;If no confusion results, the word "counters" can be dropped, and a location can be said to contain a single "number".&lt;/ref&gt; (iii) an agent, and (iv) a list of instructions that are ''effective'' relative to the capability of the agent.&lt;ref&gt;"We say that an instruction is ''effective'' if there is a procedure that the robot can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction." (Stone 1972:6)&lt;/ref&gt;

Minsky describes a more congenial variation of Lambek's "abacus" model in his "Very Simple Bases for [[Computability]]".&lt;ref&gt;cf Minsky 1967: Chapter 11 "Computer models" and Chapter 14 "Very Simple Bases for Computability" pp. 255–281 in particular&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minsky machine|Minsky's machine]] proceeds sequentially through its five (or six, depending on how one counts) instructions, unless either a conditional IF–THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence. Besides HALT, Minsky's machine includes three ''assignment'' (replacement, substitution)&lt;ref&gt;cf Knuth 1973:3.&lt;/ref&gt; operations: ZERO (e.g. the contents of location replaced by 0: L ← 0), SUCCESSOR (e.g. L ← L+1), and DECREMENT (e.g. L ← L − 1).&lt;ref&gt;But always preceded by IF–THEN to avoid improper subtraction.&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely must a programmer write "code" with such a limited instruction set. But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine is [[Turing complete]] with only four general ''types'' of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT.&lt;ref&gt;However, a few different assignment instructions (e.g. DECREMENT, INCREMENT, and ZERO/CLEAR/EMPTY for a Minsky machine) are also required for Turing-completeness; their exact specification is somewhat up to the designer. The unconditional GOTO is a convenience; it can be constructed by initializing a dedicated location to zero e.g. the instruction " Z ← 0 "; thereafter the instruction IF Z=0 THEN GOTO xxx is unconditional.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Simulation of an algorithm: computer (computor) language'': Knuth advises the reader that "the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it . . . immediately take pen and paper and work through an example".&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:4&lt;/ref&gt; But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing? The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can ''effectively'' execute. Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root. If they don't, then the algorithm, to be effective, must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root.&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1972:5. Methods for extracting roots are not trivial: see [[Methods of computing square roots]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that the programmer must know a "language" that is effective relative to the target computing agent (computer/computor).

But what model should be used for the simulation? Van Emde Boas observes "even if we base [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] on abstract instead of concrete machines, arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains. It is at this point that the notion of ''simulation'' enters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Leeuwen| first = Jan| title = Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science: Algorithms and complexity. Volume A| url = https://books.google.com/?id=-X39_rA3VSQC| year = 1990| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-444-88071-0 | page = 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; When speed is being measured, the instruction set matters. For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a "[[modular arithmetic|modulus]]" instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's "decrement").

''Structured programming, canonical structures'': Per the [[Church–Turing thesis]], any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be [[Turing complete]], and per Minsky's demonstrations, Turing completeness requires only four instruction types—conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while "undisciplined" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in "[[spaghetti code]]", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; on the other hand "it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language".&lt;ref&gt;[[John G. Kemeny]] and [[Thomas E. Kurtz]] 1985 ''Back to Basic: The History, Corruption, and Future of the Language'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc. Reading, MA, {{ISBN|0-201-13433-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tausworthe augments the three [[Structured program theorem|Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures]]:&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1977:101&lt;/ref&gt; SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE.&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1977:142&lt;/ref&gt; An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to [[proof of correctness|proofs of correctness]] using [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973 section 1.2.1, expanded by Tausworthe 1977 at pages 100ff and Chapter 9.1&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canonical flowchart symbols&lt;ref&gt;cf Tausworthe 1977&lt;/ref&gt;'': The graphical aide called a [[flowchart]], offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program of one). Like the program flow of a Minsky machine, a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down. Its primary symbols are only four: the directed arrow showing program flow, the rectangle (SEQUENCE, GOTO), the diamond (IF-THEN-ELSE), and the dot (OR-tie). The Böhm–Jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes. Sub-structures can "nest" in rectangles, but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure. The symbols, and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram.

===Algorithm example===
[[File:Sorting quicksort anim.gif|thumb|right|An animation of the [[quicksort|quicksort algorithm]] sorting an array of randomized values. The red bars mark the pivot element; at the start of the animation, the element farthest to the right-hand side is chosen as the pivot.]]

One of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order. Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description of English prose, as:

''High-level description:''
# If there are no numbers in the set then there is no highest number.
# Assume the first number in the set is the largest number in the set.
# For each remaining number in the set: if this number is larger than the current largest number, consider this number to be the largest number in the set.
# When there are no numbers left in the set to iterate over, consider the current largest number to be the largest number of the set.

''(Quasi-)formal description:''
Written in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in [[pseudocode]] or [[pidgin code]]:

{{algorithm-begin|name=LargestNumber}}
   Input: A list of numbers ''L''.
   Output: The largest number in the list ''L''.

   '''if''' ''L.size'' = 0 '''return''' null
   ''largest'' ← ''L''[0]
   '''for each''' ''item'' '''in''' ''L'', '''do'''
     '''if''' ''item'' &gt; ''largest'', '''then'''
       ''largest'' ← ''item''
   '''return''' ''largest''
{{algorithm-end}}

===Euclid's algorithm===
{{further|Euclid's algorithm}}
[[File:Euclid's algorithm Book VII Proposition 2 2.png|250px|thumb|left|The example-diagram of Euclid's algorithm from T.L. Heath (1908), with more detail added. Euclid does not go beyond a third measuring and gives no numerical examples. Nicomachus gives the example of 49 and 21: "I subtract the less from the greater; 28 is left; then again I subtract from this the same 21 (for this is possible); 7 is left; I subtract this from 21, 14 is left; from which I again subtract 7 (for this is possible); 7 is left, but 7 cannot be subtracted from 7." Heath comments that "The last phrase is curious, but the meaning of it is obvious enough, as also the meaning of the phrase about ending 'at one and the same number'."(Heath 1908:300).]]

[[Euclid]]'s algorithm to compute the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD) to two numbers appears as Proposition II in Book VII ("Elementary Number Theory") of his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heath 1908:300; Hawking's Dover 2005 edition derives from Heath.&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid poses the problem thus: "Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure". He defines "A number [to be] a multitude composed of units": a counting number, a positive integer not including zero. To "measure" is to place a shorter measuring length ''s'' successively (''q'' times) along longer length ''l'' until the remaining portion ''r'' is less than the shorter length ''s''.&lt;ref&gt;" 'Let CD, measuring BF, leave FA less than itself.' This is a neat abbreviation for saying, measure along BA successive lengths equal to CD until a point F is reached such that the length FA remaining is less than CD; in other words, let BF be the largest exact multiple of CD contained in BA" (Heath 1908:297)&lt;/ref&gt; In modern words, remainder ''r'' = ''l'' − ''q''×''s'', ''q'' being the quotient, or remainder ''r'' is the "modulus", the integer-fractional part left over after the division.&lt;ref&gt;For modern treatments using division in the algorithm, see Hardy and Wright 1979:180, Knuth 1973:2 (Volume 1), plus more discussion of Euclid's algorithm in Knuth 1969:293–297 (Volume 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Euclid's method to succeed, the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements: (i) the lengths must not be zero, AND (ii) the subtraction must be “proper”; i.e., a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger (alternately, the two can be equal so their subtraction yields zero).

Euclid's original proof adds a third requirement: the two lengths must not be prime to one another. Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a [[reductio ad absurdum]] proof that the two numbers' common measure is in fact the ''greatest''.&lt;ref&gt;Euclid covers this question in his Proposition 1.&lt;/ref&gt; While Nicomachus' algorithm is the same as Euclid's, when the numbers are prime to one another, it yields the number "1" for their common measure. So, to be precise, the following is really Nicomachus' algorithm.

[[File:Euclids-algorithm-example-1599-650.gif|350px|thumb|right|A graphical expression of Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor for 1599 and 650.
&lt;source lang="text" highlight="1,5"&gt;
 1599 = 650×2 + 299
 650 = 299×2 + 52
 299 = 52×5 + 39
 52 = 39×1 + 13
 39 = 13×3 + 0&lt;/source&gt;]]

====Computer language for Euclid's algorithm====
Only a few instruction ''types'' are required to execute Euclid's algorithm—some logical tests (conditional GOTO), unconditional GOTO, assignment (replacement), and subtraction.
* A ''location'' is symbolized by upper case letter(s), e.g. S, A, etc.
* The varying quantity (number) in a location is written in lower case letter(s) and (usually) associated with the location's name. For example, location L at the start might contain the number ''l'' = 3009.

====An inelegant program for Euclid's algorithm====
[[File:Euclid's algorithm Inelegant program 1.png|thumb|163px|right|"Inelegant" is a translation of Knuth's version of the algorithm with a subtraction-based remainder-loop replacing his use of division (or a "modulus" instruction). Derived from Knuth 1973:2–4. Depending on the two numbers "Inelegant" may compute the g.c.d. in fewer steps than "Elegant".]]

The following algorithm is framed as Knuth's four-step version of Euclid's and Nicomachus', but, rather than using division to find the remainder, it uses successive subtractions of the shorter length ''s'' from the remaining length ''r'' until ''r'' is less than ''s''. The high-level description, shown in boldface, is adapted from Knuth 1973:2–4:

'''INPUT''':
 {{vanchor|1|el1}} [Into two locations L and S put the numbers ''l'' and ''s'' that represent the two lengths]:
   INPUT L, S
 {{vanchor|2|el2}} [Initialize R: make the remaining length ''r'' equal to the starting/initial/input length ''l'']:
   R ← L

'''E0: [Ensure ''r'' ≥ ''s''.]'''
 {{vanchor|3|el3}} [Ensure the smaller of the two numbers is in S and the larger in R]:
   IF R &gt; S THEN
     the contents of L is the larger number so skip over the exchange-steps [[#4|4]], [[#5|5]] and [[#6|6]]:
     GOTO step [[#6|6]]
   ELSE
     swap the contents of R and S.
 {{vanchor|4|el4}}   L ← R (this first step is redundant, but is useful for later discussion).
 {{vanchor|5|el5}}   R ← S
 {{vanchor|6|el6}}   S ← L

'''E1: [Find remainder]''': Until the remaining length ''r'' in R is less than the shorter length ''s'' in S, repeatedly subtract the measuring number ''s'' in S from the remaining length ''r'' in R.
 {{vanchor|7|el7}} IF S &gt; R THEN
     done measuring so
     GOTO [[#10|10]]
   ELSE
     measure again,
 {{vanchor|8|el8}}   R ← R − S
 {{vanchor|9|el9}}   [Remainder-loop]:
     GOTO [[#7|7]].

'''E2: [Is the remainder zero?]''': EITHER (i) the last measure was exact, the remainder in R is zero, and the program can halt, OR (ii) the algorithm must continue: the last measure left a remainder in R less than measuring number in S.
 {{vanchor|10|el10}} IF R = 0 THEN
      done so
      GOTO [[#15|step 15]]
    ELSE
      CONTINUE TO [[#11|step 11]],

'''E3: [Interchange ''s'' and ''r'']''': The nut of Euclid's algorithm. Use remainder ''r'' to measure what was previously smaller number ''s''; L serves as a temporary location.
 {{vanchor|11|el11}}  L ← R
 {{vanchor|12|el12}}  R ← S
 {{vanchor|13|el13}}  S ← L
 {{vanchor|14|el14}}  [Repeat the measuring process]:
     GOTO [[#7|7]]

'''OUTPUT''':

 {{vanchor|15|el15}} [Done. S contains the [[greatest common divisor]]]:
    PRINT S

'''DONE''':
 {{vanchor|16|el16}} HALT, END, STOP.

====An elegant program for Euclid's algorithm====
The following version of Euclid's algorithm requires only six core instructions to do what thirteen are required to do by "Inelegant"; worse, "Inelegant" requires more ''types'' of instructions. The flowchart of "Elegant" can be found at the top of this article. In the (unstructured) Basic language, the steps are numbered, and the instruction &lt;source lang="cbmbas" inline&gt;LET [] = []&lt;/source&gt; is the assignment instruction symbolized by ←.
&lt;source lang="cbmbas"&gt;
  5 REM Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor
  6 PRINT "Type two integers greater than 0"
  10 INPUT A,B
  20 IF B=0 THEN GOTO 80
  30 IF A &gt; B THEN GOTO 60
  40 LET B=B-A
  50 GOTO 20
  60 LET A=A-B
  70 GOTO 20
  80 PRINT A
  90 END
&lt;/source&gt;
The following version can be used with Object Oriented languages:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
// Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor
integer euclidAlgorithm (int A, int B){
     A=Math.abs(A);
     B=Math.abs(B);
     while (B!=0){
          if (A&gt;B) A=A-B;
          else B=B-A;
     }
     return A;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
''How "Elegant" works'': In place of an outer "Euclid loop", "Elegant" shifts back and forth between two "co-loops", an A &gt; B loop that computes A ← A − B, and a B ≤ A loop that computes B ← B − A. This works because, when at last the minuend M is less than or equal to the subtrahend S ( Difference = Minuend − Subtrahend), the minuend can become ''s'' (the new measuring length) and the subtrahend can become the new ''r'' (the length to be measured); in other words the "sense" of the subtraction reverses.

===Testing the Euclid algorithms===
Does an algorithm do what its author wants it to do? A few test cases usually suffice to confirm core functionality. One source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVII/propVII2.html |title=Euclid's Elements, Book VII, Proposition 2 |publisher=Aleph0.clarku.edu |date= |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses 3009 and 884. Knuth suggested 40902, 24140. Another interesting case is the two [[relatively prime]] numbers 14157 and 5950.

But exceptional cases must be identified and tested. Will "Inelegant" perform properly when R &gt; S, S &gt; R, R = S? Ditto for "Elegant": B &gt; A, A &gt; B, A = B? (Yes to all). What happens when one number is zero, both numbers are zero? ("Inelegant" computes forever in all cases; "Elegant" computes forever when A = 0.) What happens if ''negative'' numbers are entered? Fractional numbers? If the input numbers, i.e. the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the function computed by the algorithm/program, is to include only positive integers including zero, then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm (and the program that [[instance (computer science)|instantiates]] it) is a [[partial function]] rather than a [[total function]]. A notable failure due to exceptions is the [[Ariane 5 Flight 501]] rocket failure (June 4, 1996).

''Proof of program correctness by use of mathematical induction'': Knuth demonstrates the application of [[mathematical induction]] to an "extended" version of Euclid's algorithm, and he proposes "a general method applicable to proving the validity of any algorithm".&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:13–18. He credits "the formulation of algorithm-proving in terms of assertions and induction" to R. W. Floyd, Peter Naur, C. A. R. Hoare, H. H. Goldstine and J. von Neumann. Tausworth 1977 borrows Knuth's Euclid example and extends Knuth's method in section 9.1 ''Formal Proofs'' (pages 288–298).&lt;/ref&gt; Tausworthe proposes that a measure of the complexity of a program be the length of its correctness proof.&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1997:294&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring and improving the Euclid algorithms===
''Elegance (compactness) versus goodness (speed)'': With only six core instructions, "Elegant" is the clear winner, compared to "Inelegant" at thirteen instructions. However, "Inelegant" is ''faster'' (it arrives at HALT in fewer steps). [[Algorithm analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;cf Knuth 1973:7 (Vol. I), and his more-detailed analyses on pp. 1969:294–313 (Vol II).&lt;/ref&gt; indicates why this is the case: "Elegant" does ''two'' conditional tests in every subtraction loop, whereas "Inelegant" only does one. As the algorithm (usually) requires many loop-throughs, ''on average'' much time is wasted doing a "B = 0?" test that is needed only after the remainder is computed.

''Can the algorithms be improved?'': Once the programmer judges a program "fit" and "effective"—that is, it computes the function intended by its author—then the question becomes, can it be improved?

The compactness of "Inelegant" can be improved by the elimination of five steps. But Chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a generalized algorithm;&lt;ref&gt;Breakdown occurs when an algorithm tries to compact itself. Success would solve the [[Halting problem]].&lt;/ref&gt; rather, it can only be done [[heuristic]]ally; i.e., by exhaustive search (examples to be found at [[Busy beaver]]), trial and error, cleverness, insight, application of [[inductive reasoning]], etc. Observe that steps 4, 5 and 6 are repeated in steps 11, 12 and 13. Comparison with "Elegant" provides a hint that these steps, together with steps 2 and 3, can be eliminated. This reduces the number of core instructions from thirteen to eight, which makes it "more elegant" than "Elegant", at nine steps.

The speed of "Elegant" can be improved by moving the "B=0?" test outside of the two subtraction loops. This change calls for the addition of three instructions (B = 0?, A = 0?, GOTO). Now "Elegant" computes the example-numbers faster; whether this is always the case for any given A, B, and R, S would require a detailed analysis.

==Algorithmic analysis==
{{Main|Analysis of algorithms}}
It is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the [[analysis of algorithms]] to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(''n''), using the [[big O notation]] with ''n'' as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of ''O(1)'', if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(''n'') if it is counted.

Different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or '[[algorithmic efficiency|effort]]' than others. For example, a [[binary search]] algorithm (with cost O(log n) ) outperforms a sequential search (cost O(n) ) when used for [[lookup table|table lookups]] on sorted lists or arrays.

===Formal versus empirical===
{{Main|Empirical algorithmics|Profiling (computer programming)|Program optimization}}
The [[analysis of algorithms|analysis, and study of algorithms]] is a discipline of [[computer science]], and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific [[programming language]] or implementation. In this sense, algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation. Usually [[pseudocode]] is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation. However, ultimately, most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware/software platforms and their [[algorithmic efficiency]] is eventually put to the test using real code. For the solution of a "one off" problem, the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences (unless n is extremely large) but for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical. Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign.

Empirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance. [[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmarks]] may be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization.
Empirical tests cannot replace formal analysis, though, and are not trivial to perform in a fair manner.&lt;ref name="KriegelSchubert2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kriegel|first1=Hans-Peter|authorlink=Hans-Peter Kriegel|last2=Schubert|first2=Erich|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|authorlink3=Arthur Zimek|title=The (black) art of run-time evaluation: Are we comparing algorithms or implementations?|journal=Knowledge and Information Systems|volume=52|issue=2|year=2016|pages=341–378|issn=0219-1377|doi=10.1007/s10115-016-1004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Execution efficiency ===
{{Main|Algorithmic efficiency}}
To illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well-established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Better Math Makes Faster Data Networks| author=Gillian Conahan| date=January 2013| url=http://discovermagazine.com/2013/jan-feb/34-better-math-makes-faster-data-networks#.URAnVieX98F| publisher=discovermagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem, which are very common in practical applications.&lt;ref name="Hassanieh12"&gt;Haitham Hassanieh, [[Piotr Indyk]], Dina Katabi, and Eric Price, "[http://siam.omnibooksonline.com/2012SODA/data/papers/500.pdf ACM-SIAM Symposium On Discrete Algorithms (SODA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704180806/http://siam.omnibooksonline.com/2012SODA/data/papers/500.pdf |date=July 4, 2013 }}, Kyoto, January 2012. See also the [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/ sFFT Web Page].&lt;/ref&gt; Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing (like digital cameras and medical equipment) to consume less power.

== Classification ==
There are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.

=== By implementation ===
One way to classify algorithms is by implementation means.

; Recursion
: A [[recursive algorithm]] is one that invokes (makes reference to) itself repeatedly until a certain condition (also known as termination condition) matches, which is a method common to [[functional programming]]. [[Iteration|Iterative]] algorithms use repetitive constructs like [[Program loops|loops]] and sometimes additional data structures like [[Stack (data structure)|stacks]] to solve the given problems. Some problems are naturally suited for one implementation or the other. For example, [[towers of Hanoi]] is well understood using recursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa.
; Logical
: An algorithm may be viewed as controlled [[Deductive reasoning|logical deduction]]. This notion may be expressed as: ''Algorithm = logic + control''.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The logic component expresses the axioms that may be used in the computation and the control component determines the way in which deduction is applied to the axioms. This is the basis for the [[logic programming]] paradigm. In pure logic programming languages, the control component is fixed and algorithms are specified by supplying only the logic component. The appeal of this approach is the elegant [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]]: a change in the axioms produces a well-defined change in the algorithm.
; Serial, parallel or distributed
: Algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time. Those computers are sometimes called serial computers. An [[algorithm design]]ed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed to [[parallel algorithm]]s or [[distributed algorithms]]. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time, whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with a [[computer network]]. Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together. The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable. Some problems have no parallel algorithms and are called inherently serial problems.
; Deterministic or non-deterministic
: [[Deterministic algorithm]]s solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm whereas [[non-deterministic algorithm]]s solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through the use of [[heuristics]].
; Exact or approximate
: While many algorithms reach an exact solution, [[approximation algorithm]]s seek an approximation that is closer to the true solution. The approximation can be reached by either using a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems. One of the examples of an approximate algorithm is the [[Knapsack problem]]. The Knapsack problem is a problem where there is a set of given items. The goal of the problem is to pack the knapsack to get the maximum total value. Each item has some weight and some value. Total weight that we can carry is no more than some fixed number X. So, we must consider weights of items as well as their value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540402862|title=Knapsack Problems {{!}} Hans Kellerer {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Quantum algorithm]]
: They run on a realistic model of [[quantum computation]]. The term is usually used for those algorithms which seem inherently quantum, or use some essential feature of [[Quantum computing]] such as [[quantum superposition]] or [[quantum entanglement]].

=== By design paradigm ===
Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories includes many different types of algorithms. Some common paradigms are:

; [[Brute force search|Brute-force]] or exhaustive search
: This is the naive method of trying every possible solution to see which is best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Carroll| first1 = Sue| last2 = Daughtrey| first2 = Taz| title = Fundamental Concepts for the Software Quality Engineer| url = https://books.google.com/?id=bz_cl3B05IcC&amp;pg=PA282| date = July 4, 2007| publisher = American Society for Quality| isbn = 978-0-87389-720-4| pages = 282 et seq. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Divide and conquer
: A [[divide and conquer algorithm]] repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem (usually [[recursion|recursively]]) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of divide and conquer is [[mergesort|merge sorting]]. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments. A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called a ''decrease and conquer algorithm'', that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem. Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so the conquer stage is more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of the decrease and conquer algorithm is the [[binary search algorithm]].
; Search and enumeration
: Many problems (such as playing [[chess]]) can be modeled as problems on [[graph theory|graphs]]. A [[graph exploration algorithm]] specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems. This category also includes [[search algorithm]]s, [[branch and bound]] enumeration and [[backtracking]].
;[[Randomized algorithm]]
: Such algorithms make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly). They can be very useful in finding approximate solutions for problems where finding exact solutions can be impractical (see heuristic method below). For some of these problems, it is known that the fastest approximations must involve some [[randomness]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the [[volume]] of a [[convex polytope]] (described using a membership oracle) can be approximated to high accuracy by a randomized polynomial time algorithm, but not by a deterministic one: see {{citation

# [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]s return a correct answer with high-probability. E.g. [[RP (complexity)|RP]] is the subclass of these that run in [[polynomial time]].
# [[Las Vegas algorithm]]s always return the correct answer, but their running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g. [[Zero-error Probabilistic Polynomial time|ZPP]].
; [[Reduction (complexity)|Reduction of complexity]]
: This technique involves solving a difficult problem by transforming it into a better-known problem for which we have (hopefully) [[asymptotically optimal]] algorithms. The goal is to find a reducing algorithm whose [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one [[selection algorithm]] for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion). This technique is also known as ''[[Transform and conquer algorithm|transform and conquer]]''.
; [[Back tracking]]
: In this approach, multiple solutions are built incrementally and abandoned when it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid full solution.

=== Optimization problems ===

For [[optimization problem]]s there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:

; [[Linear programming]]
: When searching for optimal solutions to a linear function bound to linear equality and inequality constraints, the constraints of the problem can be used directly in producing the optimal solutions. There are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category, such as the popular [[simplex algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[George B. Dantzig]] and Mukund N. Thapa. 2003. ''Linear Programming 2: Theory and Extensions''. Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the [[maximum flow problem]] for directed graphs. If a problem additionally requires that one or more of the unknowns must be an [[integer]] then it is classified in [[integer programming]]. A linear programming algorithm can solve such a problem if it can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial, i.e., the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway. In the general case, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used, depending on the difficulty of the problem.
; [[Dynamic programming]]
: When a problem shows [[optimal substructure]]s – meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems – and [[overlapping subproblems]], meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called ''dynamic programming'' avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example, [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]], the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and [[memoization]] go together. The main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is that subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming. The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems. By using memoization or maintaining a [[Mathematical table|table]] of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.
; The greedy method
: A [[greedy algorithm]] is similar to a dynamic programming algorithm in that it works by examining substructures, in this case not of the problem but of a given solution. Such algorithms start with some solution, which may be given or have been constructed in some way, and improve it by making small modifications. For some problems they can find the optimal solution while for others they stop at [[local optimum|local optima]], that is, at solutions that cannot be improved by the algorithm but are not optimum. The most popular use of greedy algorithms is for finding the minimal spanning tree where finding the optimal solution is possible with this method. [[Huffman coding|Huffman Tree]], [[kruskal's algorithm|Kruskal]], [[Prim's algorithm|Prim]], [[Sollin's algorithm|Sollin]] are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem.
;The heuristic method
:In [[optimization problem]]s, [[heuristic algorithm]]s can be used to find a solution close to the optimal solution in cases where finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms work by getting closer and closer to the optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they will find the optimal solution. Their merit is that they can find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. Such algorithms include [[local search (optimization)|local search]], [[tabu search]], [[simulated annealing]], and [[genetic algorithm]]s. Some of them, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an [[approximation algorithm]].

=== By field of study ===
{{See also|List of algorithms}}
Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are [[search algorithm]]s, [[sorting algorithm]]s, [[merge algorithm]]s, [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithms]], [[graph theory|graph algorithms]], [[string algorithms]], [[computational geometry|computational geometric algorithms]], [[combinatorial|combinatorial algorithms]], [[medical algorithm]]s, [[machine learning]], [[cryptography]], [[data compression]] algorithms and [[parsing|parsing techniques]].

Fields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.

=== By complexity ===
{{See also|Complexity class| Parameterized complexity}}
Algorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size:

* Constant time: if the time needed by the algorithm is the same, regardless of the input size. E.g. an access to an [[Array data structure|array]] element.
* Linear time: if the time is proportional to the input size. E.g. the traverse of a list.
* Logarithmic time: if the time is a logarithmic function of the input size. E.g. [[binary search algorithm]].
* Polynomial time: if the time is a power of the input size. E.g. the [[bubble sort]] algorithm has quadratic time complexity.
* Exponential time: if the time is an exponential function of the input size. E.g. [[Brute-force search]].

Some problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. Owing to this, it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them.

== Continuous algorithms ==
The adjective "continuous" when applied to the word "algorithm" can mean:
* An algorithm operating on data that represents continuous quantities, even though this data is represented by discrete approximations—such algorithms are studied in [[numerical analysis]]; or
* An algorithm in the form of a [[differential equation]] that operates continuously on the data, running on an [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Tsypkin| title = Adaptation and learning in automatic systems| url = https://books.google.com/?id=sgDHJlafMskC&amp;pg=PA54| year = 1971| publisher = Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-08-095582-7| page = 54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==
{{see also|Software patent}}

Algorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute "processes" (USPTO 2006), and hence algorithms are not patentable (as in [[Gottschalk v. Benson]]). However practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in [[Diamond v. Diehr]], the application of a simple [[feedback]] algorithm to aid in the curing of [[synthetic rubber]] was deemed patentable. The [[Software patent debate|patenting of software]] is highly controversial, and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms, especially [[data compression]] algorithms, such as [[Unisys]]' [[Graphics Interchange Format#Unisys and LZW patent enforcement|LZW patent]].

Additionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see [[export of cryptography]]).

== History: Development of the notion of "algorithm" ==

=== Ancient Near East ===
Algorithms were used in ancient Greece. Two examples are the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]], which was described in [[Introduction to Arithmetic]] by [[Nicomachus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.wichita.edu/history/men/eratosthenes.html|title=Eratosthenes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooke2005/&gt;{{rp|Ch 9.2}} and the [[Euclidean algorithm]], which was first described in [[Euclid's Elements]] (c. 300 BC).&lt;ref name=Cooke2005/&gt;{{rp|Ch 9.1}} [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian clay tablets]] describe and employ algorithmic procedures to compute the time and place of significant astronomical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Aaboe | first = Asger | author-link = Asger Aaboe | date = 2001 | title = Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy | publisher = Springer | place = New York | pages = 40–62 | isbn = 0-387-95136-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discrete and distinguishable symbols ===
'''Tally-marks''': To keep track of their flocks, their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying: accumulating stones or marks scratched on sticks or making discrete symbols in clay. Through the Babylonian and Egyptian use of marks and symbols, eventually [[Roman numerals]] and the [[abacus]] evolved (Dilson, p.&amp;nbsp;16–41). Tally marks appear prominently in [[unary numeral system]] arithmetic used in [[Turing machine]] and [[Post–Turing machine]] computations.

=== Manipulation of symbols as "place holders" for numbers: algebra ===
The work of the ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek geometers]] ([[Euclidean algorithm]]), the [[List of Indian mathematicians|Indian mathematician]] [[Brahmagupta]], and the [[List of Iranian mathematicians|Persian mathematician]] [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwarizmi]] (from whose name the terms "[[algorism]]" and "algorithm" are derived), and Western European mathematicians culminated in [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s notion of the [[calculus ratiocinator]] (ca 1680):
{{quote|A good century and a half ahead of his time, Leibniz proposed an algebra of logic, an algebra that would specify the rules for manipulating logical concepts in the manner that ordinary algebra specifies the rules for manipulating numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Mechanical contrivances with discrete states ===
''The clock'': Bolter credits the invention of the weight-driven [[clock]] as "The key invention [of Europe in the Middle Ages]", in particular, the [[verge escapement]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:24&lt;/ref&gt; that provides us with the tick and tock of a mechanical clock. "The accurate automatic machine"&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:26&lt;/ref&gt; led immediately to "mechanical [[automata theory|automata]]" beginning in the 13th century and finally to "computational machines"—the [[difference engine]] and [[analytical engine]]s of [[Charles Babbage]] and Countess [[Ada Lovelace]], mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:33–34, 204–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelace is credited with the first creation of an algorithm intended for processing on a computer – Babbage's analytical engine, the first device considered a real [[Turing-complete]] computer instead of just a [[calculator]] – and is sometimes called "history's first programmer" as a result, though a full implementation of Babbage's second device would not be realized until decades after her lifetime.

''Logical machines 1870—[[Stanley Jevons]]' "logical abacus" and "logical machine"'': The technical problem was to reduce [[Boolean equation]]s when presented in a form similar to what is now known as [[Karnaugh map]]s. Jevons (1880) describes first a simple "abacus" of "slips of wood furnished with pins, contrived so that any part or class of the [logical] combinations can be picked out mechanically . . . More recently, however, I have reduced the system to a completely mechanical form, and have thus embodied the whole of the indirect process of inference in what may be called a ''Logical Machine''" His machine came equipped with "certain moveable wooden rods" and "at the foot are 21 keys like those of a piano [etc] . . .". With this machine he could analyze a "[[syllogism]] or any other simple logical argument".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from W. Stanley Jevons 1880 ''Elementary Lessons in Logic: Deductive and Inductive'', Macmillan and Co., London and New York. Republished as a googlebook; cf Jevons 1880:199–201. Louis Couturat 1914 ''the Algebra of Logic'', The Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago and London. Republished as a googlebook; cf Couturat 1914:75–76 gives a few more details; he compares this to a typewriter as well as a piano. Jevons states that the account is to be found at January 20, 1870 ''The Proceedings of the Royal Society''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This machine he displayed in 1870 before the Fellows of the Royal Society.&lt;ref&gt;Jevons 1880:199–200&lt;/ref&gt; Another logician [[John Venn]], however, in his 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'', turned a jaundiced eye to this effort: "I have no high estimate myself of the interest or importance of what are sometimes called logical machines ... it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known or likely to be discovered really deserve the name of logical machines"; see more at [[Algorithm characterizations]]. But not to be outdone he too presented "a plan somewhat analogous, I apprehend, to Prof. Jevon's ''abacus'' ... [And] [a]gain, corresponding to Prof. Jevons's logical machine, the following contrivance may be described. I prefer to call it merely a logical-diagram machine ... but I suppose that it could do very completely all that can be rationally expected of any logical machine".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from John Venn 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'', Macmillan and Co., London. Republished as a googlebook. cf Venn 1881:120–125. The interested reader can find a deeper explanation in those pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jacquard loom, Hollerith punch cards, telegraphy and telephony—the electromechanical relay'': Bell and Newell (1971) indicate that the [[Jacquard loom]] (1801), precursor to [[Hollerith cards]] (punch cards, 1887), and "telephone switching technologies" were the roots of a tree leading to the development of the first computers.&lt;ref&gt;Bell and Newell diagram 1971:39, cf. Davis 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century the [[telegraph]], the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, it's discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as "dots and dashes" a common sound. By the late 19th century the [[ticker tape]] (ca 1870s) was in use, as was the use of Hollerith cards in the 1890 U.S. census. Then came the [[teleprinter]] (ca. 1910) with its punched-paper use of [[Baudot code]] on tape.

''Telephone-switching networks'' of electromechanical [[relay]]s (invented 1835) was behind the work of [[George Stibitz]] (1937), the inventor of the digital adding device. As he worked in Bell Laboratories, he observed the "burdensome' use of mechanical calculators with gears. "He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea... When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device".&lt;ref&gt;* Melina Hill, Valley News Correspondent, ''A Tinkerer Gets a Place in History'', Valley News West Lebanon NH, Thursday, March 31, 1983, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis (2000) observes the particular importance of the electromechanical relay (with its two "binary states" ''open'' and ''closed''):
: It was only with the development, beginning in the 1930s, of electromechanical calculators using electrical relays, that machines were built having the scope Babbage had envisioned."&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics during the 19th century up to the mid-20th century ===
''Symbols and rules'': In rapid succession, the mathematics of [[George Boole]] (1847, 1854), [[Gottlob Frege]] (1879), and [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1888–1889) reduced arithmetic to a sequence of symbols manipulated by rules. Peano's ''The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method'' (1888) was "the first attempt at an axiomatization of mathematics in a symbolic language".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:81ff&lt;/ref&gt;

But Heijenoort gives Frege (1879) this kudos: Frege's is "perhaps the most important single work ever written in logic. ... in which we see a " 'formula language', that is a ''lingua characterica'', a language written with special symbols, "for pure thought", that is, free from rhetorical embellishments ... constructed from specific symbols that are manipulated according to definite rules".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary on Frege's ''Begriffsschrift, a formula language, modeled upon that of arithmetic, for pure thought'' in van Heijenoort 1967:1&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Frege was further simplified and amplified by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] in their [[Principia Mathematica]] (1910–1913).

''The paradoxes'': At the same time a number of disturbing paradoxes appeared in the literature, in particular, the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] (1897), the [[Russell paradox]] (1902–03), and the [[Richard Paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1906, cf. Kleene 1952:36–40&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant considerations led to [[Kurt Gödel]]'s paper (1931)—he specifically cites the paradox of the liar—that completely reduces rules of [[recursion]] to numbers.

''Effective calculability'': In an effort to solve the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] defined precisely by Hilbert in 1928, mathematicians first set about to define what was meant by an "effective method" or "effective calculation" or "effective calculability" (i.e., a calculation that would succeed). In rapid succession the following appeared: [[Alonzo Church]], [[Stephen Kleene]] and [[J. B. Rosser]]'s [[λ-calculus]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. footnote in Alonzo Church 1936a in Davis 1965:90 and 1936b in Davis 1965:110&lt;/ref&gt; a finely honed definition of "general recursion" from the work of Gödel acting on suggestions of [[Jacques Herbrand]] (cf. Gödel's Princeton lectures of 1934) and subsequent simplifications by Kleene.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1935–6 in Davis 1965:237ff, Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:255ff&lt;/ref&gt; Church's proof&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in Davis 1965:88ff&lt;/ref&gt; that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable, [[Emil Post]]'s definition of effective calculability as a worker mindlessly following a list of instructions to move left or right through a sequence of rooms and while there either mark or erase a paper or observe the paper and make a yes-no decision about the next instruction.&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Finite Combinatory Processes&amp;mdash;formulation 1", Post 1936 in Davis 1965:289–290&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Turing's proof of that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable by use of his "a- [automatic-] machine"&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:116ff&lt;/ref&gt;—in effect almost identical to Post's "formulation", [[J. Barkley Rosser]]'s definition of "effective method" in terms of "a machine".&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:226&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. C. Kleene]]'s proposal of a precursor to "[[Church thesis]]" that he called "Thesis I",&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:273–274&lt;/ref&gt; and a few years later Kleene's renaming his Thesis "Church's Thesis"&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:300, 317&lt;/ref&gt; and proposing "Turing's Thesis".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:376&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emil Post (1936) and Alan Turing (1936–37, 1939) ===
Here is a remarkable coincidence{{According to whom|date=March 2017}} of two men not knowing each other but describing a process of men-as-computers working on computations—and they yield virtually identical definitions.

[[Emil Post]] (1936) described the actions of a "computer" (human being) as follows:
:"...two concepts are involved: that of a ''symbol space'' in which the work leading from problem to answer is to be carried out, and a fixed unalterable ''set of directions''.

His symbol space would be
:"a two-way infinite sequence of spaces or boxes... The problem solver or worker is to move and work in this symbol space, being capable of being in, and operating in but one box at a time.... a box is to admit of but two possible conditions, i.e., being empty or unmarked, and having a single mark in it, say a vertical stroke.

:"One box is to be singled out and called the starting point. ...a specific problem is to be given in symbolic form by a finite number of boxes [i.e., INPUT] being marked with a stroke. Likewise, the answer [i.e., OUTPUT] is to be given in symbolic form by such a configuration of marked boxes...

:"A set of directions applicable to a general problem sets up a deterministic process when applied to each specific problem. This process terminates only when it comes to the direction of type (C ) [i.e., STOP]".&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:289–290&lt;/ref&gt; See more at [[Post–Turing machine]]
[[File:Alan Turing.jpg|thumb|200px|Alan Turing's statue at [[Bletchley Park]]]]
[[Alan Turing]]'s work&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936 in Davis 1965, Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160&lt;/ref&gt; preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing. Turing's biographer believed that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: "Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter, and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'".&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, p.&amp;nbsp;96&lt;/ref&gt; Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and teletypewriters we{{Who|date=March 2017}} might conjecture that all were influences.

Turing—his model of computation is now called a [[Turing machine]]—begins, as did Post, with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and "states of mind". But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7:116&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book...I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e., on a tape divided into squares. I shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may be printed is finite...

:"The behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his "state of mind" at that moment. We may suppose that there is a bound B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe at one moment. If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive observations. We will also suppose that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is finite...

:"Let us imagine that the operations performed by the computer to be split up into 'simple operations' which are so elementary that it is not easy to imagine them further divided."&lt;ref name="Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136"&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's reduction yields the following:
:"The simple operations must therefore include:
::"(a) Changes of the symbol on one of the observed squares
::"(b) Changes of one of the squares observed to another square within L squares of one of the previously observed squares.
"It may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind. The most general single operation must, therefore, be taken to be one of the following:
::"(A) A possible change (a) of symbol together with a possible change of state of mind.
::"(B) A possible change (b) of observed squares, together with a possible change of state of mind"

:"We may now construct a machine to do the work of this computer."&lt;ref name="Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136"/&gt;

A few years later, Turing expanded his analysis (thesis, definition) with this forceful expression of it:
:"A function is said to be "effectively calculable" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Though it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematical expressible definition . . . [he discusses the history of the definition pretty much as presented above with respect to Gödel, Herbrand, Kleene, Church, Turing, and Post] . . . We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability † with effective calculability . . . .
::"† We shall use the expression "computable function" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let "effectively calculable" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions".&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160&lt;/ref&gt;

=== J. B. Rosser (1939) and S. C. Kleene (1943) ===
[[J. Barkley Rosser]] defined an 'effective [mathematical] method' in the following manner (italicization added):
:"'Effective method' is used here in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely determined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date. [his footnote #5; see discussion immediately below]. The simplest of these to state (due to Post and Turing) says essentially that ''an effective method of solving certain sets of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer''. All three definitions are equivalent, so it doesn't matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one." (Rosser 1939:225–6)

Rosser's footnote No. 5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of λ-definability, in particular Church's use of it in his ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936); (2) Herbrand and Gödel and their use of recursion in particular Gödel's use in his famous paper ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I'' (1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936–37) in their mechanism-models of computation.

[[Stephen C. Kleene]] defined as his now-famous "Thesis I" known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. But he did this in the following context (boldface in original):
:"12. ''Algorithmic theories''... In setting up a complete algorithmic theory, what we do is to describe a procedure, performable for each set of values of the independent variables, which procedure necessarily terminates and in such manner that from the outcome we can read a definite answer, "yes" or "no," to the question, "is the predicate value true?"" (Kleene 1943:273)

=== History after 1950 ===
A number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of "algorithm", and activity is on-going because of issues surrounding, in particular, [[foundations of mathematics]] (especially the [[Church–Turing thesis]]) and [[philosophy of mind]] (especially arguments about [[artificial intelligence]]).

== Career ==
Rorty received her B.A. from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1951, M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from [[Yale University]] in 1954 and 1961 respectively, and an M.A. from [[Princeton University]] in [[anthropology]] (where she has projected getting a second Ph.D.).&lt;ref name="Blogspot homepage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Homepage|url=http://amelierorty.blogspot.com/|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www.bu.edu/philo/files/2011/01/RortyCV.pdf|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her academic career at [[Wheaton College (Massachusetts)|Wheaton College]] (Mass.) (1957–1961), then began teaching at Rutgers ([[Douglass College]]) in 1962 and taught there through to 1988, by which time she had achieved the rank of distinguished professor.&lt;ref name="Blogspot homepage" /&gt; She was also professor in the history of ideas (and director of the program) at [[Brandeis University]] from 1995–2003, and from 2008–2013 was visiting professor at [[Boston University]]. {{as of|2013}} , she will be a visiting professor at [[Tufts University]].&lt;ref name="Leiter Tufts"&gt;{{cite web |last=Leiter |first=Brian |title=Amelie Rorty to be Visiting Professor at Tufts for 2013-15 |url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/04/amelie-rorty-to-be-visiting-professor-at-tufts-for-2013-15.html|work=Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a lecturer in the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, [[Harvard School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="Blogspot homepage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BU Page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty Page|url=http://www.bu.edu/philo/people/faculty/visiting-professors/amelie-oksenberg-rorty/|work=Boston University|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvard medical news"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rorty publishes on ambivalence, education, and other topics|url=http://ghsm.hms.harvard.edu/news/articles/rorty_publishes_on_ambivalence_education_and_other_topics/|accessdate=28 July 2013|newspaper=Department of Global Health and Public Medicine|date=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rorty is the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships over the course of her career: Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Studies (1968-1969), King's College, Cambridge (1971-1973), Institute for Advanced Study (1980-1981), John Simon Guggenheim (1990-1991), Woodrow Wilson Center (1994-1995), and the National Humanities Center (2007-2008).&lt;ref name="Blogspot homepage" /&gt;

===Work===
Rorty has primarily worked on problems in moral psychology and moral education. She is especially interested in the many distinctive –-and often conflicting—functions of morality as a social practice, as it sets prohibitions, projects ideals, defines duties, characterizes virtues. Exploring the dark side of some of the virtues—courage as bravado, integrity as moral narcissism, the ambivalence of love--, she has also analyzed the advantages of resistance to the obligations of morality: the benefits of self-deception, the lures of moral weakness, the wisdom of ambivalence, the hidden rationale of allegedly irrational emotions. She approaches many of these issues historically (through Aristotle, Spinoza, Hume and Freud) and anthropologically (projecting a study of exiles, immigrants, refugees. who perforce absorb a new set of ‘moral’ values.) She is presently finishing a book provisionally entitled ''On the Other Hand: The Ethics of Ambivalence''.

Rorty is the author of over 120 scholarly articles and the author or editor of more than a dozen scholarly books of original essays. A monograph, ''Mind in Action: Essays in Philosophy of Mind'', was published by Beacon Press in 1988 (paperback edition 1991). She also edited and contributed to ''Explaining Emotions'' (U. California Press, 1980), ''Essays on Aristotle’s Ethics'' (1980, U.California Press), and co-edited ''Essays on Aristotle’s De Anima'' (Oxford, 1992) with Martha Nussbaum. She initiated and served as general editor of ''Modern Studies in Philosophy'' (Doubleday-Anchor) and of ''Major Thinkers'' (University of California Press). Other notable books she edited include ''The Many Faces of Evil'' (Routledge, 2001), ''The Identities of Persons'' (1976, U. California Press) and ''The Many Faces of Philosophy'' (Oxford, 2000).

==Personal life==

[[File:Anahata Mandala.svg|thumb|Anahata chakra with peaked circle around a six-pointed star]]
{{Tantric chakras}}
'''Anahata''' ({{lang-sa|अनाहत}}, [[IAST]]: {{IAST|Anāhata}}, {{lang-en|"unstruck"}}) or '''heart chakra''' is the fourth primary [[chakra]], according to [[Hindu]] [[Yoga|Yogic]], [[Shakta]] and [[Vajrayana|Buddhist Tantric]] traditions. In [[Sanskrit]], ''anahata'' means "unhurt, unstruck, and unbeaten". ''Anahata Nad'' refers to the Vedic concept of ''unstruck sound'' (the sound of the celestial realm). Anahata is associated with balance, calmness, and serenity.

== Etymology ==
In Sanskrit Anahata means "sound produced without touching two parts" and at the same time it means "pure" or "clean, stainless". The name of this chakra signifies the state of freshness that appears when we are able to become detached and to look at the different and apparently contradictory experiences of life with a state of openness (expansion). Normally we are used that an effect is produced by the confrontation of the two opposite forces. At the level of Anahata chakra appears the possibility to integrate the two opposite forces and in this way to obtain the effect (sound, in this case), without the two forces to be confronted (without touching of the two parts). This energy is specific to cooperation and integration, which brings peace and a new perspective in a world which, up to this level (considering only the energies specific to the first three centres of force: Muladhara, Swasdhistana and Manipura) was made only of a more or less conscious confrontation between opposite forces. The name Anahata suggests, in fact, the synergic effect of the interaction of energies at this level.

== Description ==
=== Location ===
The heart chakra is located in the central channel of the spine near the heart, with its [[kshetram]] &lt;ref&gt;Swami Satyananda Saraswati. ''Kundalini Tantra''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appearance ===
Anahata is represented by a lotus flower with twelve petals. Inside there is a smoky region at the intersection of two triangles, creating a [[shatkona]]. The shatkona is a symbol used in Hindu [[Yantra]], representing the union of male and female. Specifically, it is meant to represent [[Purusha]] (the Supreme Being) and [[Prakriti]] (Mother Nature) and is often represented by [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]]. The deity of this area is [[Vayu]], who is smoke-like and four-armed, holding a kusha and riding an antelope (this chakra's animal).

=== Seed mantra ===
The [[Bīja|seed syllable]] is the dark-grey [[mantra]] "yam". In the [[Anusvara|bindu]] (or dot) above the syllable is the deity [[Ishvara|Isha]]. Isha is bright white or blue in color. He has either one or five faces, with three eyes on each face. He may have two, four or ten arms. He is clad in a tiger skin, holds a [[trident]] and drum, grants blessings, and dispels fear. His [[shakti]] is [[Kakini]], who is shining yellow or rose-coloured. She has a number of variations: one, three or six faces; two or four arms; and holds a variety of implements (occasionally a sword, shield, skull or trident). She is seated on a red lotus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tantra-Kundalini.com - Anahata chakra|url = http://www.tantra-kundalini.com/anahata.htm|website = Tantra Kundalini|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petals ===
The twelve red petals are inscribed with the syllables ''kam'', ''kham'', ''gam'', ''gham'', ''ngam'', ''cham'', ''chham'', ''jam'', ''jham'', ''nyam'', ''tam'' and ''tham'' in Sanskrit. They match the [[vritti]]s of [[lust]], fraud, indecision, [[repentance]], [[hope]], [[anxiety]], [[Desire (emotion)|longing]], [[impartiality]], arrogance, incompetence, discrimination and defiance.

== Function ==
Anahata is considered to be the seat of the [[Jivatman]] and [[Parashakti]]. In the [[Upanishads]], this is described as a tiny flame inside the heart. Anahata is named as such because sages were believed to hear the sound (Anahata –  comes without the striking of two objects together).&lt;ref&gt;Woodroffe, J. ''The Serpent Power'' – Dover Publications, New York, 1974 p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with air, touch and the actions of the hands.

Anahata is associated with the ability to make decisions outside the realm of karma. In [[Manipura]] and below, man is bound by the laws of karma and fate. In Anahata one makes decisions ("follows one's heart") based on one's higher self, not the unfulfilled emotions and desires of lower nature. As such, it is known as the heart chakra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart Chakra|url=http://asismassage.com/massage-education/heart-chakra/|publisher=ASIS Massage|accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also associated with love and compassion, charity to others and psychic healing. Meditation on this chakra is said to bring about the following [[siddhi]]s (abilities): he becomes a lord of speech, he is dear to women, his presence controls the senses of others, and he can leave and enter the body at will.

[[File:hrit.jpg|thumb|alt=Tree inside two circles inside a lotus flower|The Hrit chakra (just below Anahata) is the seat of the wish-fulfilling tree.]]
Immediately below Anahata (at the solar plexus or, sometimes, on the near left side of the body) is a minor chakra known as Hrit (or Hridaya, "heart"), with eight petals. It has three regions: a vermilion sun region, within which is a white moon region, within which is a deep-red fire region. Within this is the red wish-fulfilling tree, [[kalpa taru]], which symbolises the ability to manifest what one wishes to happen in the world.

Hrit chakra is sometimes known as the Surya (sun) chakra,&lt;ref&gt;R. Venugopalam. ''The Hidden Mysteries of Kundalini''&lt;/ref&gt; which is located slightly to the left below the heart. Its role is to absorb energy from the sun and provide heat to the body and the other chakras (to [[Manipura]] in particular, to which it provides ''[[Agni (Ayurveda)|Agni]]' (fire).

== Associations with the body ==
Anahata is said to be near the heart. Because of its connection to ''touch'' (sense) and ''actions'', it is associated with the skin and hands. In the [[endocrine system]], Anahata is said to be associated with the [[thymus]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010 &lt;!--http://healthy-ojas.com/systems/chakra-anahata.html--&gt;|reason = Citation was needed, it was provided with a relevant article that describes the correlation between the Anahata and the thymus.}}

== Practices ==
In [[Kundalini yoga]], anahata is awakened and balanced by [[asana]]s, [[pranayama]]s and the practice of [[ajapa japa]] ([[japa]], without the mental effort normally needed to repeat the mantra) and purified by ''bhakti'' (devotion).

== Comparisons with other systems ==
=== Tibetan Buddhism ===
The heart wheel in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is the location of the indestructible red-and-white drop. At death, the winds of the body dissolve and enter this drop, which then leads the body into [[Bardo]] (the intermediate stage) and rebirth. The heart wheel in this model is circular, white and has eight petals (or channels) reaching downwards. These channels divide into three wheels (mind, speech and body) and go to 24 places in the body. They again divide into three and then into 1,000, producing 72,000 channels (known as [[Nadi (yoga)|Nadi]]) throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. ''Tantric Grounds and Paths''&lt;/ref&gt;

The heart wheel is important in meditation; in the [[lower tantras]], the [[mantra]] is recited from the heart. It is recited verbally and then mentally; then, in the heart, a tiny moon disc and flame are imagined from which the mantra rings. In the higher tantras (the [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]] of the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] schools) or the [[Inner Tantras]] of the [[Nyingma]] school, the practitioner attempts to dissolve the winds and drops into the central channel at the level of the heart to experience the [[Yoga of Clear Light]]; this is a practice of the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]]. In Tibetan Buddhism there is a chakra, the Fire Wheel, above the heart and below the throat.

=== Sufism ===
Sufis have a system of [[Lataif-e-sitta]] at a number of points on the body; at the heart, there are three positioned horizontally. On the left side of the chest is the [[Qalb]] (the heart); the Ruh is on the right side of the chest, and the [[Lataif-e-sitta|Sirr]] (innermost heart) is between them.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Bakr Siraj ad Din Cook. ''The Subtle Centres of the Heart''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qalb is called the ''heart of the mystic''; it is caught between the downward pull of the lower [[nafs]], and the upward pull of the spirit of Allah and may be blackened by sin. It may be purified by reciting the names of God. The Ruh is the centre of the spirit, the breath of Allah; when awakened, it counteracts the negative pull of the nafs. The Sirr is the innermost heart, where Allah manifests his mystery to himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = [4] Anahata Chakra|url = http://www.gemsofyogadubai.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=110&amp;showall=1|website = www.gemsofyogadubai.com|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Qigong ===
In [[Qigong]], the middle [[Dantian]] (one of the three furnaces that transform energy in the body) is in this region. The middle Dantian transforms [[qi]] energy into [[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]] (spiritual energy). {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} This is also not a correct location of a Dantian. The Dantian is located on the Anterior of the body, not the posterior, as is this chakra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23792">'''Anomalous experiences''', such as so-called benign [[hallucination]]s, may occur in a person in a state of good mental and physical health, even in the apparent absence of a transient trigger factor such as [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] or [[sensory deprivation]].

The evidence for this statement has been accumulating for more than a century.  Studies of benign hallucinatory experiences go back to 1886 and the early work of the [[Society for Psychical Research]],&lt;ref&gt;Gurney, E., Myers, F.W.H. and Podmore, F. (1886). ''Phantasms of the Living'', Vols. I and II. London: Trubner and Co..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick, Eleanor; Johnson, Alice; and others (1894). Report on the Census  of Hallucinations,  London: ''Proceedings of the Society  for Psychical Research'', Vol. X.
&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested approximately 10% of the population had experienced at least one hallucinatory episode in the course of their life.  More recent studies have validated these findings; the precise incidence found varies with the nature of the episode and the criteria of "hallucination" adopted, but the basic finding is now well-supported.&lt;ref&gt;See Slade, P.D. and Bentall, R.P. (1988). ''Sensory Deception: a scientific analysis of hallucination''. London: Croom Helm, for a review.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

Of particular interest, for reasons to be discussed below, are those anomalous experiences which are characterised by extreme perceptual realism.

===Apparitional experiences===

A common type of anomalous experience is the [[apparitional experience]], which may be defined as one in which a subject seems to perceive some person or thing that is not physically present.  Self-selected samples tend to report a predominance of human figures, but apparitions of animals,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Green, C., and McCreery, C. (1975). ''Apparitions''. London: Hamish Hamilton, pp. 192-196.&lt;/ref&gt; and even objects&lt;ref&gt;''Apparitions'', pp. 197-199.&lt;/ref&gt; are also reported. Notably, the majority of the human figures reported in such samples are not recognised by the subject, and of those who are, not all are of deceased persons; apparitions of living persons have also been reported.&lt;ref&gt;''Apparitions'', pp. 178-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Out-of-body experiences===

[[Out-of-body experiences]] (OBEs) have become to some extent conflated in the public mind with the concept of the [[near-death experience]].  However, the evidence suggests that the majority of out-of-body experiences do not occur near death, but in conditions of either very high or very low arousal.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, H.J. (1985).  ''Flight of Mind: a psychological study of the out-of-body experience.'' Metuchen, New Jersey: The Scarecrow Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; McCreery &lt;ref&gt;McCreery, C. (2008). Dreams and psychosis: a new look at an old hypothesis. ''Psychological Paper No. 2008-1''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. [http://www.celiagreen.com/charlesmccreery/dreams-and-psychosis.pdf Online PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that this latter paradox may be explained by reference to the fact that sleep may be approached, not only by the conventional route of low arousal and deafferentation, but also by the less familiar route of extreme stress and hyper-arousal.&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, I. (1962). ''Sleeping and Waking: Physiology and Psychology.'' Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; On this model OBEs represent the intrusion of Stage 1 sleep processes into waking consciousness.

OBEs can be regarded as hallucinatory in the sense that they are perceptual or quasi-perceptual experiences in which by definition the ostensible viewpoint is not coincident with the physical body of the subject.  Therefore, the normal sensory input, if any, that the subject is receiving during the experience cannot correspond exactly to the perceptual representation of the world in the subject's consciousness.

As with hallucinatory experiences in general, attempts to survey samples of the general population have suggested that such experiences are relatively common, incidence figures of between 15 and 25 percent being commonly reported.&lt;ref&gt;See Irwin, ''op.cit.,'' for a review.&lt;/ref&gt;  The variation is presumably to be accounted for by the different types of populations sampled and the different criteria of ‘out-of-body experience’ used.

===Dreams and lucid dreams===
{{Main|Dream|Lucid dream}}
A dream has been defined by some (e.g. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'') as a hallucinatory experience during sleep. &lt;!-- see here: http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109540/dream --&gt;

A lucid dream may be defined as one in which the dreamer is aware that he or she is asleep and dreaming.  The term ‘lucid dream’ was first used by the Dutch physician Frederik van Eeden,&lt;ref&gt;van Eeden, F. (1913). A study of dreams. ''Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research'', '''26''', Part 47, pp. 431-461.&lt;/ref&gt; who studied his own dreams of this type.  The word ‘lucid’ refers to the fact that the subject has achieved insight into his or her condition, rather than the perceptual quality of the experience.  Nevertheless, it is one of the features of lucid dreams that they can have an extremely high quality of perceptual realism, to the extent that the dreamer may spend time examining and admiring the perceptual environment and the way it appears to imitate that of waking life.&lt;ref&gt;See Green, C. (1968). ''Lucid Dreams.'' London: Hamish Hamilton, for examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucid dreams by definition occur during sleep, but they may be regarded as hallucinatory experiences in the same way as non-lucid dreams of a vivid perceptual nature may be regarded as hallucinatory, that is they are examples of 'an experience having the character of sense perception, but without relevant or adequate sensory stimulation […]' &lt;ref&gt;Drever, (1952). ''A Dictionary of Psychology''. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

====False awakenings====

A [[false awakening]] is one in which the subject believes he/she has woken up, whether from a lucid or a non-lucid dream, but is in fact still asleep.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Green C. and McCreery C. (1994). ''Lucid Dreaming: the Paradox of Consciousness During Sleep''. London: Routledge. Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes the experience is so realistic perceptually (the sleeper seeming to wake in his or her own bedroom, for example) that insight is not achieved at once, or even until the dreamer really wakes up and realises that what has occurred was hallucinatory.  Such experiences seem particularly liable to occur to those who deliberately cultivate lucid dreams.  However, they may also occur spontaneously and be associated with the experience of [[sleep paralysis]].

===Laboratory-induced hallucinations===
Psychotic-like symptoms, such as hallucinations and unusual perceptual experience, involve gross alterations in the experience of reality. Normal perception is substantially constructive and what we perceive  is strongly influenced by our prior experiences and expectancies.  Healthy individuals prone to hallucinations, or scoring highly on psychometric measures of positive [[schizotypy]],  tend to show a bias toward reporting stimuli that did not occur under perceptually ambiguous experimental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Bentall R.P, &amp; Slade P.D. (1985). Reality testing and auditory hallucinations: a signal detection analysis. ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology'', '''24''', 159 –169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. &amp; Reed, P. (2005). Seeing words that are not there: detection biases in psychometric schizotypy. ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology'', '''44''', 295-299&lt;/ref&gt;  During visual detection of fast-moving words, undergraduate students scoring highly on positive schizotypy had significantly high rates of false perceptions of words (i.e. reported seeing words that were not included in the experimental trials).&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. &amp; Reed, P. (2005). Do positive schizotypal symptoms predict false perceptual experiences in non-clinical population? ''Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease'', '''193''', 809-812.&lt;/ref&gt;  Positive schizotypal symptoms in healthy adults seem to predict false perceptions in laboratory tasks and certain environmental parameters such as perceptual load&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. (2006). Perceptual biases and positive schizotypy: the role of perceptual load. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', '''41''', 951-958.&lt;/ref&gt; and frequency of visual targets &lt;ref&gt;Reed, P., Wakefield, D., Harris, J., Parry, J., Cella, M. &amp; Tsakanikos, E. (2008). Seeing non-existing events: effects of environmental conditions, schizotypal symptoms and sub-clinical characteristics. ''Journal of Behavior Therapy &amp; Experimental Psychiatry'', '''39''', 276-291.&lt;/ref&gt; are critical in the  generation of false perceptions. When detection of events becomes either effortless or [[Attention#Influence of Processing Load|cognitively demanding]], generation of such biases can be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. (2006). Perceptual biases and positive schizotypy: the role of perceptual load. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', '''41''', 951-958.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subtypes==

===Auditory hallucinations===
{{Main|Auditory hallucinations}}
Auditory hallucinations, and in particular the hearing of a voice, are thought of as particularly characteristic of people suffering from [[schizophrenia]].  However, normal subjects also report auditory hallucinations to a surprising extent.  For example, Bentall and Slade&lt;ref&gt;Bentall R.P. and Slade P.D. (1985).  Reliability of a scale measuring disposition towards hallucination:  a brief report.  ''Personality and Individual Differences'', '''6''', 527 529.
&lt;/ref&gt; found that as many as 15.4% of a population of 150 male students were prepared to endorse the statement ‘In the past I have had the experience of hearing a person’s voice and then found that no one was there’.  They add: &lt;blockquote&gt;‘[…]no less than 17.5% of the [subjects] were prepared to score the item “I often hear a voice speaking my thoughts aloud” as “Certainly Applies”.  This latter item is usually regarded as a first-rank symptom of schizophrenia[…]’&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Green and McCreery&lt;ref&gt;Green and McCreery, ''Apparitions'', ''op.cit. '' p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;  found that 14% of their 1800 self-selected subjects reported a purely auditory hallucination, and of these nearly half involved the hearing of articulate or inarticulate human speech sounds. An example of the former would be the case of an engineer facing a difficult professional decision, who, while sitting in a cinema, heard a voice saying, ‘loudly and distinctly’: ‘You can’t do it, you know’.  He adds: &lt;blockquote&gt;‘It was so clear and resonant that I turned and looked at my companion who was gazing placidly at the screen[…] I was amazed and somewhat relieved when it became apparent that I was the only person who had heard anything.’&lt;ref&gt;''Apparitions'', pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This case would be an example of what Posey and Losch&lt;ref&gt;Posey, T.B. and Losch, M.E. (1983).  Auditory hallucinations of hearing voices in 375 normal subjects.  ''Imagination, Cognition and Personality'', '''3''', 99-113.
&lt;/ref&gt; call ‘hearing a comforting or advising voice that is not perceived as being one’s own thoughts’. They estimated that approximately 10% of their population of 375 American college students had this type of experience.

It has been suggested that auditory hallucinations are affected by culture,  to the extent that when American subjects were examined they reported hearing stern authoritarian voices with violent or prohibitive suggestions,  whereas voices heard in India and Africa tended to be playful and collaborative instead.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Sense of presence===

This is a paradoxical experience in which the person has a strong feeling of the presence of another person, sometimes recognised, sometimes unrecognised, but without any apparently justifying sensory stimulus.

The nineteenth-century American psychologist and philosopher [[William James]] described the experience thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;'From the way in which this experience is spoken of by those who have had it, it would appear to be an extremely definite and positive state of mind, coupled with a belief in the reality of its object quite as strong as any direct sensation ever gives. And yet no sensation seems to be connected with it at all... The phenomenon would seem to be due to a pure conception becoming saturated with the sort of stinging urgency which ordinarily only sensations bring.'*&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1890; 1950). ''Principles of Psychology'', Volume II. New York, Dover Publications, pp. 322-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following is an example of this type of experience: &lt;blockquote&gt;‘My husband died in June 1945, and 26 years afterwards when I was at Church, I felt him standing beside me during the singing of a hymn. I felt I would see him if I turned my head. The feeling was so strong I was reduced to tears. I had not been thinking of him before I felt his presence. I had not had this feeling before that day, neither has it happened since then.’&lt;ref&gt;Green and McCreery, ''Apparitions'', ''op.cit''., p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Experiences of this kind appear to meet all but one of the normal criteria of hallucination.  For example, Slade and Bentall proposed the following working definition of a hallucination: &lt;blockquote&gt;‘Any percept-like experience which (a) occurs in the absence of an appropriate stimulus, (b) has the full force or impact of the corresponding actual (real) perception, and (c) is not amenable to direct and voluntary control by the experiencer.’&lt;ref&gt;Slade and Bentall, op.cit., p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
The experience quoted above certainly meets the second and third of these three criteria.  One might add that the ‘presence’ in such a case is experienced as located in a definite position in external physical space.  In this respect it may be said to be more hallucinatory than, for example, some [[hypnagogic imagery]], which may be experienced as external to the subject but located in a mental ‘space’ of its own.&lt;ref&gt;
 Leaning, F.E. (1925). An introductory study of hypnagogic phenomena. ''Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research'', '''35''', 289-409.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Mavromatis, A. (1987). ''Hypnagogia: the Unique State of Consciousness Between Wakefulness and Sleep''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; Other explanations for this phenomenon were discussed by the psychologist [[Graham Reed (psychologist)|Graham Reed]] who wrote that such experiences may involve [[illusion]], misinterpretation or [[suggestion]]. He noted that the experiences are usually reported at moments of fatigue, stress, or during the night.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham Reed (psychologist)|Reed, Graham]]. (1988). ''The Psychology of Anomalous Experience''. Prometheus Books. pp. 44-45. {{ISBN|0-87975-435-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sense of presence experiences in bereavement===

The experience of sensing the presence of a deceased loved one is a commonly reported phenomenon in [[Grief|bereavement]]. It can take the form of a clearly sensory impression or can involve a quasi-sensory 'feeling' of presence. Rees&lt;ref&gt;
Rees, W.D. (1971). The hallucinations of widowhood.  ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', '''4''', 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a study of 293 [[widow]]ed people living in a particular area of mid-[[Wales]].  He found that 14% of those interviewed reported having had a visual hallucination of their deceased [[Marriage|spouse]], 13.3% an auditory one and 2.7% a tactile one. These categories overlapped to some extent as some people reported a hallucinatory experience in more than one modality. Of interest in light of the previous heading was the fact that 46.7% of the sample reported experiencing the presence of the deceased spouse. Other studies have similarly reported a frequency of approximately 50% in the bereaved population.&lt;ref&gt;
Datson, S.L., &amp; Marwit, S.J. (1997). Personality constructs and perceived presence of deceased loved ones. ''[[Death Studies]]'', '''21''', 131-146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Olson, P.R., Suddeth, J.A., Peterson, P.A., &amp; Egelhoff, C. (1985). Hallucinations of widowhood. ''Journal of the American Geriatric Society'', "33", 543-547.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensing the presence of the deceased may be a cross-cultural phenomenon that is, however, interpreted differently depending on the cultural context in which it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;
Steffen, E., &amp; Coyle, A. (2012). 'Sense of presence' experiences in bereavement and their relationship to mental health: A critical examination of a continuing controversy. In C. Murray (Ed.). ''Mental health and anomalous experience'', New York: Nova Science Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the earliest studies of the phenomenon published in a Western peer-reviewed journal investigated the [[grief]] experiences of Japanese widows and found that 90% of them reported to have sensed the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;
Yamamoto, J., Okonogi, K., I wasaki, T., &amp; Yoshimura, S. (1969). Mourning in Japan. ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'', '''125''', 1660-1665.&lt;/ref&gt; It was observed that, in contrast to Western interpretations, the widows were not concerned about their sanity and made sense of the experience in religious terms.

In the Western world, much of the bereavement literature of the 20th century had been influenced by psychoanalytic thinking and viewed these experiences as a form of denial, in the tradition of [[Freud]]'s interpretation in ''Mourning and Melancholia'' of the bereaved person as 'clinging to the object through the medium of a hallucinatory wishful psychosis'.&lt;ref&gt;
Freud, S. (1917). Mourning and melancholia. In J. [[Strachey]] (Ed. and Trans.). ''The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud (Vol. XIV)'' (pp. 252-268). London: Hogarth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, building on cross-cultural evidence about the adaptiveness of such experiences, the continuing bonds perspective as originated by Klass et al. (1996) &lt;ref&gt;
Klass, D., Silverman, P.R., &amp; Nickman, S. (Eds.). (1996). ''Continuing bonds: New understandings of grief.'' Bristol: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that such experiences can be seen as normal and potentially adaptive in a Western context too. Since then, a number of qualitative studies have been published, describing the mainly beneficial effects of these experiences, especially when they are made sense of in spiritual or religious ways&lt;ref&gt;
Kwilecki, S. (2011). Ghosts, meaning, and faith: After-death communications in bereavement narratives. ''[[Death Studies]]", '''35''', 219-243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Steffen, E., &amp; Coyle, A. (2011). Sense of presence experiences and meaning-making in bereavement: A qualitative analysis.''[[Death Studies]]'', '''35''', 579-609.&lt;/ref&gt; While most of these experiences tend to be reported as comforting to the perceiver, a small percentage of people have reported disturbing experiences, and there is ongoing research, for example by Field and others,&lt;ref&gt;
Field, N.P., &amp; Filanosky, C. (2010). Continuing bonds, risk factors for complicated grief, and adjustment to bereavement. ''[[Death Studies]]'', '''34''', 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; to determine when continuing bonds experiences serve adjustment to bereavement and when they may be detrimental.

== Theoretical implications ==

===Psychological===
The main importance of anomalous experiences such as benign hallucinations to theoretical psychology lies in their relevance to the debate between the disease model versus the dimensional model of [[psychosis]].  According to the disease model, psychotic states such as those associated with [[schizophrenia]] and [[manic-depression]], represent symptoms of an underlying disease process, which is dichotomous in nature; i.e. a given subject either does or does not have the disease, just as a person either does or does not have a physical disease such as tuberculosis.  According to the dimensional model, by contrast, the population at large is ranged along a normally distributed continuum or dimension, which has been variously labelled as psychoticism ([[Eysenck|H.J.Eysenck]]), [[schizotypy]] ([[Gordon Claridge]]) or psychosis-proneness.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the concept of schizotypy and its variants, cf. McCreery, C. and Claridge, G. (2002). Healthy schizotypy: the case of out-of-the-body experiences. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', '''32''', 141-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The occurrence of spontaneous hallucinatory experiences in persons who are enjoying good physical health at the time, and who are not drugged or in other unusual physical states of a transient nature such as extreme fatigue, would appear to provide support for the dimensional model.&lt;ref&gt;Berrios G E (2005) On Fantastic Apparitions of Vision and Johannes Müller. ''History of Psychiatry'' 16: 229-246.&lt;/ref&gt;  The alternative to this view requires one to posit some hidden or latent disease process, of which such experiences are a symptom or precursor, an explanation which would appear to beg the question.

===Philosophical===

The "argument from hallucination" has traditionally been one of those used by proponents of the philosophical theory of [[Direct and indirect realism|representationalism against direct realism]].  Representationalism holds that when perceiving the world we are not in direct contact with it, as common sense suggests, but only in direct contact with a representation of the world in consciousness.  That representation may be a more or less accurate one depending on our circumstances, the state of our health, and so on.  Direct realism, on the other hand, holds that the common sense or unthinking view of perception is correct, and that when perceiving the world we should be regarded as in direct contact with it, unmediated by any representation in consciousness.

Clearly, during an apparitional experience, for example, the correspondence between how the subject is perceiving the world and how the world really is at that moment is distinctly imperfect. At the same time the experience may present itself to the subject as indistinguishable from normal perception.  McCreery&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, C. (2006). "Perception and Hallucination: the Case for Continuity." ''Philosophical Paper No. 2006-1''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. [http://www.celiagreen.com/charlesmccreery/perception.pdf Online PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that such empirical phenomena strengthen the case for representationalism as against direct realism.

'''''Apeiron''''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|aɪ|r|ɒ|n}}; {{lang|grc|ἄπειρον}}) is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "(that which is) unlimited," "boundless", "infinite", or "indefinite"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/peiros2|ἄπειρον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|ἀ-}} ''a-'', "without" and {{lang|grc|πεῖραρ}} ''peirar'', "end, limit", "boundary",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pei{{=}}rar|πεῖραρ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ionic Greek]] form of {{lang|grc|πέρας}} ''peras'', "end, limit, boundary".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pe/ras|πέρας|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is akin to [[Persian language|Persian]] ''piramon'', meaning "boundary, circumference, surrounding".

==''Apeiron'' as an origin==
The ''apeiron'' is central to the [[cosmology|cosmological]] theory created by [[Anaximander]], a 6th-century BC [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] whose work is mostly lost.  From the few existing fragments, we learn that he believed the beginning or ultimate reality (''[[arche]]'') is eternal and infinite, or boundless (''apeiron''), subject to neither old age nor decay, which perpetually yields fresh materials from which everything we can perceive is derived.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Phys.'' Γ5, 204b, 23sq.&lt;DK12,A16.&gt;, Hippolytus, ''Haer.'' I 6, 1 sq. &lt;DK 12 A11, B2.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apeiron'' generated the [[Opposite (semantics)|opposite]]s (hot–cold, wet–dry, etc.) which acted on the creation of the world ([[cf.]] [[Heraclitus]]). Everything is generated from ''apeiron'' and then it is destroyed by going back to ''apeiron'', according to necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''in Phys.'', p. 24, 13sq.&lt;DK 12 A9,B1.&gt;, p. 150, 24sq.&lt;DK 12 A9.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that infinite worlds are generated from ''apeiron'' and then they are destroyed there again.&lt;ref&gt;Aetius I 3,3&lt;Pseudo-Plutarch; DK 12 A14.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas were influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythical]] tradition and by his teacher [[Thales]] (7th to 6th century BC). Searching for some universal principle, Anaximander retained the traditional religious assumption that there was a cosmic order and tried to explain it rationally, using the old mythical language which ascribed divine control on various spheres of reality. This language was more suitable for a society which could see gods everywhere; therefore the first glimmerings of laws of nature were themselves derived from divine laws.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World Publishing Co. Cleveland and New York. pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks believed that the universal principles could also be applied to human societies. The word ''nomos'' (law) may originally have meant ''natural law'' and used later to mean man-made law.&lt;ref&gt;L. H. Jeferry  (1976) ''The archaic Greece. The Greek city states 700-500 BC''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London &amp; Tonbridge p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction. It adopted ''apeiron'' as the origin of all things, because it is completely indefinite. This is a further transition from the previous existing [[mythical]] way of thought to the newer [[rationalism|rational]] way of thought which is the main characteristic of the [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic period]] (8th to 6th century BC). This shift in thought is correlated with the new political conditions in the Greek [[city states]] during the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Vernant (1964) ''Les origins de la pensee grecque''. PUF Paris. p. 128; J. P. Vernant (1982) '' The origins of Greek thought''. Ithaca, Cornell University Press. pp. 118, 128. {{ISBN|0-8014-9293-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roots==
In the mythical [[Greece|Greek]] [[cosmogony]] of [[Hesiod]] (8th to 7th century BC) the first [[Greek primordial deities|primordial god]] is [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], which is a void or gap. Chaos is described as a gap either between [[Tartarus]] and the earth's surface (Miller's interpretation) or between earth's surface and the sky (Cornford's interpretation).&lt;ref&gt;''The Theogony of Hesiod''. Transl. H. G. Evelyn White (1914): 116, 736-744 [http://www.sacred-tests.com/cla/hesiod/theogony/htm online]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'First of all': On the Semantics and Ethics of Hesiod's Cosmogony - Mitchell Miller - Ancient Philosophy (Philosophy Documentation Center)|url = https://www.pdcnet.org//pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=ancientphil&amp;id=ancientphil_2001_0021_0002_0251_0276&amp;onlyautologin=true|website = www.pdcnet.org|access-date = 2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Ritual Basis for Hesiod's Theogony|last = Cornford|first = Francis|publisher = |year = 1950|isbn = |location = |pages = 95–116|work = The Unwritten Philosophy and other Essays}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can name it also [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]] (having no bottom).

Alternately, Greek [[philosopher]] [[Thales]] believed that the origin or first principle was water. [[Pherecydes of Syros]] (6th century BC) probably called the water also ''Chaos'' and this is not placed at the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Presocratic philosophers|author=G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven and M. Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg |page=57| isbn =978-0-521-27455-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the creation stories of Near East the primordial world is described formless and empty. The only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. The Babylonian cosmology [[Enuma Elish]] describes the earliest stage of the universe as one of watery chaos and something similar is described in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg|isbn=9780521294201}} p 58,59 {{ISBN|0-521-29420-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Hindu]] cosmogony which is similar to the [[Vedic]] ([[Hiranyagarbha]]) the initial state of the universe was an absolute darkness.

Hesiod made an abstraction, because his original ''chaos'' is a void, something completely indefinite. In his opinion the origin should be indefinite and indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;O. Gigon (1968) ''Der Umsprung der Griechishe Philosophie. Von Hesiod bis Parmenides''. Bale. Stuttgart, Schwabe &amp; Co. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in [[Homer]] (indefinite sea). A fragment from [[Xenophanes]] (6th century BC)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;DK 21 B 28&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; shows the transition from ''chaos'' to ''apeiron'': "The upper limit of earth borders on air. The lower limit reaches down to the unlimited. (i.e. the Apeiron)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The world of Parmenides|author=Karl.R.Popper|year=1998|publisher=Rootledge.New York|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=V76PlyggwQkC&amp;pg|isbn=9780415173018}} p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Either ''apeiron'' meant the "spatial indefinite" and was implied to be indefinite in kind, or Anaximander intended it primarily 'that which is indefinite in kind' but assumed it also to be of unlimited extent and duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|author=G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven and M. Schofield |year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg |pages=10, 110 |isbn=978-0-521-27455-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas may have been influenced by the [[Pythagoreans]]:{{Quote|[...] for they [the Pythagoreans] plainly say that when the one had been constructed, whether out of planes or of surface or of seed or of elements which they cannot express, immediately the nearest part of the unlimited began to be drawn in and limited by the limit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philolaus]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Greek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction making ''apeiron'' the principle of all things and some scholars saw a gap  between the existing ''mythical'' and the new ''rational'' way of thought (''rationalism''). But if we follow the course, we will see that there is not such an abrupt break with the previous thought. The basic elements of nature, [[water (classical element)|water]], [[air (classical element)|air]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], which the first Greek philosophers believed that composed the world, represent in fact the mythical primordial forces. The collision of these forces produced the cosmic harmony according to the Greek cosmogony (Hesiod).&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Mossé]] (1984) ''La Grece archaique d'Homere a Eschyle.'' Edition du Seuil. p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between these elements, therefore he chose something else (indefinite in kind) which could generate the others without experiencing any decay.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Phys.'' Γ5, 204b 23sq.&lt;DK 12 A 16.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a fragment attributed to his teacher Thales:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius,&lt;DK 11 A1.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "What is divine? What has no origin, nor end." This probably led his student to his final decision for ''apeiron'', because the divinity applied to it implies that it always existed. The notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This ''arche'' is called "eternal and ageless" (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg=PA83 |page=83 |isbn=978-0-521-29420-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of the world==
The ''apeiron'' has generally been understood as a sort of [[Substance theory|primal chaos]]. It acts as the substratum supporting opposites such as hot and cold, wet and dry, and directed the movement of things, by which there grew up all of the host of shapes and differences which are found in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legacy of Parmenides: Eleatic Monism and Later Presocratic Thought |author= Patricia Curd |year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=77|isbn=978-0-691-01182-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2JX1ulXzogC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Out of the vague and limitless body there sprang a central mass—this earth of ours—cylindrical in shape. A sphere of fire surrounded the air around the earth and had originally clung to it like the bark round a tree. When it broke, it created the sun, the moon and the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Strom.'' 2, fr.179 Sandbach &lt;DK 12 A 10.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first animals were generated in the water.&lt;ref&gt;Aetius V 19,4 &lt;DK 12 A 30.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When they came to earth they were transmuted by the effect of the sun. The human being sprung from some other animal, which originally was similar to a fish.&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''Haer.'' I 6,6 &lt;DK 12 A 11.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The blazing orbs, which have drawn off from the cold earth and water, are the temporary gods of the world clustering around the earth, which to the ancient thinker is the central figure.

==Interpretations==
In the commentary of [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] on Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' the following fragment is attributed direct to Anaximander:
{{Quote|Whence things have their origin, there their destruction happens as it is ordained [Greek: ''kata to chreon'' means "according to the debt"]. For they give ''justice'' and ''compensation'' to one another for their ''injustice'' according to the ordering of time.}}
This fragment remains a mystery because it can be translated in different ways. Simplicius comments that Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between the four elements (earth, air, water, fire), therefore he did not choose one of them as an origin, but something else which generates the opposites without experiencing any decay. He mentions also that Anaximander said all these in poetic terms,&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius in Phys. p. 24, 13sq.&lt;DK12a9,B1&gt;
{{Quote|Anaximander from Miletus, son of Praxiades student and descendant of Thales, said that the origin and the element of things (beings) is apeiron and he is the first who used this name for the origin (arche). He says that the origin is neither water, nor any other of the so-called elements, but something of different nature, unlimited. From it are generated the skies and the worlds which exist between them. Whence things (beings) have their origin, there their destruction happens as it is ordained. For they give justice and compensation to one another for their injustice according to the ordering of time, as he said in poetic terms. Obviously noticing the mutual changes between the four elements, he didn't demand to make one of them a subject, but something else except these. He considers that genesis takes place without any decay of this element, but with the generation of the opposites by his own movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that he used the old mythical language. The Goddess ''Justice'' ([[Dike (mythology)|Dike]]), appears to keep the order.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. Cleveland and New York. p. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt; The quotation is close to the original meanings of the relevant Greek words. The word ''dike'' (justice) was probably originally derived from the boundaries of a man's land and transmits metaphorically the notion that somebody must remain in his own sphere, respecting the one of his neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[adikia]]'' (injustice) means that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, something that could disturb "law and order" (''[[Eunomia (goddess)|eunomia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;L. H. Jeffery (1976) ''The archaic Greece. The Greek city states 700–500 BC''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London &amp; Tonbridge. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' ''eunomia'' is contrasted with ''[[hubris]]'' (arrogance).&lt;ref&gt;''Homer: Odyssey.'' 17.487&lt;/ref&gt; Arrogance was considered very dangerous because it could break the balance and lead to political instability and finally to the destruction of a ''city-state''.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] (1st century BC) transmits a different quotation:
{{Quote|Everything is generated from ''apeiron'' and there its destruction happens. Infinite worlds are generated and they are destructed there again. And he says (Anaximander) why this is ''apeiron''. Because only then genesis and decay will never stop.|Aetius I 3,3&lt;Ps.Plutarch; DK 12 A14.&gt;}}
Therefore, it seems that Anaximander argued about ''apeiron'' and this is also noticed by [[Aristotle]]:
{{Quote|The belief that there is something ''apeiron'' stems from the idea that only then genesis and decay will never stop, when that from which is taken what is generated is ''apeiron''.|Aristotle, ''Physics'' 203b 18–20 &lt;DK 12 A 15.&gt;}}
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche (1962) ''Philosophy in the tragic age of the Greeks.''. Washington DC: Regnery, Gateway.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist and that he viewed all coming to be as an illegitimate emancipation from the eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance. In accordance to this the world of the individual definite objects should perish into the indefinite since anything definite has to eventually return to the indefinite. His ideas had a great influence on many scholars including [[Martin Heidegger]].

[[Werner Heisenberg]], noted for the creation of [[quantum mechanics]], arrived at the idea that the elementary particles are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same "primordial substance". Because of its similarity to the primordial substance hypothesized by Anaximander, his colleague [[Max Born]] called this substance ''apeiron''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bmcpsgp-Ml4C&amp;pg=PA546|title= A Cultural History of Physics|last=Simonyi|first=Károly|author-link=Károly Simonyi|date=April 7, 2012|website=Chapter 5.5.10 ''Back to the Apeiron?''|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|accessdate=December 2, 2012|via=[[Google Books]]|isbn= 9781568813295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in other fields, e.g. [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell (1946) ''History of Western Philosophy'' NY. Simon and Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maurice Bowra]],&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and N. York. p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; didn't deny that Anaximander was the first who used the term ''apeiron'', but claimed that the mysterious fragment is dealing with the balance of opposite forces as central to reality being closer to the quotation transmitted by Simplicius.

There are also other interpretations which try to match both the previous aspects. ''Apeiron'' is an abstract, void, something that cannot be described according to the Greek pessimistic belief for death. Death indeed meant "nothingless". The dead live like shadows and there is no return to the real world. Everything generated from ''apeiron'' must return there according to the principle genesis-decay. There is a polar attraction between the opposites genesis-decay, arrogance-justice. The existence itself carries a guilt.&lt;ref&gt;O. Gigon (1968) ''Der Umsprung der Griechische Philosophie. Von Hesiod bis Parmenides''. Bale Stutgart, Schwabe &amp; Co. pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|The idea that the fact of existence by itself carries along an incurable guilt is Greek (''Theognis'' 327) and anybody claims that surpasses it, commits arrogance and therefore he becomes guilty. The first half of the 6th century is a period of great social instability in Miletus, the city state where Anaximander lives. Any attempt of excess leads to exaggerations and each exaggeration must be corrected. All these have to be paid according to the debt. The things give justice to one another with the process of time.}}
Justice has to destroy everything which is born. There is no external limit that can restrict the activities of men, except the destruction. Arrogance is an expression of the chaotic element of human existence and in a way a part of the rebounding mechanism of order, because pushing it to exertions causes destruction which is also a reestablishment.&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (2004) ''Ce qui fait la Grece 1. D'Homere a Heracklite. Seminaires 1982-1983. La creation humain II''. Edition du Seuil. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Greek and Western thought==
We may assume that the contradiction in the different interpretations is because Anaximander combined two different ways of thought. The first one dealing with ''apeiron'' is metaphysical (and can lead to [[monism]]), while the second one dealing with mutual changes and the balance of the opposites as central to reality is physical.&lt;ref&gt;M. O. Sullivan (1985) ''The four seasons of Greek philosophy''. Efstathiadis group. Athens. pp. 28–31 (Edition in English)&lt;/ref&gt; The same [[paradox]] existed in the Greek way of thought. The Greeks believed that each individual had unlimitable potentialities both in brain and in heart, an outlook which called a man to live at the top of his powers. But that there was a limit to his most violent ambitions, that arrogance-injustice (''hubris'' or ''adikia'') could disturb the harmony and balance. In that case justice (''[[Dike (mythology)|dike]]'') would destroy him to reestablish the order.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) The Greek experience. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. pp. 63, 89&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are obvious in later Greek philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (2004) ''Ce qui fait la grece 1. D'Homere a Heraclite. Seminaires 1982–1983. La creation Humain II''. Editions du Seuil. p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philolaus]] (5th century BC) mentions that nature constituted and is organized with the world from unlimitable ({{lang-grc|ἄπειρα}} ''apeira'', plural of ''apeiron'') and limitable. Everything which exists in the world contains the unlimited (''apeiron'') and the limited.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;DK B1.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Something similar is mentioned by [[Plato]]: Nothing can exist if it doesn't contain continually and simultaneously the limited and the unlimited, the definite and the indefinite.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[Philebus]] 16c.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doctrines existing in Western thought, still transmit some of the original ideas: "God ordained that all men shall die", "Death is a common debt". The Greek word ''adikia'' (injustice) transmits the notion that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, without respecting the one of his neighbour. Therefore, he commits [[hubris]]. The relative English word ''arrogance'' (claim as one's own without justification; {{lang-la|arrogare}}), is very close to the original meaning of the aphorism: "Nothing in excess."

==Other pre-Socratic philosophers' ideas about ''apeiron''==
Other [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers had different theories of the ''apeiron''. For the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular, [[Philolaus]]), the universe had begun as an ''apeiron'', but at some point it inhaled the void from outside, filling the cosmos with vacuous bubbles that split the world into many different parts.  For [[Anaxagoras]], the initial ''apeiron'' had begun to rotate rapidly under the control of a godlike ''[[Nous]]'' (Mind), and the great speed of the rotation caused the universe to break up into many fragments. However, since all individual things had originated from the same ''apeiron'', all things must contain parts of all other things—for instance, a tree must also contain tiny pieces of sharks, moons, and grains of sand. This alone explains how one object can be transformed into another, since each thing already contains all other things in germ.

'''Biographical criticism''' is a form of [[literary criticism]] which analyzes a writer's biography to show the relationship between the author's life and their works of literature.&lt;ref&gt;"Biographical Criticism", ''Writing essays about literature: a guide and style sheet'' (2004), Kelley Griffith, University of North Carolina at Greensborough, Wadsworth Publishing Company , pages 177-178, 400&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25111810 Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism]" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; Biographical criticism is often associated with [[historical-biographical criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/college_literature/v030/30.1knoper.html&lt;/ref&gt; a critical method that "sees a literary work chiefly, if not exclusively, as a reflection of its author's life and times".&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred L. Guerin, A handbook of critical approaches to literature, Edition 5, 2005, page 51, 57-61; Oxford University Press, University of Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;

This longstanding critical method dates back at least to the [[Renaissance]] period,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Duane Reed (1922) "Biographical Criticism of Vergil since the Renaissance" ''Studies in Philology'' 19(1): pp. 1-30, page 1 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; and was employed extensively by Samuel Johnson in his ''[[Lives of the Poets]]'' (1779–81).&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/criticism "Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets (1779–81) was the first thorough-going exercise in biographical criticism, the attempt to relate a writer's background and life to his works."&lt;/ref&gt;

Like any critical methodology, biographical criticism can be used with discretion and insight or employed as a superficial shortcut to understanding the literary work on its own terms through such strategies as [[Formalism (literature)|Formalism]].  Hence 19th century biographical criticism came under disapproval by the so-called [[New Critics]] of the 1920s, who coined the term "[[biographical fallacy]]"&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Francis Noel (1967) "The Keys Are at the Palace: A Note on Criticism and Biography" pp. 135-149 ''In'' Damon, Philip (editor)  (1967) ''Literary Criticism and Historical Understanding: Selected Papers from the English Institute'' Columbia University Press, New York, {{OCLC|390148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussed extensively in Frye, Herman Northrop (1947) ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'' Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey,  page 326 and following, {{OCLC|560970612}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe criticism that neglected the imaginative genesis of literature.

Notwithstanding this critique, biographical criticism remained a significant mode of literary inquiry throughout the 20th century, particularly in studies of [[Charles Dickens]] and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], among others. The method continues to be employed in the study of such authors as [[John Steinbeck]],&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Whitman]]&lt;ref&gt;Knoper, Randall (2003)[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3709/is_200301/ai_n9212440/ "Walt Whitman and New Biographical Criticism"] ''College Literature'' 30(1): pp. 161-168&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer, James (ed), ''Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays'' (1999),pp. 19-27, 40-43, 45, 47, 395&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peripatetic biographical criticism ==
In ''The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism'', in a chapter titled "Peripatetic Biographical Criticism", George Alexander Kennedy notes that in the [[Hellenistic]] age, "The works of authors were read as sources of information about their lives, personalities and interests. Some of this material was then used by other commentators and critics to explain passages in their works. The process became a circular one in that, though Peripatetic biographers utilized external evidence where available, they had little to go on and quarried the texts for hints".&lt;ref&gt;George Alexander Kennedy, The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism, page 205, Cambridge University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition of otherness ==
Jackson J. Benson describes the form as a "'recognition of 'otherness'—that there is an author who is different in personality and background from the reader—appears to be a simple-minded proposition. Yet as a basic prerequisite to the understanding and evaluation of a literary text it is often ignored even by the most sophisticated literary critics. The exploration of otherness is what literary biography and biographical criticism can do best, discovering an author as a unique individual, a discovery that puts a burden on us to reach out to recognize that uniqueness before we can fully comprehend an author's writings.'"&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to other modes of criticism==
Biographical criticism shares in common with [[New Historicism]] an interest in the fact that all literary works are situated in specific historical and biographical contexts from which they are generated. Biographical Criticism, like New Historicism, rejects the concept that literary studies should be limited to the internal or formal characteristics of a literary work, and insists that it properly includes a knowledge of the contexts in which the work was created. Biographical criticism stands in ambiguous relationship to [[Romanticism]]. It has often been argued that it is a development from Romanticism, but it also stands in opposition to the Romantic tendency to view literature as manifesting a "universal" transcendence of the particular conditions of its genesis.

== Assessments of biographical criticism and literary biography ==
In ''The Art of Literary Biography'' (1995), John Worthen writes:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;'The fact that we ''want'' an emergent sense of the inevitable development suggests the enormously soothing quality which biographies have come to have in our age. Not only do biographies suggest that things as difficult as human lives can – for all their obvious complexity – be summed up, known, comprehended: they reassure us that, while we are reading, a world will be created in which there are few or no unclear motives, muddled decisions, or (indeed) loose ends.'&lt;ref&gt;John Worthen, 'The Necessary Ignorance of a Biographer,' in John Batchelor (ed.) ''The Art of Literary Biography'', Clarendon Press, Oxford 1995 pp.227-244, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5741">The '''cheerleader effect''', also known as the '''group attractiveness effect''', is the [[cognitive bias]] which causes people to think individuals are more attractive when they are in a group. The term was backed up by research by Drew Walker &amp; Edward Vul (2013) and van Osch et al. (2015).&lt;ref name="Walker2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vanOsch2015"/&gt;

== Media ==
The phrase was coined by the character [[Barney Stinson]] in "[[Not a Father's Day]]", an episode of the television series ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', first aired in 2008. Barney points out to his friends a group of women that initially seem attractive, but who all seem to be very ugly when examined individually. This point is made again by [[Ted Mosby|Ted]] and [[Robin Scherbatsky|Robin]] later in the episode, who note that some of Barney's friends also only seem attractive in a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/11/cheerleader-effect-why-people-are-more-beautiful-in-groups/281119/|title=Cheerleader Effect: Why People Are More Beautiful in Groups|work=[[The Atlantic]]|last=Hamblin|first=James|date=November 4, 2013|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies ==
===2013 study===
Across five studies by Walker and Vul (2013), participants rated the attractiveness of male and female faces when shown in a group photo, and an individual photo, with the order of the photographs randomised. The people photographed got higher scores for their group photos.&lt;ref name="Walker2013"/&gt;

This effect occurs with male-only, female-only and mixed gender groups, and both small and large groups. The effect occurs to the same extent with groups of four and 16 people. Participants in studies looked more at the attractive people than the unattractive people in the group. The effect does not occur because group photos give the impression that individuals have more social or emotional intelligence: this was shown to be the case by a study which used individual photos grouped together in a single image, rather than photos taken of people in a group.

====Proposed explanation====
Drew Walker and Edward Vul proposed that this effect arises due to the interplay of three [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive phenomena]]:&lt;ref name="Walker2013"/&gt;
#The human [[visual system]] takes "ensemble representations" of faces in a group.
#Perception of individuals is biased towards this average.
#Average faces are more attractive, perhaps due to "averaging out of unattractive idiosyncracies".&lt;ref name=Langlois1990/&gt;
When all three of these phenomena are taken together, the individual faces will seem more attractive in a group, as they appear more similar to the average group face, which is more attractive than members' individual faces.&lt;ref name="Walker2013"/&gt;

===2015 study===
A 2015 study by van Osch et al. confirmed the results obtained by Walker and Vul.&lt;ref name="vanOsch2015"/&gt;

====Proposed explanation====
The research team offered two different explanations for the group attractiveness effect:&lt;ref name="vanOsch2015"/&gt;
#[[Selective attention]] to attractive group members.
#The [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] principle of similarity.
They claim that selective attention fits better the gathered data.&lt;ref name="vanOsch2015"/&gt;

===Controversy===
A 2015 replication of Walker and Vul's study failed to show any significant results for the group attractiveness effect. The research team hypothesized that this may be due to cultural differences, since the replication study was performed in Japan.&lt;ref name="Ojiro2015"/&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=September 2012}}'''Complexity theory and organizations''', also called '''complexity strategy''' or '''complex adaptive organizations''', is the use of the study of [[Complex systems|complexity systems]] in the field of [[strategic management]] and [[organizational studies]].

Complexity theory is an interdisciplinary theory that grew out of [[systems theory]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grobman, Gary M 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grobman, Gary M.|title=Complexity Theory: a new way to look at organizational change|journal=Public Administration Quarterly|year=2005|url=http://www.complexityforum.com/members/Grobman%202005%20Complexity%20theory.pdf|volume=29|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|350}} It draws from research in the natural sciences that examines uncertainty and non-linearity.&lt;ref name="Grobman, Gary M 2005"/&gt; Complexity theory emphasizes interactions and the accompanying [[feedback]] loops that constantly change systems. While it proposes that systems are unpredictable, they are also constrained by order-generating rules.&lt;ref name="Burnes, Bernard 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Burnes, Bernard|title=Complexity theories and organizational change|journal=International Journal of Management Reviews|volume=7|issue=2|year=2005|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2370.2005.00107.x|pages=73–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}}

Complexity theory has been used in the fields of [[strategic management]] and [[organizational studies]].  Application areas include understanding how [[organizations]] or firms [[:wikt:adapt|adapt]] to their environments and how they cope with conditions of uncertainty.  Organisations have complex structures in that they are [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of interactions, and their relationships are not aggregations of the individual static entities. They are adaptive; in that the individual and [[collective behavior]] mutate and [[self-organizing|self-organize]] corresponding to a change-initiating micro-event or collection of events.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-02" /&gt;

== Key concepts ==

=== Complex adaptive systems ===
Organizations can be treated as [[complex adaptive systems]] (CAS) as they exhibit fundamental CAS principles like self-organization, [[complexity]], [[emergence]],&lt;ref name="CAS-T-13" /&gt; interdependence, space of possibilities, co-evolution, [[Chaos theory|chaos]], and [[self-similarity]].&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="terra"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Terra|first1=Leonardo Augusto Amaral|last2=Passador|first2=João Luiz|title=Symbiotic Dynamic: The Strategic Problem from the Perspective of Complexity|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|date=2016|volume=33|issue=2|page=235|doi=10.1002/sres.2379|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sres.2379/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAS are contrasted with ordered and [[chaotic systems]] by the relationship that exists between the system and the agents which act within it.  In an ordered system the level of constraint means that all agent behaviour is limited to the rules of the system. In a chaotic system the agents are unconstrained and susceptible to statistical and other analysis.  In a CAS, the system and the agents co-evolve; the system lightly constrains agent behaviour, but the agents modify the system by their interaction with it. This [[self-organizing]] nature is an important characteristic of CAS; and its ability to learn to adapt, differentiate it from other self organizing systems.&lt;ref name=CAS-T-01/&gt;

== Implications for organizational management ==
CAS approaches to strategy seek to understand the nature of system constraints and agent interaction and generally takes an evolutionary or naturalistic approach to strategy.  Some research integrates [[computer simulation and organizational studies]].

===Complexity theory and knowledge management===
Complexity theory also relates to [[knowledge management]] (KM) and [[organizational learning]] (OL). "Complex systems are, by any other definition, learning organizations."&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt; Complexity Theory, KM, and OL are all complimentary and co-dependent.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt; “KM and OL each lack a theory of how cognition happens in human social systems – complexity theory offers this missing piece”.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt;

=== Complexity theory and project management ===
Complexity theory is also being used to better understand new ways of doing [[project management]], as traditional models have been found lacking to current challenges.&lt;ref name="Saynisch 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saynisch, Manfred|title=Beyond frontiers of traditional project management: An approach to evolutionary, self-organizational principles and the complexity theory—results of the research program|journal=Project Management Journal|volume=41|issue=2|year=2010|pages=21–37|doi=10.1002/pmj.20159}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} This approaches advocates forming a "culture of trust" that "welcomes outsiders, embraces new ideas, and promotes cooperation."&lt;ref name="Saynisch 2010"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

=== Recommendations for managers ===
Complexity Theory implies approaches that focus on flatter, more flexible organizations, rather than top-down, command-and-control styles of management.&lt;ref name="Burnes, Bernard 2005"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

==Additional examples ==
A typical example for an organization behaving as CAS, is Wikipedia&lt;ref name="CAS-T-11" /&gt; – collaborated and managed by a loosely organized management structure,&lt;ref name="CAS-T-11" /&gt; composed of a complex mix of [[human–computer interaction]]s.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-18" /&gt; By managing behavior, and not only mere content, Wikipedia uses simple rules to produce a complex, evolving knowledge base which has largely replaced older sources in popular use.

Other examples include the complex [[Macroeconomics|global macroeconomic network]] within a country or group of countries&lt;!--much more complex than mere macroeconomic, any help in redirecting to a better page would be welcomed---&gt;; [[stock market]] and complex web of [[Cross-border_cooperation|cross-border]] [[holding companies]]; [[manufacturing|manufacturing business]]es&lt;!--much more complex than mere manufacturing, any help in rewording would be welcomed---&gt;; and any human social group-based endeavour in a particular [[ideology]] and [[social system]] such as [[political party|political parties]], [[community|communities]], [[geopolitical]] [[organisations]], and [[terrorist network analysis|terrorist networks]] of both hierarchical and [[leaderless resistance|leaderless]] nature.&lt;ref name="GT-33" /&gt;  This new macro level state may create difficulty for an observer in explaining and describing the collective behaviour in terms of its constituent parts; as a result of the complex dynamic networks of interactions, outlined earlier.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;

{{Business administration}}

'''Conflict management''' is the process of limiting the negative aspects of [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] while increasing the positive aspects of conflict. The aim of conflict management is to enhance [[learning]] and group outcomes, including effectiveness or performance in an organizational setting.&lt;ref name="rahim 208"&gt;Rahim, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; Properly managed conflict can improve group outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Alpert, Tjosvaldo, &amp; Law, 2000; Bodtker &amp; Jameson, 2001; Rahim &amp; Bonoma, 1979; Kuhn &amp; Poole, 2000; DeChurch &amp; Marks, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict resolution==
[[Conflict resolution]] involves the reduction, elimination, or termination of all forms and types of conflict. Five styles for conflict management, as identified by Thomas and Kilmann, are: competing, compromising, collaborating, avoiding, and accommodating.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Brief for the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode, CPP Research Department, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses can benefit from appropriate types and levels of conflict. That is the aim of conflict management, and not the aim of conflict resolution.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Conflict management does not imply conflict resolution.

Conflict management minimizes the negative outcomes of conflict and promotes the positive outcomes of conflict with the goal of improving learning in an organization.&lt;ref name="rahim 208"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muddaser.com/conflict-management-resolution-strategies-process-steps/|title=Conflict management|last=Altaf|first=Muddaser|date=|website=muddaser.com/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly managed conflict increases [[organizational learning]] by increasing the number of questions asked and encourages people to challenge the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Luthans, Rubach, &amp; Marsnik, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organizational conflict]] at the interpersonal level includes disputes between peers as well as supervisor-subordinate conflict. [[Party-directed mediation]] (PDM) is a mediation approach particularly suited for disputes between co-workers, colleagues or peers, especially deep-seated interpersonal conflict, multicultural or multiethnic disputes. The mediator listens to each party separately in a pre-caucus or pre-mediation before ever bringing them into a joint session. Part of the pre-caucus also includes coaching and role plays. The idea is that the parties learn how to converse directly with their adversary in the joint session. Some unique challenges arise when organizational disputes involve supervisors and subordinates. The Negotiated Performance Appraisal (NPA) is a tool for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and is particularly useful as an alternate mediation model because it preserves the hierarchical power of supervisors while encouraging dialogue and dealing with differences in opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7conflict/ Party-Directed Mediation: Facilitating Dialogue Between Individuals''] (on-line 3rd Edition, 2014) by [[Gregorio Billikopf]], University of California&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orientations to conflict==
There are three orientations to conflict: lose-lose, win-lose, and [[win-win]]. The lose-lose orientation is a type of conflict that tends to end negatively for all parties involved. A win-lose orientation results in one victorious party, usually at the expense of the other. The win-win orientation is one of the most essential concepts to conflict resolution. A win-win solution arrived at by integrative bargaining may be close to optimal for both parties. This approach engages in a [[Cooperation|cooperative]] approach rather than a competitive one.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Wood 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the win-win concept is the ideal orientation, the notion that there can only be one winner is constantly being reinforced in American culture:

"The win-lose orientation is manufactured in our society in athletic competition, admission to academic programs, industrial promotion systems, and so on. Individuals tend to generalize from their objective win-lose situations and apply these experiences to situations that are not objectively [[Lump of labour fallacy|fixed-pies]]".&lt;ref&gt;Spangle and Isenhart 14&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of mentality can be destructive when communicating with different cultural groups by creating barriers in negotiation, resolution and compromise; it can also lead the "loser" to feel mediocre. When the win-win orientation is absent in negotiation, different responses to conflict may be observed.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Early conflict management models===
Blake and Mouton (1964) were among the first to present a conceptual scheme for classifying the modes (styles) for handling interpersonal conflicts in five types: forcing, withdrawing, smoothing, compromising, and problem solving.

In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers began using the intentions of the parties involved to classify the styles of conflict management that they included in their models. Both Thomas (1976) and Pruitt (1983) put forth a model based on the concerns of the parties involved in the conflict. The combination of the parties' concern for their own interests (i.e. [[assertiveness]]) and their concern for the interests of those across the table (i.e. cooperativeness) yielded a particular conflict management style. Pruitt called these styles yielding (low assertiveness/high cooperativeness), problem solving (high assertiveness/high cooperativeness), inaction (low assertiveness/low cooperativeness), and contending (high assertiveness/low cooperativeness). Pruitt argues that problem-solving is the preferred method when seeking mutually beneficial options (win-win).

===Khun and Poole's model===
Khun and Poole (2000) established a similar system of group conflict management. In their system, they split Kozan's confrontational model into two sub models: distributive and integrative.
* Distributive – Here conflict is approached as a distribution of a fixed amount of positive outcomes or resources, where one side will end up winning and the other losing, even if they do win some concessions.
* Integrative – Groups utilizing the integrative model see conflict as a chance to integrate the needs and concerns of both groups and make the best outcome possible. This model has a heavier emphasis on compromise than the distributive model. Khun and Poole found that the integrative model resulted in consistently better task related outcomes than those using the distributive model.

===DeChurch and Marks's meta-taxonomy===
DeChurch and Marks (2001) examined the literature available on conflict management at the time and Ni established what they claimed was a "meta-taxonomy" that encompasses all other models.

They argued that all other styles have inherent in them into two dimensions:
* activeness ("the extent to which conflict behaviors make a responsive and direct rather than inert and indirect impression"). High activeness is characterized by openly discussing differences of opinion while fully going after their own interest. 
* [[agreeableness]] ("the extent to which conflict behaviors make a pleasant and relaxed rather than unpleasant and strainful impression"). High agreeableness is characterized by attempting to satisfy all parties involved.

In the study DeChurch and Marks conducted to validate this division, activeness did not have a significant effect on the effectiveness of conflict resolution, but the agreeableness of the conflict management style, whatever it was, did have a positive impact on how groups felt about the way the conflict was managed, regardless of the outcome.

===Rahim's meta-model===

Rahim (2002) noted that there is agreement among management scholars that there is no one best approach to how to make decisions, lead or manage conflict.

In a similar vein, rather than creating a very specific model of conflict management, Rahim created a meta-model (in much the same way that DeChurch and Marks, 2001, created a meta-taxonomy) for conflict styles based on two dimensions, concern for self and concern for others.

Within this framework are five management approaches: integrating, obliging, dominating, avoiding, and compromising.
* Integration involves openness, exchanging information, looking for alternatives, and examining differences so solve the problem in a manner that is acceptable to both parties.
* Obliging is associated with attempting to minimize the differences and highlight the commonalities to satisfy the concern of the other party.
* Dominating in this style one party goes all out to win his or her objective and, as a result, often ignores the needs and expectations of the other party.
* Avoiding here a party fails to satisfy his or her own concern as well as the concern of the other party.
* Compromising involves give-and-take whereby both parties give up something to make a mutually acceptable decision.&lt;ref&gt;Rahim, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==International conflict management==

Special consideration should be paid to conflict management between two parties from distinct cultures. In addition to the everyday sources of conflict, "misunderstandings, and from this counterproductive, pseudo conflicts, arise when members of one culture are unable to understand culturally determined differences in communication practices, traditions, and thought processing".&lt;ref&gt;Borisoff &amp; Victor, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, this has already been observed in the business research literature.

Renner (2007) recounted several episodes where managers from developed countries moved to less developed countries to resolve conflicts within the company and met with little success due to their failure to adapt to the conflict management styles of the local culture.

As an example, in Kozan's study noted above, he noted that Asian cultures are far more likely to use a harmony model of conflict management. If a party operating from a harmony model comes in conflict with a party using a more confrontational model, misunderstandings above and beyond those generated by the conflict itself will arise.

International conflict management, and the cultural issues associated with it, is one of the primary areas of research in the field at the time, as existing research is insufficient to deal with the ever-increasing contact occurring between international entities.

==Application==

===Higher education===
With only 14% of researched universities reporting mandatory courses in this subject, and with up to 25% of the manager day being spent on dealing with conflict, education needs to reconsider the importance of this subject. The subject warrants emphasis on enabling students to deal with conflict management.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p.&amp;nbsp;240&lt;/ref&gt;

"Providing more conflict management training in undergraduate business programs could help raise the emotional intelligence of future managers." The improvement of emotional intelligence found that employees were more likely to use problem-solving skills, instead of trying to bargain.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p.&amp;nbsp;241&lt;/ref&gt;

Students need to have a good set of social skills. Good communication skills allow the manager to accomplish interpersonal situations and conflict. Instead of focusing on conflict as a behavior issue, focus on the communication of it.&lt;ref&gt;Myers &amp; Larson, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;307&lt;/ref&gt;

With an understanding of the communications required, the student will gain the aptitude needed to differentiate between the nature and types of conflicts. These skills also teach that relational and procedural conflict needs a high degree of immediacy to resolution. If these two conflicts are not dealt with quickly, an employee will become dissatisfied or perform poorly.&lt;ref&gt;Myers &amp; Larson, p.&amp;nbsp;313&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the responsibility of companies to react. One option is to identify the skills needed in-house, but if the skills for creating workplace fairness are already lacking, it may be best to seek assistance from an outside organization, such as a developmental assessment center.

According to Rupp, Baldwin, and Bashur, these organizations "have become a popular means for providing coaching, feedback, and experiential learning opportunities".&lt;ref&gt;Rupp, Baldwin &amp; Bashshur, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;145&lt;/ref&gt; Their main focus is fairness and how it impacts employees' attitudes and performance.

These organizations teach competencies and what they mean.&lt;ref name="rupp 146"&gt;Rupp et al., p.&amp;nbsp;146&lt;/ref&gt; The students then participate in simulations. Multiple observers assess and record what skills are being used and then return this feedback to the participant. After this assessment, participants are then given another set of simulations to utilize the skills learned. Once again they receive additional feedback from observers, in hopes that the learning can be used in their workplace.

The feedback the participant receives is detailed, behaviorally specific, and high quality. This is needed for the participant to learn how to change their behavior.&lt;ref name="rupp 146"/&gt; In this regard, it is also important that the participant take time to self-reflect so that learning may occur.

Once an assessment program is utilized, action plans may be developed based on quantitative and qualitative data.&lt;ref&gt;Rupp et al., p.&amp;nbsp;159&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counseling===
When personal conflict leads to [[frustration]] and loss of [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]], [[counseling]] may prove to be a helpful antidote. Although few [[organization]]s can afford the luxury of having professional counselors on the staff, given some training, managers may be able to perform this function. Nondirective counseling, or "listening with understanding", is little more than being a good listener —
something every manager should be.&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry P Knowles; Börje O Saxberg|title= Personality and leadership behavior |publisher= Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|location=Reading, Mass.|year=1971|isbn=|oclc=118832|doi= |nopp=true |page=Chapter 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the simple process of being able to vent one's feelings—that is; to express them to a concerned and understanding listener–is enough to relieve frustration and make it possible for the frustrated individual to advance to a problem-solving frame of mind, better able to cope with a personal difficulty that is affecting his work adversely. The nondirective approach is one effective way for [[Management|managers]] to deal with frustrated subordinates and co-workers.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Arvid Johnson|title=Management, systems, and society : an introduction|publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co.|location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.|year=1976 |pages=148–142|isbn=978-0-87620-540-2|oclc=2299496|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other more direct and more diagnostic ways that might be used in appropriate circumstances. The great strength of the nondirective approach (nondirective counseling is based on the [[client-centered therapy]] of [[Carl Rogers]]), however, lies in its simplicity, its effectiveness, and the fact that it deliberately avoids the manager-counselor's diagnosing and interpreting emotional problems, which would call for special psychological training. No one has ever been harmed by being listened to sympathetically and understandingly. On the contrary, this approach has helped many people to cope with problems that were interfering with their effectiveness on the job.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

'''Cosmic Bliss''' is a term that originated in [[Buddhism]], but is commonly referred to in various human endeavors, with the meaning of [[wikt:bliss|'bliss']]: ultimate [[contentment]].  For example, cosmic bliss in music could refer to an awe inspiring piece of music, or a very enjoyable music listening session.  In [[Buddhism]], cosmic bliss is a state of being: the state of cosmic bliss.    [[Ānanda]], means [[wikt:bliss|'bliss']] in [[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]] as well as other Indian languages.

'''Cursive script''' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:草書|草書]]|s=草书|p=cǎoshū}}), often mistranslated as '''grass script''', is a [[Chinese script styles|script style]] used in [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese]] and [[East Asian calligraphy]]. Cursive script is faster to write than other styles, but difficult to read for those unfamiliar with it. It functions primarily as a kind of [[shorthand]] script or calligraphic style. People who can read [[Regular script|standard]] or printed forms of Chinese may not be able to comprehend this script.
[[Image:Treatise On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|left|Cursive script in [[Sun Guoting]]'s ''Treatise on Calligraphy''.]]

==Names==
The character 書 (shū) means script in this context, and the character 草 (cǎo) means quick, rough or sloppy. Thus, the name of this script is literally "rough script" or "sloppy script". The same character 草 (cǎo) appears in this sense in the noun "rough draft" (草稿, cǎogǎo), and the verb "to draft [a document or plan]" (草擬, cǎonǐ). The other indirectly related meaning of the character 草 (cǎo) is [[grass]], which has led to the mistranslation{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} "grass script".

==History==
Cursive script originated in China during the [[Han dynasty]] through the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin]] period, in two phases. First, an early form of cursive developed as a cursory way to write the popular and not yet mature [[clerical script]]. Faster ways to write characters developed through four mechanisms: omitting part of a graph, merging strokes together, replacing portions with abbreviated forms (such as one stroke to replace four dots), or modifying stroke styles. This evolution can best be seen on extant [[bamboo]] and wooden slats from the period, on which the use of early cursive and immature clerical forms is intermingled. This early form of cursive script, based on clerical script, is now called zhāngcǎo (章草), and variously also termed ancient cursive, draft cursive or clerical cursive in English, to differentiate it from modern cursive (今草 jīncǎo). Modern cursive evolved from this older cursive in the [[Cao Wei|Wei Kingdom]] to Jin dynasty with influence from the semi-cursive and standard styles.
[[Image:Cur eg.svg|200px|thumb|left|Chinese characters of "Cursive Script" in [[regular script]] (left) and cursive script (right). Notice that for the cursive form, there is only a total of 3 [[Stroke (CJK character)|stroke]]s which is 17 strokes less than its regular counterpart.]]
[[Image:Cursive characters dragon.jpg|thumb|250px|8 different cursive representations of the character 龍 (dragon), from ''Compilation of Cursive Characters'' (《草字彙》), authored by Shi Liang (石梁) of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. The artists are: 1 Sun Guoting; 2, 3 [[Huaisu]]; 4 [[Yan Zhenqing]]; 5 [[Zhao Mengfu]]; 6, 7 [[Zhu Zhishan]]; 8 anonymous.]]

==Styles==
Beside zhāngcǎo and the "modern cursive", there is the "wild cursive" ({{zh|c=[[wikt:狂草|狂草]]| p=kuángcǎo}}, Japanese ''kyōsō'') which is even more cursive and difficult to read. When it was developed by [[Zhang Xu]] and [[Huaisu]] in the [[Tang dynasty]], they were called ''Dian Zhang Zui Su'' (crazy Zhang and drunk Su, 顛張醉素). Cursive, in this style, is no longer significant in legibility but rather in artistry.

Cursive scripts can be divided into the unconnected style (Chinese (S) and Japanese 独草, Chinese (T) 獨草, pinyin ''dúcǎo'', romaji ''dokusō'') where each character is separate, and the connected style (Chinese (S) 连绵, Chinese (T) 連綿, Japanese 連綿体, pinyin ''liánmián'', romaji ''renmentai'') where each character is connected to the succeeding one.

==Derived characters==
Many of the [[simplified Chinese characters]] are modeled on the printed forms of the cursive forms of the corresponding characters ({{zh|t=[[wikt:草書楷化|草書楷化]]|s=[[wikt:草书楷化|草书楷化]]|p=cǎoshūkǎihuà}}).

Cursive script forms of Chinese characters are also the origin of the Japanese [[hiragana]] script. Specifically, the hiragana characters developed from cursive forms of the [[man'yōgana]] script, called ''sōgana'' (草仮名). In Japan, the ''sōgana'' cursive script was considered to be suitable for women's writing, and thus came to be referred to as {{Nihongo|women’s script|女手|onnade}}. This term was later applied to hiragana, as well. In contrast, kanji themselves were referred to as {{Nihongo|men’s script|男手|otokode}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12493">In [[error detection]], the '''Damm algorithm''' is a [[check digit]] [[algorithm]] that detects all [[Transcription error|single-digit errors]] and all [[Transcription error#Transposition error|adjacent transposition errors]]. It was presented by H. Michael Damm in 2004.&lt;ref name="fenwick2014" /&gt;

== Strengths and weaknesses ==
The Damm algorithm is similar to the [[Verhoeff algorithm]]. It too will detect ''all'' occurrences of the two most frequently appearing types of [[transcription error]]s, namely altering one single digit, and transposing two adjacent digits (including the transposition of the trailing check digit and the preceding digit).&lt;ref name="fenwick2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salomon2005" /&gt; But the Damm algorithm has the benefit that it makes do without the dedicatedly constructed [[permutation]]s and its position specific [[Exponentiation#In abstract algebra|powers]] being inherent in the [[Verhoeff algorithm|Verhoeff scheme]]. Furthermore, a table of [[Inverse element|inverses]] can be dispensed with provided all main diagonal entries of the operation table are zero.

The Damm algorithm does not suffer from exceeding the number of 10 possible values, resulting in the need for using a non-digit character (as the [[X]] in the [[ISBN#ISBN-10 check digit calculation|10-digit ISBN]] [[Check digit#ISBN 10|check digit]] scheme).

Prepending leading zeros does not affect the check digit.&lt;ref name="fenwick2014" /&gt;

There are totally anti-symmetric quasigroups that detect all phonetic errors associated with the English language (13 ↔ 30, 14 ↔ 40, ..., 19 ↔ 90). The table used in the illustrating example is based on an instance of such kind.

Despite its desirable properties in typical contexts where similar algorithms are used, the Damm algorithm is largely unknown and scarcely used in practice.

== Design ==

Its essential part is a [[quasigroup]] of [[Order (group theory)|order]] 10 (i.e. having a {{nowrap|10 × 10}} [[Latin square]] as the body of its [[Cayley table|operation table]]) with the special feature of being [[Quasigroup#Total antisymmetry|weakly totally anti-symmetric]].&lt;ref name="dhmd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="damm2007" /&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-roman" name="BIS2003" /&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-roman" name="Chen2009" /&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-roman" name="Mileva2009" /&gt; Damm revealed several methods to create totally anti-symmetric quasigroups of order 10 and gave some examples in his doctoral dissertation.&lt;ref name="dhmd" /&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-roman" name="BIS2003" /&gt; With this, Damm also disproved an old conjecture that totally anti-symmetric quasigroups of order 10 do not exist.&lt;ref name="damm2003" /&gt;

A quasigroup {{math|(''Q'', ∗)}} is called totally anti-symmetric if for all {{math|''c'', ''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''Q''}}, the following implications hold:&lt;ref name="damm2007" /&gt;
# {{math|1=(''c'' ∗ ''x'') ∗ ''y'' = (''c'' ∗ ''y'') ∗ ''x'' ⇒ ''x'' = ''y''}}
# {{math|1=''x'' ∗ ''y'' = ''y'' ∗ ''x'' ⇒ ''x'' = ''y''}},

and it is called weak totally anti-symmetric if only the first implication holds. Damm proved that the existence of a totally anti-symmetric quasigroup of order {{math|''n''}} is equivalent to the existence of a weak totally anti-symmetric quasigroup of order {{math|''n''}}. For the Damm algorithm with the check equation
{{math|1=(…((0 ∗ ''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') ∗ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''−1&lt;/sub&gt;) ∗ …) ∗ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}
a weak totally anti-symmetric quasigroup with the property 
{{math|1=''x'' ∗ ''x'' = 0}}
is needed. Such a quasigroup can be constructed from any totally anti-symmetric quasigroup by rearranging the columns in such a way that all zeros lay on the diagonal. And, on the other hand, from any weak totally anti-symmetric quasigroup a totally anti-symmetric quasigroup can be constructed by rearranging the columns in such a way that the first row is in natural order.&lt;ref name="dhmd" /&gt;

== Algorithm ==
The validity of a digit sequence containing a check digit is defined over a quasigroup. A quasigroup table ready for use can be taken from Damm's dissertation (pages 98, 106, 111).&lt;ref name="dhmd" /&gt; It is useful if each main diagonal entry is 0,&lt;ref name=fenwick2014 /&gt; because it simplifies the check digit calculation.

=== Validating a number against the included check digit ===
#Set up an interim digit and initialize it to 0.
#Process the number digit by digit: Use the number's digit as column index and the interim digit as row index, take the table entry and replace the interim digit with it.
#The number is valid if and only if the resulting interim digit has the value of 0.&lt;ref name=fenwick2014 /&gt;

=== Calculating the check digit ===
'''Prerequisite:''' The main diagonal entries of the table are 0.
#Set up an interim digit and initialize it to 0.
#Process the number digit by digit: Use the number's digit as column index and the interim digit as row index, take the table entry and replace the interim digit with it.
#The resulting interim digit gives the check digit and will be appended as trailing digit to the number.&lt;ref name=fenwick2014 /&gt;

== Example ==
The following operation table will be used.&lt;ref name="fenwick2014" /&gt; It may be obtained from the totally anti-symmetric quasigroup in Damm's doctoral dissertation page 111&lt;ref name="dhmd" /&gt; by rearranging the rows and changing the entries correspondingly.

Suppose we choose the number (digit sequence) '''572'''.

Typically this is used in a government context where an organization that is created by a legitimate government, such as a Board, City, Town or other Public Corporations to allow them to legally function in the name of the constitutional government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10931">'''Dice notation''' (also known as '''dice algebra''', '''common dice notation''', '''RPG dice notation''', and several other titles) is a system to represent different combinations of [[dice]] in [[role-playing games]] using simple [[algebra]]-like notation such as &lt;code&gt;2d6+12&lt;/code&gt;.

== Standard notation ==
[[Image:Roll of 3d6.svg|thumb|[[Probability mass function]] of a roll of 3d6 and [[probability density function]] of the [[normal distribution]] with the same [[mean]] and [[standard deviation]].]]
In most [[role-playing game]]s, die rolls required by the system are given in the form '''''A''d''X'''''.  ''A'' and ''X'' are variables, separated by the letter "d", which stands for ''die'' or ''dice''. The letter "d" is most commonly [[Letter case|lower-case]], but some notation uses upper-case "D"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/dice-play/Notation.htm | title=Standard Dice Notation | publisher=dice-play | date=2006-04-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426013749/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/dice-play/Notation.htm |archivedate=2007-04-26 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (non-English texts can use the equivalent form of the first letter of the given language's word for "dice", but also often use the English "d").

*''A'' is the number of dice to be rolled (usually omitted if 1).
*''X'' is the number of faces of each die.

If the final number is omitted, it is typically assumed to be a six, but in some contexts, other defaults are used.

For example, if a game would call for a roll of &lt;code&gt;d4&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1d4&lt;/code&gt; this would mean, "roll one 4-sided die."

&lt;code&gt;3d6&lt;/code&gt; would mean, "roll three six-sided dice." Commonly, these dice are added together, but some systems could direct the player use them in some other way, such as choosing the best die rolled.

To this basic notation, an additive modifier can be appended, yielding expressions of the form, '''''A''d''X''+''B'''''. The plus is sometimes replaced by a minus sign ("−") to indicate subtraction. ''B'' is a number to be added to the sum of the rolls. So, &lt;code&gt;1d20-10&lt;/code&gt; would indicate a roll of a single 20-sided die with 10 being subtracted from the result. These expressions can also be chained (e.g. &lt;code&gt;2d6+1d8&lt;/code&gt;), though this usage is less common. Additionally, notation such as '''AdX-L''' is not uncommon, the "L" (or "H", less commonly) being used to represent "the lowest result" (or "the highest result"). For instance, ''4d6-L'' means a roll of 4 six-sided dice, dropping the lowest result. This application skews the probability curve towards the higher numbers, as a result a roll of 3 can only occur when all four dice come up 1 (probability 1/1296), while a roll of 18 results if ''any'' three dice are 6 (probability 21/1296 = 7/432).

Rolling three or more dice gives a [[probability distribution]] that is approximately [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], in accordance with the [[central limit theorem]].

== Variations and expansions ==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}

=== Multipliers ===
In some games, the above notation is expanded to allow for a multiplier, as in '''''A''d''X''×''C''''' or '''''C''×d''X''''', where:
*'''×''' denotes multiplication, and can be replaced by "'''/'''" or "÷" for division.
*'''''C''''' is a [[natural number]] (1 if omitted).

For example,
*'''1d6×5''' or '''5×d6''' means "roll one 6-sided die, and multiply the result by 5."
*'''3d6×10+3''' means "roll three 6-sided dice, add them together, multiply the result by 10, and then add 3."

Multiplication can also mean repeating throws of similar setup (usually represented by the letter, '''x''', rather than the multiplication symbol):
*'''3 x (2d6+4)''' means "roll two 6-sided dice adding four to result, repeat the roll 3 times adding the results together."

=== Percentile dice (d%) ===
[[File:D100.jpg|thumb|A typical pair of percentile dice including a "tens" die]]
Often, the variable ''X'' in the above notation will be 100, alternatively written "%".  Although [[Zocchihedron|100-sided dice]]  exist, it is more common to use a combination of two ten-sided dice known as "percentile dice".  One die represents units and the other tens; typically these are distinguished by color, but dice marked with multiples of ten are also available for use as the "tens" die.  Ten-sided dice intended specifically for use as percentile dice typically have no tens notation (the faces are numbered such that there are two complete sequences of 0 through 9).  A roll of 0 on both dice may be interpreted as either 0 or 100, depending on the game rules.

The ''d1000'' (using three 10-sided dice) is occasionally also seen, although it is more common in [[wargaming|wargames]] than role-playing games.

=== Selective results ===
A number of notational strategies exist for discarding only certain types of results.

Some games extend the standard notation to '''''A''d''X''(k''Y'')+''B''''' where, in addition to the above, '''''Y''''' is the number of dice kept ('''k''') from the roll.  Whether the dice omitted are the highest, lowest, or the player's choice depends on the game in question. [[7th Sea (role-playing game)|7th Sea]] and [[Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game|Legend of the Five Rings]] use only 10-sided dice, with notation of the form '''8k6''', meaning "Roll eight ten-sided dice, keep the highest six, and sum them."  Although using a Roll and keep system, [[Cortex Plus]] games all use roll all the dice of different sizes and keep two (normally the two best) although a [[Plot point (role-playing games)|Plot Point]] may be spent to keep an additional dice, and some abilities let you keep a third automatically.

An alternative notation used by the OpenRoleplaying.org die roller allows the use of a plus or minus followed by '''L''' or '''H''' instead of the modifier '''''B''''', to denote dropping or re-adding the lowest or highest roll on a single die, as in 4D6-L, which means roll 4 times a 6-sided dice and drop the lowest value,respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.openroleplaying.org/tools/dieroller/index.cgi |work=OpenRoleplaying.org |title=Die Roller |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031103919/http://www.openroleplaying.org/tools/dieroller/index.cgi |archivedate=2006-10-31 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dice pools ===
{{main|Dice pool}}
[[File:White Fudge Dice.jpg|thumb|[[Fudge (role-playing game system)|Fudge]] dice]]

A number of games including the original [[Ghostbusters (role-playing game)|''Ghostbusters'' role-playing game]], the [[Storyteller system]], and [[Fantasy Flight Games]]' [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Fantasy Flight Games)|Star Wars Roleplaying Games]] use a system where a dice pool consisting of an indicated number of dice are rolled and the total number of dice which meet a fixed condition are recorded as the result. For example, ''[[Vampire: the Requiem]]'' has players roll a pool of ten sided dice and note the number that come up as 8 or higher as "successes". Some companies produce custom dice, marked with successes and failures, for use in games which use this [[game mechanics|mechanic]].

The [[Fudge (role-playing game system)|Fudge role-playing system]] uses a set of dice which are each marked with minus signs, plus signs and blank sides, meaning −1, +1 and 0 respectively. The default is one third of each, usually represented by a six-sided die with two of each, known as dF.2 or just dF. Four of these (4dF) are rolled to determine results from −4 to +4, which is equivalent to 4d3-8. Variants include dF.1, which is a six-sided die with four blanks, one plus and one minus.

=== 6-sided variations ===
Various [[Games Workshop]] systems such as [[Necromunda]] and [[Mordheim]] use an anomalously named D66 roll, meaning d6×10+d6. There are 36 possible results ranging from 11 to 66.  The D66 is a base six variant of the base ten Percentile die (d100). The D66 is generally a combination of two six-sided dice, often made distinguishable from each other by color, or simply one die rolled twice. The first die represents the tens digit, and the second die the ones digit. For example, a roll of 1 followed by a roll of 5 will give a total of 15, while a roll of 3 followed by a roll of 6 will give a total of 36. The mean result of the D66 is 38.5, and the standard deviation about 17.16.

''[[Blood Bowl]]'', also a Games Workshop product, introduces the ''block die'' with special notation '''Xdb''' or ''roll block dice X times, blocker/defender chooses (if more than 1 die)'' with X being one of 3, 2, 1 (usually omitted), -2, -3. Alternatively words for &amp; against can be used to describe a ''Xdb'' (in this case X &gt; 0). As an example ''2db against'' is equal to ''-2db'' which are both short ways of saying ''2 dice block, defender chooses from the results rolled''.

''[[In Nomine (role-playing game)|In Nomine]]'', a game about Angels and Demons from [[Steve Jackson Games]], uses a three-dice variation called the d666.  However, this is actually a combination of 2d6 (for determining success / failure) and 1d6 (for determining degree of success / failure).  The notation of d666 is a reference to [[The Number of the Beast]].

=== 10-sided variations ===
The ''[[Cyborg Commando]]'' role-playing game by [[Gary Gygax]] uses a dice mechanic called '''d10x'''. This is equivalent to '''d10×d10''' and gives a non-linear distribution, with most results concentrated at the lower end of the range. The mean result of '''d10x''' is 30.25 and its standard deviation is about 23.82.

=== Open-ended variations ===

Several games use mechanics that allow one or more dice to be rerolled (often a die that rolls the highest possible number), with each successive roll being added to the total. Terms for this include ''open-ended'' rolling, ''exploding dice'', and ''penetration rolls''.  Games that use such a system include [[Feng Shui (role-playing game)|Feng Shui]], and [[Savage Worlds]].  On Anydice the function to make dice explode on their highest value is called quite simply ''explode''.  Another common notation shorthand for exploding dice is to use an exclamation point: '''AdX!''' or &lt;code&gt;6d6!&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.roll20.net/Dice_Reference&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Storyteller system]] combines exploding dice with a dice pool threshold and target number. [[Diana: Warrior Princess]] explodes all successes, and [[Hackmaster]] uses a variant called ''dice penetration'' by which 1 is subtracted from the total of the rerolled dice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1759">In mathematics, and especially [[general topology]], the '''Euclidean topology''' is the [[natural topology]] induced on [[Euclidean space|Euclidean n-space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean metric]].

In any [[metric space]], the [[Ball_(mathematics)|open balls]] form a [[Base (topology)|base]] for a topology on that space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Metric space|Metric space#Open and closed sets.2C topology and convergence]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Euclidean topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is then simply the topology ''generated'' by these balls. In other words, the open sets of the Euclidean topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; are given by (arbitrary) unions of the open balls &lt;math&gt;B_{r}(p)&lt;/math&gt; defined as &lt;math&gt;B_{r}(p) := \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid d(p,x) &lt; r \}&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;p \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the Euclidean metric.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39859">'''Farmer-managed natural regeneration''' ('''FMNR''') is a low-cost, sustainable [[land restoration]] technique used to combat poverty and hunger amongst poor [[subsistence farmer]]s in developing countries by increasing [[food production|food]] and timber production, and [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] to [[Extremes on Earth|climate extreme]]s. It involves the systematic regeneration and management of [[tree]]s and shrubs from tree stumps, roots and seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983; and Francis, R 2012, Project Manager, Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, World Vision Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
FMNR is especially applicable, but not restricted to, the [[dryland tropics]]. As well as returning degraded [[cropland]]s and [[grazing land]]s to productivity, it can be used to restore degraded forests, thereby reversing [[biodiversity loss]] and reducing vulnerability to [[climate change]]. FMNR can also play an important role in maintaining not-yet-degraded landscapes in a productive state, especially when combined with other [[sustainable land management]] practices such as [[conservation agriculture]] on cropland and holistic management on rangelands.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
FMNR adapts centuries-old methods of woodland management, called [[coppicing]] and [[pollarding]], to produce continuous tree-growth for fuel, building materials, food and fodder without the need for frequent and costly replanting. On farmland, selected trees are trimmed and pruned to maximise growth while promoting optimal growing conditions for annual crops (such as access to water and sunlight).&lt;ref&gt;World Resources Institute (WRI) in collaboration with United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Environment Programme, and World Bank. 2008, Turning Back the Desert: How Farmers Have Transformed Niger's Landscapes and Livelihoods, Chapter 3 in World Resources 2008: Roots of Resilience – Growing the Wealth of the Poor, http://www.wri.org/publication/world-resources-2008-roots-of-resilience.&lt;/ref&gt; When FMNR trees are integrated into crops and grazing pastures there is an increase in [[crop yield]]s, [[soil fertility]] and organic matter, [[soil moisture]] and leaf fodder. There is also a decrease in wind and heat damage, and [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sahel]] region of Africa, FMNR has become a potent tool in increasing [[food security]], resilience and climate change adaptation in poor, subsistence farming communities where much of [[sub-Saharan]] Africa's poverty exists. FMNR is also being promoted in [[East Timor]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Myanmar]].

FMNR complements the evergreen agriculture,&lt;ref&gt;Evergreen Agriculture – the incorporation of trees into crop land and pastures. The three types of evergreen agriculture are: Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, the planting of trees in conventional crop fields, and conservation agriculture with trees. Evergreen agriculture is one of several types of [[agroforestry]].&lt;/ref&gt; conservation agriculture and [[agroforestry]] movements. It is considered a good entry point for resource-poor and risk-averse farmers to adopt a low-cost and low-risk technique. This in turn has acted as a stepping stone to greater agricultural intensification as farmers become more receptive to new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Garrity, D 2012, UNCCD Drylands Ambassador, Distinguished Board Research Fellow and former Director General of the World Agroforestry Centre, Chairman of Landcare International.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Throughout the [[developing world]], immense tracts of farmland, grazing lands and [[forest]]s have become degraded to the point they are no longer productive. [[Deforestation]] continues at an alarming rate. In Africa's drier regions, 74 percent of rangelands and 61 percent of rain-fed croplands are damaged by moderate to very severe [[desertification]]. In some African countries deforestation rates exceed planting rates by 300:1.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, A 1990, The Threatening Desert: Controlling desertification, pp 3, 141, 142, 215, 298, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Degraded land has an extremely detrimental effect on the lives of subsistence farmers who depend on it for their food and livelihoods. Subsistence farmers often make up to 70-80 percent of the population in these regions and they regularly suffer from hunger, malnutrition and even famine as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D, Dettmann, P, Rinaudo, T, Tefera, H and Tofu, A 2010, Poverty Alleviation and Environmental Restoration Using the Clean Development Mechanism: A Case Study from Humbo, Ethiopia, Environmental Management (2011) 48:322–333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrity, D, Akinnifesi, F, Ajayi, O, Weldesemayat, S, Mowo, J, Kalinganire, A, Larwanou, M and Bayala, J 2010, Evergreen Agriculture: a robust approach to sustainable food security in Africa, Food Security (2010) 2:197–214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2007, The Development of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, LEISA Magazine 23.2 June 2007, Ileia Centre for Learning on Sustainable Agriculture, Wageningen, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the Sahel region of Africa, a band of savannah which runs across the continent immediately south of the Sahara Desert, large tracts of once-productive farmland are turning to desert.&lt;ref&gt;Tougiani, A, Guero, C and Rinaudo, T 2008, Community mobilisation for improved livelihoods through tree crop management in Niger, GeoJournal (2009) 74:377–389.&lt;/ref&gt; In tropical regions across the world, where rich soils and good rainfall would normally assure bountiful harvests and fat livestock, some environments have become so degraded they are no longer productive.
Severe famines across the African Sahel in the 1970s and 80s led to a global response, and stopping desertification became a top priority. Conventional methods of raising exotic and indigenous tree species in nurseries were used – planting out, watering, protecting and weeding. However, despite investing millions of dollars and thousands of hours labour, there was little overall impact.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, A 1990, The Threatening Desert: Controlling desertification, p 301, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conventional approaches to reforestation in such harsh environments faced insurmountable problems and were costly and labour-intensive. Once planted out, drought, sand storms, pests, competition from weeds and destruction by people and animals negated efforts. Low levels of community ownership were another inhibiting factor.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2007, The Development of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, LEISA Magazine 23.2 June 2007, Ileia Centre for Learning on Sustainable Agriculture, Wageningen, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing indigenous vegetation was generally dismissed as 'useless bush', and it was often cleared to make way for exotic species. Exotics were planted in fields containing living and sprouting stumps of indigenous vegetation, the presence of which was barely acknowledged, let alone seen as important.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was an enormous oversight. In fact, these living tree stumps are so numerous they constitute a vast 'underground forest' just waiting for some care to grow and provide multiple benefits at little or no cost –and each stump can produce between 10 and 30 stems each. During the process of traditional land preparation, farmers saw the stems as weeds and slashed and burnt them before sowing their food crops. The net result was a barren landscape for much of the year with few mature trees remaining. To the casual observer, the land was turning to desert. Most concluded that there were no trees present and that the only way to reverse the problem was through tree planting.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2007, The Development of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, LEISA Magazine 23.2 June 2007, Ileia Centre for Learning on Sustainable Agriculture, Wageningen, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, established indigenous trees continued to disappear at an alarming rate. In Niger, from the 1930s until 1993, forestry laws took tree ownership and responsibility for the care of trees out of the hands of the people; and even though ineffective and uneconomic, reforestation through conventional tree planting seemed to be the only way to address desertification at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Brough, W and Kimenyi, M 2004, “Desertification” of the Sahel: Exploring the role of property rights, Property and Environment Research Center, Vol 2, No. 2, June 2004, http://perc.org/articles/desertification-sahel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Resources Institute (WRI) in collaboration with United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Environment Programme, and World Bank. 2008, Turning Back the Desert: How Farmers Have Transformed Niger's Landscapes and Livelihoods, Chapter 3 in World Resources 2008: Roots of Resilience – Growing the Wealth of the Poor, http://www.wri.org/publication/world-resources-2008-roots-of-resilience.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2007, The Development of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, LEISA Magazine 23.2 June 2007, Ileia Centre for Learning on Sustainable Agriculture, Wageningen, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and spread==

In the early 1980s, in the Maradi region of the Republic of Niger, the missionary organisation, Serving in Mission (SIM), was unsuccessfully attempting to reforest the surrounding districts using conventional means. In 1983, SIM began experimenting and promoting FMNR amongst about 10 farmers. During the severe famine of 1984, a food-for-work program was introduced that saw some 70,000 people exposed to FMNR and its practice on around 12,500 hectares of farmland. From 1985 to 1999, FMNR continued to be promoted locally and nationally as exchange visits and training days were organised for various NGOs, government foresters, Peace Corps Volunteers and farmer and civil society groups. Additionally, SIM project staff and farmers visited numerous locations across Niger to provide training.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2007, The Development of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, LEISA Magazine 23.2 June 2007, Ileia Centre for Learning on Sustainable Agriculture, Wageningen, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2004 it was ascertained that FMNR was being practiced on over five million hectares or 50 percent of Niger's farmland – an average reforestation rate of 250,000 hectares per year over a 20-year period. This transformation prompted Senior Fellow of the World Resources Institute, Chris Reij to comment that "this is probably the largest positive environmental transformation in the Sahel and perhaps all of Africa”.&lt;ref&gt;World Resources Institute (WRI) in collaboration with United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Environment Programme, and World Bank. 2008, Turning Back the Desert: How Farmers Have Transformed Niger's Landscapes and Livelihoods, Chapter 3 in World Resources 2008: Roots of Resilience – Growing the Wealth of the Poor, http://www.wri.org/publication/world-resources-2008-roots-of-resilience.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hertsgaard, M 2009, Regreening Africa, The Nation, 7 December 2009, http://www.thenation.com/article/regreening-africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2004, World Vision Australia and World Vision Ethiopia initiated a forestry-based carbon sequestration project as a potential means to stimulate community development while engaging in environmental restoration. An innovative partnership with the World Bank, the Humbo Community-based Natural Regeneration Project involved the regeneration of 2,728 hectares of degraded native forests. This brought social, economic and ecological benefits to the participating communities. Within two years, communities were collecting wild fruits, firewood and fodder, and reported that wildlife had begun to return and erosion and flooding had been reduced. In addition, the communities are now receiving payments for the sale of carbon credits through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D, Dettmann, P, Rinaudo, T, Tefera, H and Tofu, A 2010, Poverty Alleviation and Environmental Restoration Using the Clean Development Mechanism: A Case Study from Humbo, Ethiopia, Environmental Management (2011) 48:322–333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank 2012, Ethiopia: Humbo Assisted Natural Regeneration, http://wbcarbonfinance.org/Router.cfm?Page=Projport&amp;ProjID=9625.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the Humbo project, FMNR spread to the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia where 20,000 hectares have been set aside for regeneration, including 10-hectare FMNR model sites for research and demonstration in each of 34 sub-districts.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Government of Ethiopia has committed to reforest 15 million hectares of degraded land using FMNR as part of a climate change and renewable energy plan to become carbon neutral by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;UNDP 2012, Programme document for Ethiopia (2012–2015), www.et.undp.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task...&lt;/ref&gt;

In Talensi, northern Ghana, FMNR is being practiced on 2,000-3,000 hectares and new projects, initiated by World Vision, are introducing FMNR into three new districts. In the Kaffrine and Diourbel regions of Senegal, FMNR has spread across 50,000 hectares in four years.&lt;ref&gt;World Vision Australia Monitoring and Evaluation Reports (internal documents).&lt;/ref&gt; World Vision is also promoting FMNR in Indonesia, Myanmar and East Timor.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also examples of both independently promoted and spontaneous FMNR movements occurring. In Burkina Faso, for example, an increasing part of the country is being transformed into agroforestry parkland. And in Mali, an ageing agroforestry parkland of about 6 million hectares is showing signs of regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;World Agroforestry Center 2012, Improving Sustainable Productivity in Farming Systems and Enhanced Livelihoods through Adoption of Evergreen Agriculture in Eastern Africa, Research Proposal to the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, World Agroforestry Center, Nairobi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reij, C 2012, African Re-greening Initiatives Blog, see http://www.africa-regreening.blogspot.com.au.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key principles==

FMNR depends on the existence of living tree stumps or roots in crop fields, grazing pastures, woodlands or forests. Each season bushy growth will sprout from the stumps/roots often appearing like small shrubs. Continuous grazing by livestock, regular burning and/or regular harvesting for fuel wood results in these 'shrubs' never attaining tree stature. On farmland, standard practice has been for farmers to slash this regrowth in preparation for planting crops, but with a little attention this growth can be turned into a valuable resource without jeopardising, but in fact, enhancing crop yields.&lt;ref&gt;Ndour, B, Sarr, A et Mbaye, A 2010, Projects Baysatol/SFLEI – Rapport d'Activities, Institut Sénégalais de Recherches Agricoles (ISRA), Centre National de Recherches Agronomiques, Replublique du Senegal Ministere de l'Agriculture / World Vision Senegal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrity, D, Akinnifesi, F, Ajayi, O, Weldesemayat, S, Mowo, J, Kalinganire, A, Larwanou, M and Bayala, J 2010, Evergreen Agriculture: a robust approach to sustainable food security in Africa, Food Security (2010) 2:197–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

For each stump, a decision is made as to how many stems will be chosen to grow. The tallest and straightest stems are selected and the remaining stems culled. Best results are obtained when the farmer returns regularly to prune any unwanted new stems and side branches as they appear. Farmers can then grow other crops between and around the trees. When farmers want wood they can cut the stem(s) they want and leave the rest to continue growing. The remaining stems will increase in size and value each year, and will continue to protect the environment. Each time a stem is harvested, a younger stem is selected to replace it.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various naturally occurring tree species can be used which may also provide berries, fruits and nuts or have medicinal qualities. In Niger, commonly used species include: ''[[Strychnos spinosa]]'', ''[[Balanites aegyptiaca]]'', ''[[Boscia senegalensis]]'', ''[[Ziziphus]]'' spp., ''[[Annona senegalensis]]'', ''[[Poupartia birrea]]'' and ''[[Faidherbia albida]]''. However, the most important determinants are whatever species are locally available, their ability to re-sprout after cutting, and the value local people place on those species.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Faidherbia albida'', also known as the 'fertiliser tree', is popular for intercropping across the Sahel as it fixes nitrogen into the soil, provides fodder for livestock, and shade for crops and livestock. By shedding its leaves in the wet season, ''Faidherbia'' provides beneficial light shade to crops when high temperatures would otherwise damage crops or retard growth. Leaf fall contributes useful nutrients and organic matter to the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Garrity, D, Akinnifesi, F, Ajayi, O, Weldesemayat, S, Mowo, J, Kalinganire, A, Larwanou, M and Bayala, J 2010, Evergreen Agriculture: a robust approach to sustainable food security in Africa, Food Security (2010) 2:197–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of FMNR is not confined to croplands. It is being practised on grazing land and in degraded communal forests as well. When there are no living stumps, seeds of naturally occurring species are used. In reality, there is no fixed way of practising FMNR and farmers are free to choose which species they will leave, the density of trees they prefer, and the timing and method of pruning.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
[[File:FMNR example 1.png|thumbnail|centre]]
FMNR depends on the existence of living tree stumps, tree roots and seeds to be re-vegetated.  These can be in crop fields, grazing lands or degraded forests. New stems, which sprout from these stumps and tree roots, can be selected and pruned for improved growth. Sprouting tree stumps and roots may look like shrubs and are often ignored or even slashed by farmers or foresters. However, with culling of excess stems and by selecting and pruning of the best stems, the re-growth has enormous potential to rapidly grow into trees.

[[File:FMNR example 2.jpeg|thumbnail|centre]]Seemingly treeless fields may contain seeds and living tree stumps and roots which have the ability to sprout new stems and regenerate trees. Even this 'bare' millet field in West Africa contains hundreds of living stumps per hectare which are buried beneath the surface like an underground forest.

[[File:FMNR 3 example.png|thumbnail|centre]] '''Step 1.''' Do not automatically slash all tree growth, but survey your farm noting how many and what species of trees are present.
'''
[[File:FMNR example 4.png|thumbnail|center]] '''Step 2'''. Select the stumps which will be used for regeneration.

[[File:FMNR example 5.png|thumbnail|center]] '''Step 3'''. Select the best five or so stems and cull unwanted ones. This way, when you want wood you can cut the stem(s) that are needed and leave the rest to continue growing. These remaining stems will increase in size and value each year, and will continue to protect the environment and provide other useful materials and services such as fodder, humus, habitat for useful pest predators and protection from the wind and sun. Each time one stem is harvested, a younger stem is selected to replace it.

[[File:FMNR example 6.png|thumbnail|center]] Tag selected stems with a coloured rag or paint. Work with the whole community to draw up and agree on laws which will protect the trees being pruned and respect each person's rights. Where possible, include government forestry staff and local authorities in planning and decision making.

==Benefits==

FMNR can restore degraded farmlands, pastures and forests by increasing the quantity and value of woody vegetation, by increasing biodiversity and by improving soil structure and fertility through leaf litter and nutrient cycling. The reforestation also retards wind and water erosion; it creates wind-breaks which decrease soil moisture evaporation, and protects crops and livestock against searing winds and temperatures. Often, dried up springs reappear and the water table rises towards historic levels; insect eating predators including insects, spiders and birds return, helping to keep crop pests in check; the trees can be a source of edible berries and nuts; and over time the biodiversity of plant and animal life is increased.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2007, The Development of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, LEISA Magazine 23.2 June 2007, Ileia Centre for Learning on Sustainable Agriculture, Wageningen, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Vision Australia 2012, Turning 'Deserts' into Food Bowls by Releasing the Underground Forest – Latest developments in Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, internal briefing paper, World Vision Australia, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt; FMNR can be used to combat deforestation and desertification and can also be an important tool in maintaining the integrity and productivity of land that is not yet degraded.

Trials, long-running programs and anecdotal data indicate that FMNR can at least double crop yields on low fertility soils.&lt;ref&gt;Ndour, B, Sarr, A et Mbaye, A 2010, Projects Baysatol/SFLEI – Rapport d'Activities, Institut Sénégalais de Recherches Agricoles (ISRA), Centre National de Recherches Agronomiques, Replublique du Senegal Ministere de l'Agriculture / World Vision Senegal.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sahel, high numbers of livestock and an eight-month dry season can mean that pastures are completely depleted before the rains commence. However, with the presence of trees, grazing animals can make it through the dry season by feeding on tree leaves and seed pods of some species, at a time when no other fodder is available.&lt;ref&gt;Reij, C, Tappan, G, and Smale, M 2009. Re-Greening the Sahel: Farmer-led innovation in Burkina Faso and Niger, Chapter 7 in: Spielman, D, Pandya-Lorch, R (eds): Millions Fed – proven successes in agricultural development, International Food Policy Research Institute, US, pp 53-58, see http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/oc64ch07.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Vision Australia 2012, Turning 'Deserts' into Food Bowls by Releasing the Underground Forest – Latest developments in Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, internal briefing paper, World Vision Australia, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt; In north east Ghana, more grass became available with the introduction of FMNR because communities worked together to prevent bush fires from destroying their trees.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Well designed and executed FMNR projects can act as catalysts to empower communities as they  negotiate land ownership or user rights for the trees in their care. This assists with self-organisation, and with the development of new agriculture-based micro-enterprises (e.g. selling firewood, timber and handcrafts made from timber or woven grasses).&lt;ref&gt;World Vision Australia 2012, Turning 'Deserts' into Food Bowls by Releasing the Underground Forest – Latest developments in Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, internal briefing paper, World Vision Australia, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional approaches to reversing desertification, such as funding tree planting, rarely spread beyond the project boundary once external funding is withdrawn. By comparison, FMNR is cheap, rapid, locally led and implemented. It uses local skills and resources – the poorest farmers can learn by observation and teach their neighbours. Given an enabling environment, or at least the absence of a 'disabling' environment, FMNR can be done at scale and spread well beyond the original target area without ongoing government or NGO intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

World Vision evaluations of FMNR conducted in Senegal and Ghana in 2011 and 2012 found that households practising FMNR were less vulnerable to extreme weather shocks such as drought and damaging rain and wind storms.&lt;ref&gt;Diagne, M 2012, Evaluation Finale du Projet Beysatol, World Vision Senegal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weston, P and Hong, R 2012, End-of-Phase Evaluation Report: Talensi FMNR Project, World Vision Australia / World Vision Ghana.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table summarises FMNR's benefits which fit the sustainable development model of economic, social and environmental benefits:

==Key success factors and constraints==

While there are numerous accounts of the uptake and spread of FMNR independent of aid and development agencies, the following factors have been found to be beneficial for its introduction and spread: 
	
* Awareness creation of FMNR's potential.
* Capacity building through workshops and exchange visits.
* Awareness of the devastating effects of deforestation. The adoption of FMNR is more likely when communities acknowledge their situation and the need to take action. This perception of need can be supported by education.
* An FMNR champion/facilitator from within the community who encourages, challenges and trains peers. This is critical during the first three to five years, and continues to be important for up to 10 years. Regular site visits also ensure early detection and remedial action on resistance and threats to FMNR through deliberate damage to trees and theft.
* The buy-in of all stakeholders including their agreement on any by-laws created for FMNR and the consequences for infringements. Stakeholders include FMNR practitioners, local, regional and national government departments of agriculture and forestry, men, women, youth, marginalised groups (including nomadic herders), cultivators and commercial interests.
* Stakeholder buy-in is also important to create a critical mass of FMNR adopters in order to change social attitudes from a position of apathy or active participation in deforestation to one of proactive sustainable tree management through FMNR.
* Government support through the creation of favourable policies, [[positive reinforcement]] of actions facilitating the spread of FMNR, and disincentives for actions working against the spread of FMNR. FMNR practitioners need to be confident that they will benefit from their labours (either private or community ownership of trees, or legally binding user rights). 
* Reinforcement of existing organisational structures (farmers clubs, development groups, traditional leadership structures) or establishment of new structures which will provide a framework for communities to practise FMNR on a local, district or region-wide basis.
* A communications strategy which includes education in schools, radio programs and engagement with religious and traditional leaders to become advocates.
* Establishment of a legal, transparent and accessible market for FMNR wood and non-timber forest products, enabling practitioners to benefit financially from their activities.

Brown et al. suggest that the two main reasons why FMNR has spread so widely in Niger are attitudinal change by the community of what constitutes good land management practices, and farmers' ownership of trees.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D, Dettmann, P, Rinaudo, T, Tefera, H and Tofu, A 2010, Poverty Alleviation and Environmental Restoration Using the Clean Development Mechanism: A Case Study from Humbo, Ethiopia, Environmental Management (2011) 48:322–333.&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers need the assurance that they will benefit from their labour. Giving farmers either outright ownership of the trees they protect, or tree-user rights, has made it possible for large-scale farmer-led reforestation to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaudo, T 2012, Natural Resources Advisor, World Vision Australia and pioneer of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration in Niger in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current and future directions==

Over nearly 30 years, FMNR has changed the farming landscape in some of the poorest countries in the world, including parts of Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal, providing subsistence farmers with the methods necessary to become more food secure and resilient against severe weather events.&lt;ref&gt;Reij, C, Tappan, G, and Smale, M 2009. Re-Greening the Sahel: Farmer-led innovation in Burkina Faso and Niger, Chapter 7 in: Spielman, D, Pandya-Lorch, R (eds): Millions Fed – proven successes in agricultural development, International Food Policy Research Institute, US, pp 53-58, see http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/oc64ch07.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hertsgaard, M 2011, The Great Green Wall: African Farmers Beat Back Drought and Climate Change with Trees – A quiet, green miracle has been growing in the Sahel, excerpt from Hertsgaard, M 2011, Hot: Living Through the Next 50 Years on Earth, publ Houghton Miflin Harcourt in Scientific American 28 January 2011, see http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=farmers-in-sahel-beat-back-drought-and-climate-change-with-trees.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011–12 food crisis in East Africa gave a stark reminder of the importance of addressing root causes of hunger. In the 2011 State of the World Report, Bunch concludes that four major factors – lack of sustainable fertile land, loss of traditional fallowing, cost of fertiliser and climate change – are coming together all at once in a sort of “perfect storm” that will almost surely result in an African famine of unprecedented proportions, probably within the next four to five years. It will most heavily affect the lowland, semi-arid to sub-humid areas of Africa (including the Sahel, parts of eastern Africa, plus a band from Malawi across to Angola and Namibia); and unless the world does something dramatic, 10 to 30 million people could die from famine between 2015 and 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, R 2011, Africa's Soil Fertility Crisis and the Coming Famine, Chapter 6 in the Worldwatch Institute report State of the World 2011: Innovations that Nourish the Planet, see http://www.worldwatch.org/sow11.&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration of degraded land through FMNR is one way of addressing these major contributors to hunger.

In recent years FMNR has come to the attention of global development agencies and grass roots movements alike. The World Bank, World Resources Institute, World Agroforestry Center, USAID and the [[Permaculture]] movement are amongst those either actively promoting or advocating for the uptake of FMNR and FMNR has received recognition from a number of quarters including:

* In 2010, FMNR won the Interaction 4 Best Practice and Innovation Initiative award in recognition of high technical standards and effectiveness in addressing the food security and livelihood needs of small producers in the areas of natural resource management and agro forestry.  
* In 2011, FMNR won the World Vision International Global Resilience Award for the most innovative initiative in the area of resilient development practice and natural environment and climate issues.  
* In 2012 FMNR won the Arbor Day Award for Education Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;2012 Arbor Day Awards, Nebraska City, US, see http://www.arborday.org/programs/awards/2012/?award=Education%20Innovation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, World Vision Australia – in partnership with the World Agroforestry Center and World Vision East Africa – held an international conference in Nairobi called Beating Famine to analyse and plan how to improve food security for the world's poor through the use of FMNR and Evergreen Agriculture. The conference was attended by more than 200 participants, including world leaders in sustainable agriculture, five East African ministers of agriculture and the environment, ambassadors and other government representatives from Africa, Europe and Australia, and leaders from non-government and international organisations.

Two major outcomes of the conference were:
# The establishment of a global FMNR network of key stakeholders to promote, encourage and initiate the scale-up of FMNR globally.
# Country, regional and global level plans as a basis for inter-organisation collaboration for FMNR scale-up.

The conference acted as a catalyst for media coverage of FMNR in some of the world's leading outlets and a noticeable increase in momentum for an FMNR global movement. This heightened awareness of FMNR has created an opportunity for it to spread exponentially worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, R 2012, Project Manager, Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, World Vision Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guardian/Observer 26 August 2012, Africa innovations: 15 ideas helping to transform a continent, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/26/africa-innovations-transform-continent; ABC Lateline 9 July 2012, Reforestation project adds hope to food crisis, Reporter Ginny Stein, http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2012/s3542254.htm; PBS Newshour 12 July 2012, Amidst Drought and Famine, Niger Leads West Africa in Addressing Crisis, https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/july-dec12/niger_07-12.html; Der Spiegel Online 18 June 2012, Begrünung in der Sahelzone – Mister Rinaudo will die Wüste, Aus Nairobi berichtet Horand Knaup, http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/sahelzone-fmnr-soll-ausbreitung-der-wueste-stoppen-a-838840.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

World Vision and the World Agroforestry Centrer are currently exploring opportunities for conducting conferences and workshops in new regions where FMNR is not yet established in order to stimulate further awareness and adoption.

In [[continuum mechanics]], the '''finite strain theory'''—also called '''large strain theory''', or '''large deformation theory'''—deals with [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformations]] in which strains and/or rotations are large enough to invalidate assumptions inherent in [[infinitesimal strain theory]].  In this case, the undeformed and deformed configurations of the continuum are significantly different, requiring a clear distinction between them. This is commonly the case with [[elastomer]]s, [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically-deforming]] materials and other [[fluid]]s and [[Biology|biological]] [[soft tissue]].

==Displacement==

[[File:Displacement of a continuum.svg|400px|right|thumb|Figure 1. Motion of a continuum body.]]
The displacement of a body has two components: a [[rigid body|rigid-body]] displacement and a deformation.
* A rigid-body displacement consists of a simultaneous [[translation (physics)]] and rotation of the body without changing its shape or size.
* Deformation implies the change in shape and/or size of the body from an initial or undeformed configuration &lt;math&gt;\kappa_0(\mathcal B)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to a current or deformed configuration &lt;math&gt;\kappa_t(\mathcal B)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 1).

A change in the configuration of a continuum body can be described by a [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacement field]]. A ''displacement field'' is a [[vector field]] of all displacement vectors for all particles in the body, which relates the deformed configuration with the undeformed configuration. The distance between any two particles changes if and only if deformation has occurred. If displacement occurs without deformation, then it is a rigid-body displacement.

===Material coordinates (Lagrangian description)===

The displacement of particles indexed by variable {{math|i}} may be expressed as follows. The vector joining the positions of a particle in the undeformed configuration &lt;math&gt;P_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and deformed configuration &lt;math&gt;p_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[displacement (vector)|displacement vector]]. Using &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;P_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;p_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, both of which are vectors from the origin of the coordinate system to each respective point, we have the [[Continuum mechanics#Lagrangian description|Lagrangian description]] of the displacement vector:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u(\mathbf X,t)=u_i\mathbf e_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the orthonormal [[unit vectors]] that define the [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the spatial (lab-frame) coordinate system.

Expressed in terms of the material coordinates, the displacement field is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u(\mathbf X,t) = \mathbf b(t)+\mathbf x(\mathbf X,t) - \mathbf X \qquad \text{or}\qquad u_i = \alpha_{iJ}b_J + x_i - \alpha_{iJ}X_J\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf b(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement vector representing rigid-body translation.

The [[partial derivative]] of the displacement vector with respect to the material coordinates yields the ''material displacement gradient tensor'' &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u &amp;= \nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf x - \mathbf I = \mathbf F - \mathbf I \qquad &amp;\text{or}&amp; \qquad  \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X_K} =\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial X_K}-\delta_{iK} = F_{iK} - \delta_{iK}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Finite strain theory#Deformation gradient tensor|''deformation gradient tensor'']].

===Spatial coordinates (Eulerian description)===

In the [[Continuum mechanics#Eulerian description|Eulerian description]], the vector extending from a particle &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the undeformed configuration to its location in the deformed configuration is called the [[displacement (vector)|displacement vector]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf U(\mathbf x,t)=U_J\mathbf E_J\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the unit vectors that define the basis of the material (body-frame) coordinate system.

Expressed in terms of spatial coordinates, the displacement field is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf U(\mathbf x,t) = \mathbf b(t)+\mathbf x - \mathbf X(\mathbf x,t) \qquad \text{or}\qquad U_J = b_J + \alpha_{Ji}x_i - X_J \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The partial derivative of the displacement vector with respect to the spatial coordinates yields the ''spatial displacement gradient tensor'' &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf U\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf U &amp;= \mathbf I - \nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf X = \mathbf I -\mathbf F^{-1} \qquad &amp;\text{or}&amp; \qquad  \frac{\partial U_J}{\partial x_k}  = \delta_{Jk}-\frac{\partial X_J}{\partial x_k} = \delta_{Jk} - F^{-1}_{Jk} \,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Relationship between the material and spatial coordinate systems===

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{Ji}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the [[direction cosine]]s between the material and spatial coordinate systems with unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_J\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_J \cdot \mathbf e_i = \alpha_{Ji}=\alpha_{iJ}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship between &lt;math&gt;u_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;U_J\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;u_i=\alpha_{iJ}U_J \qquad \text{or} \qquad U_J=\alpha_{Ji}u_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i = \alpha_{iJ}\mathbf E_J\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u(\mathbf X,t)=u_i\mathbf e_i=u_i(\alpha_{iJ}\mathbf E_J)=U_J\mathbf E_J=\mathbf U(\mathbf x,t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Combining the coordinate systems of deformed and undeformed configurations===

It is common to superimpose the coordinate systems for the deformed and undeformed configurations, which results in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf b=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;,  and the direction cosines become [[Kronecker delta]]s, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_J \cdot \mathbf e_i = \delta_{Ji}=\delta_{iJ}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus in material (undeformed) coordinates, the displacement may be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u(\mathbf X,t) = \mathbf x(\mathbf X,t) - \mathbf X \qquad \text{or}\qquad u_i = x_i - \delta_{iJ}X_J\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

And in spatial (deformed) coordinates, the displacement may be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf U(\mathbf x,t) = \mathbf x - \mathbf X(\mathbf x,t) \qquad \text{or}\qquad U_J = \delta_{Ji}x_i - X_J \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Deformation gradient tensor==
[[File:Deformation.png|400px|right|thumb|Figure 2. Deformation of a continuum body.]]
The deformation gradient tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F(\mathbf X,t)=F_{jK}\mathbf e_j\otimes\mathbf I_K\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is related to both the reference and current configuration, as seen by the unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_K\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, therefore it is a ''[[two-point tensor]]''.

Due to the assumption of continuity of &lt;math&gt;\chi(\mathbf X,t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has the inverse &lt;math&gt;\mathbf H= \mathbf F^{-1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf H\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the ''spatial deformation gradient tensor''. Then, by the [[implicit function theorem]],&lt;ref name=Lubliner2008&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] determinant &lt;math&gt;J(\mathbf X,t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must be [[nonsingular]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;J(\mathbf X,t)=\det \mathbf F(\mathbf X,t)\neq 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The ''material deformation gradient tensor'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F(\mathbf X,t)=F_{jK}\mathbf e_j\otimes\mathbf I_K\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Tensor#Tensor rank|second-order tensor]] that represents the gradient of the mapping function or functional relation &lt;math&gt;\chi(\mathbf X,t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the [[Continuum mechanics|motion of a continuum]]. The material deformation gradient tensor characterizes the local deformation at a material point with position vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. deformation at neighbouring points, by transforming ([[linear transformation]]) a material line element emanating from that point from the reference configuration to the current or deformed configuration, assuming continuity in the mapping function &lt;math&gt;\chi(\mathbf X,t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. [[differentiable function]] of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf {X} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; and time &lt;math&gt;t\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that [[Fracture|crack]]s and voids do not open or close during the deformation. Thus we have,

:&lt;math&gt; 
  \begin{align}
    d\mathbf{x} &amp;=\frac {\partial \mathbf{x}} {\partial \mathbf {X}}\,d\mathbf{X} 
                  \qquad &amp;\text{or}&amp; \qquad 
    dx_j =\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\,dX_K \\
                &amp;= \nabla \chi(\mathbf X,t) \,d\mathbf{X} = \mathbf F(\mathbf X,t) \,d\mathbf{X} 
                  \qquad &amp;\text{or}&amp; \qquad 
    dx_j =F_{jK}\,dX_K \,.
  \end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Relative displacement vector===

Consider a [[Continuum mechanics|particle or material point]] &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with position vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X=X_I\mathbf I_I\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the undeformed configuration (Figure 2). After a displacement of the body, the new position of the particle indicated by &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the new configuration is given by the vector position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=x_i\mathbf e_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The coordinate systems for the undeformed and deformed configuration can be superimposed for convenience.

Consider now a material point &lt;math&gt;Q \,\!&lt;/math&gt; neighboring &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, with position vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}+ \Delta \mathbf{X}=(X_I+\Delta X_I)\mathbf I_I\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. In the deformed configuration this particle has a new position &lt;math&gt;q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; given by the position vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}+ \Delta \mathbf{x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that the line segments &lt;math&gt;\Delta X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; joining the particles &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in both the undeformed and deformed configuration, respectively, to be very small, then we can express them as &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Thus from Figure 2 we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{x}+ d\mathbf{x}&amp;= \mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{X}+\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{X}) \\
d\mathbf{x} &amp;= \mathbf{X}-\mathbf{x}+d\mathbf{X}+\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{X}) \\
 &amp;= d\mathbf{X}+\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{X})-\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}) \\
 &amp;= d\mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{u} \\
\end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {du}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the '''relative displacement vector''', which represents the relative displacement of &lt;math&gt;Q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the deformed configuration.

====Taylor approximation====

For an infinitesimal element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and assuming continuity on the displacement field, it is possible to use a [[Taylor series expansion]] around point &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, neglecting higher-order terms, to approximate the components of the relative displacement vector for the neighboring particle &lt;math&gt;Q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{X})&amp;=\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X})+d\mathbf{u} \quad &amp; \text{or} &amp; \quad u_i^* = u_i+du_i \\
&amp;\approx \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X})+\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\cdot d\mathbf X \quad &amp; \text{or} &amp; \quad u_i^* \approx u_i+\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X_J}dX_J \,.
\end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the previous equation &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x= d\mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{u}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\mathbf x&amp;=d\mathbf X+d\mathbf u \\
&amp;=d\mathbf X+\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\cdot d\mathbf X\\
&amp;=\left(\mathbf I + \nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\right)d\mathbf X\\
&amp;=\mathbf F d\mathbf X
\end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Time-derivative of the deformation gradient ===
Calculations that involve the time-dependent deformation of a body often require a time derivative of the deformation gradient to be calculated.  A geometrically consistent definition of such a derivative requires an excursion into [[differential geometry]]&lt;ref name=Yavari&gt;A. Yavari, J.E. Marsden, and M. Ortiz, On spatial and material covariant balance laws in elasticity, Journal of Mathematical Physics, 47, 2006, 042903; pp. 1–53.&lt;/ref&gt; but we avoid those issues in this article.

The time derivative of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \dot{\mathbf{F}} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{F}}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left[\frac{\partial \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X}, t)}{\partial \mathbf{X}}\right] = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{X}}\left[\frac{\partial \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X}, t)}{\partial t}\right] = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{X}}\left[\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{X}, t)\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity.  The derivative on the right hand side represents a '''material velocity gradient'''. It is common to convert that into a spatial gradient, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \dot{\mathbf{F}} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{X}}\left[\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{X}, t)\right] = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{x}}\left[\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{X},t)\right]\cdot\frac{\partial \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X}, t)}{\partial \mathbf{X}}
   = \boldsymbol{l}\cdot\mathbf{F}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{l}&lt;/math&gt; is the '''spatial velocity gradient'''.  If the spatial velocity gradient is constant, the above equation can be solved exactly to give
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{F} = e^{\boldsymbol{l}\, t}
 &lt;/math&gt;
assuming &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{1}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  There are several methods of computing the [[matrix exponential|exponential]] above.

Related quantities often used in continuum mechanics are the '''rate of deformation tensor''' and the '''spin tensor''' defined, respectively, as:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{d} = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(\boldsymbol{l} + \boldsymbol{l}^T\right) \,,~~
  \boldsymbol{w} = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(\boldsymbol{l} - \boldsymbol{l}^T\right) \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The rate of deformation tensor gives the rate of stretching of line elements while the spin tensor indicates the rate of rotation or [[vorticity]] of the motion.

==Transformation of a surface and volume element==

To transform quantities that are defined with respect to areas in a deformed configuration to those relative to areas in a reference configuration, and vice versa, we use Nanson's relation, expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
  da~\mathbf{n} = J~dA~\mathbf{F}^{-T}\cdot \mathbf{N}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;da\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is an area of a region in the deformed configuration, &lt;math&gt;dA\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the same area in the reference configuration, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the outward normal to the area element in the current configuration while &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the outward normal in the reference configuration, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[deformation gradient]], and &lt;math&gt;J = \det\mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The corresponding formula for the transformation of the volume element is 
:&lt;math&gt;
  dv = J~dV 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of Nanson's relation (see also &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owens|first1=Eduardo de Souza Neto, Djordje Peric, David|title=Computational methods for plasticity : theory and applications|date=2008|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|isbn=978-0-470-69452-7|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
|-
|To see how this formula is derived, we start with the oriented area elements
in the reference and current configurations:
:&lt;math&gt;
  d\mathbf{A} = dA~\mathbf{N} ~;~~ d\mathbf{a} = da~\mathbf{n}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The reference and current volumes of an element are
:&lt;math&gt;
  dV = d\mathbf{A}^{T}\cdot d\mathbf{L} ~;~~ dv = d\mathbf{a}^{T} \cdot d\mathbf{l}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{l} = \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{L}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
 d\mathbf{a}^{T} \cdot d\mathbf{l}= dv = J~dV = J~d\mathbf{A}^{T}\cdot d\mathbf{L}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or,
:&lt;math&gt;
    d\mathbf{a}^{T} \cdot \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{L} = dv = J~dV = J~d\mathbf{A}^{T}\cdot d\mathbf{L}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
so,
:&lt;math&gt;
   d\mathbf{a}^{T} \cdot \mathbf{F} = J~d\mathbf{A}^{T}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
So we get
:&lt;math&gt;
  d\mathbf{a} = J~\mathbf{F}^{-T} \cdot d\mathbf{A}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or,
:&lt;math&gt;
  da~\mathbf{n} = J~dA~\mathbf{F}^{-T}\cdot \mathbf{N}\qquad \qquad \square
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor==
[[File:Polar decomposition of F.png|400px|right|thumb|Figure 3. Representation of the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient]]

The deformation gradient &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, like any invertible second-order tensor, can be decomposed, using the [[polar decomposition]] theorem, into a product of two second-order tensors (Truesdell and Noll, 1965): an orthogonal tensor and a positive definite symmetric tensor, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{R}\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{V} \mathbf{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where the tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a [[proper orthogonal tensor]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^{-1}= \mathbf R^T\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\det \mathbf R=+1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, representing a rotation; the tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the ''right stretch tensor''; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; the ''left stretch tensor''. The terms ''right'' and ''left'' means that they are to the right and left of the rotation tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are both [[positive-definite matrix|positive definite]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x\cdot\mathbf U \cdot \mathbf x\ge 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x\cdot\mathbf V \cdot \mathbf x\ge 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x \in \mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt;, and [[symmetric tensor]]s, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf U=\mathbf U^T\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf V=\mathbf V^T\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, of second order.

This decomposition implies that the deformation of a line element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the undeformed configuration onto &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the deformed configuration, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x=\mathbf F \,d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, may be obtained either by first stretching the element by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf U\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x'=\mathbf U \,d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, followed by a rotation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x=\mathbf R \,d\mathbf x'\,\!&lt;/math&gt;; or equivalently, by applying a rigid rotation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R\,\!&lt;/math&gt; first, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x'=\mathbf R \,d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, followed later by a stretching &lt;math&gt;\mathbf V\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x=\mathbf V \,d\mathbf x'\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (See Figure 3).

Due to the orthogonality of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf V=\mathbf R\cdot\mathbf U \cdot \mathbf R^T\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

so that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf U\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf V\,\!&lt;/math&gt; have the same [[eigenvalues]] or ''principal stretches'', but different [[eigenvectors]] or ''principal directions'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The principal directions are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_i = \mathbf{R} \mathbf{N}_i. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This polar decomposition, which is unique as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is invertible with a positive determinant, is a corrolary of the [[singular-value decomposition]].

==Deformation tensors==
Several rotation-independent deformation tensors are used in mechanics.  In solid mechanics, the most popular of these are the right and left Cauchy–Green deformation tensors.

Since a pure rotation should not induce any strains in a deformable body, it is often convenient to use rotation-independent measures of deformation in [[continuum mechanics]]. As a rotation followed by its inverse rotation leads to no change (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\mathbf{R}^T=\mathbf{R}^T\mathbf{R}=\mathbf{I}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) we can exclude the rotation by multiplying &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; by its [[transpose]].

===The right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor===
In 1839, [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]] introduced a deformation tensor known as the ''right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor'' or ''Green's deformation tensor'',  defined as:&lt;ref name=note1&gt;The [[IUPAC]] recommends that this tensor be called the Cauchy strain tensor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IUPAC&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. Kaye, R. F. T. Stepto, W. J. Work, J. V. Aleman (Spain), A. Ya. Malkin|year=1998|title=Definition of terms relating to the non-ultimate mechanical properties of polymers|journal= Pure Appl. Chem.|volume= 70|issue=3|pages=701–754|url=http://old.iupac.org/reports/1998/7003kaye/index.html|doi=10.1351/pac199870030701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf C=\mathbf F^T\mathbf F=\mathbf U^2 \qquad \text{or} \qquad C_{IJ}=F_{kI}~F_{kJ} = \frac {\partial x_k} {\partial X_I} \frac {\partial x_k} {\partial X_J}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Physically, the Cauchy–Green tensor gives us the square of local change in distances due to deformation, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x^2=d\mathbf X\cdot\mathbf C \cdot d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Invariants of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are often used in the expressions for [[strain energy density function]]s.  The most commonly used [[Invariants of tensors|invariants]] are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
     I_1^C &amp; := \text{tr}(\mathbf{C}) = C_{II} = \lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \lambda_3^2 \\
     I_2^C &amp; := \tfrac{1}{2}\left[(\text{tr}~\mathbf{C})^2 - \text{tr}(\mathbf{C}^2) \right]
       = \tfrac{1}{2}\left[(C_{JJ})^2 - C_{IK}C_{KI}\right] = \lambda_1^2\lambda_2^2 + \lambda_2^2\lambda_3^2 + \lambda_3^2\lambda_1^2 \\
     I_3^C &amp; := \det(\mathbf{C}) = \lambda_1^2\lambda_2^2\lambda_3^2.
  \end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are stretch ratios for the unit fibers that are initially oriented along the eigenvector directions of the right (reference) stretch tensor (these are not generally aligned with the three axis of the coordinate systems).

===The Finger deformation tensor===
The [[IUPAC]] recommends&lt;ref name=IUPAC/&gt; that the inverse of the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor (called the Cauchy tensor in that document), i. e.,  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf C^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, be called the '''Finger tensor'''.  However, that nomenclature is not universally accepted in applied mechanics.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}=\mathbf C^{-1}=\mathbf F^{-1}\mathbf F^{-T} \qquad \text{or} \qquad f_{IJ}=\frac {\partial X_I} {\partial x_k} \frac {\partial X_J} {\partial x_k}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===The left Cauchy–Green or Finger deformation tensor===
Reversing the order of multiplication in the formula for the right Green–Cauchy deformation tensor leads to the ''left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor'' which is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf B=\mathbf F\mathbf F^T=\mathbf V^2 \qquad \text{or} \qquad B_{ij}=\frac {\partial x_i} {\partial X_K} \frac {\partial x_j} {\partial X_K}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor is often called the ''Finger deformation tensor'', named after [[Josef Finger]] (1894).&lt;ref name=IUPAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo N. Dvorkin, Marcela B. Goldschmit, 2006 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MVqa05_2QmAC&amp;pg=PA25 Nonlinear Continua], p. 25, Springer {{ISBN|3-540-24985-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=note2&gt;The [[IUPAC]] recommends that this tensor be called the Green strain tensor.&lt;/ref&gt;

Invariants of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are also used in the expressions for [[strain energy density function]]s.  The conventional invariants are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  I_1 &amp; := \text{tr}(\mathbf{B}) = B_{ii} = \lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \lambda_3^2\\
  I_2 &amp; := \tfrac{1}{2}\left[(\text{tr}~\mathbf{B})^2 - \text{tr}(\mathbf{B}^2)\right]
        = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(B_{ii}^2 - B_{jk}B_{kj}\right) = \lambda_1^2\lambda_2^2 + \lambda_2^2\lambda_3^2 + \lambda_3^2\lambda_1^2 \\
  I_3 &amp; := \det\mathbf{B} = J^2 = \lambda_1^2\lambda_2^2\lambda_3^2
  \end{align}
 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;J:=\det\mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the determinant of the deformation gradient.

For incompressible materials, a slightly different set of invariants is used:
:&lt;math&gt;
    (\bar{I}_1 := J^{-2/3} I_1 ~;~~ \bar{I}_2 := J^{-4/3} I_2 ~;~~ J=1) ~.
 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===The Cauchy deformation tensor===
Earlier in 1828,&lt;ref&gt;Jirásek,Milan;  Bažant, Z. P. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8mz-xPdvH00C&amp;pg=PA463 Inelastic analysis of structures], Wiley, p. 463 {{ISBN|0-471-98716-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] introduced a deformation tensor defined as  the inverse of the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf B^{-1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  This tensor has also been called the '''Piola tensor'''&lt;ref name=IUPAC /&gt; and the '''Finger tensor'''&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Reddy, David K. Gartling (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=sv0VKLL5lWUC&amp;pg=PA317 The finite element method in heat transfer and fluid dynamics], p. 317, CRC Press {{ISBN|1-4200-8598-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the rheology and fluid dynamics literature.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}=\mathbf B^{-1}=\mathbf F^{-T}\mathbf F^{-1} \qquad \text{or} \qquad c_{ij}=\frac {\partial X_K} {\partial x_i} \frac {\partial X_K} {\partial x_j}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Spectral representation===
If there are three distinct principal stretches &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the [[spectral decomposition]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is given  by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i^2 \mathbf{N}_i \otimes \mathbf{N}_i \qquad \text{and} \qquad \mathbf{B} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i^2 \mathbf{n}_i \otimes \mathbf{n}_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf U = \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i \mathbf N_i \otimes \mathbf N_i ~;~~
        \mathbf V = \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i \mathbf n_i \otimes \mathbf n_i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf R = \sum_{i=1}^3 \mathbf n_i \otimes \mathbf N_i ~;~~
        \mathbf F = \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i \mathbf n_i \otimes \mathbf N_i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{R}~\mathbf{U}~\mathbf{R}^T =
   \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i~\mathbf{R}~(\mathbf{N}_i\otimes\mathbf{N}_i)~\mathbf{R}^T =
   \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i~(\mathbf{R}~\mathbf{N}_i)\otimes(\mathbf{R}~\mathbf{N}_i)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the uniqueness of the spectral decomposition also implies that &lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{n}_i = \mathbf{R}~\mathbf{N}_i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  The left stretch (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) is also called the ''spatial stretch tensor'' while the right stretch (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) is called the ''material stretch tensor''.

The effect of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; acting on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is to stretch the vector by &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and to rotate it to the new orientation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{F}~\mathbf{N}_i = \lambda_i~(\mathbf{R}~\mathbf{N}_i) = \lambda_i~\mathbf{n}_i
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
In a similar vein, 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{F}^{-T}~\mathbf{N}_i = \cfrac{1}{\lambda_i}~\mathbf{n}_i ~;~~
  \mathbf{F}^T~\mathbf{n}_i = \lambda_i~\mathbf{N}_i ~;~~
  \mathbf{F}^{-1}~\mathbf{n}_i = \cfrac{1}{\lambda_i}~\mathbf{N}_i ~.
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

!Examples
|-
|'''Uniaxial extension of an incompressible material'''

This is the case where a specimen is stretched in 1-direction with a [[stretch ratio]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\alpha=\alpha_1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.   If the volume remains constant, the contraction in the other two directions is such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\alpha_1 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 =1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\alpha_2=\alpha_3=\alpha^{-0.5}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.   Then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=\begin{bmatrix} \alpha &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \alpha^{-0.5} &amp; 0 \\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \alpha^{-0.5} \end{bmatrix}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{C}=\begin{bmatrix} \alpha^2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \alpha^{-1} &amp; 0 \\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \alpha^{-1} \end{bmatrix}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Simple shear'''

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}=\begin{bmatrix} 1+\gamma^2 &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 \\
\gamma &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 \\
\gamma &amp; 1+\gamma^2 &amp; 0 \\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Rigid body rotation'''

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=\begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta &amp; \sin \theta &amp; 0 \\
- \sin \theta  &amp; \cos \theta  &amp; 0 \\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{C}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Derivatives of stretch===
[[Tensor derivative (continuum mechanics)|Derivatives]] of the stretch with respect to the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor are used to  derive the stress-strain relations of many solids, particularly [[hyperelastic material]]s.  These derivatives are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{\partial\lambda_i}{\partial\mathbf{C}} =
       \cfrac{1}{2\lambda_i}~\mathbf{N}_i\otimes\mathbf{N}_i =
       \cfrac{1}{2\lambda_i}~\mathbf{R}^T~(\mathbf{n}_i\otimes\mathbf{n}_i)~\mathbf{R} ~;~~ i=1,2,3
 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
and follow from the observations that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{C}:(\mathbf{N}_i\otimes\mathbf{N}_i) = \lambda_i^2 ~;~~~~\cfrac{\partial\mathbf{C}}{\partial\mathbf{C}} = \mathsf{I}^{(s)} ~;~~~~ \mathsf{I}^{(s)}:(\mathbf{N}_i\otimes\mathbf{N}_i)=\mathbf{N}_i\otimes\mathbf{N}_i.
 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Physical interpretation of deformation tensors===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = X^i~\boldsymbol{E}_i&lt;/math&gt; be a Cartesian coordinate system defined on the undeformed body and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = x^i~\boldsymbol{E}_i&lt;/math&gt; be another system defined on the deformed body.  Let a curve &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}(s)&lt;/math&gt; in the undeformed body be parametrized using &lt;math&gt;s \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.  Its image in the deformed body is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X}(s))&lt;/math&gt;.

The undeformed length of the curve is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
l_X
= \int_0^1 \left| \cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s} \right|~ds
= \int_0^1 \sqrt{ \cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}\cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}}~ds
= \int_0^1 \sqrt{ \cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}\cdot\boldsymbol{I} \cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s} }~ds
&lt;/math&gt;
After deformation, the length becomes
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
l_x &amp; = \int_0^1 \left| \cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d s} \right|~ds
      = \int_0^1 \sqrt{\cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d s}\cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d s}}~ds
      = \int_0^1 \sqrt{
        \left(\cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d \mathbf{X}}\cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}\right)
        \cdot
        \left(\cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d \mathbf{X}}\cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}\right)}~ds
\\
      &amp; = \int_0^1 \sqrt{\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}\cdot\left[
                        \left(\cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d \mathbf{X}}\right)^T\cdot \cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d \mathbf{X}}\right]
\cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s} }~ds
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{C} := \boldsymbol{F}^T\cdot\boldsymbol{F} = \left(\cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d \mathbf{X}}\right)^T\cdot \cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d \mathbf{X}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;
   l_x = \int_0^1 \sqrt{ \cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}\cdot\boldsymbol{C} \cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s} }~ds
&lt;/math&gt;
which indicates that changes in length are characterized by &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Finite strain tensors==
The concept of ''strain'' is used to evaluate how much a given displacement differs locally from a rigid body displacement.&lt;ref name=Lubliner2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=BelytschkoLiuMoran2000&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf C - \mathbf I)\qquad \text{or} \qquad E_{KL}=\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_L}-\delta_{KL}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or as a function of the displacement gradient tensor
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E =\frac{1}{2}\left[ (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T + \nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u + (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T \cdot\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\right]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;E_{KL}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_K}{\partial X_L}+\frac{\partial u_L}{\partial X_K}+\frac{\partial u_M}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial u_M}{\partial X_L}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The Green-Lagrangian strain tensor is a measure of how much &lt;math&gt;\mathbf C\,\!&lt;/math&gt; differs from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''Eulerian-Almansi finite strain tensor'', referenced to the deformed configuration, i.e. Eulerian description, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf I - \mathbf c)=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf I - \mathbf B ^{-1})
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
e_{rs}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\delta_{rs} - \frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_r}\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_s} \right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or as a function of the displacement gradients we have
:&lt;math&gt;e_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} +\frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}-\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_j}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

!Derivation of the Lagrangian and Eulerian finite strain tensors
|-
|A measure of deformation is the difference between the squares of the differential line element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, in the undeformed configuration, and &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, in the deformed configuration (Figure 2). Deformation has occurred if the difference is non zero, otherwise a rigid-body displacement has occurred. Thus we have,

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{x}^2 - d\mathbf{X}^2=d\mathbf x\cdot d\mathbf x-d\mathbf X\cdot d\mathbf X
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
(dx)^2 - (dX)^2=dx_jdx_j-dX_M\,dX_M\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In the Lagrangian description, using the material coordinates as the frame of reference, the linear transformation between the differential lines is

:&lt;math&gt; d\mathbf x = \frac {\partial \mathbf x} {\partial \mathbf X}\,d\mathbf X=\mathbf F \,d\mathbf{X} \qquad\text{or} \qquad dx_j=\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_M} \,dX_M\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then we have,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\mathbf{x}^2&amp;=d\mathbf x \cdot d\mathbf x \\
&amp;= \mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X \cdot \mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X \\
&amp;= d\mathbf X \cdot \mathbf F^T\mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X \\
&amp;= d\mathbf X\cdot\mathbf C\cdot d\mathbf X
\end{align}
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\begin{align}
(dx)^2&amp;=dx_j\,dx_j \\
&amp;= \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_L}\,dX_K\,dX_L \\
&amp;= C_{KL}\,dX_K\,dX_L \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_{KL}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the ''right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor'', &lt;math&gt;\mathbf C=\mathbf F^T \mathbf F\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Then, replacing this equation into the first equation we have,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\mathbf{x}^2 - d\mathbf{X}^2 &amp;= d\mathbf X\cdot\mathbf C\cdot d\mathbf X-d\mathbf X\cdot d\mathbf X \\
&amp;=d\mathbf X\cdot (\mathbf C - \mathbf I)\cdot d\mathbf X \\
&amp;= d\mathbf X \cdot 2\mathbf E \cdot d\mathbf X \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(dx)^2 - (dX)^2 &amp;= \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_L}\,dX_K\,dX_L-dX_M\,dX_M \\
&amp;= \left( \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_L}-\delta_{KL}\right)\,dX_K\,dX_L \\
&amp;=2E_{KL}\,dX_K\,dX_L
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_{KL}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, are the  components of a second-order tensor called the ''Green – St-Venant strain tensor'' or the ''Lagrangian finite strain tensor'',
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf C - \mathbf I)\qquad \text{or} \qquad E_{KL}=\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_L}-\delta_{KL}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In the Eulerian description, using the spatial coordinates as the frame of reference, the linear transformation between the differential lines is
:&lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{X} = \frac {\partial \mathbf{X}} {\partial \mathbf {x}}d\mathbf{x}=\mathbf F^{-1} \, d\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{H}  \,d\mathbf{x} \qquad \text{or} \qquad dX_M=\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_n}\, dx_n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the ''spatial deformation gradient tensor'',  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\mathbf{X}^2&amp;=d\mathbf X \cdot d\mathbf X \\
&amp;= \mathbf F^{-1} \cdot d\mathbf x \cdot \mathbf F^{-1} \cdot d\mathbf x \\
&amp;= d\mathbf x \cdot \mathbf F^{-T}\mathbf F^{-1} \cdot d\mathbf x \\
&amp;= d\mathbf x\cdot\mathbf c\cdot d\mathbf x
\end{align}
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\begin{align}
(dX)^2&amp;=dX_M\,dX_M \\
&amp;= \frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_r}\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_s}\,dx_r\,dx_s \\
&amp;= c_{rs}\,dx_r\,dx_s  \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where the second order tensor &lt;math&gt;c_{rs}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called ''Cauchy's deformation tensor'', &lt;math&gt;\mathbf c=\mathbf F^{-T}\mathbf F^{-1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\mathbf{x}^2 - d\mathbf{X}^2 &amp;= d\mathbf x\cdot d\mathbf x-d\mathbf x\cdot\mathbf c\cdot d\mathbf x \\
&amp;=d\mathbf x\cdot (\mathbf I - \mathbf c)\cdot d\mathbf x \\
&amp;= d\mathbf x \cdot 2\mathbf e \cdot d\mathbf x \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(dx)^2 - (dX)^2 &amp;= dx_j\,dx_j-\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_r}\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_s}\,dx_r\,dx_s \\
&amp;= \left(\delta_{rs} - \frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_r}\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_s} \right)\,dx_r\,dx_s \\
&amp;=2e_{rs}\,dx_r\,dx_s
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e_{rs}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, are the  components of a second-order tensor called the ''Eulerian-Almansi finite strain tensor'',
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf I - \mathbf c)
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
e_{rs}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\delta_{rs} - \frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_r}\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_s} \right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Both the Lagrangian and Eulerian finite strain tensors can be conveniently expressed in terms of the ''displacement gradient tensor''. For the Lagrangian strain tensor, first we differentiate the displacement vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u(\mathbf X, t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the material coordinates &lt;math&gt;X_M\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the ''material displacement gradient tensor'',  &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf u(\mathbf X,t) &amp;= \mathbf x(\mathbf X,t) - \mathbf X \\
\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u &amp;= \mathbf F - \mathbf I \\
\mathbf F &amp;= \nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u + \mathbf I \\
\end{align}
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\begin{align}
u_i&amp; = x_i-\delta_{iJ}X_J \\
\delta_{iJ}U_J &amp;= x_i-\delta_{iJ}X_J \\
x_i&amp;=\delta_{iJ}\left(U_J+X_J\right) \\
\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial X_K}&amp;=\delta_{iJ}\left(\frac{\partial U_J}{\partial X_K}+\delta_{JK}\right) \\
\end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing this equation into the expression for the Lagrangian finite strain tensor we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf E &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf F^T\mathbf F-\mathbf I\right) \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left[ \left\{ (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T+\mathbf I\right\}\left( \nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u+\mathbf I\right)-\mathbf I\right] \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left[  (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T + \nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u + (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T \cdot\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\right] \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_{KL}&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_L}-\delta_{KL}\right) \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left[\delta_{jM}\left(\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_K}+\delta_{MK}\right)\delta_{jN}\left(\frac{\partial U_N}{\partial X_L}+\delta_{NL}\right)-\delta_{KL}\right] \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left[\delta_{MN}\left(\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_K}+\delta_{MK}\right)\left(\frac{\partial U_N}{\partial X_L}+\delta_{NL}\right)-\delta_{KL}\right] \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_K}+\delta_{MK}\right)\left(\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_L}+\delta_{ML}\right)-\delta_{KL}\right] \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial U_K}{\partial X_L}+\frac{\partial U_L}{\partial X_K}+\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_L}\right)
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the Eulerian-Almansi finite strain tensor can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;e_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} +\frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}-\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_j}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Seth–Hill family of generalized strain tensors ===
[[B. R. Seth]] from the [[Indian Institute of Technology]], [[Kharagpur]] was the first to show that the Green and Almansi strain tensors are special cases of a more general [[strain measure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Seth|first=B.

Doyle and J.L. Eriksen (1956). "Non-linear elasticity." ''Advances in Applied Mechanics'' 4, 53–115.&lt;/ref&gt; can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_{(m)}=\frac{1}{2m}(\mathbf U^{2m}- \mathbf I) = \frac{1}{2m}\left[\mathbf{C}^{m} - \mathbf{I}\right]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For different values of &lt;math&gt;m\,\!&lt;/math&gt; we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf E_{(1)}&amp;=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf U^{2}- \mathbf I) = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{C}-\mathbf{I}) &amp; \qquad \text{Green-Lagrangian strain tensor}\\
 \mathbf E_{(1/2)}&amp;=(\mathbf U- \mathbf I) = \mathbf{C}^{1/2}-\mathbf{I}&amp; \qquad \text{Biot strain tensor}\\
\mathbf E_{(0)}&amp;=\ln \mathbf U = \frac{1}{2}\,\ln\mathbf{C} &amp; \qquad \text{Logarithmic strain, Natural strain, True strain, or Hencky strain} \\
 \mathbf{E}_{(-1)} &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left[\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{U}^{-2}\right] &amp; \qquad \text{Almansi strain}
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The second-order approximation of these tensors is
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{E}_{(m)} = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} + {\tfrac 1 2}(\nabla\mathbf{u})^T\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u} - (1 - m) \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^T\cdot\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; is the infinitesimal strain tensor.

Many other different definitions of tensors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; are admissible, provided that they all satisfy the conditions that:&lt;ref name="BazCed91"&gt;Z.P. Bažant and L. Cedolin (1991). ''Stability of Structures. Elastic, Inelastic, Fracture and Damage Theories.'' Oxford Univ. Press, New York (2nd ed. Dover Publ., New York 2003; 3rd ed., World Scientific 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; vanishes for all rigid-body motions
* the dependence of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; on the displacement gradient tensor &lt;math&gt;\nabla\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, continuously differentiable and monotonic
* it is also desired that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; reduces to the infinitesimal strain tensor &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; as the norm &lt;math&gt;|\nabla\mathbf{u}| \to 0&lt;/math&gt;

An example is the set of tensors 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{E}^{(n)} = \left({\mathbf U}^n - {\mathbf U}^{-n}\right)/2n
 &lt;/math&gt;
which do not belong to the Seth–Hill class, but have the same 2nd-order approximation as the Seth–Hill measures at &lt;math&gt;m=0&lt;/math&gt; for any value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Baz98"&gt;Z.P. Bažant (1998). "Easy-to-compute tensors with symmetric inverse approximating Hencky finite strain and its rate." ''Journal of Materials of Technology ASME'', 120 (April), 131–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stretch ratio==
The '''stretch ratio''' is a measure of the extensional or normal strain of a differential line element, which can be defined at either the undeformed configuration or the deformed configuration.

The stretch ratio for the differential element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X=dX\mathbf N\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure) in the direction of the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N\,\!&lt;/math&gt; at the material point &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, in the undeformed configuration, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{(\mathbf N)}=\frac{dx}{dX}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;dx\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the deformed magnitude of the differential element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, the stretch ratio for the differential element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x=dx\mathbf n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure), in the direction of the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; at the material point &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, in the deformed configuration, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Lambda_{(\mathbf n)}}=\frac{dX}{dx}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The normal strain  &lt;math&gt;e_{\mathbf N}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in any direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N\,\!&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a function of the stretch ratio,

:&lt;math&gt;e_{(\mathbf N)}=\frac{dx-dX}{dX}=\Lambda_{(\mathbf N)}-1.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This equation implies that the normal strain is zero, i.e. no deformation, when the stretch is equal to unity. Some materials, such as elastometers can sustain stretch ratios of 3 or 4 before they fail, whereas traditional engineering materials, such as concrete or steel, fail at much lower stretch ratios, perhaps of the order of 1.1 (reference?)

==Physical interpretation of the finite strain tensor==

The diagonal components &lt;math&gt;E_{KL}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; of the Lagrangian finite strain tensor are related to the normal strain, e.g.

:&lt;math&gt;E_{11}=e_{(\mathbf I_1)}+\frac{1}{2}e_{(\mathbf I_1)}^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e_{(\mathbf I_1)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the normal strain or engineering strain in the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The off-diagonal components &lt;math&gt;E_{KL}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; of the Lagrangian finite strain tensor are related to shear strain, e.g.

:&lt;math&gt;E_{12}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2E_{11}+1}\sqrt{2E_{22}+1}\sin\phi_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the angle between two line elements that were originally perpendicular with directions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

Under certain circumstances, i.e. small displacements and small displacement rates, the components of the Lagrangian finite strain tensor may be approximated by the components of the [[Infinitesimal strain theory#Infinitesimal strain tensor|infinitesimal strain tensor]]

|The stretch ratio for the differential element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X=dX\mathbf N\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure) in the direction of the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N\,\!&lt;/math&gt; at the material point &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, in the undeformed configuration, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{(\mathbf N)}=\frac{dx}{dX}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;dx\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the deformed magnitude of the differential element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, the stretch ratio for the differential element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x=dx\mathbf n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure), in the direction of the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; at the material point &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, in the deformed configuration, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Lambda_{(\mathbf n)}}=\frac{dX}{dx}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The square of the stretch ratio is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{(\mathbf N)}^2=\left (\frac{dx}{dX}\right )^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing that

:&lt;math&gt;(dx)^2=C_{KL}dX_KdX_L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{(\mathbf N)}^2=C_{KL}N_KN_L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_K\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_L\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors.

The normal strain or engineering strain  &lt;math&gt;e_{\mathbf N}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in any direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N\,\!&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a function of the stretch ratio,

:&lt;math&gt;e_{(\mathbf N)}=\frac{dx-dX}{dX}=\Lambda_{(\mathbf N)}-1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the normal strain in the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; at the material point &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; may be expressed in terms of the stretch ratio as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
e_{(\mathbf I_1)}=\frac{dx_1-dX_1}{dX_1}&amp;=\Lambda_{(\mathbf I_1)}-1\\
&amp;=\sqrt {C_{11}} -1=\sqrt{\delta_{11}+2E_{11}}-1\\
&amp;=\sqrt{1+2E_{11}}-1\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

solving for &lt;math&gt;E_{11}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; we have

&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
2E_{11}&amp;= \frac{(dx_1)^2 - (dX_1)^2}{(dX_1)^2} \\
E_{11}&amp;= \left(\frac{dx_1-dX_1}{dX_1}\right)+ \frac {1}{2} \left(\frac{dx_1-dX_1}{dX_1}\right)^2 \\
&amp;=e_{(\mathbf I_1)}+\frac{1}{2}e_{(\mathbf I_1)}^2\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The ''shear strain'', or change in angle between two line elements &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; initially perpendicular, and oriented in the principal directions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectivelly, can also be expressed as a function of the stretch ratio. From the [[dot product]] between the deformed lines &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\mathbf x_1 \cdot d\mathbf x_2&amp;=dx_1dx_2\cos\theta_{12} \\
\mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X_1\cdot \mathbf F\cdot d\mathbf X_2&amp;= \sqrt {d\mathbf X_1 \cdot \mathbf F^T\cdot\mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X_1}\cdot \sqrt {d\mathbf X_2 \cdot \mathbf F^T\cdot\mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X_2} \cos\theta_{12} \\
\frac{d\mathbf X_1\cdot \mathbf F^T\cdot\mathbf F\cdot d\mathbf X_2}{dX_1dX_2}&amp;=\frac{\sqrt {d\mathbf X_1 \cdot \mathbf F^T\cdot\mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X_1}\cdot \sqrt {d\mathbf X_2 \cdot \mathbf F^T\cdot\mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X_2}}{dX_1dX_2}\cos\theta_{12}\\
\mathbf I_1 \cdot \mathbf C \cdot \mathbf I_2&amp;= \Lambda_{\mathbf I_1}\Lambda_{\mathbf I_2}\cos\theta_{12}\\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the lines &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the deformed configuration. Defining &lt;math&gt;\phi_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as the shear strain or reduction in the angle between two line elements that were originally perpendicular, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{12}=\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_{12}=\sin\phi_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_1 \cdot \mathbf C \cdot \mathbf I_2= \Lambda_{\mathbf I_1}\Lambda_{\mathbf I_2}\sin\phi_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
C_{12}&amp;=\sqrt{C_{11}}\sqrt{C_{22}}\sin\phi_{12}\\
2E_{12}+\delta_{12}&amp;=\sqrt{2E_{11}+1}\sqrt{2E_{22}+1}\sin\phi_{12}\\

== Deformation tensors in convected curvilinear coordinates ==
A representation of deformation tensors in [[curvilinear coordinates]] is useful for many problems in continuum mechanics such as nonlinear shell theories and large plastic deformations.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}(\xi^1,\xi^2,\xi^3)&lt;/math&gt; denote the function by which a position vector in space is constructed from coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\xi^1,\xi^2,\xi^3)&lt;/math&gt;. The coordinates are said to be "convected" if they correspond to a one-to-one mapping to and from Lagrangian particles in a continuum body. If the coordinate grid is "painted" on the body in its initial configuration, then this grid will deform and flow with the motion of material to remain painted on the same material particles in the deformed configuration so that grid lines intersect at the same material particle in either configuration.  The tangent vector to the deformed coordinate grid line curve &lt;math&gt;\xi^i&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{g}_i = \frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial \xi^i}
&lt;/math&gt;
The three tangent vectors at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; form a local basis.  These vectors are related the reciprocal basis vectors by 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}^j = \delta_i^j
&lt;/math&gt;

Let us define a second-order tensor field &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{g}&lt;/math&gt; (also called the [[metric tensor]]) with components
:&lt;math&gt;
   g_{ij} := \frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial \xi^i}\cdot\frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial \xi^j} = \mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}_j
&lt;/math&gt;
The [[curvilinear coordinates|Christoffel symbols of the first kind]] can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Gamma_{ijk}
      = \tfrac{1}{2}[(\mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}_k)_{,j} + (\mathbf{g}_j\cdot\mathbf{g}_k)_{,i} - (\mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}_j)_{,k}]
&lt;/math&gt;

To see how the Christoffel symbols are related to the Right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor let us similarly define two bases, the already mentioned one that is tangent to deformed grid lines and another that is tangent to the undeformed grid lines. Namely,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{G}_i := \frac{\partial \mathbf{X}}{\partial \xi^i} ~;~~ \mathbf{G}_i\cdot\mathbf{G}^j = \delta_i^j ~;~~ \mathbf{g}_i := \frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial \xi^i}  ~;~~ \mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}^j = \delta_i^j
&lt;/math&gt;

=== The deformation gradient in curvilinear coordinates ===
Using the definition of the [[curvilinear coordinates|gradient of a vector field]] in curvilinear coordinates, the deformation gradient can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}_{\mathbf{X}}\mathbf{x} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial \xi^i}\otimes\mathbf{G}^i = \mathbf{g}_i\otimes\mathbf{G}^i
&lt;/math&gt;

=== The right Cauchy–Green tensor in curvilinear coordinates ===
The right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{C} = \boldsymbol{F}^T\cdot\boldsymbol{F} = (\mathbf{G}^i\otimes\mathbf{g}_i)\cdot(\mathbf{g}_j\otimes\mathbf{G}^j)
       = (\mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}_j)(\mathbf{G}^i\otimes\mathbf{G}^j)
&lt;/math&gt;
If we express &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of components with respect to the basis {&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}^i&lt;/math&gt;} we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{C} = C_{ij}~\mathbf{G}^i\otimes\mathbf{G}^j
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, 
:&lt;math&gt;
  C_{ij} = \mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}_j = g_{ij}
 &lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding Christoffel symbol of the first kind may be written in the following form.
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Gamma_{ijk} 
      = \tfrac{1}{2}[C_{ik,j} + C_{jk,i} - C_{ij,k}]
      = \tfrac{1}{2}[(\mathbf{G}_i\cdot\boldsymbol{C}\cdot\mathbf{G}_k)_{,j} + (\mathbf{G}_j\cdot\boldsymbol{C}\cdot\mathbf{G}_k)_{,i} - (\mathbf{G}_i\cdot\boldsymbol{C}\cdot\mathbf{G}_j)_{,k}]
&lt;/math&gt;

===Some relations between deformation measures and Christoffel symbols===
Let us consider a one-to-one mapping from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \{X^1,X^2,X^3\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \{x^1,x^2,x^3\}&lt;/math&gt; and let us assume that there exist two positive-definite, symmetric second-order tensor fields &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{G}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{g}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;
   G_{ij} = \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}~g_{\alpha\beta} 
&lt;/math&gt;
Then,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial G_{ij}}{\partial x^k} = \left(\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} +
       \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\beta}{\partial x^j \partial x^k}\right)~g_{\alpha\beta} +
       \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial x^k}
&lt;/math&gt;
Noting that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial x^k} = \frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^k}~\frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial X^\gamma}
&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;g_{\alpha\beta} = g_{\beta\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  \frac{\partial G_{ij}}{\partial x^k} &amp; = \left(\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} +
       \frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^j \partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^i}\right)~g_{\alpha\beta} +
       \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^k}~\frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial X^\gamma} \\
  \frac{\partial G_{ik}}{\partial x^j} &amp; = \left(\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k} +
       \frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^j \partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^i}\right)~g_{\alpha\beta} +
       \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial X^\gamma} \\
  \frac{\partial G_{jk}}{\partial x^i} &amp; = \left(\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k} +
       \frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}\right)~g_{\alpha\beta} +
       \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial X^\gamma} 
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Define
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   _{(x)}\Gamma_{ijk} &amp; := \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial G_{ik}}{\partial x^j} + \frac{\partial G_{jk}}{\partial x^i} - \frac{\partial G_{ij}}{\partial x^k}\right) \\
   _{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} &amp; := \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial g_{\alpha\gamma}}{\partial X^\beta} + \frac{\partial g_{\beta\gamma}}{\partial X^\alpha} - \frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial X^\gamma}\right) \\
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence
:&lt;math&gt;
  _{(x)}\Gamma_{ijk} = \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^k} \,_{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} + \frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k}~g_{\alpha\beta}
&lt;/math&gt;
Define
:&lt;math&gt;
   [G^{ij}] = [G_{ij}]^{-1} ~;~~ [g^{\alpha\beta}] = [g_{\alpha\beta}]^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;
   G^{ij} = \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial X^\alpha}~\frac{\partial x^j}{\partial X^\beta}~g^{\alpha\beta}
&lt;/math&gt;
Define the Christoffel symbols of the second kind as
:&lt;math&gt;
  _{(x)}\Gamma^m_{ij} := G^{mk} \,_{(x)}\Gamma_{ijk} ~;~~
  _{(X)}\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta} := g^{\nu\gamma} \,_{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} 
&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  _{(x)}\Gamma^m_{ij} &amp; =  G^{mk}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^k} \,_{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} + G^{mk}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k}~g_{\alpha\beta} \\
   &amp; =  \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial X^\rho}~g^{\nu\rho}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^k} \,_{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} + 
   \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial X^\rho}~g^{\nu\rho}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k}~g_{\alpha\beta} \\
   &amp; =  \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\delta^\gamma_\rho~g^{\nu\rho}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} + 
   \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\delta^\beta_\rho~g^{\nu\rho}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~g_{\alpha\beta} \\
   &amp; =  \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~g^{\nu\gamma}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} + 
   \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~g^{\nu\beta}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~g_{\alpha\beta} \\
   &amp; =  \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta} + 
   \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\delta^{\nu}_{\alpha}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} 
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  _{(x)}\Gamma^m_{ij} =  \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta} + 
   \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\alpha}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} 
&lt;/math&gt;
The invertibility of the mapping implies that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  \frac{\partial X^\mu}{\partial x^m}\,_{(x)}\Gamma^m_{ij} &amp; =  \frac{\partial X^\mu}{\partial x^m}~\frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta} + 
   \frac{\partial X^\mu}{\partial x^m}~\frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\alpha}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} \\
   &amp; =  \delta^\mu_\nu~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta} + 
   \delta^\mu_\alpha~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} \\
   &amp; =  \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} + \frac{\partial^2 X^\mu}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} 
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
We can also formulate a similar result in terms of derivatives with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2 X^\mu}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} &amp; = \frac{\partial X^\mu}{\partial x^m}\,_{(x)}\Gamma^m_{ij} - \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \\
\frac{\partial^2 x^m}{\partial X^\alpha \partial X^\beta} &amp; = \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\mu}\,_{(X)}\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} - \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial X^\alpha}~\frac{\partial x^j}{\partial X^\beta} \,_{(x)}\Gamma^m_{ij}
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Compatibility conditions ==
{{Main|Compatibility (mechanics)}}
The problem of compatibility in continuum mechanics involves the determination of allowable single-valued continuous fields on bodies.  These allowable conditions leave the body without unphysical gaps or overlaps after a deformation.  Most such conditions apply to simply-connected bodies.  Additional conditions are required for the internal boundaries of multiply connected bodies.

=== Compatibility of the deformation gradient ===
The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a compatible &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt; field over a simply connected body are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{0}
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Compatibility of the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor ===
The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a compatible &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt; field over a simply connected body are
:&lt;math&gt;
  R^\gamma_{\alpha\beta\rho} := 
   \frac{\partial }{\partial X^\rho}[\,_{(X)}\Gamma^\gamma_{\alpha\beta}] -
   \frac{\partial }{\partial X^\beta}[\,_{(X)}\Gamma^\gamma_{\alpha\rho}] +
  \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\gamma_{\mu\rho}\,_{(X)}\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} - 
  \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\gamma_{\mu\beta}\,_{(X)}\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\rho} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
We can show these are the mixed components of the [[Riemann–Christoffel curvature tensor]]. Therefore, the necessary conditions for &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt;-compatibility are that the Riemann–Christoffel curvature of the deformation is zero.

=== Compatibility of the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor ===
No general sufficiency conditions are known for the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor in three-dimensions.  Compatibility conditions for two-dimensional &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt; fields have been found by Janet Blume.&lt;ref name=Blume&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blume, J.

== Coefficient of Conservatism ==
Each plant species in a region is assigned a '''coefficient of conservatism''', also known as a C-value, ranging between 0 and 10.&lt;ref name=fqa95 /&gt; A plant species with a higher score (e.g. 10) has a ''lower'' tolerance to [[environmental degradation]] such as [[grazing]] or [[land development|development]] and therefore is naturally restricted to undisturbed, [[remnant natural area|remnant habitats]]. Non-native plants are either assigned a C-value of 0 or are excluded from assessments.&lt;ref name=freyman16&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freyman |first1=William A. |last2=Master |first2=Linda A. |last3=Packard |first3=Stephen |date=2016 |title=The Universal Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) Calculator: an online tool for ecological assessment and monitoring |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12491/abstract |journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution |volume=7 |issue= |pages=380-383 |doi=10.1111/2041-210X.12491 |access-date=2018-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Chicago Region, 84% of the native plant species have a C-value of 4 or greater.&lt;ref name=FCR17&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilhelm |first1=Gerould |last2=Rericha |first2=Laura |authorlink2=Laura Rericha |date=2017 |title=Flora of the Chicago Region: A Floristic and Ecological Synthesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants with a C-value of 4 or greater rarely naturally move from a remnant area to surrounding degraded land.&lt;ref name=FCR17 /&gt;

C-values are assigned within specific ecological and geographic regions. As of February 2018, there were at least 50 different FQA databases ranging from the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] to western [[Washington (state)|Washington]], though most databases represented regions in the eastern and central United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=universalfqa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://universalfqa.org |title=Universal FQA|date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mean C-value''' (&lt;math&gt; \bar{C}&lt;/math&gt;) is calculated based on an inventory of plants. An area with a native mean C-value of 3.5  or higher likely has "sufficient floristic quality to be of at least marginal natural area quality."&lt;ref name=swink94 /&gt; Remnant natural areas with mean C-values of 4.0 or greater are [[environmental mitigation|unmitigable]].&lt;ref name=FCR17 /&gt;

== Floristic Quality Index ==
The '''Floristic Quality Index''' (FQI) is calculated by multiplying the mean C value by the square root of the total number of species:

&lt;math&gt; \bar{C}\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Aristotle's Four Causes of a Table.svg|thumb|upright=2|[[Aristotle]]'s Four Causes illustrated for a table: material (wood), formal (design), efficient (carpentry), final (dining).]]
The "'''four causes'''" are elements of an influential principle in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian thought]] whereby explanations of change or movement are classified into four fundamental types of answer to the question "why?". [[Aristotle]] wrote that "we do not have knowledge of a thing until we have grasped its why, that is to say, its cause."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 194 b17–20; see also: {{nowrap|''Posterior Analytics'' 71 b9–11; 94 a20.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP Four Causes"&gt; "[F]or a full range of cases, an explanation which fails to invoke all four causes is no explanation at all."—[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/#FouCau "Four Causes"]. Falcon, Andrea. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/ Aristotle on Causality]. ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While there are cases where identifying a "cause" is difficult, or in which "causes" might merge, Aristotle held that his four "causes" provided an analytical scheme of general applicability.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. ''The Beginnings of Western Science'' (1992). p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aitia''''', from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αἰτία}}, was the word that Aristotle used to refer to the causal explanation that has traditionally been translated as "cause", but this specialized, technical, philosophical usage of the word "cause" does not correspond exactly to its most usual applications in everyday English language.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=91–92}} The translation of Aristotle's {{lang|grc|αἰτία}} that is nearest to current ordinary language could be "question" or "causal explanation",&lt;ref name="Hankison1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP Four Causes"/&gt;{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=91–92}} although any such terms may mask the fact that Aristotelians consider the four causes to be more fundamental in nature than mere explanations. In this article, the peculiar philosophical usage of the word "cause" will be employed, for tradition's sake, but the reader should not be misled by confusing this technical usage with current ordinary language.

Aristotle held that there were four kinds of answers to "why" questions (in ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' II, 3, and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' V, 2):&lt;ref name="SEP Four Causes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1013a |title=Metaphysics |chapter=Book 5, section 1013a |others=Translated by Hugh Tredennick |author=Aristotle}} Aristotle in 23 Volumes, Vols. 17, 18, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1933, 1989; (hosted at perseus.tufts.edu.)

* '''Matter''': a change or movement's '''material cause''', is the aspect of the change or movement which is determined by the material that composes the moving or changing things. For a table, that might be wood; for a statue, that might be bronze or marble.
* '''Form''': a change or movement's '''formal cause''', is a change or movement caused by the arrangement, shape or appearance of the thing changing or moving. Aristotle says for example that the ratio 2:1, and number in general, is the cause of the [[octave]].
* '''Agent''': a change or movement's '''efficient''' or '''moving cause''', consists of things apart from the thing being changed or moved, which interact so as to be an agency of the change or movement. For example, the efficient cause of a table is a carpenter, or a person working as one, and according to Aristotle the efficient cause of a boy is a father.
* '''End''' or '''purpose''': a change or movement's '''final cause''', is that for the sake of which a thing is what it is. For a seed, it might be an adult plant. For a sailboat, it might be sailing. For a ball at the top of a ramp, it might be coming to rest at the bottom.
The four "causes" are not mutually exclusive. For Aristotle, several answers to the question "why" have to be given to explain a phenomenon and especially the actual configuration of an object.&lt;ref&gt;According to Reece (2018): "Aristotle thinks that human action is a species of animal self-movement, and animal self-movement is a species of natural change. Natural changes, although they are not substances and do not have causes in precisely the same way that substances do, are to be explained in terms of the four causes, or as many of them as a given natural change has: The material cause is that out of which something comes to be, or what undergoes change from one state to another; the formal cause, what differentiates something from other things, and serves as a paradigm for its coming to be that thing; the efficient cause, the starting-point of change; the final cause, that for the sake of which something comes about."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if asking why a table is such and such, a complete explanation, taking into account the four causes, would sound like this: This table is solid and brown because it is made of wood (matter), it does not collapse because it has four legs of equal length (form), it is as such because a carpenter made it starting from a tree (agent), it has these dimensions because it is to be used by men and women (end).

==Meaning of "cause"==

In his philosophical writings, Aristotle used the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] word [[wikt:αἴτιος|αἴτιον]], ''aition'', a neuter singular form of an adjective. The Greek word had meant, perhaps originally in a [[Ancient Greek law | "legal"]] context, what or who is "[[Personal responsibility|responsible]]", mostly but not always in a bad sense of "guilt" or "blame"; alternatively it could mean "to the credit of" someone or something. The appropriation of this word by Aristotle and other philosophers reflects how the Greek experience of legal practice influenced the concern in Greek thought to determine ''what'' is responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lloyd | first=G.

=== {{anchor|Material cause}} Matter ===

Aristotle considers the '''material "cause"''' (''hyle'')&lt;ref name=preus&gt;{{cite dictionary |author=Preus, Anthony |year=2015 |title=Material cause |work=Historical Dictionary of Ancient Greek Philosophy |edition=2nd |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=wjW_BgAAQBAJ |isbn=978-0810854871}}&lt;/ref&gt; of an object as equivalent to the nature of the raw material out of which the object is composed. (The word "nature" for Aristotle applies to both its potential in the raw material and its ultimate finished form. In a sense this form already existed in the material: see [[potentiality and actuality]].)

Whereas modern physics looks to simple bodies, Aristotle's physics instead treated living things as exemplary. However, he felt that simple natural bodies such as earth, fire, air, and water also showed signs of having their own innate sources of motion, change, and rest. Fire, for example, carries things upwards, unless stopped from doing so. Things like beds and cloaks, formed by human artifice, have no innate tendency to become beds or cloaks.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 192b&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aristotelian terminology, material is not the same as [[Substance theory|substance]]. Matter has parallels with substance in so far as primary matter serves as the substratum for simple bodies which are not substance: sand and rock (mostly earth), rivers and seas (mostly water), atmosphere and wind (mostly air and then mostly fire below the moon). Only individuals are said to be substance (subjects) in the primary sense. Secondary substance, in a different sense, also applies to man-made artifacts.

=== {{anchor|Formal cause}} Form ===
{{see|Platonic realism}}

Aristotle considers the '''formal "cause"''' (''eidos'')&lt;ref name=preus/&gt; as describing the pattern or form which when present makes matter into a particular type of thing, which we recognize as being of that particular type.

By Aristotle's own account, this is a difficult and controversial [[concept]].{{citation needed|date= September 2016}} It links with [[theory of forms|theories of forms]] such as those of Aristotle's teacher, [[Plato]], but in Aristotle's own account (see his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''), he takes into account many previous writers who had expressed opinions about forms and ideas, but he shows how his own views differ from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lloyd | first=G. E. R. | author-link=G. E. R. Lloyd | date=1968 | title=Aristotle: The Growth and Structure of His Thought | chapter=The critic of Plato | publisher=Cambridge University Press | place=Cambridge | pages=43–47 | isbn=0-521-09456-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Efficient cause}} Agent ===

Aristotle defines the '''agent''' or '''efficient "cause"''' (''kinoun'')&lt;ref name=preus/&gt; of an object as that which causes change and motion to start or stop (such as a painter painting a house) (see Aristotle, Physics II 3, 194b29). In many cases, this is simply the thing that brings something about. For example, in the case of a statue, it is the person chiseling away which transforms a block of marble into a statue. Only this one of the four causes is like what an ordinary English-speaker would regard as a cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last=Lloyd | first=G. E. R. | author-link=G. E. R.

=== {{anchor|Final cause}} End ===
{{Main article|Teleology}}

Aristotle defines the '''end''', '''purpose''', or '''final "cause"''' (''telos'')&lt;ref name=preus/&gt; as that for the sake of which a thing is done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Aristotle | author-link=Aristotle | title=Physics | at=II.3. 194 &lt;sup&gt;b 32&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the form, this is a controversial type of explanation in science; some have argued for its survival in [[evolutionary biology]],&lt;ref name="Lennox 1993"&gt;{{ Citation | last=Lennox | first=James G. | author-link=James G. Lennox | date=1993 | title=Darwin ''was'' a teleologist | journal=Biology and Philosophy | volume=8 | issue=4 | pages=409–421 | doi=10.1007/BF00857687 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ernst Mayr]] denied that it continued to play a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last=Mayr | first=Ernst | author-link=Ernst Mayr | date=10 November 1961 | title=Cause and Effect in Biology | volume=134 | issue=3489 | pages=1501–1506 | quote= The development or behavior of an individual is purposive, natural selection is definitely not…. Darwin 'has swept out such finalistic teleology by the front door.' }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly claimed{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} that Aristotle's conception of nature is teleological in the sense that [[Nature (philosophy)|Nature]] has goals apart from those that humans have. On the other hand, as discussed further below, it has also been claimed that Aristotle thought that a ''telos'' can be present without any form of deliberation, consciousness or intelligence. An example of a relevant passage occurs in ''Physics'' II.8, where he writes:

{{quote|This is most obvious in the animals other than man: they make things neither by art nor after inquiry or deliberation. That is why people wonder whether it is by intelligence or by some other faculty that these creatures work, – spiders, ants, and the like... It is absurd to suppose that purpose is not present because we do not observe the agent deliberating. Art does not deliberate. If the ship-building art were in the wood, it would produce the same results by nature. If, therefore, purpose is present in art, it is present also in nature.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Aristotle'' Vol. I. The Revised Oxford Translation, ed. Jonathan Barnes).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For example, according to Aristotle, a seed has the eventual adult plant as its end (i.e., as its ''telos'') if and only if the seed would become the adult plant under normal circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle gives this example in ''Parts of Animals'' I.1.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Physics'' II.9, Aristotle hazards a few arguments that a determination of the end (cause) of a phenomenon is more important than the others. He argues that the end is that which brings it about, so for example "if one defines the operation of sawing as being a certain kind of dividing, then this cannot come about unless the saw has teeth of a certain kind; and these cannot be unless it is of iron."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' II.9. 200b4–7.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle, once a final "cause" is in place, the material, efficient and formal "causes" follow by necessity. However, he recommends that the student of nature determine the other "causes" as well,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' II.9.&lt;/ref&gt; and notes that not all phenomena have an end, e.g., chance events.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' II.5 where chance is opposed to nature, which he has already said acts for ends.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle saw that [[Aristotle's biology|his biological investigations]] provided insights into the causes of things, especially into the final cause.
{{quote|We should approach the investigation of every kind of animal without being ashamed, since in each one of them there is something natural and something beautiful.  The absence of chance and the serving of ends are found in the works of nature especially. And the end, for the sake of which a thing has been constructed or has come to be, belongs to what is beautiful. |source=Aristotle, ''On the Parts of Animals'' 645&lt;sup&gt;a 21-26&lt;/sup&gt;, Book I, Part 5.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, G. E. R. (1970). ''Early Greek Science: Thales to Aristotle'', New York: W. W. Norton, p. 105. ISBN 978-0-393-00583-7 &lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[George Holmes Howison]], in ''The Limits of Evolution'' (1901), highlights "final causation" in presenting his theory of metaphysics, which he terms "personal idealism", and to which he invites not only man, but all (ideal) life; at p.&amp;nbsp;39: 

{{quote|Here, in seeing that Final Cause &amp;ndash; causation at the call of self-posited aim or end – is the only full and genuine cause, we further see that Nature, the cosmic aggregate of phenomena and the cosmic bond of their law which in the mood of vague and inaccurate abstraction we call Force, is after all only an effect... Thus teleology, or the Reign of Final Cause, the reign of ideality, is not only an element in the notion of Evolution, but is the very vital cord in the notion. The conception of evolution is founded at last and essentially in the conception of Progress: but this conception has no meaning at all except in the light of a goal; there can be no goal unless there is a Beyond for everything actual; and there is no such Beyond except through a spontaneous ideal. The presupposition of Nature, as a system undergoing evolution, is therefore the causal activity of our Pure Ideals. These are our three organic and organizing conceptions called the True, the Beautiful, and the Good.}}

However, [[Edward Feser]] argues, in line with the Aristotelian and [[Thomism|Thomistic]] tradition, that finality has been greatly misunderstood. Indeed, without finality, efficient causality becomes inexplicable. Finality thus understood is not purpose but that end towards which a thing is ordered.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite book | last1=Feser | first1=Edward | orig-year=2009 | title=Aquinas: A Beginner's Guide | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2qhHE-6Mn4C | series=Beginner's Guides | edition=Reprint | location=Oxford | publisher=Oneworld Publications | publication-date=2011 | page=| isbn=9781780740065 | access-date=2018-03-12 | quote=[...] three principles are central to Aquinas's general metaphysics [...] the principle of finality is in a sense the most fundamental of them, given that the final cause is 'the cause of causes': for, again in Aquinas's' view an efficient cause can bring an effect in to being only if it is 'directed towards' that effect; and it is ultimately in that sense that the effect is 'contained in' the efficient cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When a match is rubbed against the side of a matchbox, the effect is not the appearance of an elephant or the sounding of a drum, but fire.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare: {{cite book | last1=Feser | first1=Edward | orig-year=2009 | title=Aquinas: A Beginner's Guide | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2qhHE-6Mn4C | series=Beginner's Guides | edition=Reprint | location=Oxford | publisher=Oneworld Publications | publication-date=2011 | page=| isbn=9781780740065 | access-date=2018-03-12 | quote=A match, for example, reliably generates flame and heat when struck, and never (say) frost and cold, or the smell of lilacs, or thunder.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effect is not arbitrary because the match is ordered towards the end of fire&lt;ref&gt;Compare:The match is 'directed towards' the production of fire and heat [...]&lt;/ref&gt; which is realized through efficient causes.

In their theoretical study of organism, more specifically propagating organisation of process, Kauffman ''et al.'' remark (p30): {{quote|Our language is teleological. We believe that autonomous agents constitute the minimal physical system to which teleological language rightly applies.&lt;ref&gt;

==In modern science==
{{See also|Teleology#Teleology and science}}

[[Francis Bacon]] wrote in his ''[[Advancement of Learning]]'' (1605) that natural science "doth make inquiry, and take consideration of the same natures : but how? Only as to the material and efficient causes of them, and not as to the forms." According to the demands of Bacon, apart from the "[[Physical law|laws of nature]]" themselves, the causes relevant to natural [[science]] are only [[efficient cause]]s and [[material cause]]s in terms of Aristotle's classification, or to use the formulation which became famous later, all nature visible to human science is matter and motion. Using the terminology of Aristotle, he divided knowledge into physics and metaphysics in ''[[The New Organon]]''. &lt;blockquote&gt;From the two kinds of axioms which have been spoken of arises a just division of philosophy and the sciences, taking the received terms (which come nearest to express the thing) in a sense agreeable to my own views. Thus, let the investigation of forms, which are (in the eye of reason at least, and in their essential law) eternal and immutable, constitute [[Metaphysics]]; and let the investigation of the efficient cause, and of matter, and of the latent process, and the latent configuration (all of which have reference to the common and ordinary course of nature, not to her eternal and fundamental laws) constitute [[Physics]]. And to these let there be subordinate two practical divisions: to Physics, Mechanics; to Metaphysics, what (in a purer sense of the word) I call Magic, on account of the broadness of the ways it moves in, and its greater command over nature. Francis Bacon ''The New Organon'', Book II, Aphorism 9, 1620&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bacon's position became the standard one for modern science.

===Biology===
{{main article|Teleology in biology}}

Explanations in terms of final causes remain common [[Teleology in biology|in evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref name="Lennox 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayala 1998"&gt;[[Francisco J. Ayala|Ayala, Francisco]] (1998). "Teleological explanations in evolutionary biology." ''Nature's purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco J. Ayala]] has claimed that teleology is indispensable to biology since the concept of [[adaptation]] is inherently teleological.&lt;ref name="Ayala 1998" /&gt; In an appreciation of [[Charles Darwin]] published in ''Nature'' in 1874, [[Asa Gray]] noted "Darwin's great service to Natural Science" lies in bringing back Teleology "so that, instead of Morphology ''versus'' Teleology, we shall have Morphology wedded to Teleology". Darwin quickly responded, "What you say about Teleology pleases me especially and I do not think anyone else has ever noticed the point."&lt;ref name="Lennox 1993"/&gt; [[Francis Darwin]] and [[T. H. Huxley]] reiterate this sentiment. The latter wrote that "..the most remarkable service to the philosophy of Biology rendered by Mr. Darwin is the reconciliation of Teleology and Morphology, and the explanation of the facts of both, which his view offers."&lt;ref name="Lennox 1993"/&gt; [[James G. Lennox]] states that Darwin uses the term 'Final Cause' consistently in his ''Species Notebook'', ''Origin of Species'' and after.&lt;ref name="Lennox 1993"/&gt;

Contrary to the position described by [[Francisco J. Ayala]], [[Ernst Mayr]] states that "adaptedness... is ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' result rather than an a priori goal-seeking."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst W.]] (1992). "The idea of teleology" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 53, 117–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Various commentators view the teleological phrases used in modern evolutionary biology as a type of shorthand. For example, S. H. P. Madrell writes that "the proper but cumbersome way of describing change by evolutionary adaptation [may be] substituted by shorter overtly teleological statements" for the sake of saving space, but that this "should not be taken to imply that evolution proceeds by anything other than from mutations arising by chance, with those that impart an advantage being retained by natural selection."&lt;ref&gt;Madrell SHP (1998) "Why are there no insects in the open sea?" ''The Journal of Experimental Biology'' '''201''':2461–2464.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lennox states that in evolution as conceived by Darwin, it is true both that evolution is the result of mutations arising by chance and that evolution is teleological in nature.&lt;ref name="Lennox 1993" /&gt;

Statements that a species does something "in order to" achieve survival are teleological. The validity or invalidity of such statements depends on the species and the intention of the writer as to the meaning of the phrase "in order to". Sometimes it is possible or useful to rewrite such sentences so as to avoid teleology.&lt;ref name=Reiss&gt;{{cite book |author=Reiss, John O. |date=2009 |title=Not by Design: Retiring Darwin's Watchmaker |publisher=University of California Press |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences so that they do not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology even if that is not the intention.

==Heidegger on technology==

In ''[[The Question Concerning Technology]]'', [[Martin Heidegger]] describes the four causes as follows:

#''causa materialis'' is the material or matter
# ''causa formalis'' is the form or shape the material or matter enters
# ''causa finalis'' is the end
# ''causa efficiens'' is the effect that brings about the finished result.{{sfn|Heidegger|1977|pp=289-290}}

Heidegger explains it thus:

{{quote|Whoever builds a house or a ship or forges a sacrificial chalice reveals what is to be brought forth, according to the terms of the four modes of occasioning.{{sfn|Heidegger|1977|p=295}}}}

The educationist David Waddington comments that although the efficient cause, which he identifies as "the craftsman", might be thought the most significant of the four, in his view each of Heidegger's four causes is "equally co-responsible" for producing a craft item, in Heidegger's terms "bringing forth" the thing into existence. Waddington cites Lovitt's description of this bringing forth as "a unified process".&lt;ref name="Waddington2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Waddington, David |title=A Field Guide to Heidegger Understanding {{!}} ''The Question Concerning Technology'' |journal=Educational Philosophy and Theory |date=2005 |volume=37 |issue=4 |page=568 |url=https://www.academia.edu/540032/A_Field_Guide_to_Heidegger_Understanding_The_Question_concerning_Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lovitt1972&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lovitt, W. |date=1972 |title=A Gesprach with Heidegger on Technology, Man and World |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=44–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tinbergen's four questions==
{{main|Tinbergen's four questions}}

[[Tinbergen's four questions]], named after the [[ethologist]] [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and based on Aristotle's four causes, are complementary categories of explanations for [[animal behaviour]]. They are also commonly referred to as levels of analysis. The four questions are on [[function (biology)|function]], what an [[adaptation]] does that is [[natural selection|selected for]] in [[evolution]]; [[phylogeny]], the evolutionary history of an [[organism]], revealing its relationships to other species; [[mechanism (biology)|mechanism]], namely the proximate cause of a behaviour, such as the role of [[testosterone]] in [[aggression]]; and [[ontogeny]], the [[developmental biology|development]] of an organism from egg to embryo to adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacDougall-Shackleton |first=Scott A. |date=2011-07-27 |title=The levels of analysis revisited |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=366 |issue=1574 |pages=2076–2085 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0363 |pmc=3130367 |pmid=21690126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h&amp;h&gt;Hladký, V. &amp; Havlíček, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">In mathematics, '''Hopf conjecture''' may refer to one of several conjectural statements from [[differential geometry]] and [[topology]] attributed to either [[Eberhard Hopf]] or [[Heinz Hopf]].

== Positively curved Riemannian manifolds ==

: ''A compact, even-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] with positive [[sectional curvature]] has positive [[Euler characteristic]]'' 

For [[differential geometry of surfaces|surfaces]], this follows from the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]]. For [[4-manifold|four-dimensional manifolds]], this follows from the finiteness of the [[fundamental group]] and  [[Poincaré duality]]. The conjecture has been proved for manifolds of dimension 4''k''+2 or 4''k''+4 admitting an isometric [[torus action]] of a ''k''-dimensional torus and for manifolds ''M'' admitting an isometric action of a compact [[Lie group]] ''G'' with principal isotropy subgroup ''H'' and cohomogeneity ''k'' such that

: &lt;math&gt; k-(\operatorname{rank} G-\operatorname{rank} H)\leq 5. &lt;/math&gt; 

In a related conjecture, "positive" is replaced with "nonnegative".

== Riemannian symmetric spaces == 
: ''A compact [[symmetric space]] of rank greater than one cannot carry a Riemannian metric of positive sectional curvature.'' 

In particular, the four-dimensional manifold ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; should admit no [[Riemannian metric]] with positive sectional curvature.

== Aspherical manifolds ==
: ''Suppose M&lt;sup&gt;2k&lt;/sup&gt; is a closed, [[aspherical manifold]] of even dimension. Then its Euler characteristic satisfies the inequality''

:: &lt;math&gt; (-1)^k\chi(M^{2k})\geq 0. &lt;/math&gt; 

This topological version of Hopf conjecture for [[Riemannian manifold]]s is due to [[William Thurston]]. [[Ruth Charney]] and [[Michael Davis (mathematician)|Michael Davis]] conjectured that the same inequality holds for a nonpositively curved piecewise Euclidean (PE) manifold.

== Metrics with no  conjugate points==

: ''A Riemannian metric without conjugate points on n-dimensional torus is flat.''

This theorem was proved by Dmitri Burago and Sergei Ivanov.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Burago and Sergei Ivanov, ''Riemannian tori without conjugate points are flat'', [[Geometric and Functional Analysis]] '''4''' (1994), no. 3, 259-269, {{doi| 10.1007/BF01896241}}, {{MR|1274115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Day of the Girl Child''' is an international observance day declared by the United Nations; it is also called the '''Day of Girls''' and the '''International Day of the Girl'''. [[October 11]], 2012, was the first Day of the Girl Child. The observation supports more opportunity for girls and increases awareness of [[gender inequality]] faced by girls worldwide based upon their gender. This inequality includes areas such as [[right to education|access to education]], nutrition, legal rights, medical care, and protection from discrimination, [[violence against women]] and [[forced marriage|forced]] [[child marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/10/united-nations-malala-girls-education.html|title=As Malala Recovers, U.N.

The Day of Girls helps raise awareness not only of the issues that girls face, but also what is likely to happen when those problems are solved. For example, educating girls helps reduce the rate of child marriage, disease and helps strengthen the [[economy]] by helping girls have access to higher paying jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://schoolsofthought.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/11/education-a-focus-on-international-day-of-the-girl-child/|title=Education a Focus on International Day of the Girl Child|last=Krache|first=Donna|date=11 October 2012|work=CNN|access-date=11 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/camille-crittenden/science-math-programs-matter_b_1944249.html|title=International Day of the Girl: Why Science &amp; Math Programs Matter|last=Crittenden|first=Camille|date=8 October 2012|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=11 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:International Day of the Girl Child for 2014.jpg|alt=Girls at a 2014 International Day of the Girl Child Event.|thumb|Girls at a 2014 International Day of Girls Event.]]
The International Day of Girls initiative began as a project of [[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan International]], a non-governmental organization that operates worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=201609280700CANADANWCANADAPR.C2019&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Challenge Accepted!

Plan International representatives in [[Canada]] approached the Canadian federal government to seek to the coalition of supporters [[raised awareness]] of the initiative internationally. Eventually, Plan International urged the [[United Nations]] to become involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katy-ma-/international-day-of-the-girl_b_4080548.html|title=What Is the International Day of the Girl Child?|last=Ma|first=Katy|date=10 October 2013|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=11 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International Day of Girls was formally proposed as a resolution by Canada in the United Nations General Assembly. [[Rona Ambrose]], Canada's Minister for the Status of Women, sponsored the resolution; a delegation of women and girls made presentations in support of the initiative at the 55th [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]]. On December 19, 2011, the United Nations General Assembly voted to pass a resolution adopting October 11, 2012 as the inaugural International Day of Girls.&lt;ref name="ambrose1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ambrose, Rona and Rosemary McCarney|title=International Day of the Girl Child: girls' rights are human rights|url=http://blogs.edmontonjournal.com/2011/12/29/international-day-of-the-girl-child-a-canadian-accomplishment/|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=Edmonton Journal|date=December 29, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719031013/http://blogs.edmontonjournal.com/2011/12/29/international-day-of-the-girl-child-a-canadian-accomplishment/|archivedate=July 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution states that the Day of Girls recognizes {{blockquote|[the] empowerment of and investment in girls, which are critical for economic growth, the achievement of all [[Millennium Development Goal]]s, including the [[poverty reduction|eradication of poverty]] and [[extreme poverty]], as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing also that empowering girls requires their active participation in [[decision-making]] processes and the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, as well as boys and men and the wider community [...] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution Adopted by the General Assembly: 66/170 International Day of the Girl Child|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/66/170|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; |sign=|source=}}

Isolation reduces the opportunity of the abused to be rescued or escape from the abuse. It also helps [[Destabilisation|disorientate]] the abused and makes the abused more dependent on the abuser. The degree of power and control over the abused is contingent upon the degree of his or her physical or emotional isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P3883.html |title=The Theory and Practice of Blackmail |publisher=RAND |date=1959-03-10 |accessdate=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan Richard Thoreson |url=https://www.outrightinternational.org/content/blackmail-and-extortion-lgbt-people-sub-saharan-africa |title=Blackmail and Extortion of LGBT People in Sub-Saharan Africa &amp;#124; OutRight |publisher=Outrightinternational.org |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An important element of psychological control is the isolation of the victim from the outside world.&lt;ref name="WHO 2013 p. 7"&gt;[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/85239/1/9789241564625_eng.pdf ''Global and regional estimates of violence against women: prevalence and health effects of intimate partner violence and non-partner sexual violence.''] World Health Organization. 2013. {{ISBN|978-92-4-156462-5}}. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Isolation includes [[Abusive power and control|controlling]] a person's social activity: who they see, who they talk to, where they go and any other method to limit their access to others. It may also include limiting what material is read.&lt;ref name="Duluth model"&gt;[http://www.theduluthmodel.org/pdf/PowerandControl.pdf ''Power and Control.''] Duluth Model. Retrieved April 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It can include insisting on knowing where they are and requiring permission for medical care. The abuser exhibits hypersensitive and reactive jealousy.&lt;ref name="WHO 2013 p. 7" /&gt;

Isolation can be aided by:

==In workplace bullying==
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Isolation is a common element of workplace bullying. It includes preventing access to opportunities, physical or social isolation, withholding necessary information, keeping the target out of the loop, ignoring or [[Social exclusion|excluding]].&lt;ref name="Rayner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peyton"/&gt;

Workplace isolation is a defined category in the workplace power and control wheel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Duthie_workplace-power-control-wheel_2013.pdf Power &amp; Control in the Workplace] American Institute on Domestic Violence&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isolation itself as abuse or punishment==
Isolation may itself be considered to be abuse or intended as [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] – see [[silent treatment]], [[ostracism]], [[social rejection]], [[shunning]], [[social exclusion]], [[blacklisting]], [[solitary confinement]] and [[sensory deprivation]].

==Non-coercive isolation==
Isolation may also be voluntarily sought by an individual or as a response to circumstances without being  directly imposed by another – see [[social isolation]], [[emotional isolation]], [[solitude]], [[recluse]] and [[hermit]].

==Academic biography==
Shapiro obtained his Bachelor's degree in English from [[Harvard College]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="crimson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bwsp"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/13/science/the-biologist-who-saw-a-pattern.html|title=The Biologist Who Saw a Pattern|first=Gina|last=Kolata|authorlink=Gina Kolata|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=October 13, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, inspired by a [[genetics]] course he had taken as a senior,&lt;ref name="beckwith"&gt;{{citation|title=Making genes, making waves: a social activist in science|first=Jonathan R.|last=Beckwith|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-674-00928-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; he shifted from English to science, earned a doctorate in genetics from [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] in 1968, and did postdoctoral research with [[Jon Beckwith]] at the [[Harvard Medical School]]. He was troubled by the potential [[genetic engineering]] applications of his research.&lt;ref name="beckwith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/05/science/elusive-genetic-switch-at-last-yields-image-of-its-3-d-structure.html|title=Elusive Genetic Switch At Last Yields Image Of Its 3-D Structure|first=Gina|last=Kolata|authorlink=Gina Kolata|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=March 5, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Harvard Geneticist Turns to Social Ills|journal=[[Boston Globe]]|first=Richard|last=Knox|date=January 20, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent two years teaching genetics in [[Havana, Cuba]], before returning to another postdoctorate with Harlyn Halvorson at [[Brandeis University]].&lt;ref name="bwsp"/&gt; Since 1973, he has worked as a professor of microbiology at the University of Chicago, and has also been a visiting professor from time to time, including once as a Darwin Prize Visiting Professor at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://shapiro.bsd.uchicago.edu/cv.shtml | title=Curriculum Vitae, James A. Shapiro | publisher=University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
While working with Beckwith at Harvard, Shapiro was part of the first team to isolate a single [[gene]] from an organism.&lt;ref name="bwsp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/11/23/archives/scientists-isolate-a-gene-step-in-heredity-control-scientists.html|title=Scientists Isolate a Gene; Step in Heredity Control|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=November 23, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/12/08/archives/playing-with-biological-fire.html|title=Playing With Biological Fire|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=8 December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene they isolated was ''[[lac operon|lacZ]]'', which codes for the [[β-galactosidase]] [[enzyme]] used by ''[[E. coli]]'' bacteria to digest the sugars in milk. Their technique involved [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] of two complementary copies of the gene into two different [[bacteriophage]]s, then mixing the genetic material from the two phages, and finally using a [[nuclease]] to degrade the single-stranded phage genome, leaving only the double-stranded DNA formed by the two copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppRmC9-a6JQC&amp;pg=PA42|title=The lac Operon: a short history of a genetic paradigm|first=Benno|last=Müller-Hill|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1996|isbn=978-3-11-014830-5|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' in 1979, Shapiro was the first to propose [[replicative transposition]] as a mechanism for gene mobility. In this model, genes such as [[retrotransposon]]s are copied from one [[DNA]] sequence to another via a process in which the two sequences combine to form an intermediate "theta" shape, sometimes called a "Shapiro intermediate".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8oIaOGHURroC&amp;pg=PA46|title=Lateral DNA transfer: mechanisms and consequences|first=Frederic|last=Bushman|publisher=CSHL Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-87969-621-4|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Shapiro showed that bacteria cooperate in communities that exhibit complex behavior such as [[hunting]], building protective structures, and spreading spores, and in which individual bacteria may sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the larger community.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/05/science/some-thoughts-on-self-sacrifice.html|title=Some Thoughts on Self Sacrifice|first=Malcolm W.|last=Browne|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=July 5, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/13/science/bacteria-are-found-to-thrive-on-a-rich-social-life.html|title=Bacteria Are Found to Thrive on a Rich Social Life|journal=[[New York Times]]|first=Gina|last=Kolata|authorlink=Gina Kolata|date=October 13, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Scientist uncovers secret lives of bacteria|journal=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=December 15, 2004|first=Sandra|last=Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this work, Shapiro believes that cooperative behavior is a fundamental organizing concept for biological activity at all levels of complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/14/science/biologists-tally-generosity-s-rewards.html|title=Biologists Tally Generosity's Rewards|journal=[[New York Times]]|first=Malcolm W.|last=Browne|date=April 14, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro has also studied [[pattern formation]] in bacteria, an area where he feels that there are new mathematical principles to be discovered that also underlie the growth of [[crystal]]s and the shape of [[cosmology|cosmological structures]].&lt;ref name="bwsp"/&gt; For instance, he found that the gut bacterium ''[[Proteus mirabilis]]'' forms complex terraced rings, an [[emergent property]] of simple rules that the bacterium uses to avoid neighboring cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Making the complex simple|date=January 25, 2001|journal=[[The Economist]]|url=http://www.economist.com/node/484994?Story_ID=484994&amp;CFID=756778&amp;CFTOKEN=91709399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has proposed the term [[natural genetic engineering]] to account for how novelty is created in the course of biological evolution. It has been criticized by some.&lt;ref&gt;Bezak, Eva (2011). "(Review) Evolution: A View from the 21st Century". Australasian Physical &amp; Engineering Science in Medicine 34 (4): 643–645.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buratti, Emanuele (2012). "Evolutionary Lessons for 21st Century Molecular Biotechnologists". Molecular Biotechnology 52 (1): 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Laurence A (May–June 2011). "(Review) Evolution: A View from the 21st Century". Reports of the National Center for Science Education 32.3 (9): 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seoighe, Cathal (2012). "(Review) Evolution: A View from the 21st Century". Trends in Evolutionary Biology 4 (e6): 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Types of Karma.JPG|thumb|Broad classification of ''Karmas'' as per Jain philosophy]]
{{Jainism}}
'''Karma''' is the basic principle within an overarching psycho-cosmology in [[Jainism]]. Human moral actions form the basis of the transmigration of the [[soul]] (''{{IAST|[[Jiva|jīva]]}}''). The soul is constrained to a cycle of rebirth, trapped within the [[Temporality|temporal]] world (''{{IAST|[[Samsara (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]}}''), until it finally achieves liberation (''{{IAST|[[Moksa (Jainism)|mokṣa]]}}''). Liberation is achieved by following a path of purification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapple|1990|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains believe that karma is a physical substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul by the actions of that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the [[causality]] of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the [[soul]]—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (''[[Lesya|leśyā]]''). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and [[Reincarnation|reincarnates]] in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.

Jains cite [[problem of evil|inequalities, sufferings, and pain]] as evidence for the existence of karma. Various types of karma are classified according to their effects on the potency of the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (''[[asrava|āsrava]]'') and bondage (''[[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]]''), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the [[Intentionality|intentions]] behind those deeds. The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates any reliance on some supposed existence of [[divine grace]] or [[retributive justice|retribution]]. The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.

== Philosophical overview ==

According to Jains, all souls are intrinsically pure in their inherent and ideal state, possessing the qualities of infinite knowledge, infinite perception, infinite bliss and infinite energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|pp=104–06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contemporary experience, these qualities are found to be defiled and obstructed, on account of the association of these souls with karma. The soul has been associated with karma in this way throughout an eternity of beginning-less time.&lt;ref name=Jaini107&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bondage of the soul is explained in the [[Jain Agamas|Jain texts]] by analogy with gold ore, which—in its natural state—is always found unrefined of admixture with impurities. Similarly, the ideally pure state of the soul has always been overlaid with the impurities of karma. This analogy with gold ore is also taken one step further: the purification of the soul can be achieved if the proper methods of refining are applied.&lt;ref name=Jaini107/&gt; Over the centuries, [[Jain monasticism|Jain monks]] have developed a large and sophisticated corpus of literature describing the nature of the soul, various aspects of the working of karma, and the ways and means of attaining ''{{IAST|mokṣa}}''.&lt;ref name=Jaini107/&gt;

=== Material theory ===
Jainism speaks of karmic "dirt", as karma is thought to be manifest as very subtle and sensually imperceptible particles pervading the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gombrich|2006|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are so small that one space-point—the smallest possible extent of space—contains an infinite number of karmic particles (or quantity of karmic dirt). It is these karmic particles that adhere to the soul and affect its natural potency.&lt;ref name =Jaini112&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; This material karma is called ''dravya karma''; and the resultant emotions—pleasure, pain, love, hatred, and so on—experienced by the soul are called ''bhava karma'', psychic karma.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The relationship between the material and psychic karma is that of cause and effect. The material karma gives rise to the feelings and emotions in worldly souls,&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Jain philosophy]] categorises the souls ''jivas'' into two categories: worldly souls, who are unliberated; and liberated souls, who are free from all karma.&lt;/ref&gt; which—in turn—give rise to psychic karma, causing emotional modifications within the soul. These emotions, yet again, result in influx and bondage of fresh material karma.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jhaveri|2001|pp=1328–1329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jains hold that the karmic matter is actually an agent that enables the consciousness to act within the material context of this universe. They are the material carrier of a soul's desire to physically experience this world. When attracted to the consciousness, they are stored in an interactive karmic field called ''{{IAST|kārmaṇa śarīra}}'', which emanates from the soul.&lt;ref name="Tatia1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|1994|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, karma is a subtle matter surrounding the consciousness of a soul. When these two components—consciousness and ripened karma—interact, the soul experiences life as known in the present material universe.&lt;ref name="Tatia1994" /&gt;

=== Self regulating mechanism ===

{{See also|Jain cosmology|Jainism and non-creationism}}

According to [[Indologist]] [[Robert J. Zydenbos]], karma is a system of natural laws, where actions that carry moral significance are considered to cause certain consequences in the same way as physical actions. When one holds an apple and then lets it go, the apple will fall. There is no judge, and no moral judgment involved, since this is a mechanical consequence of the physical action.&lt;ref name=zydenbos&gt;{{harvnb|Zydenbos|2006|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same manner, consequences occur naturally when one utters a lie, steals something, commits senseless violence or leads a life of debauchery. Rather than assume that these consequences—the moral rewards and retributions—are a work of some divine judge, Jains believe that there is an innate moral order in the cosmos, self-regulating through the workings of the law of karma. Morality and ethics are important in Jainism not because of a God, but because a life led in agreement with moral and ethical principles (''[[mahavrata]]'') is considered beneficial: it leads to a decrease—and finally to the total loss of—karma, which in turn leads to everlasting happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zydenbos|2006|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain conception of karma takes away the responsibility for salvation from God and bestows it on man himself. In the words of the Jain scholar, J. L. Jaini:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tukol|1980|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Jainism, more than any other creed, gives absolute religious independence and freedom to man. Nothing can intervene between the actions which we do and the fruits thereof. Once done, they become our masters and must fructify. As my independence is great, so my responsibility is co-extensive with it. I can live as I like; but my voice is irrevocable, and I cannot escape the consequences of it. No God, his Prophet or his deputy or beloved can interfere with human life. The soul, and it alone is responsible for all it does.}}

=== Predominance of karma ===

According to Jainism, karmic consequences are unerringly certain and inescapable. No divine grace can save a person from experiencing them. Only the practice of austerities and self-control can modify or alleviate the consequences of karma.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krishan, Yuvraj 1997 p.50"&gt;{{harvnb|Krishan|1997|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even then, in some cases, there is no option but to accept karma with equanimity. The second-century Jain text, ''Bhagavatī Ārādhanā'' (verse no. 1616) sums up the predominance of karma in Jain doctrine:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|There is nothing mightier in the world than karma; karma tramples down all powers, as an elephant a clump of lotuses.}} This predominance of karma is a theme often explored by Jain ascetics in the literature they have produced, throughout all centuries. [[Paul Dundas]] notes that the ascetics often used [[cautionary tale]]s to underline the full karmic implications of morally incorrect modes of life, or excessively intense emotional relationships. However, he notes that such narratives were often softened by concluding statements about the transforming effects of the protagonists' pious actions, and their eventual attainment of liberation.&lt;ref name="Dundas Paul 2002 p 101"&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biographies of legendary persons like [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]], in the Jain versions of the epics ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'',&lt;ref group=note&gt;
"The first Jain version of the ''{{IAST|Rāmāyaṇa}}'' was written in about the fourth century CE in {{IAST|Prākrit}} by {{IAST|Vimala Sūri}}." see Dundas, Paul (2002): pp. 238–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;
"The Jains seem at times to have employed the epic to engage in confrontation with the Hindus. In the sixteenth century, Jain writers in western India produced versions of the ''{{IAST|Mahābhārata}}'' libelling {{IAST|Viṣṇu}} who, according to another influential Hindu text, the ''{{IAST|Śiva Purāṇa}}'', had created a fordmaker-like figure who converted the demons to Jain mendicancy, thus enabling the gods to defeat them. Another target of these Jain ''{{IAST|Mahābhāratas}}'' was {{IAST|Kṛṣṇa}} who ceases to be the pious Jain of early {{IAST|Śvetāmbara}} tradition and instead is portrayed as a devious and immoral schemer." see Dundas, Paul (2002): p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;
also have karma as one of the major themes. The major events, characters and circumstances are explained by reference to their past lives, with examples of specific actions of particular intensity in one life determining events in the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|pp=237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jain texts narrate how even [[Māhavīra]], one of the most popular propagators of Jainism and the 24th ''{{IAST|[[Tirthankara|tīrthaṇkara]]}}'' (ford-maker),&lt;ref group=note&gt;The word ''{{IAST|[[Tirthankara|tīrthaṇkara]]}}'' is translated as ''ford-maker'', but is also loosely translated as a ''prophet'' or a ''teacher''. Fording means crossing or wading in the river. Hence, they are called ford-makers because they serve as ferrymen across the river of [[Samsara (Jainism)|transmigration]]. see Grimes, John (1996)  p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; had to bear the brunt of his previous karma before attaining ''[[Kevala Jnana|kevala jñāna]]'' ([[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]). He attained it only after bearing twelve years of severe austerity with detachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''{{IAST|[[Acaranga Sutra|Ācāranga Sūtra]]}}'' speaks of how Māhavīra bore his karma with complete equanimity, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratt|2007|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|He was struck with a stick, the fist, a lance, hit with a fruit, a clod, a potsherd. Beating him again and again many cried. When he once sat without moving his body many cut his flesh, tore his hair under pain, or covered him with dust. Throwing him up they let him fall, or disturbed him in his religious postures; abandoning the care of his body, the Venerable One humbled himself and bore pain, free from desires. As a hero at the head of the battle is surrounded by all sides, so was there Māhavīra. Bearing all hardships, the Venerable One, undisturbed, proceeded on the road to ''[[Nirvana (Jainism)|nirvāṇa]].''|Ācāranga Sūtra 8–356:60}}

=== Reincarnation and transmigration ===

Karma forms a central and fundamental part of Jain faith, being intricately connected to other of its philosophical concepts like transmigration, reincarnation, liberation, non-violence (''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]]'') and non-attachment, among others. Actions are seen to have consequences: some immediate, some delayed, even into future incarnations. So the doctrine of karma is not considered simply in relation to one life-time, but also in relation to both future incarnations and past lives. ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'' 3.3–4 states:&lt;ref name=krishan43&gt;{{harvnb|Krishan|1997|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this doctrine, Jainism attributes supreme importance to pure thinking and moral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rankin|2006|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Four states of existence===

{{See also|Jain cosmology}}

[[File:Gati or existences.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The soul travels to any one of the four states of existence after the death depending on its karmas]]

The Jain texts postulate four ''gatis'', that is states-of-existence or birth-categories, within which the soul transmigrates. The four ''gatis'' are: ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' (demi-gods), ''manuṣya'' (humans), ''[[Naraka (Jainism)|nāraki]]'' (hell beings) and ''tiryañca'' (animals, plants and micro-organisms).&lt;ref name=Jaini108&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four ''gatis'' have four corresponding realms or habitation levels in the vertically tiered [[Jain cosmology#Jain geography|Jain universe]]: demi-gods occupy the higher levels where the heavens are situated; humans, plants and animals occupy the middle levels; and hellish beings occupy the lower levels where seven hells are situated.&lt;ref name=Jaini108/&gt;

Single-sensed souls, however, called ''[[nigoda]]'',&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Jain hierarchy of life classifies living beings on the basis of the senses: five-sensed beings like humans and animals are at the top, and single sensed beings like microbes and plants are at the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; and element-bodied souls pervade all tiers of this universe. ''Nigodas'' are souls at the bottom end of the existential hierarchy. They are so tiny and undifferentiated, that they lack even individual bodies, living in colonies. According to Jain texts, this infinity of ''nigodas'' can also be found in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub–sub categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within ''[[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, God has no role to play in an individual's destiny; one's personal destiny is not seen as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather as a result of its own personal karma.&lt;ref name="Krishan1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Krishan|1997|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, ''[[Vyakhyaprajnapti|Bhagvati sūtra]]'' 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood leads to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows leads to rebirth in heaven.&lt;ref name="Krishan1997" /&gt;

===Lesya – colouring of the soul===
[[File:Lesya.jpg|right|thumb|The common representation of the mango tree and men analogy of the lesyas.]]
{{Main|Lesya}}

According to the Jain theory of karma, the karmic matter imparts a colour (''leśyā'') to the soul, depending on the mental activities behind an action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coloring of the soul is explained through the analogy of crystal, that acquires the color of the matter associated with it. In the same way, the soul also reflects the qualities of taste, smell and touch of associated karmic matter, although it is usually the colour that is referred to when discussing the ''leśyās''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Wiley | first =Kristi | title =Colors of the Soul: By-Products of Activity or Passions? | journal =[[Philosophy East and West]] | volume =50 | issue =3 | pages =351 | publisher =[[University of Hawaii Press|University of Hawai'i Press]] | location =Hawai'i | date =July 2000 | jstor =1400178 | issn =1527-943X}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'' 34.3 speaks of six main categories of ''leśyā'' represented by six colours: black, blue, grey, yellow, red and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobi|1895|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black, blue and grey are inauspicious ''leśyā'', leading to the soul being born into misfortunes. The yellow, red and white are auspicious ''leśyās'', that lead to the soul being born into good fortune.&lt;ref name=varni&gt;{{harvnb|Varni|1993|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'' describes the mental disposition of persons having black and white ''leśyās'':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobi|1895|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain texts further illustrate the effects of ''leśyās'' on the mental dispositions of a soul, using an example of the reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down.&lt;ref name=varni/&gt; The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six ''leśyās''. At one extreme, the person with the black ''leśyā'', having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white ''leśyā'', having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.&lt;ref name=varni/&gt;

=== Role of deeds and intent ===

The role of intent is one of the most important and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions. In Jainism, intent is important but not an essential precondition of sin or wrong conduct. Evil intent forms only one of the modes of committing sin.&lt;ref name=krishan47&gt;{{harvnb|Krishan|1997|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any action committed, knowingly or ''unknowingly'', has karmic repercussions. In certain philosophies, like Buddhism, a person is guilty of violence only if he had an intention to commit violence. On the other hand, according to Jains, if an act produces violence, then the person is guilty of it, whether or not he had an intention to commit it.&lt;ref name=koller23&gt;{{harvnb|Koller|2007|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Koller explains the role of intent in Jainism with the example of a monk, who unknowingly offered poisoned food to his brethren. According to the Jain view, the monk is guilty of a violent act if the other monks die because they eat the poisoned food; but according to the Buddhist view he would not be guilty.&lt;ref name=koller23/&gt; The crucial difference between the two views is that the Buddhist view excuses the act, categorizing it as non-intentional, since he was not aware that the food was poisoned; whereas the Jain view holds the monk to have been responsible, due to his ignorance and carelessness. Jains argue that the monk's very ignorance and carelessness constitute an intent to do violence and hence entail his guilt.&lt;ref name=koller23/&gt; So the absence of intent does not absolve a person from the karmic ''consequences'' of guilt either, according to the Jain analysis.

Intent is a function of [[Kashaya (Jainism)|kaṣāya]], which refers to negative emotions and negative qualities of mental (or deliberative) action. The presence of intent acts as an aggravating factor, increasing the vibrations of the soul, which results in the soul absorbing more karma.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krishan|1997|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is explained by ''[[Tattvarthasutra|Tattvārthasūtra]]'' 6.7: "[The] intentional act produces a strong karmic bondage and [the] unintentional produces weak, shortlived karmic bondage."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krishan|1997|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the physical act is also not a [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary condition]] for karma to bind to the soul: the existence of intent alone is sufficient. This is explained by [[Kundakunda]] (1st Century CE) in ''[[Samayasāra]]'' 262–263: "The intent to kill, to steal, to be unchaste and to acquire property, whether these offences are actually carried or not, leads to bondage of evil karmas."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krishan|1997|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jainism thus places an equal emphasis on the physical act as well as intent for binding of karmas.

== Origins and Influence ==

Although the doctrine of karma is central to all [[Indian religions]], it is difficult to say when and where in India the concept of karma originated. In Jainism, it is assumed its development took place in an era from which the literary documents are not available,{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=176}} since the basics of this doctrine were present and concluded even in the earliest documents of Jains.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=175}} ''[[Acaranga Sutra]]'' and ''[[Sutrakritanga]]'', contain a general outline of the doctrines of karma and reincarnation.&lt;ref name="E.B 2001 3357, 3372"&gt;{{harvnb|E.B|2001|pp=3357, 3372}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of this doctrine in Jainism might be in the teachings of Parsva, who is said to have lived about two hundred fifty years before Mahavira.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=176}} The Jain conception of karma—as something material that encumbers the soul—has an archaic nature&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freidhelm|1990|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; which justifies the hypothesis that it goes back to 8th or 9th century BCE.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=176}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glasenapp|2003|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present form of the doctrine seems to be unchanged at least since the time of Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE) who is respected by both the sects.{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=176}} This is supported by the fact that both Svetambara and Digambara sects agree on the basic doctrine, giving indication that it reached in its present form before the schism took place. Bhadrabahu is usually seen as the last leader of united Jain sangh. Detailed codification of types of karma and their effects were attested by [[Umasvati]] who is regarded by both Digambara and Svetambara as one of theirs.&lt;ref name="E.B 2001 3357, 3372"/&gt;

Jain and Buddhist scholar [[Padmanabh Jaini]] observes:&lt;ref name="jaini"&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|We are not yet in a position to explain definitivetly the earlier and more intense interest in karma shown by Jaina thinkers (and, to a lesser extent, by those of Buddhists) relative to their Brahmanic counterparts. Perhaps the entire concept that a person's situation and experiences are in fact the results of deeds committed in various lives may not be [[Aryan]] origin at all, but rather may have developed as a part of the indigenous [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Gangetic]] traditions from which the various Sramana movements arose. In any case we shall see, Jaina views on the process and possibilities of rebirth are distinctly non-Hindu; the social ramifications of these views, moreover, have been profound.}}

With regards to the influence of the theory of karma on development of various religious and social practices in ancient India, Dr. Padmanabh Jaini states:&lt;ref name="jaini-1"&gt;Padmanabh Jaini, Collected papers on Jaina Studies, Chapter 7, Pg 137&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The emphasis on reaping the fruits only of one's own karma was not restricted to the Jainas; both Hindus and Buddhist writers have produced doctrinal materials stressing the same point. Each of the latter traditions, however, developed practices in basic contradiction to such belief. In addition to ''[[śrāddha]]'' (the Hindu ritual of offering to the dead ancestors), we find among Hindus widespread adherence to the notion of divine intervention in one's fate, while (Mahayana) Buddhists eventually came to propound such theories like boon-granting [[Bodhisattva]]s, transfer of merit and like. Only Jains have been absolutely unwilling to allow such ideas to penetrate their community, despite the fact that there must have been tremendous amount of social pressure on them to do so.}}

The Jain socio-religious practices like regular fasting, practicing severe austerities and penances,&lt;ref name="Krishan, Yuvraj 1997 p.50"/&gt; the ritual death of ''[[Sallekhana]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rejection of God as the creator and operator of the universe can all be linked to the Jain theory of karma. Jaini notes that the disagreement over the karmic theory of transmigration resulted in the social distinction between the Jains and their Hindu neighbours.&lt;ref name=Jaini135&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one of the most important Hindu rituals, ''śrāddha'' was not only rejected but strongly criticized by the Jains as superstition.&lt;ref name=Jaini135/&gt; Certain authors have also noted the strong influence of the concept of karma on the [[Mahavrata|Jain ethics]], especially the ethics of non-violence. Once the doctrine of transmigration of souls came to include rebirth on earth in animal as well as human form, depending upon one's karmas, it is quite probable that, it created a humanitarian sentiment of kinship amongst all life forms and thus contributed to the notion of ''{{IAST|ahiṃsā}}'' (non-violence).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Patil|2006|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors affecting the effects of Karma ==
{{See also|Types of Karma (Jainism)}}
The nature of experience of the effects of the karma depends on the following four factors:&lt;ref name=sukhlal302/&gt;
*'''''Prakriti''''' (nature or type of karma) – According to Jain texts, there are eight main types of karma which categorized into the 'harming' and the 'non-harming'; each divided into four types. The harming karmas (''ghātiyā karmas'') directly affect the soul powers by impeding its perception, knowledge and energy, and also brings about delusion. These harming karmas are: ''darśanāvaraṇa'' (perception-obscuring karma), ''jñānavāraṇa'' (knowledge-obscuring karma), ''antarāya'' (obstacle-creating karma) and ''mohanīya'' (deluding karma). The non-harming category (''aghātiyā karmas'') is responsible for the reborn soul's physical and mental circumstances, longevity, spiritual potential and experience of pleasant and unpleasant sensations. These non-harming karmas are: ''nāma'' (body-determining karma), ''āyu'' (lifespan-determining karma), ''gotra'' (status-determining karma) and ''vedanīya'' (feeling-producing karma), respectively.&lt;ref name=sukhlal302&gt;{{harvnb|Sanghvi|1974|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of karmas thus affect the soul in different ways as per their nature.
*'''''Sthiti''''' (the [[Types of Karma#Duration of Karmas|duration of the karmic bond]]) – The karmic bond remains latent and bound to the consciousness up to the time it is activated. Although latent karma does not affect the soul directly, its existence limits the spiritual growth of the soul. Jain texts provide the minimum and the maximum duration for which such karma is bound before it matures.
*'''''Anubhava'''''  (intensity of karmas) – The degree of the experience of the karmas, that is, mild or intense, depends on the ''anubhava'' quality or the intensity of the bondage. It determines the power of karmas and its effect on the soul. ''Anubhava'' depends on the intensity of the passions at the time of binding the karmas. More intense the emotions—like anger, greed etc.—at the time of binding the karma, the more intense will be its experience at the time of maturity.
*'''''Pradesha''''' (The quantity of the karmas) – It is the quantity of karmic matter that is received and gets activated at the time of experience.&lt;ref name=sukhlal302/&gt;
Both emotions and activity play a part in binding of karmas. Duration and intensity of the karmic bond are determined by emotions or ''"[[Kashaya (Jainism)|{{IAST|kaṣāya}}]]"'' and type and quantity of the karmas bound is depended on ''yoga'' or activity.&lt;ref name=sukhlal302/&gt;

==The process of bondage and release==
The karmic process in Jainism is based on seven truths or fundamental principles (''[[Tattva (Jainism)|tattva]]'') of Jainism which explain the human predicament.&lt;ref name=soni&gt;{{Citation|last=Soni |first=Jayandra |editor=E. Craig |title=Jain Philosophy |journal=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1998 |url=http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT1 |accessdate=2008-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060722002023/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT1 |archivedate=22 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Out that the seven ''tattvas'', the four—influx (''[[Asrava|āsrava]]''), bondage (''[[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]]''), stoppage (''[[Samvara|saṃvara]]'')  and release (''[[Nirjara|nirjarā]]'')—pertain to the karmic process.&lt;ref name=soni/&gt;

===Attraction and binding===
[[File:Reincarnation AS.jpg|thumb|Representation of a soul undergoing reincarnation.]]
The karmic bondage occurs as a result of the following two processes: ''āsrava'' and ''bandha''.  ''Āsrava'' is the inflow of karma.&lt;ref name=Jaini112/&gt; The karmic influx occurs when the particles are attracted to the soul on account of ''[[Yoga#Jainism|yoga]]''. ''Yoga'' is the vibrations of the soul due to activities of mind, speech and body.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|1994|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''yoga'' alone do not produce bondage. The karmas have effect only when they are bound to the consciousness. This binding of the karma to the consciousness is called ''bandha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|1994|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the many causes of bondage, emotions or passions are considered as the main cause of bondage. The karmas are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions.&lt;ref name=Jaini112/&gt; The passions like anger, pride, deceit and greed are called sticky (''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|kaṣāyas]]'') because they act like glue in making karmic particles stick to the soul resulting in ''bandha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last =Reichenbach  | first =Bruce  | title =Karma, Causation, and Divine Intervention  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume =39  | issue =2  | pages =135–149  | publisher =University of Hawai press  | date =April 1989| doi =10.2307/1399374  | jstor =1399374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The karmic inflow on account of ''yoga'' driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|1994|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the ancient Jain texts talk of subduing these negative emotions:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1995|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote| When he wishes that which is good for him, he should get rid of the four faults—anger, pride, deceit and greed—which increase the evil. Anger and pride when not suppressed, and deceit and greed when arising: all these four black passions water the roots of re-birth.|Daśavaikālika sūtra, 8:36–39}}

=== Causes of attraction and bondage ===
{{Main|Causes of karma in Jainism}}

The Jain theory of karma proposes that karma particles are attracted and then bound to the consciousness of souls by a combination of four factors pertaining to actions: instrumentality, process, modality and motivation.&lt;ref name="tat"&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|1994|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''instrumentality''' of an action refers to whether the instrument of the action was: the body, as in physical actions; one's speech, as in [[Speech act theory|speech acts]]; or the mind, as in thoughtful deliberation.
*The '''process''' of an action refers to the temporal sequence in which it occurs: the decision to act, plans to facilitate the act, making preparations necessary for the act, and ultimately the carrying through of the act itself.
*The '''modality''' of an action refers to different modes in which one can participate in an action, for example: being the one who carries out the act itself; being one who instigates another to perform the act; or being one who gives permission, approval or endorsement of an act.
*The '''motivation''' for an action refers to the internal passions or negative emotions that prompt the act, including: anger, greed, pride, deceit and so on.

All actions have the above four factor present in them. When different [[permutation]]s of the sub-elements of the four factors are calculated, the Jain teachers speak of 108 ways in which the karmic matter can be attracted to the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sanghvi|1974|pp=239–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even giving silent assent or endorsement to acts of violence from far away has karmic consequences for the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Prasada, Ajit (1974) p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the scriptures advise carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as means to avoid the burden of karma.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Varni|1993|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Varni|1993|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the major [[Jain text]], ''[[Tattvartha sutra]]'':
&lt;ref name="Vidyanand2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jain|first=Vijay K.|title=Acharya Umasvami’s Tattvarthsutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLmx9bvtglkC|year=2011|publisher=Vikalp Printers|isbn=978-81-903639-2-1|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Wrong belief, non-abstinence, negligence, passions, and activities are the causes of bondage.|Tattvārthasūtra, 8-1}}
{{quote|The individual self attracts particles of matter which are fit to turn into karma, as the self is actuated by passions. This is bondage.|Tattvārthasūtra, 8-2}}
The causes of ''bandha'' or the karmic bondage—in the order they are required to be eliminated by a soul for spiritual progress—are:
* ''Mithyātva'' (Irrationality and a deluded world view) – The deluded world view is the misunderstanding as to how this world really functions on account of one-sided perspectives, perverse viewpoints, pointless generalisations and ignorance.
* ''Avirati'' (non-restraint or a vowless life) – ''Avirati'' is the inability to refrain voluntarily from the evil actions, that harms oneself and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of  ''avirati'' can only be overcome by observing the minor vows of a layman.
* ''Pramāda'' (carelessness and laxity of conduct) – This third cause of bondage consists of absentmindedness, lack of enthusiasm towards acquiring merit and spiritual growth, and improper actions of mind, body and speech without any regard to oneself or others.&lt;ref name=tatia190&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|1994|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|{{IAST|Kaṣāya}}]]'' (passions or negative emotions) –  The four passions—anger, pride, deceit and greed—are the primary reason for the attachment of the karmas to the soul. They keep the soul immersed in the darkness of delusion leading to deluded conduct and unending cycles of reincarnations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|1994|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Yoga'' (activities of mind, speech and body)

Each cause presupposes the existence of the next cause, but the next cause does not necessarily pre-suppose the existence of the previous cause.&lt;ref name=tatia190/&gt; A soul is able to advance on the spiritual ladder called ''[[Gunasthana|{{IAST|guṇasthāna}}]]'', only when it is able to eliminate the above causes of bondage one by one.

===Fruition===

[[File:Karma AS.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Karma as moral [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and reaction: [[Goodness and value theory|goodness]] sown is reaped as goodness.]]

The consequences of karma are inevitable, though they may take some time to take effect. To explain this, a Jain monk, Ratnaprabhacharya says:&lt;ref name="real"&gt;{{harvnb|Bhattacharya|1966|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The prosperity of a vicious man and misery of a virtuous man are respectively but the effects of good deeds and bad deeds done previously. The vice and virtue may have their effects in their next lives. In this way the law of causality is not infringed here.}}

The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately.&lt;ref name="real"/&gt; It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.&lt;ref name="real"/&gt;

Jain texts distinguish between the effect of the fruition of ''karma'' on a right believer and a wrong believer:
{{quote|The ignorant, engrossed in the nature of various species of karmas, enjoys the fruits of karmas (in the form of pleasure
and pain), and the knowledgeable is aware of the fruits of karmas but does not enjoy them|[[Samayasāra]] (10-9-316)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jain|first=Vijay K.|title=Acharya Kundkund's Samayasara|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwPT79iyRHMC|year=2012|publisher=Vikalp Printers|isbn=978-81-903639-3-8|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Modifications===
Although the Jains believe the karmic consequences as inevitable, Jain texts also hold that a soul has energy to transform and modify the effects of karma.&lt;ref name= Jaini139&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karma undergoes following modifications:

*''Udaya'' (maturity) – It is the fruition of karmas as per its nature in the due course.&lt;ref name=tatia257&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|2006|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Udīraṇa'' (premature operation) – By this process, it is possible to make certain karmas operative before their predetermined time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|2006|pp=257–258}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Udvartanā'' (augmentation) – By this process, there is a subsequent increase in duration and intensity of the karmas due to additional negative emotions and feelings.&lt;ref name=tatia257/&gt;
*''Apavartanā'' (diminution) – In this case, there is subsequent decrease in duration and intensity of the karmas due to positive emotions and feelings.&lt;ref name=tatia257/&gt;
*''{{IAST|Saṃkramaṇa}}'' (transformation) – It is the mutation or conversion of one sub-type of karmas into another sub-type. However, this does not occur between different types. For example, ''papa'' (bad karma) can be converted into ''[[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]]'' (good karma) as both sub-types belong to the same type of karma.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|2006|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Upaśamanā'' (state of subsidence) – During this state the operation of karma does not occur. The karma becomes operative only when the duration of subsidence ceases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|2006|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Nidhatti'' (prevention) – In this state, premature operation and transformation is not possible but augmentation and diminution of karmas is possible.&lt;ref name=tatia259&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|2006|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Nikācanā'' (invariance) – For some sub-types, no variations or modifications are possible—the consequences are the same as were established at the time of bonding.&lt;ref name=tatia259/&gt;

The Jain karmic theory, thus speaks of great powers of soul to manipulate the karmas by its actions.&lt;ref name= Jaini139/&gt;

===Release===
[[Jain philosophy]] assert that emancipation is not possible as long as the soul is not released from bondage of karma. This is possible by ''[[samvara]]'' (stoppage of inflow of new karmas) and ''[[nirjara|nirjarā]]'' (shedding of existing karmas through conscious efforts).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sanghvi|1974|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Samvara'' is achieved through practice of:
*Three ''guptis'' or three controls of mind, speech and body,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bhattacharya|1976|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Five ''samitis'' or observing carefulness in movement, speaking, eating, placing objects and disposing refuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bhattacharya|1976|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ten ''dharmas'' or observation of good acts like – forgiveness, humility, straightforwardness, contentment, truthfulness, self-control, penance, renunciation, non-attachment and continence.&lt;ref name=hari46&gt;{{harvnb|Bhattacharya|1976|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Anupreksha]]s'' or meditation on the truths of this universe.&lt;ref name=hari46/&gt;
*''Pariṣahajaya'', that is, a man on moral path must develop a perfectly patient and unperturbed attitude in the midst of trying and difficult circumstances.&lt;ref name=hari46/&gt;
*''Cāritra'', that is, endeavour to remain in steady spiritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bhattacharya|1976|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nirjarā'' is possible through ''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]'', austerities and penances. ''Tapas'' can be either external or internal. Six forms of external ''tapas'' are—fasting, control of appetite, accepting food under certain conditions, renunciation of delicious food, sitting and sleeping in lonely place and renunciation of comforts. Six forms of internal ''tapas'' are—atonement, reverence, rendering of service to worthy ones, spiritual study, avoiding selfish feelings and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bhattacharya|1976|pp=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
Justice Tukol notes that the supreme importance of the doctrine of karma lies in providing a rational and satisfying explanation to the apparent unexplainable phenomenon of birth and death, of happiness and misery, of inequalities and of existence of different species of living beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tukol|1980|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Sutrakritanga|Sūtrakṛtāṅga]]'', one of the oldest canons of Jainism, states:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krishan|1997|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Here in the east, west, north, and south many men have been born according to their merit, as inhabitants of this our world—some as Aryas, some as non-Aryas, some in noble families, some in low families, some as big men, some as small men, some of good complexion, some of bad complexion, some as handsome men, some as ugly men. And of these men one man is king.|Sūtrakṛtāṅga, 2.1.13}}
Jains thus cite inequalities, sufferings, and pain as evidence for the existence of karma. The theory of karma is able to explain day-to-day observable phenomena such as inequality between the rich and the poor, luck, differences in lifespan, and the ability to enjoy life despite being immoral. According to Jains, such inequalities and oddities that exist even from the time of birth can be attributed to the deeds of the past lives and thus provide evidence to existence of karmas:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirtivijay|1957|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|One is stout while another is lean; one is a master while another is a slave and similarly we find the high and the low, the mutilated and the lame, the blind and the deaf and many such oddities. The thrones of mighty monarchs are gone. The proud and the haughty have been humiliated in a moment and reduced to ashes. Even amongst the twins born of the same mother, we find one a dullard and another intelligent, one rich and another poor, one black and another white.  What is all this due to? They could not have done any deeds while they were in their mother's womb.  Then, why then should such oddities exist? We have then to infer that these disparities must be the result of their deeds in their past births though they are born together at one time. There are many oddities in this world and it will have to be admitted that behind all this some powerful force is at work whereby the world appears to be full of oddities.  This force is called 'karma'.  We are unable to perceive karma by our naked eyes, yet we are able to know it from its actions.}}

== Criticisms ==
The Jain theory of karma has been challenged from an early time by the [[Vedanta]] and {{IAST|[[Sāṃkhya]]}} branches of [[Hindu philosophy]].
In particular, Vedanta Hindus considered the Jain position on the supremacy and potency of karma, specifically its insistence on non-intervention by any Supreme Being in regard to the fate of souls, as ''nāstika'' or [[atheism|atheistic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pande|1978|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
For example, in a commentary to the [[Brahma Sutras]] (III, 2, 38, and 41), [[Adi Sankara]], argues that the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results at some future time; neither can super sensuous,  non-intelligent qualities like ''[[adrsta]]''—an unseen force being the metaphysical link between work and its result—by themselves mediate the appropriate, justly deserved pleasure and pain. The fruits, according to him, then, must be administered through the action of a conscious agent, namely, a supreme being ([[Ishvara]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last =Reichenbach  | first =Bruce R.  | title =Karma, causation, and divine intervention  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume =39  | issue =2  | pages = 135–149 [145]  | publisher =University of Hawaii Press  | location =Hawaii  | date = April 1989  | url =http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/reiche2.htm  | accessdate = 2009-12-29  | doi =10.2307/1399374  | jstor =1399374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;For the Jain refutation of the theory of God as operator and dispenser of karma, see [[Jainism and non-creationism]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Jainism's strong emphasis on the doctrine of karma and intense asceticism was also criticised by the Buddhists. Thus, the ''[[Samyutta Nikaya|Saṃyutta Nikāya]]'' narrates the story of Asibandhakaputta, a headman who was originally a disciple of Māhavīra. He debates with the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], telling him that, according to Māhavīra (Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta), a man's fate or karma is decided by what he does habitually. The Buddha responds, considering this view to be inadequate, stating that even a habitual sinner spends more time "not doing the sin" and only some time actually "doing the sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malalasekera|2003|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another Buddhist text ''[[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima Nikāya]]'', the Buddha criticizes Jain emphasis on the destruction of unobservable and unverifiable types of karma as a means to end suffering, rather than on eliminating evil mental states such as greed, hatred and delusion, which are observable and verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1975|pp=205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Upālisutta dialogue of this ''Majjhima Nikāya'' text, Buddha contends with a Jain monk who asserts that bodily actions are the most criminal, in comparison to the actions of speech and mind. Buddha criticises this view, saying that the actions of ''mind'' are most criminal, and not the actions of speech or body.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krishan|1997|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha also criticises the Jain ascetic practice of various austerities, claiming that he, Buddha, is happier when ''not'' practising the austerities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=29–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In the 8th century [[Jain text]] ''Aṣṭakaprakaraṇam'' (11.1–8), [[Haribhadra]] refutes the Buddhist view that austerities and penances results in suffering and pain. According to him suffering is on account of past karmas and not due to penances. Even if penances result in some suffering and efforts, they should be undertaken as it is the only means of getting rid of the karma. He compares it to the efforts and pains undertaken by a businessman to earn profit, which makes him happy. In the same way the austerities and penances are blissful to an ascetic who desires emancipation. See Haribhadrasūri, Sinha, Ashok Kumar, &amp; Jain, Sagarmal (2000) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

While admitting the complexity and sophistication of the Jain doctrine, Padmanabh Jaini compares it with that of Hindu doctrine of rebirth and points out that the Jain seers are silent on the exact moment and mode of rebirth, that is, the re-entry of soul in womb after the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of ''nitya-nigoda'', which states that there are certain categories of souls who have always been ''nigodas'', is also criticized. According to Jainism, ''nigodas'' are lowest form of extremely microscopic beings having momentary life spans, living in colonies and pervading the entire universe. According to Jaini, the entire concept of ''nitya-nigoda'' undermines the concept of karma, as these beings clearly would not have had prior opportunity to perform any karmically meaningful actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karma is also criticised on the grounds that it leads to the dampening of spirits with men suffering the ills of life because the course of one's life is determined by karma.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kalghatgi|1988|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often maintained that the impression of karma as the accumulation of a mountain of bad deeds looming over our heads without any recourse leads to fatalism. However, as Paul Dundas puts it, the Jain theory of karma does not imply lack of [[free will]] or operation of total [[determinism|deterministic]] control over destinies.&lt;ref name="Dundas Paul 2002 p 101"/&gt; Furthermore, the doctrine of karma does not promote fatalism amongst its believers on account of belief in personal responsibility of actions and that austerities could expatiate the evil karmas and it was possible to attain salvation by emulating the life of the Jinas.&lt;ref name="Krishan, Yuvraj 1997 p.50"/&gt;

'''Kripa''' (कृपा) is the concept of [[divine grace]] in [[Hinduism]]. It is the central tenet of [[Bhakti Yoga]] and [[Bhakti movement]]s, which are seen as reform movements in Hinduism as compared to the Hinduism which finds its origins in the [[Veda]]s;&lt;ref&gt;''The Embodiment of Bhakti'', by Karen Pechilis Prentiss, Oxford University Press US, 1999. {{ISBN|0-19-512813-3}}. ''Page 3-6.''&lt;/ref&gt; though variously it can mean "grace", "mercy", or "blessing", depending upon the context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/light/light_glo.html Glossary of Sanskrit Terms - Kripa] ''www.swami-krishnananda.org.''&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindi word Kirpala from Sanskrit Kripala means "kind" and is used as a given name for males, while "Kripa" (Kṛpā), is used as a female given name.

{{Hindu philosophy}}

== Significance of Kripa ==

Kripa is akin to similar beliefs prevalent in [[mysticism]] of all traditions. In Hinduism as well, the bestowal of divine grace or Kripa is considered an event which catapults a devotee or [[bhakta]] into a period of intense personal transformation leading to his [[Moksha]].

Devotional or [[Bhakti]] literature available throughout India is replete with references to Kripa as the ultimate key towards realizing the spiritual path of self-realization &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2005/06/30/stories/2005063000400900.htm Descent of divine grace] ''[[The Hindu]]'', June 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some like the ancient sage [[Vasistha]], in his classical work [[Yoga Vasistha]], considered it to be the only way to transcend the bondage of lifetimes of Karma. He states to [[Rama]] that divine grace or Kripa is the only way to help us go beyond the effects of [[Prarabdha karma]], or collection of all the past [[Karma]]s, [[Sanchita karma]] chosen to experience during a lifetime.

The [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosopher]] [[Madhvacharya]] held that grace was not a gift from God, but rather must be earned.&lt;ref&gt;McGreal,Ian. ''Great Thinkers of the Eastern World''. HarperResource, 1995. {{ISBN|978-0-06-270085-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Krishna]] says to [[Arjuna]] in the final chapter of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], ''Verse 18.66'', "Setting aside all meritorious deeds ([[Dharma]]), just [[surrender (religion)|surrender]] completely to My will (with firm faith and loving contemplation). I shall liberate you from all sins. Do not fear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Similarly, [[Adi Shankaracharya]] composes his famous verse [[Bhaja Govindam]] in 8th century, where he declares:
&lt;poem&gt;
:: "''Bhajagovindam bhajagovindam''
:: ''Govindam bhaja muudhamate''
:: ''Sampraapte sannihite kaale''
:: ''Nahi nahi rakshati dukrijnkarane.."''
:: Translation:
::Worship [[Govinda]], Worship Govinda,
:: Worship Govinda. Oh fool!
:: Rules of Grammar will not save you
:: At the time of your death.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The [[Skanda Purana]] mentions the grace of a [[Guru]] in various places, especially in the Uttarakhand, section ''Guru Strotram'', known as [[Guru Gita]], in the form of a dialogue between [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati|Uma]] (Shakti):
&lt;poem&gt;
:: "Guru Brahma Guru Vishnu
:: Guru Devo Maheshwara
:: Guru Sakshat Param Brahma
:: Tasmai Shri Gurave Namah"

:: "Dhyana Moolam Guru Murti.
:: Puja Moolam Gurur Padam,
:: Mantra Moolam Gurur Vakyam,
:: Moksha Moolam Guru Kripa".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogamag.net/archives/1983/gjuly83/stotram.shtml Guru Strotram]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

== Bhakti movement ==
{{main|Bhakti movement}}
[[Bhakti]] or devotion has often remained an ignored aspect in [[Indian philosophy]], hence its significance was lost to majority of the populace. For some time it was considered befitting only to the lower classes and woman, as only the elite were considered able to comprehend the message of the [[Vedic]] tradition. Things changed with the revival and reform movements in Hinduism which brought this aspect of Kripa into a new light and made the divine accessible to all, and not just the preserve of the priestly class.&lt;ref&gt;''Tradition and Modernity in Bhakti Movements'', by Jayant Lele. Published by Brill Archive, 1981. {{ISBN|90-04-06370-6}}. ''Page 6''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kinds of Kripa ==

Kripa has been categorized in various ways as [[Ishwara]] kripa (grace of God), variously [[Hari]] Kripa, [[Shastra]] kripa (grace of the Scriptures), [[Guru]] kripa (grace of the Guru) and lastly [[Atma (Hinduism)|Atma]] kripa (grace of the Self).

The '''People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs''' ({{lang|ru|Народный комиссариат внутренних дел}}, ''Narodnyy Komissariat Vnutrennikh Del''), abbreviated '''NKVD''' ({{lang|ru|НКВД}} {{Audio|ru-NKVD.ogg|listen}}), was the [[interior ministry]] of the [[Soviet Union]].

Established in 1917 as NKVD of Russian SFSR,&lt;ref name="semukhina74"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Semukhina|first1=Olga B.|last2=Reynolds|first2=Kenneth Michael|title=Understanding the Modern Russian Police|date=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781482218879|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idInAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT74|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the agency was originally tasked with conducting regular police work and overseeing the country's prisons and labor camps.&lt;ref name="huskey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huskey|first1=Eugene|title=Russian Lawyers and the Soviet State: The Origins and Development of the Soviet Bar, 1917-1939|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400854516|page=230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7n_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was disbanded in 1930, with its functions being dispersed among other agencies, only to be reinstated as an [[all-union ministry]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Semukhina|first1=Olga B.|last2=Reynolds|first2=Kenneth Michael|title=Understanding the Modern Russian Police|date=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439803493|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAnMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of the [[OGPU]] (the [[secret police]] organization) were transferred to the NKVD in 1934, giving it a monopoly over law enforcement activities that lasted until the end of World War II.&lt;ref name="huskey"/&gt; During this period, the NKVD included both ordinary public order activities, as well as secret police activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg V.|title=Stalin: New Biography of a Dictator|date=2015|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300166941|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dy7CCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NKVD is known for its role in [[Soviet political repressions|political repression]] and for carrying out the [[Great Purge]] under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Mobile [[gas van]]s were used to execute people without trial during the Great Purge.&lt;ref&gt;Yevgenia Albats, KGB: The State Within a State. 1995, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gellately.

Penguin Books, 2002 {{ISBN|0-14-200063-9}} p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; It was led by [[Genrikh Yagoda]], [[Nikolai Yezhov]] and [[Lavrentiy Beria]].

The NKVD undertook mass [[extrajudicial execution]]s of untold numbers of citizens, and conceived, populated and administered the [[Gulag]] system of [[forced labour]] camps. Their agents were responsible for the repression of the wealthier peasantry, as well as the mass deportations of [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|entire nationalities]]  to uninhabited regions of the country. They oversaw the [[Soviet Border Troops|protection of Soviet borders]] and espionage (which included [[political assassination]]s), and enforced [[Marxism-Leninism|Soviet policy]] in communist movements and puppet governments in other countries, most notably the repression and massacres in [[Polish Operation of the NKVD|Poland]].

In March 1946 all People's Commissariats were renamed to Ministries, and the NKVD became the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Statiev|first1=Alexander|title=The Soviet Counterinsurgency in the Western Borderlands|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521768337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YIRSwRDVqu4C&amp;pg=PR15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and structure ==
{{main|Cheka|Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies}}
[[File:1924 yagoda menshinsky dsershinsky.jpg|thumb|Early NKVD leaders [[Genrikh Yagoda]], [[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]] and [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], 1924]]

After the Russian [[February Revolution]] of 1917, the [[Provisional Government]] dissolved the [[Tsar]]ist police and set up the ''People's [[Militsiya]]''. The subsequent Russian [[October Revolution]] of 1917 saw a seizure of state power led by [[Lenin]] and the [[Bolshevik]]s, who established a new [[Bolshevik]] regime, the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR). The Provisional Government's [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD), formerly under [[Georgy Lvov]] (from March 1917) and then under [[Nikolai Avksentiev]] (from {{OldStyleDate|6 August|1917|24 July}}) and Alexei Nikitin (from {{OldStyleDate|8 October|1917|25 September}}), turned into NKVD (People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs) under a People's Commissar. However, the NKVD apparatus was overwhelmed by duties inherited from MVD, such as the supervision of the local governments and firefighting, and the ''Workers' and Peasants' Militsiya'' staffed by proletarians was largely inexperienced and unqualified. Realizing that it was left with no capable security force, the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the RSFSR established ({{OldStyleDate|20 December|1917|7 December}}) a secret political police, the ''[[Cheka]]'', led by [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]. It gained the right to undertake quick non-judicial trials and executions, if that was deemed necessary in order to "protect the Russian Socialist-[[Communist]] revolution".

The ''Cheka'' was reorganized in 1922 as the [[State Political Directorate]], or GPU, of the NKVD of the RSFSR.&lt;ref name="Malcher0"&gt;Blank Pages by G.C.Malcher {{ISBN|1-897984-00-6}} Page 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] formed, with the RSFSR as its largest member. The GPU became the [[OGPU]] (Joint State Political Directorate), under the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the USSR. The NKVD of the RSFSR retained control of the ''militsiya'', and various other responsibilities.

In 1934 the NKVD of the RSFSR was transformed into an all-union security force, the NKVD (which the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] leaders soon came to call "the leading detachment of our party"), and the OGPU was incorporated into the NKVD as the [[Main Directorate for State Security (USSR)|Main Directorate for State Security]] (GUGB); the separate NKVD of the RSFSR was not resurrected until 1946 (as the MVD of the RSFSR). As a result, the NKVD also took over control of all detention facilities (including the forced labor camps, known as the [[GULag]]) as well as the regular police. At various times, the NKVD had the following Chief Directorates, abbreviated as "ГУ"– {{lang|ru|Главное управление}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye upravleniye}}.
:ГУГБ – государственной безопасности, of State Security ([[GUGB]], {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye upravleniye gosudarstvennoi bezopasnosti}})
:ГУРКМ– рабоче-крестьянской милиции, of Workers and Peasants ''[[Militsiya]]'' ([[GURKM]], {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye upravleniye raboče-krest'yanskoi militsyi}})
:ГУПВО– пограничной и внутренней охраны, of Border and Internal Guards ([[GUPVO]], {{lang|ru-Latn|GU pograničnoi i vnytrennei okhrany}})
:ГУПО– пожарной охраны, of Firefighting Services ([[GUPO]], {{lang|ru-Latn|GU požarnoi okhrany}})
:ГУШосДор– шоссейных дорог, of Highways([[GUŠD]], {{lang|ru-Latn|GU šosseynykh dorog}})
:ГУЖД– железных дорог, of Railways ([[GUŽD]], {{lang|ru-Latn|GU železnykh dorog}})
:ГУЛаг– Главное управление исправительно-трудовых лагерей и колоний, ([[GULag]], {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye upravleniye ispravitelno-trudovykh lagerey i kolonii}})
:ГЭУ  – экономическое, of Economics (GEU, {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye ekonomičeskoie upravleniye}})
:ГТУ  – транспортное, of Transport (GTU, {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye transportnoie upravleniye}})
:ГУВПИ – военнопленных и интернированных, of [[POW]]s and interned persons ([[GUVPI]], {{lang|ru-Latn|Glavnoye upravleniye voyennoplennikh i internirovannikh}})

===Yezhov era===
[[File:Ezhov.PNG|upright|thumb|[[Nikolai Yezhov]], head of the NKVD from 1936–1939]]

Until the reorganization begun by [[Nikolai Yezhov]] with a purge of the regional political police in the autumn of 1936 and formalized by a May 1939 directive of the All-Union NKVD by which all appointments to the local political police were controlled from the center, there was frequent tension between centralized control of local units and the collusion of those units with local and regional party elements, frequently resulting in the thwarting of Moscow's plans.&lt;ref&gt;
James Harris, "[http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_ARTICLE=CMR_422_0423 Dual subordination ? The political police and the party in the Urals region, 1918–1953]", ''Cahiers du monde russe'' 22 (2001):423–446.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its establishment in 1934, the NKVD underwent many organizational changes; between 1938 and 1939 alone, the NKVD's structure and leadership changed three times.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

During Yezhov's time in office,  the [[Great Purge]] reached its height from the years 1937 and 1938 alone, at least 1.3 million were arrested and 681,692 were executed for 'crimes against the state'. The Gulag population swelled by 685,201 under Yezhov, nearly tripling in size in just two years, with at least 140,000 of these prisoners (and likely many more) dying of malnutrition, exhaustion and the elements in the camps (or during transport to them).&lt;ref&gt;Figes, Orlando (2007) ''The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia'' {{ISBN|0-8050-7461-9}}, page 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 1941, the 4th Department (Special Section, OO) of GUGB NKVD security service responsible for the Soviet Armed Forces military counter-intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.documentstalk.com/wp/gugb GUGB NKVD.] DocumentsTalk.com, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of 12 Sections and one Investigation Unit, was separated from GUGB NKVD USSR.&lt;br&gt; The official liquidation of OO GUGB within NKVD was announced on 12 February by a joint order № 00151/003 of NKVD and NKGB USSR. The rest of GUGB was abolished and staff was moved to newly created [[People's Commissariat for State Security]] (NKGB). Departments of former GUGB were renamed Directorates. For example, foreign intelligence unit known as Foreign Department (shortcut- INO) became Foreign Directorate (INU); GUGB political police unit represented by Secret Political Department (SPO) became Secret Political Directorate (SPU), and so on. The former GUGB 4th Department (OO) was split into three sections. One section, which handled military counter-intelligence in NKVD troops (former 11th Section of GUGB 4th Department OO) become 3rd NKVD Department or OKR (Otdel KontrRazvedki), the chief of OKR NKVD was Aleksander Belyanov.&lt;br&gt; 
After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the Soviet Union (June 1941),the NKGB USSR was abolished  and on July 20, 1941 the units that formed NKGB becomes  part of NKVD USSR. The military CI was also upgraded from department to directorate and pot in NKVD organization as (Directorate of Special Departments or UOO NKVD USSR). The only section  did not return to UOO NKVD till 11 of January 1942 was one responsible for counterintelligence in NKVMF (Navy). It returned to NKVD control in January 11 1942 as UOO 9th Department controlled by P. Gladkov. . In April 1943 Directorate of Special Departments was transformed in to SMERSH and transferred to People's Defense and Commissariates.  
The same time, the NKVD was reduced in size and duties  again by creating  NKGB as independent State 
Security  Commissariate.  
In 1946, all Soviet Commissariats were renamed "ministries". Accordingly, the Peoples Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) of the USSR became the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD), while the NKGB was renamed as the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|Ministry of State Security]] (MGB). In 1953, after the arrest of [[Lavrenty Beria]], the MGB merged back into the MVD. The police and security services finally split in 1954 to become:

* The USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), responsible for the criminal militia and [[prison|correctional facilities]].
* The USSR Committee for State Security ([[KGB]]), responsible for the [[political police]], intelligence, counter-intelligence, personal protection (of the leadership) and confidential communications.

===Main Directorates (Departments)===
* [[Main Directorate of State Security|State Security]]
* Workers-Peasants Militsiya
* Border and Internal Security
* Firefighting security
* [[Gulag|Correction and Labor camps]]
* ''Other smaller departments''
** Department of Civil registration
** Financial (FINO)
** Administration
** Human resources
** Secretariat
** Special assignment

==Ranking system (State Security)==
In 1935–1945 [[Main Directorate of State Security]] of NKVD had its own ranking system before it was merged in the Soviet military standardized ranking system.

== NKVD activities ==
The main function of the NKVD was to protect the [[state security]] of the Soviet Union. This role was accomplished through massive [[political repression]], including authorised murders of many thousands of politicians and citizens, as well as kidnappings, assassinations and mass deportations.

===Domestic repressions===
[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|NKVD chief [[Genrikh Yagoda]] (middle) inspecting the construction of the [[Moscow Canal|Moscow-Volga canal]], 1935]]
{{see also|Political repression in the Soviet Union}}

In implementing Soviet internal policy towards perceived enemies of the Soviet state ("[[enemies of the people]]"), untold multitudes of people were sent to GULAG camps and hundreds of thousands were executed by the NKVD. Formally, most of these people were convicted by [[NKVD troika]]s ("triplets")– special [[court martial|courts martial]]. Evidential standards were very low: a tip-off by an anonymous informer was considered sufficient grounds for arrest. Use of "physical means of persuasion" (torture) was sanctioned by a special decree of the state, which opened the door to numerous abuses, documented in recollections of victims and members of the NKVD itself. Hundreds of [[Mass graves in the Soviet Union|mass graves]] resulting from such operations were later discovered throughout the country. Documented evidence exists that the NKVD committed mass extrajudicial executions, guided by secret "plans". Those plans established the number and proportion of victims (officially "public enemies") in a given region (e.g. the quotas for clergy, former [[nobility|nobles]] etc., regardless of identity). The families of the repressed, including children, were also automatically repressed according to [[Order about Family Members of Traitors of the Motherland|NKVD Order no. 00486]].

The purges were organized in a number of waves according to the decisions of the [[Politburo]] of the Communist Party.  Some examples are the campaigns among engineers ([[Shakhty Trial]]), party and military elite plots ([[Great Purge]] with [[NKVD Order No. 00447|Order 00447]]), and medical staff ("[[Doctors' Plot]]").

A number of [[mass operations of the NKVD]] were related to the prosecution of whole ethnic categories. For example, the [[Polish Operation of the NKVD (1937–38)|Polish Operation]] of the NKVD in 1937–1938 resulted in the execution of 111,091 Poles.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Wendy Z. (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=D0_HYK8R-8IC&amp;pg=PA217 Inventing the Enemy: Denunciation and Terror in Stalin's Russia.]'' New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-19196-8}}. p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whole populations of certain ethnicities [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|were forcibly resettled]]. Foreigners living in the Soviet Union were given particular attention. When disillusioned American citizens living in the Soviet Union thronged the gates of the U.S. embassy in Moscow to plead for new U.S. passports to leave USSR (their original U.S. passports had been taken for 'registration' purposes years before), none were issued. Instead, the NKVD promptly arrested all of the Americans, who were taken to [[Lubyanka Prison]] and later shot.&lt;ref&gt;Tzouliadis, Tim, ''The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia'' Penguin Press (2008), {{ISBN|1-59420-168-4}}: Many of the Americans desiring to return home were communists who had voluntarily moved to the Soviet Union, while others moved to Soviet Union as skilled auto workers to help produce cars at the recently constructed GAZ automobile factory built by the [[Ford Motor Company]]. All were U.S. citizens.&lt;/ref&gt; American factory workers at the Soviet Ford [[GAZ]] plant, suspected by Stalin of being 'poisoned' by Western influences, were dragged off with the others to Lubyanka by the NKVD in the very same Ford [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Model A]] cars they had helped build, where they were tortured; nearly all were executed or died in labor camps. Many of the slain Americans were dumped in the mass grave at [[Yuzhnoye Butovo District]] near Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Tzouliadis, Tim, ''The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia'' Penguin Press (2008), {{ISBN|1-59420-168-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the people of the [[Soviet Republics]] still formed the majority of NKVD victims[*17][*18].

The NKVD also served as arm of the Russian Soviet communist government for the lethal mass persecution and destruction of ethnic minorities and religious beliefs, such as the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek Catholics]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and other religious organizations, an operation headed by [[Yevgeny Tuchkov]].

===International operations===
[[File:Lavrenti Beria Stalins family.jpg|thumb|[[Lavrentiy Beria]] with [[Stalin]] (in background) and Stalin's daughter Svetlana]]
During the 1930s, the NKVD was responsible for political murders of those Stalin believed to oppose him. Espionage networks headed by experienced multilingual NKVD officers such as [[Pavel Sudoplatov]] and [[Iskhak Akhmerov]] were established in nearly every major Western country, including the United States. The NKVD recruited agents for its espionage efforts from all walks of life, from unemployed intellectuals such as [[Mark Zborowski]] to aristocrats such as [[Martha Dodd]]. Besides the gathering of intelligence, these networks provided organizational assistance for so-called ''wet business'',&lt;ref&gt;Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.P. Putnam (1945), p. 18: NKVD expression for a political murder&lt;/ref&gt; where enemies of the USSR either disappeared or were openly liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, ''Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The NKVD's [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and ''[[special operations]]'' (''Inostranny Otdel'') unit organized overseas assassinations of political enemies of the USSR, such as leaders of nationalist movements, former Tsarist officials, and personal rivals of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Among the officially confirmed victims of such plots were:

* [[Leon Trotsky]], a personal political enemy of Stalin and his most bitter international critic, killed in Mexico City in 1940;
* [[Yevhen Konovalets]], prominent [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] patriot leader who was attempting to create a separatist movement in Soviet Ukraine; assassinated in [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands
*[[Yevgeny Miller]], former General of the Tsarist (Imperial Russian) Army; in the 1930s, he was responsible for funding anti-communist movements inside the USSR with the support of European governments. Kidnapped in Paris and brought to Moscow, where he was interrogated and executed
* [[Noe Ramishvili]], Prime Minister of independent [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], fled to France after the Bolshevik takeover; responsible for funding and coordinating Georgian nationalist organizations and the [[August uprising]], he was assassinated in Paris
* [[Boris Savinkov]], Russian revolutionary and anti-Bolshevik terrorist (lured back into Russia and killed in 1924 by the [[Trust Operation]] of the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]]);
* [[Sidney Reilly]], British agent of the [[MI6]] who deliberately entered Russia in 1925 trying to expose the [[Trust Operation]] to avenge Savinkov's death;
* [[Alexander Kutepov]], former General of the Tsarist (Imperial Russian) Army, who was active in organizing anti-communist groups with the support of French and British governments

Prominent political dissidents were also found dead under highly suspicious circumstances, including [[Walter Krivitsky]], [[Lev Sedov]], [[Ignace Reiss]] and former German Communist Party (KPD) member [[Willi Münzenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.P. Putnam (1945), pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orlov, Alexander, ''The March of Time'', St. Ermin's Press (2004), {{ISBN|1-903608-05-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, Christopher and Mitrokhin, Vasili, ''The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB'', Basic Books (2000), {{ISBN|0-465-00312-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-465-00312-9}}, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.

The pro-Soviet leader [[Sheng Shicai]] in Xinjiang received NKVD assistance in conducting a purge to coincide with Stalin's [[Great Purge]] in 1937. Sheng and the Soviets alleged a massive Trotskyist conspiracy and a "Fascist Trotskyite plot" to destroy the Soviet Union. The Soviet Consul General Garegin Apresoff, General [[Ma Hushan]], [[Ma Shaowu]], Mahmud Sijan, the official leader of the Xinjiang province Huang Han-chang and [[Hoja-Niyaz]] were among the 435 alleged conspirators in the plot. Xinjiang came under virtual Soviet control. Stalin opposed the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=warlords+and+muslims#v=snippet&amp;q=fascist%20trotskyite%20plotters&amp;f=false|title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911–1949|author=Andrew D.

===Spanish Civil War===

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], NKVD agents, acting in conjunction with the [[Communist Party of Spain]], exercised substantial control over the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] government, using Soviet military aid to help further Soviet influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert W. Pringle|title=Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Intelligence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9RQCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA288|year=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |pages=288–89|isbn=9781442253186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NKVD established numerous secret prisons around the capital [[Madrid]], which were used to detain, torture, and kill hundreds of the NKVD's enemies, at first focusing on [[Francoist Spain|Spanish Nationalists]] and [[Red Terror (Spain)|Spanish Catholics]], while from late 1938 increasingly anarchists and [[Leon Trotsky|Trotskyists]] were the objects of persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Andrew|title=The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TWUAQ7Xof8C&amp;pg=PA73|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|page=73|isbn=9780465003129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 [[Andrés Nin]], the secretary of the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|Trotskyist POUM]] and his colleagues were tortured and killed in an NKVD prison in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Clay Large|title=Between Two Fires: Europe's Path in the 1930s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_t-7jUEjQi8C&amp;pg=PA308|year=1991|publisher=W.W. Norton|page=308|isbn=9780393307573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II operations===
[[File:Victims of Soviet NKVD in Lvov, June 1941.jpg|thumb|The corpses of victims of the NKVD murdered in last days of June 1941, in one of the [[NKVD prisoner massacres]] just after outbreak of the German-Soviet War.]]

Prior to the German invasion, in order to accomplish its own goals, the NKVD was prepared to cooperate even with such organizations as the German [[Gestapo]]. In March 1940 representatives of the NKVD and the Gestapo met for one week in [[Zakopane]], to coordinate the pacification of Poland; ''see [[Gestapo-NKVD Conferences|Gestapo–NKVD Conferences]]''. For its part, the Soviet Union delivered hundreds of German and Austrian Communists to the Gestapo, as unwanted foreigners, together with their documents. However, many NKVD units were later to fight the Wehrmacht, for example the [[10th Rifle Division NKVD]], which fought at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].

After the German invasion the NKVD [[NKVD prisoner massacres|evacuated and killed prisoners]].

During World War II, NKVD [[Internal Troops]] units were used for rear area security, including preventing the retreat of Soviet Union army divisions. Though mainly intended for internal security, NKVD divisions were sometimes used at the front to stem the occurrence of [[desertion]] through Stalin's [[Order No. 270]] and [[Order No. 227]] decrees in 1941 and 1942, which aimed to raise troop morale via brutality and coercion. At the beginning of the war the NKVD formed 15 rifle divisions, which had expanded by 1945 to 53 divisions and 28 brigades.&lt;ref name=zaloga&gt;Zaloga, Steven J. ''The Red Army of the Great Patriotic War, 1941–45'', Osprey Publishing, (1989), pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;  A list of identified NKVD Internal Troops divisions can be seen at [[List of Soviet Union divisions]]. Though mainly intended for internal security, NKVD divisions were sometimes used in the front-lines, for example during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Crimean Offensive (1944)|Crimean Offensive of 1944]].&lt;ref name=zaloga/&gt; Unlike the [[Waffen-SS]], the NKVD did not field any armored or mechanized units.&lt;ref name=zaloga/&gt;

In the enemy-held territories, the NKVD carried out numerous missions of sabotage. After fall of [[Kiev]], NKVD agents set fire to the Nazi headquarters and various other targets, eventually burning down much of the city center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birstein|first1=Vadim|title=Smersh: Stalin's Secret Weapon|date=2013|publisher=Biteback Publishing|isbn=978-1849546898|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kg2uAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT589&amp;dq=NKVD+sabotage+kiev#v=onepage&amp;q=NKVD%20sabotage%20kiev&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar actions took place across the occupied Byelorussia and Ukraine.

The NKVD (later [[KGB]]) carried out mass arrests, deportations, and executions. The targets included both collaborators with Germany and non-Communist [[resistance movement]]s such as the Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] and the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] aiming to separate from the Soviet Union, among others. The NKVD also executed tens of thousands of [[NKVD massacres of prisoners|Polish political prisoners]] in 1939–1941, including the [[Katyń massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sovietstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/soviet-story-press-kit-march-2010.pdf |title=History Documentary film: The Soviet Story |author=Edvins Snore |year=2008 |publisher=SIA Labvakar |location=Riga, Latvia |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824074927/http://www.sovietstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/soviet-story-press-kit-march-2010.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://thepeoplescube.com/peoples-blog/the-soviet-story-a-must-see-for-all-students-of-history-t13314.html|title=History Documentary – A Must See For All Students of History|author=Red Square|year=2014|publisher=The Peoples Cube|accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; NKVD units were also used to repress the prolonged partisan war in [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|Ukraine]] and the [[Forest Brothers|Baltics]], which lasted until the early 1950s.

===Postwar operations===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
After the death of Stalin in 1953, the new Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] halted the NKVD purges. From the 1950s to the 1980s, thousands of victims were legally "rehabilitated" (i.e., acquitted and had their rights restored). Many of the victims and their relatives refused to apply for rehabilitation out of fear or lack of documents. The rehabilitation was not complete: in most cases the formulation was "due to lack of evidence of the case of crime". Only a limited number of persons were rehabilitated with the formulation "cleared of all charges".

Very few NKVD agents were ever officially convicted of the particular violation of anyone's rights. Legally, those agents executed in the 1930s were also "purged" without legitimate criminal investigations and court decisions. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade) a small number of ex-NKVD agents living in the [[Baltic states]] were convicted of crimes against the local population.

===Intelligence activities===
These included:

* Establishment of a widespread spy network through the [[Comintern]].
* Operations of [[Richard Sorge]], the "[[Red Orchestra (spy)|Red Orchestra]]", [[Willi Lehmann]], and other agents who provided valuable intelligence during World War II.
* Recruitment of important UK officials as agents in the 1940s.
* Penetration of British intelligence ([[MI6]]) and counter-intelligence ([[MI5]]) services.
* Collection of detailed nuclear weapons design information from the U.S. and Britain.
* Disruption of several confirmed plots to assassinate Stalin.
* Establishment of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] and earlier its communist party along with training activists, during World War II. The first President of Poland after the war was [[Bolesław Bierut]], an NKVD agent.

=== Soviet economy ===
[[File:Korolev posle aresta 1938.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sergei Korolev]] shortly after his arrest, 1938]]
The extensive system of labor exploitation in the [[Gulag]] made a notable contribution to the Soviet economy and the development of remote areas. Colonization of Siberia, the North and Far East was among the explicitly stated goals in the very first laws concerning Soviet [[labor camp]]s. Mining, construction works (roads, railways, canals, dams, and factories), logging, and other functions of the labor camps were part of the Soviet [[planned economy]], and the NKVD had its own production plans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The most unusual part of the NKVD's achievements was its role in Soviet science and arms development. Many scientists and engineers arrested for political crimes were placed in special prisons, much more comfortable than the Gulag, colloquially known as ''[[sharashka]]s''. These prisoners continued their work in these prisons. When later released, some of them became world leaders in science and technology. Among such ''sharashka'' members were [[Sergey Korolev]], the head designer of the Soviet rocket program and first human space flight mission in 1961, and [[Andrei Tupolev]], the famous airplane designer. [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] was also imprisoned in a sharashka, and based his novel ''[[The First Circle]]'' on his experiences there.

After World War II, the NKVD coordinated work on Soviet nuclear weaponry, under the direction of General [[Pavel Sudoplatov]]. The scientists were not prisoners, but the project was supervised by the NKVD because of its great importance and the corresponding requirement for absolute security and secrecy. Also, the project used information obtained by the NKVD from the United States.

==People's Commissars==
The agency was headed by a people's commissar (minister). His first deputy was the director of State Security Service (GUGB).
* 1934–1936 [[Genrikh Yagoda]], both people's commissar of Interior and director of State Security
* 1936–1938 [[Nikolai Yezhov]], people's commissar of Interior
** 1936–1937 [[Yakov Agranov]], director of State Security (as the first deputy)
** 1937–1938 [[Mikhail Frinovsky]], director of State Security (as the first deputy)
** 1938 [[Lavrentiy Beria]], director of State Security (as the first deputy)
* 1938–1945 [[Lavrentiy Beria]], people's commissar of Interior
** 1938–1941 [[Vsevolod Merkulov]], director of State Security (as the first deputy)
** 1941–1943 [[Vsevolod Merkulov]], director of State Security (as the first deputy)
* 1945–1946 [[Sergei Kruglov (politician)|Sergei Kruglov]], people's commissar of Interior
''Note: In the first half of 1941 Vsevolod Merkulov transformed his agency into separate commissariat (ministry), but it was merged back to the people's commissariat of Interior soon after the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]]. In 1943 Merkulov once again split his [[Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)|agency]] this time for good.''

==Officers==
Andrei Zhukov has singlehandedly identified every single NKVD officer involved in 1930s arrests and killings by researching a Moscow archive. There are just over 40,000 names on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/06/stalin-secret-police-killings-crimes-russia-terror-nkvd|title=Stalin's secret police finally named but killings still not seen as crimes|last=Walker|first=Shaun|date=6 February 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6004">The '''National Campus Climate Survey (NCCS)''' is a service offered to institutions of [[higher education]] in the [[United States]] who would like to better understand and improve their campus climate with regards to [[sexual assault]] and related topics.  The study is designed to:

# Meet all state and federal requirements for the conduct of sexual assault [[Survey methodology|survey]]s.
# Provide a scientifically rigorous survey instrument to help schools learn about the campus climate concerning [[sexual misconduct]].
# Provide varying survey implementation tiers to match institutions’ varying needs for defensible data.
# Provide a benchmarking tool to allow institutions to compare their results against other participating institutions, and where possible, peer groups.

The study was developed in response to the report from the [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]].

== The National Campus Climate Survey ==

=== Study Website &amp; Enrollment ===
The National Campus Climate Survey launched its service and website ([http://www.nationalcampusclimatesurvey.com www.nationalcampusclimatesurvey.com]) on September 1, 2015 and is currently enrolling institutions of higher education into the Spring 2016 data collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Assault Survey Now Available for Multi-Institutional Enrollment|url=http://www.nationalcampusclimatesurvey.org/news/2015/9/2/sexual-assault-survey-now-available-for-multi-institutional-enrollment|website=National Campus Climate Survey|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Study Design ===
The core NCCS design uses a sample survey approach rather than a [[census]] of all students. (However, schools will have the option to conduct a census if they wish.) A randomly selected sample of students (undergraduates and graduates) allows the study to make scientifically based inferences to the population as a whole, helps focus finite research resources on successfully contacting and encouraging the participation of the broadest group of students, and reduces survey burden on an often over-surveyed population.

The NCCS will request sample data from university registrars (i.e. gender, race/ethnicity, year in school, on/off campus residence) in addition to contact information to allow for nonresponse analyses to be conducted. If deemed appropriate, the NCCS may generate nonresponse bias weights for the final analytic data file.

The NCCS will be implemented as a web-based, mobile-optimized survey, to ensure the data collected is of highest quality. Logical branching and filters will be used to tailor the questionnaire appropriately for each individual. Data collection will include at least four email contacts, and may include mailed prenotification letters, telephone calls, and in-person visits (depending on the service level selected). Data will be collected between January and April, 2016.

=== Service Levels ===
The NCCS has a three-tiered service structure, designed to meet the specific needs of the local campus.

More specifics regarding the Tier services are available on the [http://www.nationalcampusclimatesurvey.org/service-levels/ study website service levels page].

=== Survey Instrument ===
The survey instrument and methodology were designed by a team, led by the University of Michigan’s Survey Research Center and including representatives from Student Life at the University of Michigan, the Office of the General Counsel at the University of Michigan, and SoundRocket. The team designed the survey measurements to include both the prevalence and incidence of sexual assault on campus, as well as perceptions of campus climate. The methodological team drew heavily upon behavioral-specific questions from the Sexual Experiences Survey to measure the prevalence and incidence of sexual assault, because such questions have been researched and validated. (1) The design features of this survey have demonstrated effectiveness in minimizing response errors in web surveys, as well as minimizing overall respondent burden. (2) The average length for completion of the survey instrument is less than 15 minutes.  

An early draft of the survey instrument is available at the [https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2015/04/Campus-climate-survey-questions.pdf University of Michigan 2015 Campus Climate Surveys Regarding Sexual Misconduct] page.

[[Image:GRB080319B illustration NASA.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gamma-ray bursts might have regulated the advent of intelligent life]]
'''Neocatastrophism''' is the [[hypothesis]] that life-exterminating events such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s have acted as a galactic regulation mechanism in the [[Milky Way]] upon the emergence of complex [[life]] in its [[Galactic habitable zone|habitable zone]].&lt;ref name="Cirković08"&gt;Cirković MM, Vukotić B.

[http://www.aob.bg.ac.rs/paob/86/pdf/193-196.pdf Astrobiological Landscape and Neocatastrophism.]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Publications of the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade,86:193-19&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed as an explanation of [[Fermi paradox|Fermi's paradox]]  since it provides a mechanism which would have delayed the otherwise expected advent of [[Noogenesis|intelligent being]]s in the local galaxy nearby to [[Earth]]. This is an avenue to explain why none so far have been detected by [[humans]].

==The problem==

It is estimated that Earth-like [[planet]]s in the Milky Way started forming 9 billion years ago, and that their [[median]] age is 6.4 ± 0.7 [[Ga (unit)|Ga]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver C.H. (2001). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0012399v2 An Estimate of the Age Distribution of Terrestrial Planets in the Universe: Quantifying Metallicity as a Selection Effect.] Icarus, 151:307-313 {{doi|10.1006/icar.2001.6607}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, 75% of stars in the [[galactic habitable zone]] are older than the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver CH, Fenner Y, Gibson BK. (2004). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401024 The galactic habitable zone and the age distribution of complex life in the Milky Way.] Science. 303(5654):59-62. {{DOI|10.1126/science.1092322}} {{PMID|14704421}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the existence of potential planets with evolved intelligent life more likely than not to be older than that of the Earth ([[Age of the Earth|4.54 Ga]]). This creates an observational dilemma since [[interstellar travel]], (even of the "slow" kind that is nearly within the reach of present Earth technology) could in theory, if this had arisen elsewhere, take from only 5 million to 50 million years to colonize the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, I.A., [http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf "Where are They? Maybe we are alone in the galaxy after all"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326090244/http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}, '' Scientific American,'' July 2000, 38-43, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a conundrum first posed in 1950 by the physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] in his namesake paradox: "Why are no aliens or their artifacts physically here?"&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"&gt;Webb S. (2002). ''If the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody? Fifty solutions to the Fermi paradox and the problem of extraterrestrial life''. Copernicus Books (Springer Verlag)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The neocatastrophism resolution==
The hypothesis posits that [[Astrobiology|astrobiological evolution]] is subject to regulation mechanisms that arrest or postpone the advent of complex creatures capable of interstellar communication and traveling technology. These regulation mechanisms act to temporarily sterilize planets of biology in the [[galactic habitable zone]]. The main proposed regulation mechanism is gamma-ray bursts.&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt;

Part of the neocatastrophism hypothesis is that [[stellar evolution]] produces a decreasing frequency of such catastrophic events increasing the length of the "window" in which intelligent life might arise as galaxies age. According to modeling,&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt; this creates the possibility of a [[phase transition]] at which point a galaxy turns from a place that is essentially dead (with a few pockets of simple life) to one that is crowded with complex life forms.

[[File:Lennuliiklust uurimas.jpg|thumbnail|An observer is someone who gathers information about a phenomenon, but does not intervene. (Observing the air traffic in [[Rõuge]], [[Estonia]])]]

'''Observation''' is the active acquisition of [[information]] from a [[primary source]]. In living beings, observation employs the [[sense]]s. In science, observation can also involve the recording of [[data (information)|data]] via the use of [[scientific instrument]]s. The term may also refer to any data collected during the scientific activity. Observations can be [[qualitative property|qualitative]], that is, only the absence or presence of a property is noted, or [[quantitative data|quantitative]] if a numerical value is attached to the observed [[phenomenon]] by [[counting]] or [[measurement|measuring]].

Observations play a role in the second and fifth steps of the scientific method. However, the need for [[reproducibility]] requires that observations by different observers can be comparable. Human [[sense]] impressions are [[subjectivity|subjective]] and [[qualitative data|qualitative]], making them difficult to record or compare. The use of [[measurement]] developed to allow recording and comparison of observations made at different times and places, by different people. Measurement consists of using observation to compare the phenomenon being observed to a [[Standard (metrology)|standard unit]]. The standard unit can be an artifact, process, or definition which can be duplicated or shared by all observers.  In measurement the number of standard units which is equal to the observation is counted.  Measurement reduces an observation to a number which can be recorded, and two observations which result in the same number are equal within the [[measurement|resolution]] of the process.

Human senses are limited and subject to errors in perception, such as [[optical illusion]]s. [[Scientific instrument]]s were developed to aid human abilities of observation, such as [[weighing scale]]s, [[clock]]s, [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, [[thermometer]]s, [[camera]]s, and [[tape recorder]]s, and also translate into perceptible form events that are unobservable by the senses, such as [[pH indicator|indicator dyes]], [[voltmeter]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, [[infrared camera]]s, [[oscilloscope]]s, [[interferometer]]s, [[geiger counter]]s, and [[radio receiver]]s.

One problem encountered throughout scientific fields is that the observation may affect the process being observed, resulting in a different outcome than if the process was unobserved. This is called the ''[[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]]''. For example, it is not normally possible to check the air pressure in an automobile tire without letting out some of the air, thereby changing the pressure. However, in most fields of science it is possible to reduce the effects of observation to insignificance by using better instruments.

Considered as a physical process itself, all forms of observation (human or instrumental) involve [[amplifier|amplification]] and are thus thermodynamically [[irreversibility|irreversible processes]], increasing [[entropy]].

==Observational paradoxes==
In some specific fields of science the results of observation differ depending on factors which are not important in everyday observation.  These are usually illustrated with "[[paradox]]es" in which an event appears different when observed from two different points of view, seeming to violate "common sense".
* '''Relativity:''' In [[relativistic physics]] which deals with velocities close to the [[speed of light]], it is found that different observers may observe different values for the length, time rates, mass, and many other properties of an object, depending on the observer's velocity relative to the object.   For example, in the [[twin paradox]] one twin goes on a trip near the speed of light and comes home younger than the twin who stayed at home.  This is not a paradox: time passes at a slower rate when measured from a frame moving with respect to the object.  In relativistic physics, an observation must always be qualified by specifying the state of motion of the observer, its [[Frame of reference|reference frame]].
* '''Quantum mechanics:''' In [[quantum mechanics]], which deals with the behavior of very small objects, it is not possible to [[observer (quantum physics)|observe a system]] without changing the system, and the "observer" must be considered part of the [[system]] being observed. In isolation, quantum objects are represented by a [[wave function]] which often exists in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] or mixture of different [[quantum state|states]]. However, when an observation is made to determine the actual location or state of the object, it always finds the object in a single state, not a "mixture". The interaction of the observation process appears to "[[wave function collapse|collapse]]" the wave function into a single state. So any interaction between an isolated wave function and the external world that results in this wave function collapse is called an ''observation'' or ''measurement'', whether or not it is part of a deliberate observation process.

==Biases==
The human senses do not function like a video [[camcorder]], impartially recording all observations.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite web

  | first = Julia

  | doi = 
  | accessdate = August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human perception occurs by a complex, unconscious process of [[abstraction]], in which certain details of the incoming sense data are noticed and remembered, and the rest forgotten.    What is kept and what is thrown away depends on an internal model or representation of the world, called by psychologists a ''[[schema (psychology)|schema]]'', that is built up over our entire lives.  The data is fitted into this schema.  Later when events are remembered, memory gaps may even be filled by "plausible" data the mind makes up to fit the model; this is called ''[[reconstructive memory]]''. How much attention the various perceived data are given depends on an internal value system, which judges how important it is to the individual. Thus two people can view the same event and come away with entirely different perceptions of it, even disagreeing about simple facts.  This is why [[eyewitness testimony]] is notoriously unreliable.

Several of the more important ways observations can be affected by human psychology are given below.

===Confirmation bias===
{{main|confirmation bias}}
Human observations are biased toward confirming the observer's conscious and unconscious expectations and view of the world; we "''see what we expect to see''".&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 1429996765}}&lt;/ref&gt; In psychology, this is called [[confirmation bias]].&lt;ref name="Shermer" /&gt;   Since the object of scientific research is the discovery of new phenomena, this bias can and has caused new discoveries to be overlooked; one example is the discovery of [[x-ray]]s. It can also result in erroneous scientific support for widely held cultural myths, on the other hand, as in the [[scientific racism]] that supported ideas of racial superiority in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Correct scientific technique emphasizes careful recording of observations, separating experimental observations from the conclusions drawn from them, and techniques such as [[blind experiment|blind]] or [[double blind experiment]]s, to minimize observational bias.

==="Cargo cult" science===
{{main|Cargo cult science}}
Another bias, which has become more prevalent with the advent of "[[big science]]" and the large rewards of new discoveries, is bias in favor of the researcher's desired hypothesis or outcome; we "''see what we want to see''". Called [[pathological science]] and [[cargo cult science]], this is different from deliberate falsification of results, and can happen to good-faith researchers.  Researchers with a great incentive or desire for a given outcome can misinterpret or misjudge results, or even persuade themselves they have seen something they haven't.  Possible examples of mistaken discoveries caused by this bias are [[Mars#Martian 'canals'|Martian "canals"]], [[N rays]], [[polywater]], [[cold fusion]], and [[perpetual motion]] machines. Recent decades have seen scientific scandals caused by researchers playing "fast and loose" with observational methods in order to get their pet theories published. This type of bias is rampant in [[pseudoscience]], where correct scientific techniques are not followed. The main defense against this bias, besides correct research techniques, is [[peer review]] and repetition of the experiment, or the observation, by other researchers with no incentive to bias. For example, an emerging practice in the competitive field of [[biotechnology]] is to require the physical results of experiments, such as serums and [[tissue culture]]s, be made available to competing laboratories for independent testing.

===Processing bias===
Modern scientific instruments can extensively process "observations" before they are presented to the human senses, and particularly with computerized instruments, there is sometimes a question as to where in the data processing chain "observing" ends and "drawing conclusions" begins. This has recently become an issue with [[digital image processing|digitally enhanced]] images published as experimental data in [[scientific paper|papers]] in [[scientific journal]]s. The images are enhanced to bring out features that the researcher wants to emphasize, but this also has the effect of supporting the researcher's conclusions. This is a form of bias that is difficult to quantify. Some [[scientific journal]]s have begun to set detailed standards for what types of [[image processing]] are allowed in research results. Computerized instruments often keep a copy of the "raw data" from sensors before processing, which is the ultimate defense against processing bias, and similarly scientific standards require preservation of the original unenhanced "raw" versions of images used as research data.

===Observational bias===
An observational bias occurs when researchers only look where they think they will find positive results, or where it is easy to record observations. This is called the "[[streetlight effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David H.

==Observations in philosophy==
{{quote|"Observe always that everything is the result of a change, and get used to thinking that there is nothing [[Nature]] loves so well as to change existing forms and to make new ones like them."|Meditations. iv. 36. – [[Marcus Aurelius]]}}

Observation in [[philosophical]] terms is the process of filtering [[sense|sensory]] [[information]] through the thought process. Input is received via [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[visual perception|sight]], [[olfaction|smell]], [[taste]], or [[Haptic perception|touch]] and then analyzed through either rational or irrational thought.


For example, let us suppose that an observer ''sees'' a parent beat their child; and consequently ''observes'' that such an action is either good or bad.{{Citation needed|reason=What is the source of the distinction "seeing" versus "observing"?|date=May 2009}} Deductions about what behaviors are good or bad may be based on preferences about building relationships, or study of the consequences resulting from the observed behavior. With the passage of time, impressions stored in the consciousness about many, together with the resulting relationships and consequences, permit the individual to build a construct about the moral implications of behavior.

'''Personal experience''' of a [[human being]] is the moment-to-moment [[experience]] and [[sensory awareness]] of internal and external [[event (philosophy)|events]] or a sum of experiences forming an empirical unity such as a period of life.

==History==
An early belief of some philosophers of [[Ancient Greece]] was that the [[mind]] was like a [[Analog recording|recording]] device and simply kept somehow-objective records of what the [[senses]] experienced. This was believed in the Western world into the 20th century until [[cognitive psychology]] experiments decisively proved that it was not true, and that many events were simply filled in by the mind, based on what "should be". This, among other things, explained why [[witness|eyewitness]] accounts of events often were so widely varied.

In [[Ancient Rome]] it was believed that personal experience was part of some divine or species-wide [[collective experience]]. This gave rise to notions of [[racial memory]], [[national mission]], and such notions as [[racism]] and [[patriotism]]. It was likely easier to create [[political movement]]s and military morale with such notions, than a strictly personal idea of experience. [[Carl Jung]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] were notable investigators of these ideas of collective experience in the 20th century.

During [[the Enlightenment]], there was rigorous investigation of these ideas. [[Immanuel Kant]] noted that it was only possible to explain "experience and its objects" as a consequence of each other: either experience makes those objects possible, or those objects make experience possible. This is seen today as [[Epistemological dualism|dualism]], and denying the possibility of a third thing making both experience and whatever reality its objects have, both possible. That thing could be a more universal [[cognition]], as proposed in some versions of [[Christianity]] or [[Gaia philosophy]].

[[Image:PricePointGraph.svg|Price points A, B, and C, along a [[demand curve]] (where P is price and Q represents demand)|framed]]

'''Price points''' are [[price]]s at which [[demand]] for a given [[Product (business)|product]] is supposed to stay relatively high.

==Characteristics==
Introductory [[microeconomics]] depicts a [[demand curve]] as downward-sloping to the right and either linear or gently convex to the origin. The downwards slope generally holds, but the model of the curve is only [[piecewise]] true, as price surveys indicate that demand for a product is not a [[linear function]] of its price and not even a [[smooth function]]. Demand curves resemble a series of waves rather than a straight line. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The diagram shows price points at the points labeled A, B, and C. When a vendor increases a price beyond a price point (say to a price slightly above ''price point B''), sales volume decreases by an amount more than proportional to the price increase. This decrease in quantity-demanded more than offsets the additional revenue from the increased unit-price. As a result, total revenue (price multiplied by quantity-demanded) decreases when a firm raises its price beyond a price point. Technically, the [[price elasticity of demand]] is low (inelastic) at a price lower than the price point (steep section of the demand curve), and  high (elastic) at a price higher than a price point (gently sloping part of the demand curve). [[Business entity|Firm]]s commonly set prices at existing price-points as a [[marketing strategy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Causes==
There are three main reasons for price points to appear:

# [[Consumer theory#Price effect as sum of substitution and income effects|Substitution]] price points
#* price points occur at the price of a close substitute
#* when an item's price rises above the cost of a close substitute, the quantity demanded drops sharply{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
# [[Customary pricing|Customary price]] points
#* the [[Market (economics)|market]] grows accustomed to paying a certain amount for a type of product
#* increasing the price beyond this amount will cause sales to drop dramatically{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
# Perceptual price points (also referred to as "[[psychological pricing]]" or as "odd-number pricing")
#* raising a price above 99 cents will cause demand to fall disproportionately because people perceive $1.00 as a significantly higher price&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Increased Consumer Sales Response Through Use of 99-Ending Prices|last = Schindler|first = Robert M.|date = 1996|journal = Journal of Retailing|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Kibarian|first2 = Thomas M.|volume = 72|issue = 2|pages = 187–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oligopoly pricing==
In relation to customary price points, [[oligopolies]] can also generate price points. Such price points do not necessarily result from  [[collusion]], but as an [[emergence|emergent]] property of oligopolies: when all firms sell at the same price, any firm which attempts to raise its selling price will experience a decrease in sales and revenues (preventing firms from raising prices unilaterally); on the other hand, any firm in an oligopoly which lowers its prices will mostly likely be matched by competitors, resulting in small increases in sales but decreases in revenues (for all the firms in that market). This effect can potentially produce a kinked demand-curve where the kink lies at the point of the current price-level in the market.
These results depend on the elasticity of the demand curve{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and on the properties of each market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4841">In [[economics]] and [[engineering]], the '''price–performance ratio''' refers to a product's ability to deliver performance, of any sort, for its price. Generally speaking, products with a lower price/performance ratio are more desirable, excluding other factors.

Price–performance is often written as '''cost–performance''' or '''cost–benefit'''.  Even though this term would seem to be a straightforward ratio, when price performance is improved, better, or increased, it actually refers to the performance divided by the price, in other words exactly the opposite ratio (i.e. an inverse ratio) to rank a product as having an increased price/performance.  

==Examples==

===Consumer and medical products===
According to futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil]], products start out as highly ineffective and highly expensive.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"/&gt;

Gradually, products become more effective and cheaper until they are highly effective and almost free to buy.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"/&gt; Some of the products that have followed this example include [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] medications (which are now affordable to the majority of AIDS sufferers{{which|date=September 2014}}), [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] programs, and [[digital camera]]s.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"&gt;{{cite book
  |last = Kurzweil
  |first = Raymond
  |authorlink = Raymond Kurzweil
  |title = The Singularity is Near
  |publisher = [[Penguin Books]]
  |year = 2005
  |isbn = 0-14-303788-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, products that rely primarily on paper (e.g., newspapers and toilet paper) and/or fossil fuels (e.g., electricity in most countries and petroleum gasoline for automobiles) have only increased in price.  

This directly contradicts the trend of electronic gadgets like [[netbook]]s, [[desktop computer]]s, and [[laptop]] computers that also have been decreasing in price. However, the prevailing [[inflation rate]] of a country or province/state may negate the plummeting costs of software, AIDS medications, and/or digital cameras in certain regions along with certain governmental policies. This has the effect of keeping costs high in certain areas while they are dramatically reduced in others. 

In theory, this means that the rich people have earlier access to highly inefficient technologies, medical treatments, and [[Therapy|therapies]] (that are prototypical in nature) while the poor get access to these same products when they become more efficient and easier to manufacture several years down the road.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"/&gt;

===Business world===
During the latter 1990s, the cost–performance ratios of the larger [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] systems fell tremendously in comparison to a number of smaller [[microcomputer]]s handling the same load. As a result, many of the older computer companies were shut down and people were [[unemployment|put out of work]]. However, most of them were able to be re-hired at the newer corporations after undergoing a series of re-training involving the newer technologies.

In the business world, there is usually a value associated with a typical cost–performance ratio analysis. This value can either be positive, neutral, or negative depending on the amount of money spent versus the results achieved by the spending of the available [[Financial capital|capital]]. A cost-performance ratio with a positive value (i.e. greater than 1) indicates that costs are running under budget.&lt;ref name="wideman"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.maxwideman.com/pmglossary/PMG_C11.htm#Cost%20Performance%20Indicator | title = Cost–performance ratio indicator | publisher = Max Wideman| date = | accessdate = 2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A negative value (i.e. less than 1) indicates that costs are running over budget.&lt;ref name="wideman"/&gt; However, a neutral cost-performance ratio (between 1.0 and 1.9) could suggest a certain degree of stagnation in the budget. [[Business trip]]s can also be factored into the cost–performance ratio because spending $50 to do a journey spanning {{convert|100|mi|km}} in two hours is a better cost–performance ratio than spending $105 to do the journey in one hour.

===Computer technology===
The term tends to be used quite a bit when comparing computer hardware. During the latter 1990s, the price–performance ratios of midrange and large [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] systems fell tremendously in comparison to a number of smaller [[microcomputer]]s handling the same load. Many companies were forced out of the industry as this happened, including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], [[Data General]] and many [[multiprocessor]] vendors such as [[Sequent Computer Systems]] and [[Pyramid Technology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7601">'''Reginald Hawkins''' (1923–2007) was a civil rights activist in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], NC for most of his life. He was the first African-American to run for Governor of North Carolina. He fought to desegregate Charlotte schools and businesses. His son-in-law was [[Hamaas Abdul Khaalis]] whose [[1973 Hanafi Muslim massacre|family was murdered in 1973]] and who went on to commit the [[1977 Hanafi Siege]].

Reginald Hawkins was born in [[Beaufort, North Carolina|Beaufort, NC]] in 1923. He served as captain in the [[United States Army|US Army]] during [[World War II]]. After completing his time in the service he attended [[Howard University]] where he got his degree in dentistry in 1948. He also received his MA of Divinity from [[Johnson C. Smith University|Johnson C Smith University]] in 1973. He married Catherine Richardson while he was still in dental school and they had four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/charlotte/obituary.aspx?n=reginald-armistice-hawkins&amp;pid=94263646|title=Dr. Reginald Armistice Hawkins's Obituary on Charlotte Observer|website=Charlotte Observer|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil rights advocacy==
Hawkins and members of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] differed over the best way to end school desegregation. Kelly Alexander wanted to sue the city of Charlotte over civil injustice. Hawkins believed that a confrontational approach was best through utilizing media coverage to help mobilize citizens, arguing  "The only way to move forward is to engage bigots in direct controversy within their own community.&lt;ref name="jfl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reginald Hawkins (1923-2007)|url=http://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/reginald-hawkins-1923-2007/|website=North Carolina History Project|publisher=The John Locke Foundation|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make his point  about the only way to move forward, Hawkins escorted Dorthy Counts, a young black girl to Harding High School, a white school in Charlotte. On September 4, 1957 Hawkins and Counts walked through a shower of spit and insults to integrate the first Mecklenburg County School.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clclt.com/charlotte/the-militant-dentist-dr-reginald-hawkins/Content?oid=3003665|title=The Militant Dentist: Dr. Reginald Hawkins|last=Wright|first=Emiene|website=Creative Loafing Charlotte|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His actions that day created a lot of stir in both the white and African- American neighborhoods,creating  a national name for Hawkins. From then on Hawkins became a prominent civil rights activist in Charlotte. In 1961 Hawkins  led a [[boycott]] of Irwin Avenue Junior High School. He urged African-American Students to stay home instead of attending a second rate educational institution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to his disagreement with NAACP policies and in an attempt to distance himself from their "communist" label, Hawkins resigned his membership in 1958 and created the Mecklenburg Organization for Political Affairs (MOPA). MOPA used community activists within the African -American community to call for desegregation. Members took part in marches, picketing, protests, boycotts, and sit-in's, usually near schools or hospitals in the Charlotte area.Hawkins work helped successfully integrate many restaurants downtown including those in Belk's and Ivey's department stores.&lt;ref name="jfl" /&gt;

In 1962 Hawkins filed suit against the North Carolina Dental Society for discrimination due to the fact they would not let him practice at [[Charlotte Memorial Hospital]]. He frequently led demonstrations outside the Mercy, Charlotte Memorial , Presbyterian and Good Samaritan hospitals in the Charlotte area. These demonstrations usually attracted a lot of press and generated controversy in the medical community. Hawkins continued to protest by writing [[Attorney general|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]] claiming that the hospitals were breaking their nondiscrimination policy that was one of the conditions of them receiving federal funding. By the end of 1962 the [[Department of Health]] ordered Memorial to desegregate their maternity and dentistry wards. Hawkins continued to protest until 1963 when the hospital declared an open door policy for all patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On November 22, 1965 four bombs exploded across Charlotte in the span of about 15 minutes. Hawkins home was hit as well as the homes of [[Kelly Alexander Sr]], president of the NAACP, [[Frederick D Alexander|Fred Alexander]], first African American City Council man, and [[Julius L. Chambers|Julius Chambers]], a civil rights lawyer. The bombings caught the attention of the local news and put Charlotte into the violent category that cities like [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] had already been placed in. No one was ever arrested for the bombings even though there was a state wide man hunt and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] still holds an open file on the event. Many people believe the bombings were resistance to efforts of desegregation that all four men were part of.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article45744905.html|title=50 years ago: Bombs ignited night of terror|newspaper=charlotteobserver|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also helped organize the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] and was a great friend to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&lt;ref name="jfl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Michael B.|title="Not Gradually... But Now": Reginald Hawkins, Black Leadership, and Desegregation in Charlotte, North Carolina|jstor=23523030|publisher=North Carolina Office of Arcives and History}}&lt;/ref&gt; King was originally scheduled to stop in Charlotte and speak at one of Hawkins campaign events, but changed his plans and went to Memphis instead, where he was assassinated only a few days later.

==Politics==
In 1968 Hawkins announced his campaign for governor of North Carolina. His political actions had earned him many friends but also many enemies. He lost the Democratic primary to [[Robert W. Scott]] in a three-way race, earning 18.52% of the vote; Scott went on to win the election. He ran again governor again in 1972 and lost in the Democratic primary, winning 8.16% of the vote in a six-way race; the winner of the primary, [[Skipper Bowles]], lost in the general election to Republican candidate [[James Holshouser]]. Even though he did not win, Hawkins' campaigns were symbolically important, showing that African-Americans did have the ability to run for office and try to make political changes.

Throughout his life Hawkins was an ardent supporter of equal rights and integration. He continued his work, giving speeches and calling for change right up until his death in 2007.

Within the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] context,  sanctions are usually monetary fines, levied against a party to a [[lawsuit]] or his/her attorney, for violating rules of [[civil procedure|procedure]], or for abusing the [[judicial process]]. The most severe sanction in a civil lawsuit is the [[involuntary dismissal]], [[with prejudice]], of a complaining party's [[cause of action]], or of the responding party's answer. This has the effect of deciding the entire action against the sanctioned party without recourse, except to the degree that an [[appeal]] or [[trial de novo|trial ''de novo'']] may be allowed because of [[reversible error]].

As a noun, the term is usually used in the plural form, even if it only refers to a single event: if a [[judge]] fines a party, it is not said that he or she imposed a sanction, but that he or she imposed sanctions.

A judge may sanction a party during a legal proceeding, by which it is implied that he or she imposes penalties.  In the [[United States federal courts|United States federal court system]], certain types of conduct are sanctionable under Rule 11 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

Conversely and sometimes confusingly, the word may be used to imply "approve of," especially in an official sense.  "The law sanctions such behavior" would imply that the behavior spoken of enjoys the specific approval of law.

To sanction implies make a legal agreement. The word is derived from sanctus, to make holy. A legal agreement or sanction imposes approvals, rules, guidelines and penalties on conduct.

The Sanction is defined as ''an element associated with an accountability and which corresponds to the consequence resulting from the justification of the realisation (or not) of this accountability.''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference | author = Feltus C. | title = Aligning Access Rights to Governance Needs with the Responsibility MetaModel (ReMMo) in the Frame of Enterprise Architecture | date=2014 | url = http://dial.academielouvain.be/handle/boreal:144013 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sex strike''', sometimes called a '''sex boycott''', is a [[Strike action|strike]], a method of [[non-violent resistance]] in which one or multiple persons (usually [[women]]) refrain from [[Human sexual behavior|sex]] with their partners to achieve certain goals. It is a form of temporary [[sexual abstinence]].

Sex strikes have been used to protest many issues, from [[war]] to [[Gang#Gang violence|gang violence]].

== Historical ==
[[File:Lysistrate (Marble Stele).jpg|thumb|Marble stele of [[Lysistrate]]]]

=== Ancient Greece ===
The most famous example of a sex strike in the arts is the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] playwright [[Aristophanes]]' work ''[[Lysistrata]]'', an [[anti-war]] comedy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=27673724 Lucy Burns, sex-strikes through the ages.]&lt;/ref&gt; The female characters in the play, led by the eponymous Lysistrata, withhold sex from their husbands as part of their strategy to secure peace and end the [[Peloponnesian War]].

=== Nigeria ===
Among the [[Igbo people]] of Nigeria, in pre-colonial times, the community of women periodically formed themselves into a Council, a kind of women's trade union. This was headed by the Agba Ekwe, 'the favoured one of the goddess Idemili and her earthly manifestation'. She carried her staff of authority and had the final word in public gatherings and assemblies. Central among her tasks was to ensure men's good behaviour, punishing male attempts at harassment or abuse. What men most feared was the Council's power of strike action. According to Ifi Amadiume, an Igbo anthropologist: "The strongest weapon the Council had and used against the men was the right to order mass strikes and demonstrations by all women. When ordered to strike, women refused to perform their expected duties and roles, including all domestic, sexual and maternal services. They would leave the town ''en masse'', carrying only suckling babies. If angry enough, they were known to attack any men they met."&lt;ref&gt;Amadiume, I. 1987. ''Male Daughters, Female Husbands. Gender and sex in an African society.'' London and New Jersey: Zed Books, pp. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World history and prehistory ===
Citing similar examples of women's strike action in [[hunter-gatherer]] and other precolonial traditions around the world, some [[anthropologist]]s argue that it was thanks to solidarity of this kind—especially collective resistance to the possibility of [[rape]]—that language, culture, and religion became established in our species in the first instance. This controversial hypothesis is known as the "[[Female cosmetic coalitions|Female Cosmetic Coalitions]]", "Lysistrata",&lt;ref&gt;Camilla Power, 1990.

=== Colombia ===
In October 1997, the chief of the [[Military of Colombia]], General Manuel Bonnet publicly called for a sex strike among the wives and girlfriends of the Colombian left-wing guerrillas, [[drug trafficker]]s, and paramilitaries as part of a strategy—along with diplomacy—to achieve a ceasefire. Also the [[mayor of Bogota]], [[Antanas Mockus]], declared the [[Bogota|capital]] a women-only zone for one night, suggesting men to stay at home to reflect on violence. The guerrillas ridiculed the initiatives, pointing at the fact that there were more than 2,000 women in their army. In the end the ceasefire was achieved, but lasted only a short time.

In September 2006 dozens of wives and girlfriends of gang members from [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]], [[Colombia]], started a sex strike called ''La huelga de las piernas cruzadas'' ("the strike of crossed legs") to curb [[gang violence]], in response to 480 deaths due to gang violence in the [[coffee]] region. According to spokeswoman Jennifer Bayer, the specific target of the strike was to force gang members to turn in their weapons in compliance with the law. According to them, many gang members were involved in violent crime for status and sexual attractiveness, and the strike sent the message that refusing to turn in the guns was not sexy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In June 2011, women organized in the so-called Crossed Legs Movement in the secluded town of [[Barbacoas, Nariño|Barbacoas]] in southwestern Colombia, started a sex strike to pressure the government to repair the road connecting Barbacoas and its neighboring towns and cities.&lt;ref name="GNAD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/colombian-women-use-sex-strike-pressure-government-repair-road-huelga-de-piernas-cruzadas-20|title=Colombian women use sex strike to pressure government to repair road (Huelga de piernas cruzadas), 2011|website=Global Nonviolent Action Database|publisher=Swarthmore College|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They declared that if the men of the town were not going to demand action, they would refuse to have sex with them.

'''Solidarity''' is unity  (as of a group or class) that produces or is based on unities of interests, objectives, standards, and sympathies.&lt;ref name="dict1"&gt;''Merriam Webster'', http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solidarity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/solidarity|title=solidarity|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the [[social relations|ties in a society]] that bind people together as one. The term is generally employed in [[sociology]] and the other [[social sciences]] as well as in [[philosophy]] or in [[Catholic social teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/CJFA/article/view/CJFA.2013.013|title=Social Security in Poland – cultural, historical and economical issues|first1=Stanisław|last1=Adamiak|first2=Ewa|last2=Chojnacka|first3=Damian|last3=Walczak|date=1 December 2013|publisher=|journal=Copernican Journal of Finance &amp; Accounting|volume=2|issue=2|pages=11–26|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=wydawnictwoumk.pl|doi=10.12775/cjfa.2013.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, solidarity is a core concept in [[Christian democracy]] political ideology.&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickKwon2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=Tony |last2=Kwon |first2=Huck-ju |last3= Manning |first3=Nick |author4=James Midgley, Gillian Pascall |title= International Encyclopedia of Social Policy |date= 4 July 2013 |publisher= Routledge |language=English |isbn= 978-1-136-61003-5|page=1866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What forms the basis of solidarity varies between societies. In simple societies it may be mainly based on [[kinship]] and shared values. In more complex societies there are various theories as to what contributes to a sense of social solidarity.&lt;ref name="dict1" /&gt;

Solidarity is also one of six principles of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union#The text|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], Title IV&lt;/ref&gt; and December 20 of each year is International Human Solidarity Day recognized as an [[international observance]].

== Émile Durkheim ==
According to [[Émile Durkheim]], the types of social solidarity correlate with types of society. Durkheim introduced the terms [[mechanical and organic solidarity|''mechanical'' and ''organic solidarity'']] as part of his theory of the development of societies in ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893). In a society exhibiting mechanical solidarity, its cohesion and integration comes from the homogeneity of individuals—people feel connected through similar work, educational and religious training, and lifestyle. Mechanical solidarity normally operates in "traditional" and small scale societies.&lt;ref name="dict2"&gt;''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', p405-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In simpler societies (e.g., [[tribe|tribal]]), solidarity is usually based on [[kinship]] ties of familial networks. Organic solidarity comes from the interdependence that arises from specialization of work and the complementarities between people—a development which occurs in "modern" and "industrial" societies.&lt;ref name="dict2" /&gt;
* Definition: it is [[social cohesion]] based upon the dependence individuals have on each other in more advanced societies.

Although individuals perform different tasks and often have different values and interest, the order and very solidarity of society depends on their reliance on each other to perform their specified tasks. Organic here is referring to the interdependence of the component parts.  Thus social solidarity is maintained in more complex societies through the interdependence of its component parts (e.g., farmers produce the food to feed the factory workers who produce the tractors that allow the farmer to produce the food).

== Peter Kropotkin ==
A connection between the biological and the social was of principal importance for the idea of solidarity as expressed by the anarchist ideologist and former Prince [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842–1921). In his most famous book, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' (1902), written partly in response to Huxleyan Social Darwinism, Kropotkin studied the use of cooperation as a survival mechanism in human societies at their various stages, as well as with animals. According to him, [[mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]], or cooperation, within a species has been an important factor in the evolution of social institutions. Solidarity is essential for mutual aid; supportive activity towards other people does not result from the expectation of reward, but rather from instinctive feelings of solidarity.

In his introduction to the book, Kropotkin wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The number and importance of mutual-aid institutions which were developed by the creative genius of the savage and half-savage masses, during the earliest clan-period of mankind and still more during the next village-community period, and the immense influence which these early institutions have exercised upon the subsequent development of mankind, down to the present times, induced me to extend my researches to the later, historical periods as well; especially, to study that most interesting period&amp;nbsp;– the free medieval city republics, whose universality and influence upon our modern civilization have not yet been duly appreciated. And finally, I have tried to indicate in brief the immense importance which the mutual-support instincts, inherited by mankind from its extremely long evolution, play even now in our modern society, which is supposed to rest upon the principle "every one for himself, and the State for all," but which it never has succeeded, nor will succeed in realizing".&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, P. Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution.&amp;nbsp;– L.: Freedom press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Kropotkin advocated an alternative economic and social system, which would be coordinated through a horizontal network of voluntary associations with goods distributed in compliance with the physical needs of the individual, rather than according to labour.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in philosophy ==
Solidarity is an emerging concept in contemporary philosophy&amp;nbsp;– it is subject to ongoing studies in various subfields of [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor=Bayertz, Kurt |year=1999 |title=Solidarity |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |publication-place=Dordrecht |isbn=978-0-7923-5475-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable approach in [[bioethics]] is to identify solidarity primarily as a three-tiered practice enacted at the interpersonal, communal, and contractual and legal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Prainsack, Barbara |author2=Buyx, Alena |year=2012 |title=Solidarity in Contemporary Bioethics&amp;nbsp;– Towards a New Approach |journal=Bioethics |issue=26/7 |pages=343–350 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2012.01987.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is driven by the quest to differentiate between the diverse applications of the concept and to clarify its meaning, both historically and in terms of its potential as a fruitful concept for contemporary moral, social and political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Prainsack, Barbara |author2=Buyx, Alena |year=2011 |title=Solidarity: reflections on an emerging concept in bioethics |publisher=Nuffield Council on Bioethics |publication-place=London |url=http://nuffieldbioethics.org/project/solidarity/ |accessdate= 2013-11-04 |isbn= 978-1-904384-25-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catholic social teaching ==
Solidarity is an integral element of [[Catholic social teaching]]. According to [[Pope Francis]]:
{{blockquote|No one can remain insensitive to the inequalities that persist in the world ... the Brazilian people, particularly the humblest among you, can offer the world a valuable lesson in solidarity, a word that is too often forgotten or silenced because it is uncomfortable ... I would like to make an appeal to those in possession of greater resources, to public authorities and to all people of good will who are working for social justice: never tire of working for a more just world, marked by greater solidarity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicsocialteaching.org.uk/themes/solidarity/|title=Solidarity|author=|date=|website=catholicsocialteaching.org.uk|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Church's teaching on solidarity is explained in the [[Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church]], and briefly summarised in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]:

* 1939. The principle of solidarity, also articulated in terms of "friendship" or "social charity," is a direct demand of human and Christian brotherhood 

* 1940. Solidarity is manifested in the first place by the distribution of goods and remuneration for work ...

* 1941. Socio-economic problems can be resolved only with the help of all the forms of solidarity: solidarity of the poor among themselves, between rich and poor, of workers among themselves, between employers and employees in a business, solidarity among nations and peoples. International solidarity is a requirement of the moral order; world peace depends in part upon this

* 1942. The virtue of solidarity goes beyond material goods. In spreading the spiritual goods of the faith, the Church has promoted, and often opened new paths for, the development of temporal goods as well. And so throughout the centuries has the Lord's saying been verified: "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well."

[[File:Status set.png|thumb|An example of a status set]]
A '''status set''' is a collection of [[social status]]es that an individual holds. A person may have status of a daughter, wife, mother, student, worker, church member and a citizen.

The term "status set" was coined by [[Robert K. Merton]] in 1957. He made a clear distinction between a "[[role set]]" and a "status set".&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. Merton "On social structure and science" {{ISBN|0-226-52071-4}}, page 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Merton stated that status set is the set of statuses in a society while role set is the set of roles in a society

In [[economics]] and business [[decision-making]], a '''sunk cost''' is a [[cost]] that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered (also known as retrospective cost).

Sunk costs are sometimes contrasted with ''[[prospective costs]]'', which are future costs that may be incurred or changed if an action is taken. In that regard, both retrospective and prospective costs could be either fixed costs (continuous for as long as the business is in operation and unaffected by output volume) or variable costs (dependent on volume).&lt;ref name="Sherman2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherman|first=Roger|title=Market Regulation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tbFHAAAAYAAJ|year=2008|publisher=Pearson / Addison Wesley|isbn=978-0-321-32232-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many economists consider it a mistake to classify sunk costs as "fixed" or "variable." For example, if a firm sinks $400 million on an enterprise software installation, that cost is "sunk" because it was a one-time expense and cannot be recovered once spent. A "fixed" cost would be monthly payments made as part of a service contract or licensing deal with the company that set up the software. The upfront irretrievable payment for the installation should ''not'' be deemed a "fixed" cost, with its cost spread out over time. Sunk costs should be kept separate. The "variable costs" for this project might include data centre power usage, for example.

In traditional [[microeconomic]] theory, only prospective (future) costs are relevant to an investment decision. The fields of traditional economics propose that economic actors should not let sunk costs influence their decisions. Doing so would not be rationally assessing a decision exclusively on its own merits. Alternatively, a decision-maker might make rational decisions according to their own incentives, outside of efficiency or profitability. This is considered to be an ''incentive problem'' and is distinct from a sunk cost problem. Evidence from [[behavioral economics]] suggests this theory may fail to predict real-world behavior. Sunk costs do, in fact, influence actors' decisions because humans are prone to [[loss aversion]] and [[framing effect (psychology)|framing effects]]. 

Sunk costs should not affect the rational decision-maker's best choice. However, until a decision-maker irreversibly commits resources, the prospective cost is an [[relevant cost|avoidable future cost]] and is properly included in any decision-making processes.

For instance, if someone is considering preordering movie tickets, but has not actually purchased them yet, the cost remains avoidable. However, if the price of the tickets rises to an amount that requires him or her to pay more than the value he or she places on them, they should figure out the change in terms of prospective cost that goes into the decision-making process and re-evaluate his or her decision hence.

==Description==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2007}}
The sunk cost is distinct from economic loss. For example, when a new car is purchased, it can subsequently be resold; however, it will probably not be resold for the original purchase price. The economic loss is the difference (including [[transaction cost]]s). The sum originally paid should not affect any rational future decision-making about the car, regardless of the resale value: if the owner can derive more value from selling the car than not selling it, then it should be sold, regardless of the price paid. In this sense, the sunk cost is not a precise quantity, but an economic term for a sum paid, in the past, which is no longer relevant to decisions about the future; it may be used inconsistently in quantitative terms as the original cost or the expected economic loss. It may also be used as shorthand for an error in analysis due to the ''sunk cost [[fallacy]]'', irrational decision-making or, most simply, as irrelevant data.

[[Economist]]s argue that sunk costs are not taken into account when making [[rationality|rational]] decisions. In the case of a baseball game ticket that has already been purchased, the ticket-buyer can choose between the following two end results if he realizes that he doesn't like the game:

# Having paid the price of the ticket and having suffered watching a game that he does not want to see, or;
# Having paid the price of the ticket and having used the time to do something more fun.

In either case, the ticket-buyer has ''paid the price of the ticket'' so ''that'' part of the decision no longer affects the future. If the ticket-buyer regrets buying the ticket, the current decision should be based on whether he wants to see the game at all, regardless of the price, just as if he were to go to a free baseball game. The economist will suggest that, since the second option involves suffering in only one way (spent money), while the first involves suffering in two (spent money plus wasted time), option two is obviously preferable.

Sunk costs may cause [[cost overrun]]. In business, an example of sunk costs may be investment into a factory or research that now has a lower value or no value whatsoever. For example, $20 million has been spent on building a power plant; the value at present is zero because it is incomplete (and no sale or recovery is feasible). The plant can be completed for an additional $10 million, or abandoned and a different but equally valuable facility built for $5 million. It should be obvious that abandonment and construction of the alternative facility is the more rational decision, even though it represents a total loss of the original expenditure—the original sum invested is a sunk cost. If decision-makers are irrational or have the wrong incentives, the completion of the project may be chosen. For example, politicians or managers may have more incentive to avoid the appearance of a total loss. In practice, there is considerable ambiguity and uncertainty in such cases, and decisions may in retrospect appear irrational that were, at the time, reasonable to the economic actors involved and in the context of their own incentives.

[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
Behavioral economics recognizes that sunk costs often affect economic decisions due to loss aversion: the price paid becomes a benchmark for the value, whereas the price paid should be irrelevant. This is considered irrational behavior (as rationality is defined by [[classical economics]]). Economic experiments have shown that the sunk cost fallacy and loss aversion are common; hence economic rationality—as assumed by much of economics—is limited. This has enormous implications{{such as?|date=April 2018}} for [[finance]], economics, and securities markets in particular. [[Daniel Kahneman]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] in part for his extensive work in this area with his collaborator, [[Amos Tversky]].

==Features characterizing the sunk cost heuristic==
Two specific features characterizing the sunk cost heuristic worth mentioning are:
# An overoptimistic probability bias, whereby after an investment the evaluation of one's investment-reaping dividends is increased.
# The requisite of personal responsibility. Sunk cost appears to operate chiefly in those who feel personal responsibility for the investments that are to be viewed as sunk cost.

===Overoptimistic probability bias===
In 1968 Knox and Inkster,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0025528 | last1 = Knox | first1 =  RE| last2 = Inkster | first2 =  JA| year = 1968 | title = Postdecision dissonance at post time | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 319–323 | pmid = 5645589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in what is perhaps the classic sunk cost experiment, approached 141 horse [[Gambling|bettors]]: 72 of the people had just finished placing a $2.00 bet within the past 30 seconds, and 69 people were about to place a $2.00 bet in the next 30 seconds. Their hypothesis was that people who had just committed themselves to a course of action (betting $2.00) would reduce [[Cognitive dissonance|post-decision dissonance]] by believing more strongly than ever that they had picked a winner. Knox and Inkster asked the bettors to rate their horse's chances of winning on a 7-point scale. What they found was that people who were about to place a bet rated the chance that their horse would win at an average of 3.48 which corresponded to a "fair chance of winning" whereas people who had just finished betting gave an average rating of 4.81 which corresponded to a "good chance of winning". Their hypothesis was confirmed: after making a $2.00 commitment, people became more confident their bet would pay off. Knox and Inkster performed an ancillary test on the patrons of the horses themselves and managed (after normalization) to repeat their finding almost identically.

Additional evidence of inflated probability estimations can be found in Arkes and Blumer (1985)&lt;ref name="Arkes and Blumer"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0749-5978(85)90049-4 | last1 = Arkes | first1 = Hal | last2 = Blumer | first2 = Catherine | year = 1985 | title = The Psychology of Sunk Cost | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Process | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 124–140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arkes and Hutzel (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/1099-0771(200007/09)13:3&lt;295::AID-BDM353&gt;3.0.CO;2-6 | last1 = Arkes | first1 = Hal | last2 = Hutzel | first2 = Laura | year = 2000 | title = The Role of Probability of Success Estimates in the Sunk Cost Effect | url = | journal = Journal of Behavioural Decision Making | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 295–306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requisite of personal responsibility===
In a study of 96 business students in 1976, Staw and Fox&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Staw | first1 = Barry | year = 1976 | title = Knee Deep in the Big Muddy | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Process | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 124–140 | doi=10.1016/0749-5978(85)90049-4 | last2 = Blumer | first2 = Catherine}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the subjects a choice between making an [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] investment either in an underperforming company department, or in other sections of the hypothetical company. Staw and Fox divided the participants into two groups: a low responsibility condition and a high responsibility condition. In the high responsibility condition, the participants were told that they, as manager, had made an earlier, disappointing R&amp;D investment. In the low responsibility condition, subjects were told that a former manager had made a previous R&amp;D investment in the underperforming division and were given the same profit data as the other group. In both cases subjects were then asked to make a new $20 million investment. There was a significant interaction between assumed responsibility and average investment, with the high responsibility condition averaging $12.97 million and the low condition averaging $9.43 million.

Similar results have been obtained in earlier studies by Staw (1974, 1976) and by Arkes and Blumer (1985)&lt;ref name="Arkes and Blumer"/&gt; and Whyte (1986).&lt;ref name="Whyte1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whyte|first1=Glen|title=Escalating Commitment to a Course of Action: A Reinterpretation|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume=11|issue=2|year=1986|pages=311|issn=0363-7425|doi=10.2307/258462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss aversion and the ''sunk cost fallacy''==
{{further|Escalation of commitment}}
Many people have strong misgivings about "wasting" resources ([[loss aversion]]). In the above example involving a non-refundable sporting event ticket, many people, for example, would feel obliged to go to the event despite not really wanting to, because doing otherwise would be ''wasting'' the ticket worth. They usually feel they've passed the ''[[point of no return]]''. This is sometimes referred to as the ''sunk cost fallacy''. Economists would label this behavior as "irrational". It is inefficient because it misallocates resources by depending on information that is irrelevant to the decision being made.

This line of thinking, in turn, may reflect a non-standard measure of [[utility]], which is ultimately subjective and unique to the consumer. A ticket-buyer who purchases a ticket to an event they won't enjoy in advance makes a semi-public commitment to watching it. To leave early is to make this lapse of judgment manifest to strangers, an appearance they might otherwise choose to avoid. Alternatively, they may take a sense of [[pride]] in having recognized the [[opportunity cost]] of the alternative use of time.

The idea of sunk costs is often employed when analyzing business decisions. A common example of a sunk cost for a business is the [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] of a brand name. This type of [[marketing]] incurs costs that cannot normally be recovered. It is not typically possible to later "demote" one's brand names in exchange for cash. A second example is [[R&amp;D]] costs. Once spent, such costs are sunk and should have no effect on future pricing decisions. So a pharmaceutical company’s attempt to justify high prices because of the need to recoup R&amp;D expenses is fallacious. The company will charge market prices whether R&amp;D had cost one dollar or one million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Klein and Bauman (2010) The Cartoon Introduction to Economics Volume One: Microeconomics 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, R&amp;D costs, and the ability to recoup those costs, are a factor in deciding whether to spend the money on R&amp;D or not.{{Citation needed|reason=This seems mildly biased, what about raising prices in order to afford investing in future R&amp;D?|date=March 2017}} While this example is a fallacy, however, raising prices in order to finance future R&amp;D is not considered to be one. 

Some research has also noted circumstances where the ''sunk cost fallacy'' is reversed; that is, where individuals appear irrationally eager to write off earlier investments in order to take up a new endeavor&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Chip. "Escalation and de-escalation of commitment in response to sunk costs: The role of budgeting in mental accounting." ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes'' 62 (1995): 38-38.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ''sunk cost fallacy'' is in [[game theory]] sometimes known as the "Concorde Fallacy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00292525 |title=Do Savannah Sparrows Commit the Concorde Fallacy? |publisher=Springer Berlin |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/q553g0w6844m5kt3 |accessdate=2009-09-15 |first1= P.J. | last1=Weatherhead |journal= Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. |volume= 5 |pages=373–381 |issue=4 | year=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the fact that the British and French governments continued to fund the joint development of [[Concorde]] even after it became apparent that there was no longer an economic case for the aircraft. The project was regarded privately by the British government as a "commercial disaster" which should never have been started and was almost cancelled, but political and legal issues had ultimately made it impossible for either government to pull out.

==Bygones principle==
The ''bygones principle'' is an [[economic theory]] used in business.&lt;ref name="Gupta2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gupta|first=K. P.|title=Cost Management: Measuring, Monitoring &amp; Motivating Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtQ6jBgwbvEC&amp;pg=PA248|year=2009|publisher=Global India Publications|isbn=978-93-80228-02-0|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists stress the "extra" or "marginal" costs and benefits of every decision. The theory emphasizes the importance of ignoring past costs and only taking into account the future costs and benefits when making decisions. It states that when making a decision, one should make a hard-headed calculation of the extra costs one will incur and weigh these against its extra advantages.

==Etymology==
{{anchor|Term origins}}
The term is sometimes credited as having been coined and defined by [[Canadian]] sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] in his paper "On the Characteristics of Total Institutions", presented in April 1957 at the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research|Walter Reed Institute]]'s Symposium on Preventive and Social Psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Goffman"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  An expanded version appeared in [[Donald Cressey]]'s collection, ''The Prison'',&lt;ref name="Cressey"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Prison: Studies in Institutional Organization and Change |editor=Donald R. Cressey |year=1961 |publisher=Holt |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was reprinted in Goffman's 1961 collection, ''[[Asylums (book)|Asylums]]''.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Extracts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goffman"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Fine and Manning, however, note that Goffman heard the term in lectures by [[Everett Hughes (sociologist)|Everett Hughes]] (likely during the late-1940s seminar, "Work and Occupations").&lt;ref name="fm36"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fine|first1=Gary Alan|last2=Smith|first2=Gregory W. H.|title=Erving Goffman. Vol. 1–4|year=2000|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]|isbn=0-7619-6863-6|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether Goffman coined the term, he can be credited with popularizing it.&lt;ref name="Tonry2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Tonry|title=The Oxford Handbook of Crime and Criminal Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSHkIF7tamgC&amp;pg=PA884|accessdate=29 May 2013|date=29 September 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-539508-2|page=884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==
{{anchor|Typology of total institutions}}
Total institutions are divided by Goffman into five different types:&lt;ref name="Extracts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldstein|first1=Martin|last2=Goldstein|first2=Inge|title=The experience of science: an interdisciplinary approach|year=1984|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-306-41538-0|pages=231|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwhD5g0wbpAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA231,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# places established to care for people felt to be incapable of looking after themselves and a threat to the community, albeit an unintended one: [[leprosarium]]s, [[mental hospital]]s, and tuberculosis [[sanatorium|sanitariums]].
# institutions organised to protect the community against what are felt to be intentional dangers to it, with the welfare of the people thus sequestered not the immediate issue: [[concentration camps]], [[Prisoner-of-war camp|P.O.W. camp]]s, [[Prison|penitentiaries]], and [[jail]]s.
# institutions purportedly established to better pursue some worklike tasks and justifying themselves only on these instrumental grounds: [[colonial compounds]], [[work camp]]s, [[boarding school]]s, [[ships]], army [[barracks]], and large [[mansions]] from the point of view of those who live in the [[servants' quarters]].
# establishments designed as retreats from the world even while often serving also as training stations for the religious; examples are [[convents]], [[abbeys]], [[monasteries]], and other [[cloisters]].

[[Sociologist]]s have pointed out that [[tourism|tourist]] venues such as [[cruise ship]]s are acquiring many of the characteristics of total institutions.

These examples differ from the traditional examples in that the influence is short term.&lt;ref&gt;George Ritzer and Allan Liska, "'McDisneyization' and 'Post-tourism:' Complementary Perspectives on Contemporary Tourism," ''Tourism: The Experience of Tourism'', ed.

===Universities===
John Paul Wright, professor of criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati, has characterized many modern American universities as total institutions: 
:Billion dollar institutions now police students' Halloween costumes, their private text messages, their social media posts, and even their external voluntary associations. Faculty and staff, too, are finding their words—written, spoken, and even sung—subject to formal, and more often secret, investigation. Almost every aspect of life on many campuses is now subject to unprecedented surveillance and potential sanction.&lt;ref&gt;John Paul Wright (2017).

'''Troy weight''' is a system of [[Physical unit|unit]]s of [[mass]] customarily used for [[precious metal]]s and [[gemstone]]s. One troy ounce (abbreviated "t oz" or "oz t") is equal to {{val|31.1034768|ul=grams}}, (or about 1.0971 oz. [[avoirdupois]], the "avoirdupois" ounce being the most common definition of an "ounce" in the US).&lt;ref name=nist&gt;https://www.nist.gov/file/330151 pdf National Institute of Standards and Technology - Handbook 44 - Appendix C - General Tables of Units of Measurement&lt;/ref&gt; There are only 12 troy ounces per troy pound, rather than the 16 ounces per pound found in the more common [[Avoirdupois | avoirdupois system]]. The avoirdupois pound has 7000 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] whereas the troy pound has only 5760  grains (i.e. 12 × 480 grains). Both systems use the same grain defined by the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959 as  {{val|0.06479891|u=grams}}. Therefore, the troy ounce is {{convert|480|gr|sigfig=4|disp=or}}, compared with the avoirdupois ounce, which is {{convert|437.5|gr|disp=or}}. The troy ounce, then, is about 10% heavier (ratio 192/175) than the avoirdupois ounce. Although troy ounces are still used to weigh [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[gemstone]]s, troy weight is no longer used in most other applications. One troy ounce of [[Gold as an investment|gold]] is denoted with the [[ISO 4217|ISO 4217 currency code]] XAU, while one troy ounce of [[Silver as an investment|silver]] is denoted as XAG.&lt;ref name="currency-iso.org"&gt;{{Cite web

==Etymology==
Troy weight probably takes its name from the French market town of [[Troyes]] in France where English merchants traded at least as early as the early 9th century.&lt;ref name="OED3troy2"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|chapter-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/206831|date=June 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=troy, n.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|quote=The received opinion is that it took its name from a weight used at the fair of Troyes in France}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Partridge|title=Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English|year=1958|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London|page=3566|chapter=Trojan|oclc=250202885|quote=…the great fairs established for all Europe the weight-standard ''Troyes'', whence…''Troy''…}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "troy" is first attested in 1390, describing the weight of a platter, in an account of the travels in Europe of the [[Henry IV of England#Relationship with Richard II|Earl of Derby]].&lt;ref name="OED3troy2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=L.

Charles Moore Watson (1844–1916) proposes an alternative etymology:  ''The Assize of Weights and Measures'' (also known as ''[[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)#Acts of Parliament|Tractatus de Ponderibus et Mensuris]]''), one of the [[statutes of uncertain date]] from the reign of either [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] or [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], thus before 1307, specifies "troni ponderacionem"—which the Public Record Commissioners translate as "troy weight".  The word "troni" refers to markets.  Watson finds the dialect word "troi", meaning a [[Weighing scale|balance]] in Wright's Dialect Dictionary.  Troy weight referred to the tower system; the earliest reference to the modern troy weights is in 1414.&lt;ref name="CMW1910"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Charles Moore|title=British weights and measures as described in the laws of England from Anglo-Saxon times|url=https://archive.org/stream/britishweightsme00watsuoft/britishweightsme00watsuoft_djvu.txt|year=1910|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=82|oclc=4566577|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401195759/http://archive.org/stream/britishweightsme00watsuoft/britishweightsme00watsuoft_djvu.txt|archivedate=2016-04-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Wright (linguist)|title=The English dialect dictionary|volume=6|year=1898|publisher=English Dialect Society|location=Oxford|page=250|oclc=63381077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Many aspects of the troy weight system were indirectly derived from the [[Roman currency|Roman monetary system]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used bronze bars of varying weights as currency. An {{Lang|la|[[aes grave]]}} ("heavy bronze") weighed one [[Pound (mass)|pound]]. One twelfth of an {{lang|la|aes grave}} was called an {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Weight|uncia]]}}, or in English, an "ounce". Before the adoption of the metric system, many systems of troy weights were in use in various parts of Europe, among them Holland troy, Paris troy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Kelly, LL.D. - [https://books.google.com/books?id=iqtLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=%22The+Universal+Cambist%22+%22when+silver+is+sold+in+bars%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L5q-TojYF6OziQK37cmoCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Universal Cambist and Commercial Instructor, Vol. 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327193151/https://books.google.com/books?id=iqtLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=%22The+Universal+Cambist%22+%22when+silver+is+sold+in+bars%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L5q-TojYF6OziQK37cmoCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAA |date=2017-03-27 }} p. 20 (1811)&lt;/ref&gt; Their values varied from one another by up to several percentage points. Troy weights were first used in England in the 15th century, and were made official for gold and silver in 1527.&lt;ref name="HallockWade1906"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hallock|first1=William|authorlink1=William Hallock|last2=Wade|first2=Herbert Treadwell|title=Outlines of the evolution of weights and measures and the metric system|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJ0gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=14 August 2012|year=1906|publisher=The Macmillan company|location=London|page=34|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105072502/http://books.google.com/books?id=kJ0gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34|archivedate=5 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Imperial system of weights and measures (also known as [[Imperial units]]) was established in 1824, prior to which the troy weight system was a subset of pre-Imperial [[English units]].

The troy ounce in use today is essentially the same as the British Imperial troy ounce (1824–1971), adopted as an official weight standard for [[United States]] coinage by Act of Congress on May 19, 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The British Imperial troy ounce (known more commonly simply as the imperial troy ounce) was based on, and virtually identical with, the pre-1824 British troy ounce and the pre-1707 English troy ounce. (1824 was the year the British Imperial system of weights and measures was adopted, 1707 was the year of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] which created the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].) Troy ounces have been used in England since about 1400 and the English troy ounce was officially adopted for coinage in 1527. Before that time, various sorts of troy ounces were in use on the continent.&lt;ref name="1977zupko"&gt;{{cite book

The troy ounce and grain were also part of the [[apothecaries' system]]. This was long used in medicine, but has now been largely replaced by the [[metric system]] (milligrams).&lt;ref name="dictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=Troy Ounce | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/troy%20ounce | work=WordNet 3.0, Dictionary.com | publisher=Princeton University | accessdate=2008-01-10 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226004653/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/troy%20ounce | archivedate=2008-02-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only troy weight in widespread use today is the British Imperial troy ounce and its American counterpart. Both are currently based on a grain of 0.06479891&amp;nbsp;gram (exact, by definition), with 480 grains to a troy ounce (compared with {{frac|437|1|2}} grains for an ounce avoirdupois).

The British Empire abolished the 12-ounce troy pound in the 19th century, though it has been retained (although rarely used) in the American system.

===Origin===
The origin of the troy weight system is unknown. Although the name probably comes from the [[Champagne fairs]] at [[Troyes]], in northeastern France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the units themselves may be of more northern origin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} English troy weights were nearly identical to the troy weight system of [[Bremen]]. (The Bremen troy ounce had a mass of 480.8 British Imperial grains.)&lt;ref name="1977zupko"/&gt;

An alternative suggestion is that the weights come from the Muslim domains by way of the Gold [[Dirham|Dirhem]] (47.966 British Imperial grains), in the manner that [[King Offa]]'s weights were derived from the silver Dirhem (about 45.0 British grains).

According to Watson, troy relates to a dialect word '''troi''' (balance).  Then troy weight is a style of weighing, like [[auncel]] or [[bismar]] weights, or other kindred methods.  The troy weight then refers to weighing of small precious or potent goods, such as [[bullion]] and medicines.&lt;ref name="CMW1910"/&gt;

==Units of measurement==
[[File:comparison of pounds.svg|thumb|400px|Chart comparing the mass (in grams) of tower, Troy, merchant, avoirdupois and London pounds. Each colored block represents one ounce (gold=Troy, blue= avoirdupois, purple=tower)]]

=== Troy pound ===
The troy pound is 5 760&amp;nbsp;grains (≈ 373.24&amp;nbsp;g, 12&amp;nbsp;oz&amp;nbsp;t), while an [[avoirdupois]] pound is approximately 21.53% heavier at 7 000&amp;nbsp;grains (≈ 453.59&amp;nbsp;g).

=== Troy ounce (oz&amp;nbsp;t) ===
One troy ounce (oz&amp;nbsp;t) is equal to {{nowrap|31.103 476 8}} grams.
Also equal to {{nowrap|1.097 142 86}} avoirdupois ounces, exactly {{frac|192|175}}, or about 10% larger.

=== Pennyweight (dwt) ===
{{main|Pennyweight}}

The pennyweight symbol is ''dwt''. There are 24 grains in 1 dwt, and 20 dwt in one troy ounce. Because there were 12 troy ounces in the old troy pound, there would have been 240 pennyweights to the pound—the basis of the fact that the old [[pound sterling|British pound sterling]] of currency contained 240 pence. (However, prior to 1526, English [[pound sterling]] was based on the [[tower pound]], which is {{frac|15|16}} of a troy pound.) The ''d'' in ''dwt'' stands for ''[[denarius]]'', the ancient Roman coin that equates loosely to a penny. The symbol ''d'' for penny can be recognized in the notation for British pre-decimal pennies, in which pounds, shillings, and pence were indicated using the symbols ''£'', ''s'', and ''d'', respectively. For example, ''£6 11s 8d'' indicated six pounds, eleven shillings, and eight pence.

=== Mint weights ===
Mint weights, also known as ''moneyers' weights'' were legalised by Act of Parliament dated 17 July 1649 entitled ''An Act touching the monies and coins of England''.

==Scottish system==
In Scotland, the Incorporation of Goldsmiths of the City of Edinburgh used a system in multiples of sixteen. (''See Assay-Master's Accounts, 1681–1702, on loan from the Incorporation to the National Archives of Scotland''.) Thus, there were 16 drops to the troy ounce, 16 ounces to the troy pound, and 16 pounds to the troy stone. The Scots had several other ways of measuring precious metals and gems, but this was the common usage for gold and silver.

The Pound was 7716 BI grains, but after the union, rounded to 7680 BI grains.  This divides to 16 ounces, each of 16 drops, each of 30 grains.  The rounding makes the ounce and grain equal to the English standard.

==Dutch system==
The Dutch troy system is based on a Mark, of 8 Ounces, the ounce of 20 Engels (pennyweight), the Engel of 32 As. The mark was rated as 3798 Grains, English troy, or 246.084 metric grams.  The divisions are identical to the tower system.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Patric|title=Universal Cambist|year=1835|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{English pounds}}

The troy system was used in the [[apothecaries' system]], but with different further subdivisions.

==Relationship to British coinage==
King [[Offa]]'s [[currency]] reform replaced the [[sceat]] with the [[silver]] [[penny]].  This coin was derived from half of a silver [[dirhem]].  The weights were then derived by a count of coins, by a mix of [[Charlemagne]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] systems.  A [[shilling]] was set to twelve [[pence]], an [[ounce]] to twenty pence, and a [[British pound|pound]] to twelve ounces or twenty shillings.  The penny was quite a lot of money, so weight by coins was not a general practice.

Later kings debased the coin, both in weight and fineness.  The original pound divided was the [[tower pound]] of 5400 [[grain]]s, but a later pound of 5760 grains displaced it.  Where once 240 pence made a tower pound (and 256 make a troy pound), by the time of the [[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)|United Kingdom Weights and Measures Act]] of 1824, a troy pound gives 792 silver pence, still minted as such as [[Maundy Money]].

[[Sterling silver|Sterling]] originally referred to the Norman silver penny of the late 11th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The coin was minted to a fineness of 11 oz, 2 dwt (in the pound), or 925 [[Millesimal fineness]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10167">{{About|the philosophical concept of value-pluralism|other uses of the term|Pluralism (disambiguation)}}
In [[ethics]], '''value pluralism''' (also known as '''ethical pluralism''' or '''moral pluralism''') is the idea that there are several [[values]] which may be equally correct and fundamental, and yet in conflict with each other. In addition, value-pluralism postulates that in many cases, such incompatible values may be [[commensurability (ethics)|incommensurable]], in the sense that there is no objective ordering of them in terms of importance. Value pluralism is opposed to ''value monism''.

Value-pluralism is a theory in [[metaethics]], rather than a theory of [[normative ethics]], or a set of values in itself. [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] philosopher and historian of ideas [[Isaiah Berlin]] is credited with being the first to popularize a substantial work describing the theory of objective value-pluralism, bringing it to the attention of academia (cf. the Isaiah Berlin Virtual Library). The related idea that fundamental values can and, in some cases, do conflict with each other is prominent in the thought of [[Max Weber]], captured in his notion of "polytheism".

== Context ==

Value-pluralism is an alternative to both [[moral relativism]] and [[moral absolutism]] (which Berlin called ''monism'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berlin/ |title= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Isaiah Berlin | last1= Cherniss | first1= Joshua | last2= Hardy | first2= Henry | date= 2013-11-29 |accessdate= 2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of value-pluralism is the idea that the moral life of a nun is incompatible with that of a mother, yet there is no purely rational measure of which is preferable. Hence, moral decisions often require radical preferences with no rational calculus to determine which alternative is to be selected.

Value-pluralism differs from value-relativism in that pluralism accepts limits to differences, such as when vital human needs are violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crowder | first = George | title = Liberalism and Value Pluralism | publisher = [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]] | location = London | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-8264-5048-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If values can be compared with virtues or duties then reference might also be made to the arguments of classical philosophy. Kant, for example, referred to "a conflict of duties"&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. ''Critique of Practical Reason'' 1788 (tr. Abbott T.K., Longmans, Green &amp; Co., London, 1883) p.280&lt;/ref&gt; and the subject can be traced back to Plato's ''Statesman'' where he wrote that although the aim may be "to promote not a part of virtue but the whole", it is often the case that the different parts of virtue "may be at war with one another".&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Statesman'' 306; cf. ''Laws'' 705, ''Republic'' 443&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaiah Berlin suggested that [[James Fitzjames Stephen]], rather than himself, deserved credit for fathering value-pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blattberg|first1=Charles|title=An Exchange with Professor Sir Isaiah Berlin|url=http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/lists/onib/blattberg.pdf|publisher=The Isaiah Berlin Literary Trust|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stephen had observed: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There are innumerable differences which obviously add to the interest of life, and without which it would be unendurably dull. Again, there are differences which can neither be left unsettled nor be settled without a struggle, and a real one, but in regard to which the struggle is rather between inconsistent forms of good than between good and evil. In cases of this sort no one need see an occasion for anything more than a good-tempered trial of strength and skill, except those narrow-minded fanatics whose minds are incapable of taking in more than one idea at a time, or of having a taste for more things than one, which one thing is generally a trifle. There is no surer mark of a poor, contemptible, cowardly character than the inability to conduct disputes of this sort with fairness, temper, humanity, goodwill to antagonists, and a determination to accept a fair defeat in good part and to make the best of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephen|first1=James Fitzjames|title=Liberty, Equality, Fraternity|date=1874|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/572#Stephen_0021_308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William James]], influenced by Fitzjames Stephen, endorsed value-pluralism in an essay on "[[The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life]]", which he first delivered as a lecture in 1891. He wrote that none "of the measures [of goodness] that have been actually proposed has, however, given general satisfaction ... The various ideals have no common character apart from the fact that they are ideals. No single abstract principle can be so used as to yield to the philosopher anything like a scientifically accurate and genuinely useful casuistic scale."

[[Joseph Raz]] and many others have done further work clarifying and defending value-pluralism. For instance, political philosopher [[William Galston]], former policy advisor to President Bill Clinton, has defended a Berlinian approach to value pluralism in books like ''Liberal Pluralism.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Liberal Pluralism: The Implications of Value Pluralism for Political Theory and Practice|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2002-05-13|location = Cambridge|isbn = 9780521813044|language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetlock]], studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tetlock|first1=P.E.|last2=Peterson|first2=R.|last3=Lerner|first3=J.|title=Revising the value pluralism model: Incorporating social content and context postulates|journal=Ontario symposium on social and personality psychology: Values|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tetlock|first1=P.E.|title=A value pluralism model of ideological reasoning|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Personality Processes and Individual Differences|date=1986|volume=50|pages=819–827}}&lt;/ref&gt; and identifies with&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The bright future of post-partisan social psychology|url=http://edge.org/conversation/jonathan_haidt-the-bright-future-of-post-partisan-social-psychology|first = Jonathan|last=Haidt|website=edge.org|date=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; value pluralism.

== Criticisms ==
The philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], who was Berlin's student, has advanced an important critique of Berlin's value-pluralism. Blattberg focuses on value-pluralism's applications to Marx, the Russian intelligentsia, Judaism, and Berlin's early political thought, as well as Berlin's conceptions of liberty, the Enlightenment versus the Counter-Enlightenment, and history.

Another notable critic of value-pluralism in recent times is [[Ronald Dworkin]], the second most-cited American legal scholar, who attempts to forge a [[liberalism|liberal]] theory of [[egalitarianism|equality]] from a [[monism|monist]] starting-point, citing the failure of value-pluralism to adequately address the "Equality of what?" debate.

Alan Brown suggests that Berlin ignores the fact that values are indeed commensurable as they can be compared by their varying contributions towards the human good.&lt;ref name="Brown_157_158"&gt;Brown, A. (1986) Modern Political Philosophy; Theories of the Just Society, Middlesex, Penguin Books pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the ends of freedom, equality, efficiency, creativity, etc., Brown maintains that none of these are ends in themselves but are valued for their consequences. Brown concludes that Berlin has failed to show that the problem of conflicting values is insoluble in principle.&lt;ref name="Brown_157_158"/&gt; The deliberative democrat [[Robert B. Talisse|Robert Talisse]] has published several articles criticizing the pluralism of Isaiah Berlin, William Galston, [[Richard Flathman]], and [[John N. Gray|John Gray]], alleging informal logic and internal epistemological contradictions.

A '''vigilante''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|ɪ|dʒ|ɪ|ˈ|l|æ|n|t|i|}}, {{IPAc-en||ˌ|v|ɪ|dʒ|ɪ|ˈ|l|æ|n|t|eɪ|}}; {{IPA-es|bixiˈlante|lang}}; {{IPA-pt|viʒiˈlɐ̃t(ɨ)|lang}}, {{IPA-pt|viʒiˈlɐ̃tʃi|}}) is a [[civilian]] or organization acting in a [[law enforcement]] capacity (or in the pursuit of self-perceived justice) without legal authority.

==Vigilante conduct==

"Vigilante justice" is often rationalized by the concept that proper legal forms of criminal punishment are either nonexistent, insufficient, or inefficient. Vigilantes normally see the government as ineffective in enforcing the law; such individuals often claim to justify their actions as a fulfillment of the wishes of the community.

Persons alleged to be escaping the law or above the law are sometimes the victims of vigilantism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csvr.org.za/papers/papvtp1.htm |title="As for Violent Crime that's our Daily Bread": Vigilante violence during South Africa's period of transition |first1=Bronwyn |last1=Harris |date=May 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203104624/http://www.csvr.org.za/papers/papvtp1.htm |archivedate=2007-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vigilante conduct involves varied degrees of violence. Vigilantes could assault targets verbally and/or physically, damage and/or vandalize property, or even murder individuals.

In a number of cases, vigilantism has involved targets with mistaken identities.

==History==
Vigilantism and the vigilante ethos existed long before the word ''vigilante'' was introduced into the English language. There are conceptual and psychological parallels between the [[Dark Age]] and medieval [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] custom of [[private war]] or [[Feud|vendetta]] and the modern vigilante philosophy.

Elements of the concept of vigilantism can be found in the Biblical account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 34 of the abduction and rape (or, by some interpretations, seduction) of [[Dinah]], the daughter of [[Jacob]], in the [[Canaan]]ite city of [[Shechem]] by the eponymous son of the ruler, and the violent reaction of her brothers [[Simeon (Hebrew Bible)|Simeon]] and [[Levi]], who slew all of the males of the city in revenge, rescued their sister and plundered Shechem. When Jacob protested that their actions might bring trouble upon him and his family, the brothers replied "Should he [i.e., Shechem] treat our sister as a harlot?"

Similarly, in {{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 13}}, [[Absalom]] kills [[Amnon]] after [[King David]], their father, fails to punish Amnon for raping [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]], their sister.

Recourse to personal vengeance and [[dueling]] was considered a class privilege of the sword-bearing aristocracy before the formation of the modern centralized liberal-bureaucratic nation-state (see [[Marc Bloch]], trans. L. A. Manyon, ''Feudal Society'', Vol. I, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;127). In addition, sociologists{{Who|date=July 2015}} have posited a complex legal and ethical interrelationship between vigilante acts and [[rebellion]] and [[tyrannicide]].

In the [[western culture|Western]] literary and cultural tradition, characteristics of ''vigilantism'' have often been vested in folkloric heroes and legendary [[outlaw]]s (e.g., [[Robin Hood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6OZHSrJCRAC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=%22robin+hood%22+vigilantism#PPA316,M1|title=A Great Effusion of Blood?: Interpreting Medieval Violence|author=Mark D. Meyerson, Daniel Thiery|date=2004-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Vigilantism in literature, folklore and legend is connected to the fundamental issues of dissatisfied morality, injustice, the failures of authority and the ethical adequacy of legitimate governance.

During medieval times, punishment of felons was sometimes exercised by such [[secret societies]] as the courts of the [[Vehm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Germany: Die Feme | publisher = Time | date = Oct 16, 1944 | url = http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,885763-1,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[cf.]] the medieval Sardinian ''Gamurra'' later become ''Barracelli'', the Sicilian [[Vendicatori]] and the [[Beati Paoli]]), a type of early vigilante organization, which became extremely powerful in Westphalian Germany during the 15th century.

===Colonial era in America===
Formally-defined vigilantism arose in the early American colonies.

*Established the mid-18th century, for instance, the [[Regulator movement]] of American colonial times was composed of citizen volunteers of the [[frontier]] who opposed [[official misconduct]] and [[extrajudicial]]ly punished banditry as well as protected colonists from indigenous Americans' enforcement of border control.

===India===
{{see also|Moral police}}
In India, vigilante refers to when a group metes out [[Law of India|extralegal]] punishment to alleged lawbreakers. [[Vigilantism]] is also referred to as "mob justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===19th century===
{{Globalize|section|date=August 2015}}
As boom-towns, or mining towns in California because of the Gold Rush, started appearing towards the 1850s, vigilantes started taking justice into their own hands because these towns did not have any established forms of government. These people would assault accused thieves, rapists and murderers. When they assaulted these thieves, they would steal their gold and give it to the accuser. Other than reports and newspapers, there are not many records of vigilantes. Few names or groups are known.

* [[Los Angeles]] and the bordering counties experienced outbursts of vigilantism from the early 1850s as many of the criminals driven out of San Francisco and the [[Gold Country]] expanded into the less-populated "Cow Counties" of [[Southern California]], making the city and nearby countryside a dangerous place for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote=The homicide rate between 1847 and 1870 averaged 158 per 100,000 (13 murders per year), which was 10 to 20 times the annual murder rates for New York City during the same period |first=Eric |last=Monkkonen |title=Western Homicide: The Case of Los Angeles, 1830–1870 |journal=Pacific Historical Review |volume=74 |year=2005 |issue=4 |pages=603–618 [p. 609] |doi=10.1525/phr.2005.74.4.603 |jstor= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This touched off a three-month cycle of retaliatory battles and raids by the two sides in which some 29 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kshs.org/publicat/history/1995summer_watts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1856 the San Francisco Vigilance Movement remobilized, but unlike the earlier Committee, and the vigilante tradition generally, the 1856 Committee was concerned with not only civil crimes but also politics and political corruption.&lt;ref name="Public City"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ethington|title=The Public City: The Political Construction of Urban Life in San Francisco, 1850-1900|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|pages=88–89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhyq64Plm4YC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=%22san+francisco+committee+of+vigilance%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=53mKnnCbMR&amp;sig=q9XxFJ4xlLwMkDw69uqzSGwcMP4|location=Berekely, CA|accessdate=2007-09-03|isbn= 0-520-23001-9|first=Philip J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In October 1862 in northern Texas, several [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionist]] sympathizers were arrested and taken to [[Gainesville, Texas]] for trial on charges of treason and insurrection.  Seven were tried and hung, and 14 were hung without trial.  A few weeks later, Unionist sympathizers were hung without trial across northern Texas.  Known as the "[[Great Hanging at Gainesville]]", it may have been the deadliest act of vigilante violence in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Under the Rebel Flag: Life in Texas During the Civil War | publisher = Texas State Library and Archives Commission | year = 2011 | url = https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/civilwar/dissent.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From late December 1863 to 1864 the [[Montana Vigilantes]] were formed by citizens of [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]], [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]] and nearby [[Nevada City, Montana|Nevada City]] to fight lawlessness in the gold mining region of Montana. Over the next month, 21 men were hanged, including, on January 10, 1864, [[Henry Plummer]] the sheriff of Bannack, who was also the leader of a major gang of highwaymen. The last man hanged by the vigilantes may have done nothing more than express an opinion that several of those hanged previously had been innocent.
* In 1865, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was formed in Pulaski, Tennessee by a group of six Confederate War veterans.  The KKK or "Klan" sought to use extralegal force to resist [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] South of the United States. The KKK became a leading agent of [[Racism|racist]] and [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] violence in the United States.

Amid rising [[anti-Italianism]], the impoverished Italian and [[Sicily|Sicilian]] immigrants in the jailhouse had been blanketly and summarily rounded up and charged baselessly on suspicion of [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] involvement and involvement in the murder of [[David Hennessy]]. When the Italian immigrants were acquitted, a lynch mob forcibly entered the jail, executing and hanging the Italians. Later, in [[Tallulah, Louisiana]] in 1899, three [[Italian-American]] immigrant shopkeepers were lynched because they had given equal status in their shops to [[African Americans|black]] customers. A vigilante mob ultimately hanged five Italian-Americans during the incident: the three Italian shopkeepers and two Italian bystanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The Italian Americans |first= Allon |last= Schoener |publisher= Macmillan Publishing Company |year= 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In March 1898, the "101" of [[Skagway, Alaska]] posted handbills and held meetings trying to free the town of a bunco gang known as the "Soap Gang" under the control of the infamous [[Soapy Smith]]. Four months after its creation the 101 shot and killed Soapy in a [[shootout on Juneau Wharf]].

'''Wealth in people''' (sometimes written wealth-in-people) is a concept developed by [[anthropologists]] and historians to describe social systems in which status, power, and influence are achieved and mediated through the number of one's dependents, followers, or other social ties and affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berry|first=Sara|title=No Condition is Permanent: The Social Dynamics of Agrarian Change in Sub-Saharan Africa|year=1993|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dependent's labor generates material wealth, which is in turn used to attach further dependents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson-Hanks|first=Jennifer|title=Uncertain Honor: Modern Motherhood in an African Crisis|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgoQlcAZN3EC&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=wealth%20in%20people&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q=wealth%20in%20people&amp;f=false|isbn=9780226401812}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such systems can therefore exist independent of or alongside other capitalist or monetary modes of value and accumulation. The concept is most commonly applied to [[ethnographies]] and histories of Africa, particularly the tropical equatorial regions.

== Origins of term ==

Anthropologists have long emphasized the importance of ties and affiliations for gaining status. One of the earliest uses of the concept was by [[Max Gluckman]] in his 1941 work ''Economy of the Central Barotse Plain,'' with other similar uses by anthropologists such as Kenneth Little in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=Kenneth|title=The Mende of Sierra Leone: A West African People in Transition|year=1951|publisher=Routledge &amp; K. Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lloyd A. Fallers]] in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fallers|first=Lloyd A.|title=The King's Men: Leadership and Status in Buganda on the Eve of Independence|year=1964|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and David Murray Schneider in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=David Murray|title=American Kinship: A Cultural Account|year=1968|publisher=Prentice-Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the specific term "wealth-in-people" did not gain widespread use until the early 1980s. The first of this wave of anthropological studies was Caroline H. Bledsoe's 1980 work on ''Women and Marriage in Kpelle Society,'' which used the concept to examine how urbanization affects the strategies of [[Kpelle people|Kpelle]] women and men to gain power an influence by binding themselves to their superiors through ties of marriage, clientship, and filial obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bledsoe|first=Caroline H.|title=Women and Marriage in Kpelle Society|year=1980|publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bledsoe's framework, people can be understood as resources, and the way society is ordered therefore is the result of rational choice.

In the 1990s, the concept of wealth-in-people became a widespread conceptual tool not only in anthropology but also history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guyer|first=Jane I.|author2=Samuel M. Eno Belinga |title=Wealth in People as Wealth in Knowledge: Accumulation and Composition in Equatorial Africa|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1995|volume=36|issue=1|pages=91–120|doi=10.1017/S0021853700026992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of [[urbanization in Africa]], they created mobile cities. If the land was no longer suitable for crops, then the people would have to change their location.
The importance of Wealth in People in Africa could be related to the people in Africa having a primacy of exit. With there being so much land around, if the people did not like the way a ruler was leading, they could leave and start a new settlement. When the European settlers came, they also acknowledged the importance of Wealth in People. This is seen with European men like the laçandos who married prominent African women in order to gain more connections for trading. Additionally Wealth in People is also connected to Wealth in Knowledge. Wealth in Knowledge and Wealth in People are closely related; they both focus on the number of people or things that a person knows as a marker of his or her power in African society. This emphasis of knowledge could also be related to the heavy presence of oral history in African society. The griots were African oral historians and were highly ranked in society. The ability to learn the history like the Sundiata epic became a sacred tradition passed between father and son.

== Examples ==

The concept of wealth-in-people has been used to understand a range of societies, most of which are in central Africa.

=== Cameroon ===

Nicholas Argenti applies the concept to [[Southern Cameroons|southern Cameroon]] to show the flip side of wealth in people, noting the marginalized status that would accompany men who were not able to acquire a sufficient number of dependents (including wives, children, and clients).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Argenti|first=Nicolas|title=The Intestines of the State: Youth, Violence, and Belated Histories in the Cameroon Grassfields|year=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane Guyer and Samuel Eno Belinga also discuss the concept of wealth in people as it relates to Central Africa and, in particular, Cameroon. In “Wealth in People as Wealth in Knowledge: Accumulation and Composition in Equatorial Africa,” Guyer and Eno Beligna use Moneblum (The Blue Man), a Cameroonian epic by Daniel Osomo, as evidence of the role wealth-in-people plays in political mobilization. The epic tells the story of a son, Mekui-Mengomo, who challenges his father in a quest to marry. Rather than win through his own powers, Mekui-Mengomo must call on the community to help him in this quest. Each power he needs is owned by a different person, and each must come forth individually to supply it. Mekui-Mengomo drives this process, but he cannot do it alone, or through oppressive force. Instead he must attract people to his cause. The dynamic found in Mekui-Mengomo’s story reflects the broader culture in which “the ability to range over vast differentiated social and geographic space for exactly the right components to produce a particular desired goal was intrinsic to social power.” &lt;ref&gt;Guyer, Jane I.; Samuel M. Eno Belinga (1995). "Wealth in People as Wealth in Knowledge: Accumulation and Composition in Equatorial Africa". The Journal of African History 36 (1): 91–120. doi:10.1017/S0021853700026992&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial Era===

Jeffrey Herbst draws on the wealth-in-people concept when writing about power in pre-colonial Africa more generally, and about the challenges Europeans faced in trying to impose control within this environment. Herbst argues that the Europeans were unprepared for the dynamic they found in a “world where the extension and consolidation of power meant something very different from the broadcasting of authority in Europe or in postcolonial regions of the developing world.” &lt;ref&gt;Herbst, Jeffrey. ""Power and Space in Precolonial Africa" and "The Europeans and the African Problem"" States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2000. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Power in Africa was “nonterritorial,” a sharp contrast to the dynamics that had developed in Europe by the colonial era (though, Herbst argues, not necessarily earlier).&lt;ref&gt;Herbst, Jeffrey. ""Power and Space in Precolonial Africa" and "The Europeans and the African Problem"" States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2000. 35-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Property was focused instead on people, who were comparatively scarce and very mobile. In order to gain power, a state or leader had to draw people in—and those people could leave, using the ample land resources available, if they were mistreated. Herbst argues that this challenge so frustrated Europeans that colonial states went to “elaborate lengths” to give the appearance of control, and responded with violence when these attempts failed or came under threat. Herbst thus shows that wealth-in-people had an impact not only on African societies before the colonial era, but also may have played a significant role in shaping and challenging colonialism as it developed.&lt;ref&gt;Herbst, Jeffrey. ""Power and Space in Precolonial Africa" and "The Europeans and the African Problem"" States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2000. 35-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Yamato-damashii'''''|大和魂||"Japanese spirit"}} or {{nihongo|'''''Yamato-gokoro'''''|大和心||"Japanese heart/mind"}} is a [[Japanese language]] term that refers to the cultural values and characteristics of the [[Japanese people]]. The phrase was coined in the [[Heian period]] to describe the indigenous Japanese 'spirit' or cultural values as opposed to cultural values of foreign nations such as those identified through contact with [[Tang dynasty]] [[China]].  Later, a qualitative contrast between Japanese and Chinese spirit was elicited from the term. [[Edo period]] writers and [[samurai]] used it to augment and support the [[Bushido]] concept of honor and valor.  [[Japanese nationalism|Japanese nationalists]] propagandized ''Yamato-damashii''&amp;nbsp;– "the brave, daring, and indomitable spirit of Japanese people"&amp;nbsp;– as one of the key [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|Japanese military-political doctrines in the Shōwa period]]. English translations of ''Yamato-damashii'' include the "Japanese spirit", "Japanese soul", "Yamato spirit", and "The Soul of Old Japan". [[Lafcadio Hearn]] mentions the latter in connection with [[Shinto]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;For this national type of moral character was invented the name ''Yamato-damashi'' (or ''Yamato-gokoro''),&amp;nbsp;— the Soul of Yamato (or Heart of Yamato),&amp;nbsp;— the appellation of the old province of Yamato, seat of the early emperors, being figuratively used for the entire country. We might correctly, though less literally, interpret the expression ''Yamato-damashi'' as "The Soul of Old Japan". (1904:177)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin of the term==
Originally ''Yamato-damashi'' did not bear the bellicose weight or ideological timbre that it later assumed in pre-war modern Japan. It first occurs in the {{nihongo|''Otome''|乙女|}} section of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (Chapter 21), as a native virtue that flourishes best, not as a contrast to foreign civilization but, rather precisely, when it is grounded on a solid basis in Chinese learning. Thus we read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No, the safe thing is to give him a good, solid fund of knowledge. It is when there is a fund of Chinese learning (''zae'' 才)  that the Japanese spirit (''yamato-damashii'' 大和魂) is respected in the world. ([[Murasaki Shikibu]], ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' tr. [[Edward Seidensticker]], 1976, 1:362) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Lexicology==
''Yamato-damashii'' "Japan, Japanese" [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] ''Yamato'' ([[Wikt:大和|大和]], "great harmony") with ''damashii'', which is the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] ''[[rendaku]]'' pronunciation of ''tamashii'' ([[Wikt:魂|魂]] "spirit; soul"). Both these ''[[kanji]]'' ([[Chinese characters]] used in Japan) readings ''Yamato'' (大和) and ''damashii'' (魂) are native Japanese ''[[kun'yomi]]'', while the ''Wakon'' (和魂 "Japanese spirit") reading is Sinitic ''[[on'yomi]]'' borrowed from Chinese ''Héhún'' (和魂).

''Yamato'' is historically the second of three common Japanese [[endonym]]s (or autonyms) for 'Japan; Japanese'.
*''[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]'' ([[Wikt:倭|倭]] or [[Wikt:和|和]]) is Japan's oldest endonym and derives from the  [[Han dynasty]] Chinese exonym ''Wō'' 倭 "Japan, Japanese". This character 倭, which graphically combines the [[Wikt:亻|亻]] "human, person" [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] and a ''wěi'' [[Wikt:委|委]] "bend" [[phonetic]], was usually pronounced ''wēi'' in [[Classical Chinese]] compounds like ''wēichí'' 倭遲 "winding, circuitous", but scholars have interpreted ''Wō'' 倭 "Japanese" as connoting either "submissive; docile" or "short; dwarf". In the 8th century, Japanese scribes replaced the [[Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese|pejorative Chinese character]]  倭 for ''Wa'' "Japan" with ''Wa'' 和 "harmony; peace".
*''Yamato'' (大和, "great harmony") is the oldest native name for "Japan". ''Daiwa'' and ''Taiwa'' (borrowed from Chinese ''dàhé'' 大和) are ''on'yomi'' readings. This name ''Yamato'' (大和) originally referred to "[[Yamato Province]]", around present-day [[Nara Prefecture]], where [[Emperor Jimmu]] legendarily founded Japan. Common words with this [[prefix]] include ''Yamato-jidai'' (大和時代 "[[Yamato period]]", 250-710 CE), ''Yamato-minzoku'' (大和民族 "[[Yamato people]]; Japanese race"), and ''[[Yamato-e]]'' (大和絵 "traditional Japanese-style paintings").
*''Nihon'' or ''Nippon'' ([[Wikt:日本|日本]], "sun's origin"; "[[Japan]]") is the normal modern [[endonym]]. Compared with the neutral pronunciation ''Nihon'', ''[[Names of Japan|Nippon]]'' has more nationalistic connotations. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
In current Japanese usage, ''Wa'' 倭 is an archaic [[variant Chinese character]] for ''Wa'' 和, ''Yamato'' is a literary and historical term, and ''Nihon'' is the usual name for "Japan; Japanese".

''Tamashii'' or ''tama'' (魂 "soul; spirit; ghost" or 霊 "spirit; soul") is Japanese ''kun'yomi'', while ''kon'' or ''gon'' is Chinese ''on'yomi'' (from ''hún'' [[Hun and po|魂]]). The [[Shinto]]-influenced semantics of Japanese ''tama''/''tamashii'' exceed customary English concepts of "spirit", "soul", or "ghost", besides the human soul, it also includes diverse spiritual forces found in nature. [[Roy Andrew Miller]] suggests that German ''[[Geist]]'' or French ''[[Wikt:élan|élan]]'' are better translations than English ''spirit'' or ''soul'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;But finally we must conclude that nothing in any commonly used European language, including English, really does justice to Japanese ''tama''. The spirit, soul, ''Geist'', or ''élan'' to which the Japanese term has reference, whether it is the ''tama'' of ''Yamato-damashii'' or the ''tama'' of ''kotodama'', is a vital and active entity that plays no part in any usual Western-language imagery or expression. We have no such word, and we make use of no imagery capitalizing upon the concepts that it employs; but the Japanese have, and they do. (1982:131) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Kotodama]]'' ({{lang|ja|言霊}}, "word spirit", approximately "[[magic word]]") illustrate this traditional Japanese belief about ''tama(shii)'' energies. ''[[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese-English Dictionary]]'' (5th ed., 2003) gives ''kotodama'' translation [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]] and a revealing usage example: "{{lang|ja|ことだま【言霊】}}, the soul [spirit] of language; the miraculous power of language [a phrase, a spell]. ̍ ⇨ {{lang|ja|言霊の幸(さきわ)う国}} Japan, "the land where the mysterious workings of language bring bliss"."

''[[Yamato nadeshiko]]'' ({{lang|ja|大和撫子}}, "Japanese [[fringed pink]]") is a floral metaphor for "the idealized traditional Japanese woman". During World War II, ultra-nationalists popularized ''Yamato-nadeshiko'' as the female manifestation of ''Yamato-damashii''.

== Later history==
The record of ''Yamato-damashii'' dates back one millennium to the Heian period (794–1185) of Japanese history, when [[Chinese culture]] and [[Chinese language]] were highly influential.

''Yamato-gokoro'' (大和心 "Japanese heart; Japanese mind" is the closest synonym of ''Yamato-damashii''. The Heian poet [[Akazome Emon]] first used ''Yamato-gokoro'' in her ''Goshūi Wakashū'' (後拾遺和歌集 "Later Collection of [[Waka (poetry)|Waka]] Gleanings," 1086).

Since ''Wa'' 和 commonly abbreviates ''Yamato'' 大和 "Japan; Japanese", 和魂 (also read ''Wakon'') is a contraction of ''Yamato-damashii''. The ''[[Konjaku Monogatarishū]]'' (circa 1120) first uses it describing a burglar who murdered a nattering scholar of Chinese classical law. "Although Kiyohara no Yoshizumi (清原善澄) had admirable learning, he is said to have died in this childish way because he did not have the slightest knowledge of the Japanese spirit" (tr. Carr 1994:283).

For centuries after its use by Heian authors ''Yamato-damashii'' was rarely recorded until the late [[Edo period]] (1600–1868). One [[Kamakura period|Kamakura-period]] exception is the ''[[Gukanshō]]'' history (ca. 1220), which uses ''Yamato-damashii'' (和魂) in praising the character of child [[Emperor Toba]] (r. 1107–1123).
&lt;blockquote&gt; Still, he had the personality of (his uncle) Fujiwara no Kinzane (藤原公実) characterized by Chinese learning and followed in the footsteps of (his ancestor) [[Sugawara no Michizane]], but Toba had even more Japanese spirit than either of them. (adapted from Carr 1994:283)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Three new "Japanese spirit" phrases originated around the 1867 [[Meiji Restoration]]. First, the modernization {{nihongo|''Nihon-damashii''|日本魂|}} was fashioned by [[Kyokutei Bakin]], a famous [[samurai]] author of ''[[Gesaku]]''. His ''Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki'' ("The Crescent Moon", 1811) quotes [[Minamoto no Tametomo]] discussing ''[[seppuku]]'' rituals: "I admit that a person who does not care about dying when on the verge of death may superficially have the Japanese spirit, but I think this is a misunderstanding from not having learned about it." (tr. Carr 1994:284). Second, ''Wakon-kansai'' (和魂漢才 "Japanese spirit and Chinese scholarship") occurs in the ''Kanke ikai'' (菅家遺戒 "Sugawara's dying instructions"). Third, ''Wakon-yōsai'' (和魂洋才 "Japanese spirit and Western techniques") was created by Yoshikawa Tadayasu (吉川忠安) in his ''Kaika sakuron'' (開化策論 , "Questions and Themes on Progress", 1867).

Following the Japanese victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Russo-Japanese War]], nationalists made ''Wakon-yōsai'' into a catchphrase for [[modernization]] and [[militarization]], and developed ''Yamato-damashii'' into what Miller (1982:13) calls "the official rallying cry for the Japanese armed forces in [[World War II]]."

In the present day, ''Yamato-damashii'' is historically associated with [[Japanese nationalism]], but is commonly used in ''[[Nihonjinron]]'' discussions and sports media. It is the motto for the international Purebred [[mixed martial arts]] school headed by Japanese-American [[Enson Inoue]]. Professor David Pollack predicts that ''Yamato-damashii'' will become extinct.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Synthesis comes to an end only when antithesis ceases to appear. For many centuries Japan found its most significant antithesis in China. During the last century and a half the West has been the antithetical term in the dialectic, and as always it has been in that "other" that Japan has sought its own image, peering anxiously for signs of its own identity into the mirror of the rest of the world. After the challenge of Western technology has been successfully met, one wonders what will be left that is "alien," besides the very fact that the historically necessary "other" is lacking. In that case, "Japanese spirit" (Yamato-damashii) will find itself face to face with the most frightening "other" of all – its lack – at which point opposition must cease or else feed upon itself. (1986:52-3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Definitions==
Racially and ethnically offensive words are problematic for dictionaries. [[Lexicographer]]s and publishers have editorial policies for treating [[ethnic slurs]] and insults. For example, [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] (4th ed., 2000) defines ''Jap'' as "''Offensive Slang''. Used as a disparaging term for a person of Japanese birth or descent."

Michael Carr argues that ''Yamato-damashii'' (1994:280-1) "significantly differs from everyday racist slurs because it is not an overt insult, it is the opposite: an ethnic adulation. It belongs to a special category of benedictions such as ''[[Manifest Destiny]]'' or ''[[Chosen People]]'' that imply national, racial, or ethnic self-conceit." The nationalist and racist connotations of Japanese ''Yamato-damashii'' are comparable with German ''Herrenvolk'' ("[[Master race]]").

Carr lexicographically analyzed ''Yamato-damashii'' definitions among modern general-purpose [[Japanese dictionaries]] from four publishers, namely, ''[[Daijisen]]'' (Shōgakukan, 1986), ''[[Daijirin]]'' (Sanseidō, 1988), ''[[Nihongo Daijiten]]'' (Kōdansha, 1989), and ''[[Kōjien]]'' (Iwanami, 1991).

For instance, this definition from the popular ''Daijirin'' dictionary gives the ''kanji'' 大和魂, modern and [[Old Japanese]] pronunciations, two meanings, synonyms, and usage examples from [[Japanese literature]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;やまとだましい［―だましひ］4 【《大和》魂】①大和心。和魂。（漢学を学んで得た知識に対して）日本人固有の実務・世事などを処理する能力・知恵をいう。「才(ざえ)を本としてこそ、―の世に用ゐらるる方も強う侍らめ〔出典： 源氏（乙女）〕」 「露、―無かりける者にて〔出典： 今昔 二十〕」②( 近世以降の国粋思想の中で用いられた語)日本民族固有の精神。日本人としての意識。&lt;br&gt;
'''yamato''' ... '''-damashii''', ''-damashiFi'' "type 4" [accent on ''da''] 【《大和》魂】1. ''yamato-gokoro''. ''wakon''. (in contrast to knowledge obtained from studying Chinese classics) Japanese people's characteristic ability or wisdom/intelligence for managing/treating actual things and worldly affairs. ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (The Maiden [chapter]) "Without a solid foundation of book-learning this 'Japanese spirit' of which one hears so much is not of any great use in the world." [Tales of] Times Now Past (20) "He did not have the slightest knowledge of the Japanese spirit." 2. (term used in ultra-nationalistic ideology of recent times) characteristic mentality of the Japanese race/people. Consciousness/awareness of being a Japanese person. (tr. Carr 1994:288)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Collectively, these four definitions provide insights into what ''Yamato-damashii'' means in current Japanese usage. They all distinguish two basic meanings: ① "A Japanese practical ability; opposed to Chinese scholarship" and ② "A traditional (bushido/nationalistic) concept of death-defying valor".  When two or more definitions use identical terminology, it suggests consensus on semantics. For instance, while the dictionaries split on whether meaning ① refers to ''Nihon-minzoku'' (日本民族 "Japanese race/people/nation") or ''Nihon-jin'' (日本人 "Japanese person/people"), all four say the nationalistic meaning ② refers to ''Nihon-minzoku''.

For meaning ①, the most salient word (used 7 times) is ''koyū'' (固有 "inherent; innate; characteristic; special quality"). This sense is defined as a ''noryoku'' (能力 "ability, capability; competency") or ''chie'' (知恵 "wisdom; insight; intelligence"), which pertains to ''jisseikatsujōno'' (実生活上 "real life; everyday/practical reality') or ''jitsumutekina'' (実務的な "actual things, practical experience").

For meaning ②, all the definitions describe a ''seishin'' (精神 "mind; mentality; spirit; soul; genius"). Specifically a "Japanese spirit" with ''kakan'' (果敢 "boldness; courage; daring; determination"), ''yūmō'' (勇猛 "bravery; valor; intrepidness; daring"), and ''shinmei o mo oshimanai'' (身命をも惜しまない "without regard for one's life"), especially when ''koto ni atatte'' (事に当たって "facing a vital matter; in case of crisis"). Purity is mentioned with ''seijo'' (清浄 "purity; cleanliness") and ''isagiyoi'' (潔い "pure; clean; honorable; gallant; brave").

Within this dictionary sample, only the ''Nihongo daijiten'' qualifies ''Yamato-damashii'' as a characteristic that is ''to sareta'' (とされた "assumed, supposed; alleged'"), whereas the other three define it as a matter of fact. Carr concludes (1994:290), "Believing that all individuals of any race or nationality share certain "spiritual" characteristics is at best overgeneralization, or at worst racism."

Some monolingual English dictionaries enter ''Yamato'' or ''Yamato-e'', but only the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] enters ''Yamato-damashii''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Yamato''' (ja'mato) [Jap., = 'Japan']&lt;br&gt;
'''1'''. The style or school of art in Japan which culminated in the 12th and 13th centuries and dealt with Japanese subjects in a distinctively Japanese (rather than Chinese) way. Usu. as '''Yamato-e''' ('''†-we''') [''e'' picture]; also –'''ryū''' [-''ryū'' style, orig. stream, school]. … &lt;br&gt;
'''2'''. '''Yamato-damashii''': the Japanese spirit. … (v. 3, 2002) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''OED'' gives three usage examples, starting with ''Yamato-damashi'' (1942, ''Royal Air Force Journal'', "He will be filled with what is called ''yamato damashi'' [sic] or the pure spirit of Japan.") and ''Yamato-damashii'' (1957, ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''). Note that the 1904 Hearn quotation above antedates this 1942 citation.

Most Japanese-English dictionaries literally translate ''Yamato-damashii'' as "the Japanese spirit". For instance, [[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese-English Dictionary]] (5th ed., 2003) enters ''Yamato'' "'''やまと'''【大和】 Yamato; (old) Japan" along with 14 subentries, including ''Yamato-damashii'' "'''大和魂''' the Japanese spirit" and ''Yamato-gokoro'' "'''大和心''' the Japanese spirit; the Japanese sensibility."

The online ''Encyclopedia of Shinto'' (linked below, note the pronunciation file) comprehensively defines '''Yamato-damashii'''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Literally, "Japanese spirit"; ''Yamato damashii'' is also written 大和魂. This term is often contrasted with "Chinese Learning" (''karasae''), that is, knowledge and scholarship imported into Japan from China. ''Yamato damashii'' refers to an inherent faculty of common-sense wisdom, resourcefulness, and prudent judgment that is characteristic of, and unique to, the Japanese people. It also refers to a practical, "real life" ability and intelligence that is in contrast with scholarship and knowledge acquired through formal education. It is a term used to express such ideas as the essential purity and resolute spirit of the Japanese people, the wish for the peace and security of the nation, and the possession of a strong spirit and emotion that will meet any challenge, even at the expense of one's own life. ''Yamato damashii'' is synonymous with ''Yamato gokoro'' (lit. "Japanese heart"). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
