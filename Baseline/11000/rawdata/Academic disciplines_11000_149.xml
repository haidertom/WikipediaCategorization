The '''abundance of the chemical elements''' is a measure of the [[Type–token distinction#Occurrences|occurrence]] of the [[chemical element]]s relative to all other elements in a given environment. Abundance is measured in one of three ways: by the [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass-fraction]] (the same as weight fraction); by the [[mole fraction|mole-fraction]] (fraction of atoms by numerical count, or sometimes fraction of molecules in gases); or by the [[volume fraction|volume-fraction]]. Volume-fraction is a common abundance measure in mixed gases such as planetary atmospheres, and is similar in value to molecular mole-fraction for gas mixtures at relatively low densities and pressures, and [[ideal gas]] mixtures. Most abundance values in this article are given as mass-fractions.

For example, the abundance of [[oxygen]] in pure [[water]] can be measured in two ways: the ''mass fraction'' is about 89%, because that is the fraction of water's mass which is oxygen. However, the ''mole-fraction'' is 33.3333...%  because only 1 [[atom]] of 3 in water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, is oxygen. As another example, looking at the ''mass-fraction'' abundance of hydrogen and helium in both the [[Universe]] as a whole and in the [[atmosphere]]s of [[Gas giant|gas-giant planet]]s such as [[Jupiter]], it is 74% for [[hydrogen]] and 23–25% for [[helium]]; while the ''(atomic) mole-fraction'' for hydrogen is 92%, and for helium is 8%, in these environments. Changing the given environment to  [[Atmosphere of Jupiter|Jupiter's outer atmosphere]], where hydrogen is [[diatomic]] while helium is not, changes the ''molecular'' mole-fraction (fraction of total gas molecules), as well as the fraction of atmosphere by volume, of hydrogen to about 86%, and of helium to 13%.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Below Jupiter's outer atmosphere, volume fractions are significantly different from mole fractions due to high temperatures (ionization and disproportionation) and high density where the [[Ideal Gas Law]] is inapplicable.&lt;/ref&gt;

The abundance of chemical elements in the universe is dominated by the large amounts of  hydrogen and helium which were produced in the [[Big Bang]]. Remaining elements, making up only about 2% of the universe, were largely produced by [[supernova]]e and certain [[red giant|red giant stars]]. [[Lithium]], [[beryllium]] and [[boron]] are rare because although they are produced by nuclear fusion, they are then destroyed by other reactions in the stars.&lt;ref name="LiBeB Story"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vangioni-Flam|first1=Elisabeth|last2=Cassé|first2=Michel|editor1-last=Spite|editor1-first=Monique|title=Galaxy Evolution: Connecting the Distant Universe with the Local Fossil Record|date=2012|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|pages=77–86|isbn=9401142130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trimble"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trimble|first1=Virginia|editor1-last=Malkan|editor1-first=Matthew A.|editor2-last=Zuckerman|editor2-first=Ben|title=The origin and evolution of the universe|date=1996|publisher=[[Jones and Bartlett Publishers]]|location=Sudbury, Mass.|isbn=0-7637-0030-4|page=101|url=|chapter=The Origin and Evolution of the Chemical Elements}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elements from carbon to iron are relatively more common in the universe because of the ease of making them in [[supernova nucleosynthesis]]. Elements of higher atomic number than iron (element 26) become progressively more rare in the universe, because they increasingly absorb stellar energy in being produced. Elements with even atomic numbers are generally more common than their neighbors in the [[periodic table]], also due to favorable energetics of formation.

The abundance of elements in the Sun and outer planets is similar to that in the universe. Due to solar heating, the elements of Earth and the inner rocky planets of the Solar System have undergone an additional depletion of volatile hydrogen, helium, neon, nitrogen, and carbon (which volatilizes as methane). The crust, mantle, and core of the Earth show evidence of chemical segregation plus some sequestration by density. Lighter silicates of aluminum are found in the crust, with more magnesium silicate in the mantle, while metallic iron and nickel compose the core. The abundance of elements in specialized environments, such as atmospheres, or oceans, or the human body, are primarily a product of chemical interactions with the medium in which they reside.

The elements – that is, ordinary ([[baryon]]ic) matter made of [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[electron]]s, are only a small part of the content of the [[Universe]]. [[Observational cosmology|Cosmological observations]] suggest that only 4.6% of the universe's energy (including the mass contributed by energy, E = mc² ↔ m = E / c²) comprises the visible [[baryon]]ic [[matter]] that constitutes [[star]]s, [[planets]], and [[Life|living]] beings. The rest is thought to be made up of [[dark energy]] (68%) and [[dark matter]] (27%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/20929-dark-energy.html What is Dark Energy?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115022038/http://www.space.com/20929-dark-energy.html |date=2016-01-15 }}, Space.com, 1 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These are forms of matter and energy believed to exist on the basis of [[scientific theory]] and observational [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]s, but they have not been directly observed and their nature is not well understood.

Most standard (baryonic) matter is found in intergalactic gas, stars, and [[interstellar cloud]]s, in the form of atoms or [[ion]]s ([[plasma (physics)|plasma]]), although it can be found in degenerate forms in extreme astrophysical settings, such as the high densities inside [[white dwarf]]s and [[neutron star]]s.

[[Hydrogen]] is the most abundant element in the Universe; [[helium]] is second.  However, after this, the rank of abundance does not continue to correspond to the [[atomic number]]; [[oxygen]] has abundance rank 3, but atomic number 8. All others are substantially less common.

The abundance of the lightest elements is well predicted by the [[Lambda-CDM model|standard cosmological model]], since they were mostly produced shortly (i.e., within a few hundred seconds) after the [[Big Bang]], in a process known as [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]. Heavier elements were mostly produced much later, inside of [[star]]s.

Hydrogen and helium are estimated to make up roughly 74% and 24% of all baryonic matter in the universe respectively. Despite comprising only a very small fraction of the universe, the remaining "heavy elements" can greatly influence astronomical phenomena. Only about 2% (by mass) of the [[Milky Way galaxy]]'s disk is composed of heavy elements.

These other elements are generated by stellar processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.28.53|title=Abundances of the Elements|date=1956|last1=Suess|first1=Hans|last2=Urey|first2=Harold|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=28|page=53|bibcode=1956RvMP...28...53S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF00172440|title=Abundances of the elements in the solar system|date=1973|last1=Cameron|first1=A.G.W.|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=15|pages=121|bibcode=1973SSRv...15..121C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0016-7037(82)90208-3|title=Solar-system abundances of the elements|date=1982|last1=Anders|first1=E|last2=Ebihara|first2=M|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=46|page=2363|bibcode = 1982GeCoA..46.2363A|issue=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[astronomy]], a "metal" is any element other than hydrogen or helium. This distinction is significant because hydrogen and helium are the only elements that were produced in significant quantities in the Big Bang.  Thus, the [[metallicity]] of a [[galaxy]] or other object is an indication of stellar activity, after the Big Bang.

In general, elements up to iron are made in large stars in the process of becoming [[supernova]]e. [[Iron-56]] is particularly common, since it is the most stable element that can easily be made from alpha particles (being a product of decay of radioactive [[nickel-56]], ultimately made from 14 helium nuclei). Elements heavier than iron are made in energy-absorbing processes in large stars, and their abundance in the universe (and on Earth) generally decreases with increasing atomic number.

The following graph (note log scale) shows abundance of elements in the [[Solar System]]. The table shows the twelve most common elements in our galaxy (estimated spectroscopically), as measured in parts per million, by mass.&lt;ref name="croswell"/&gt;
Nearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The more distant galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past, so their abundances of elements appear closer to the primordial mixture. Since physical laws and processes are uniform throughout the universe, however, it is expected that these galaxies will likewise have evolved similar abundances of elements.

The abundance of elements is in keeping with their origin from the [[Big Bang]] and [[nucleosynthesis]] in a number of progenitor [[supernova]] stars. Very abundant hydrogen and helium are products of the Big Bang, while the next three elements are rare since they had little time to form in the Big Bang and are not made in stars (they are, however, produced in small quantities by breakup of heavier elements in interstellar dust, as a result of impact by [[cosmic ray]]s).

Beginning with carbon, elements have been produced in stars by buildup from [[alpha particle]]s (helium nuclei), resulting in an alternatingly larger abundance of elements with even atomic numbers (these are also more stable). The effect of odd-numbered chemical elements generally being more rare in the universe was empirically noticed in 1914, and is known as the [[Oddo-Harkins rule]].

===Relation to nuclear binding energy===
Loose correlations have been observed between estimated elemental abundances in the universe and the [[Nuclear binding energy#Nuclear binding energy curve|nuclear binding energy curve]].  Roughly speaking, the relative stability of various atomic nuclides has exerted a strong influence on the relative abundance of elements formed in the [[Big Bang]], and during the development of the universe thereafter.&lt;ref name=Bell01&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Jerry A.|title=Chemistry: a project of the American Chemical Society|date=2005|publisher=Freeman|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-7167-3126-9|pages=191–193|author2=GenChem Editorial/Writing Team|chapter=Chapter 3: Origin of Atoms|quote=Correlations between abundance and nuclear binding energy [Subsection title]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
See the article about [[nucleosynthesis]] for the explanation on how certain [[nuclear fusion]] processes in stars (such as [[carbon-burning process|carbon burning]], etc.) create the elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.

A further observed peculiarity is the jagged alternation between relative abundance and scarcity of adjacent atomic numbers in the elemental abundance curve, and a similar pattern of energy levels in the nuclear binding energy curve. This alternation is caused by the higher relative [[binding energy]] (corresponding to relative stability) of even atomic numbers compared with odd atomic numbers and is explained by the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]].&lt;ref name=Bell02&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Jerry A.|title=Chemistry: a project of the American Chemical Society|date=2005|publisher=Freeman|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-7167-3126-9|page=192|author2=GenChem Editorial/Writing Team|chapter=Chapter 3: Origin of Atoms|quote=The higher abundance of elements with even atomic numbers [Subsection title]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[semi-empirical mass formula]] (SEMF), also called ''Weizsäcker's formula'' or the ''Bethe-Weizsäcker mass formula'', gives a theoretical explanation of the overall shape of the curve of nuclear binding energy.&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=David|title=Semi-empirical Nuclear Mass Formula|url=http://www.upscale.utoronto.ca/GeneralInterest/DBailey/SubAtomic/Lectures/LectF25/Lect25.htm|work=PHY357: Strings &amp; Binding Energy|publisher=[[University of Toronto]]|accessdate=2011-03-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724042945/http://www.upscale.utoronto.ca/GeneralInterest/DBailey/SubAtomic/Lectures/LectF25/Lect25.htm|archivedate=2011-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earth ==
{{see also|Earth#Chemical composition}}

The [[Earth]] formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets acquired different compositions during the [[formation and evolution of the solar system]]. In turn, the [[history of Earth|natural history of the Earth]] caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements.

The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98{{e|24}}&amp;nbsp;kg. In bulk, by mass, it is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements.&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973&gt;{{cite journal | author=Morgan, J. W. | author2=Anders, E. | title=Chemical composition of Earth, Venus, and Mercury | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | date=1980 | volume=77 | issue=12 | pages=6973–6977 | doi=10.1073/pnas.77.12.6973 | pmid=16592930 | pmc=350422 |bibcode = 1980PNAS...77.6973M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk composition of the Earth by elemental-mass is roughly similar to the gross composition of the solar system, with the major differences being that Earth is missing a great deal of the volatile elements hydrogen, helium, neon, and nitrogen, as well as carbon which has been lost as volatile hydrocarbons. The remaining elemental composition is roughly typical of the "rocky" inner planets, which formed in the thermal zone where solar heat drove volatile compounds into space. The Earth retains oxygen as the second-largest component of its mass (and largest atomic-fraction), mainly from this element being retained in [[silicate minerals]] which have a very high melting point and low vapor pressure.

{{main|Abundance of elements in Earth's crust}}

[[File:Elemental abundances.svg|thumb|400px|right|
Abundance (atom fraction) of the chemical elements in Earth's upper continental crust as a function of atomic number. The rarest elements in the crust (shown in yellow) are rare due to a combination of factors: all but 1 of them are the densest siderophiles (iron-loving) elements in the [[Goldschmidt classification]] of elements, meaning they have a tendency to mix well with iron, depleting them by being relocated deeper into the Earth's core. Their abundance in [[meteoroid]]s is higher. Additionally, tellurium has been depleted from the crust due to formation of volatile hydrides.]]

The mass-abundance of the nine most abundant elements in the Earth's crust is approximately: oxygen 46%, silicon 28%, aluminum 8.2%, iron 5.6%, calcium 4.2%, sodium 2.5%, magnesium 2.4%, potassium 2.0%, and titanium 0.61%. Other elements occur at less than 0.15%. For a complete list, see [[abundance of elements in Earth's crust]].

The graph at right illustrates the relative atomic-abundance of the chemical elements in Earth's upper continental crust— the part that is relatively accessible for measurements and estimation.

Many of the elements shown in the graph are classified into (partially overlapping) categories:

#  rock-forming elements (major elements in green field, and minor elements in light green field);
#  [[rare earth element]]s (lanthanides, La-Lu, and Y; labeled in blue);
#  major industrial metals (global production &gt;~3×10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; kg/year; labeled in red);
#  [[precious metal]]s (labeled in purple);
#  the nine rarest "metals" — the six [[platinum group]] elements plus [[Gold|Au]], [[Rhenium|Re]], and [[Tellurium|Te]] (a metalloid) — in the yellow field. These are rare in the crust from being soluble in iron and thus concentrated in the Earth's core.

Note that there are two breaks where the unstable (radioactive) elements [[technetium]] (atomic number 43) and [[promethium]] (atomic number 61) would be. These elements are surrounded by stable elements, yet both have relatively short half lives (~ 4 million years and ~ 18 years respectively). These are thus extremely rare, since any primordial initial fractions of these in pre-Solar System materials have long since decayed. These two elements are now only produced naturally through the [[nuclear fission|spontaneous fission]] of very heavy [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] elements (for example, [[uranium]], [[thorium]], or the trace amounts of [[plutonium]] that exist in uranium ores), or by the interaction of certain other elements with [[cosmic ray]]s. Both technetium and promethium have been identified spectroscopically in the atmospheres of stars, where they are produced by ongoing nucleosynthetic processes.

There are also breaks in the abundance graph where the six [[noble gas]]es would be, since they are not chemically bound in the Earth's crust, and they are only generated by decay chains from radioactive elements in the crust, and are therefore extremely rare there.

The eight naturally occurring very rare, highly radioactive elements ([[polonium]], [[astatine]], [[francium]], [[radium]], [[actinium]], [[protactinium]], [[neptunium]], and [[plutonium]]) are not included, since any of these elements that were present at the formation of the Earth have decayed away eons ago, and their quantity today is negligible and is only produced from the [[radioactive decay]] of uranium and thorium.

[[Oxygen]] and [[silicon]] are notably the most common elements in the crust. On Earth and in rocky planets in general, silicon and oxygen are far more common than their cosmic abundance. The reason is that they combine with each other to form [[silicate mineral]]s. In this way, they are the lightest of all of the two-percent "astronomical metals" (i.e., non-hydrogen and helium elements) to form a solid that is refractory to the Sun's heat, and thus cannot boil away into space. All elements lighter than oxygen have been removed from the crust in this way.

==== Rare-earth elements ====
"Rare" earth elements is a historical misnomer. The persistence of the term reflects unfamiliarity rather than true rarity. The more abundant [[rare earth element]]s are similarly concentrated in the crust compared to commonplace industrial metals such as chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, or lead. The two least abundant rare earth elements ([[thulium]] and [[lutetium]]) are nearly 200 times more common than gold. However, in contrast to the ordinary base and precious metals, rare earth elements have very little tendency to become concentrated in exploitable ore deposits. Consequently, most of the world's supply of rare earth elements comes from only a handful of sources. Furthermore, the rare earth metals are all quite chemically similar to each other, and they are thus quite difficult to separate into quantities of the pure elements.

Differences in abundances of individual rare earth elements in the upper continental crust of the Earth represent the superposition of two effects, one nuclear and one geochemical. First, the rare earth elements with even atomic numbers (&lt;sub&gt;58&lt;/sub&gt;Ce, &lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;Nd, ...) have greater cosmic and terrestrial abundances than the adjacent rare earth elements with odd atomic numbers (&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;La, &lt;sub&gt;59&lt;/sub&gt;Pr, ...). Second, the lighter rare earth elements are more incompatible (because they have larger ionic radii) and therefore more strongly concentrated in the continental crust than the heavier rare earth elements. In most rare earth ore deposits, the first four rare earth elements – [[lanthanum]], [[cerium]], [[praseodymium]], and [[neodymium]] – constitute 80% to 99% of the total amount of rare earth metal that can be found in the ore.

=== Mantle ===
{{main|Mantle (geology)}}

The mass-abundance of the eight most abundant elements in the Earth's mantle (see main article above) is approximately: oxygen 45%, magnesium 23%, silicon 22%, iron 5.8%, calcium 2.3%, aluminum 2.2%, sodium 0.3%, potassium 0.3%.

The mantle differs in elemental composition from the crust in having a great deal more magnesium and significantly more iron, while having much less aluminum and sodium.

=== Core ===

Due to [[Planetary differentiation#Gravitational separation|mass segregation]], the core of the Earth is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;

=== Ocean ===
{{for|a complete list|Abundances of the elements (data page)#Sea water}}
The most abundant elements in the ocean by proportion of mass in percent are oxygen (85.84), hydrogen (10.82), chlorine (1.94), sodium (1.08), magnesium (0.1292), sulfur (0.091), calcium (0.04), potassium (0.04), bromine (0.0067), carbon (0.0028), and boron  (0.00043).

=== Atmosphere ===
The order of elements by volume-fraction (which is approximately molecular mole-fraction) in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is [[nitrogen]] (78.1%), [[oxygen]] (20.9%),&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=Earth’s Oxygen: A Mystery Easy to Take for Granted |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/science/earths-oxygen-a-mystery-easy-to-take-for-granted.html |date=3 October 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003185748/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/science/earths-oxygen-a-mystery-easy-to-take-for-granted.html |archivedate=3 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[argon]] (0.96%), followed by (in uncertain order) carbon and hydrogen because water vapor and carbon dioxide, which represent most of these two elements in the air, are variable components.   Sulfur, phosphorus, and all other elements are present in significantly lower proportions.

According to the abundance curve graph (above right), argon, a significant if not major component of the atmosphere, does not appear in the crust at all. This is because the atmosphere has a far smaller mass than the crust, so argon remaining in the crust contributes little to mass-fraction there, while at the same time buildup of argon in the atmosphere has become large enough to be significant. &lt;!--it's not that argon can't stay in the crust due to being inert. Helium stays in the crust well enough! And there is argon trapped in rocks or K-Ar dating would not work. Instead, the reason is the one given.--&gt;

By mass, human cells consist of 65–90% water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and a significant portion of the remainder is composed of carbon-containing organic molecules. Oxygen therefore contributes a majority of a human body's mass, followed by carbon. Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: [[hydrogen]] (H),  [[carbon]] (C), [[nitrogen]] (N), [[oxygen]] (O),  [[calcium]] (Ca), and [[phosphorus]] (P). The next 0.75% is made up of the next five elements: [[potassium]] (K), [[sulfur]] (S), [[chlorine]] (Cl), [[sodium]] (Na), and [[magnesium]] (Mg).  [[CHNOPS]] for short. Only 17 elements are known for certain to be necessary to human life, with one additional element (fluorine) thought to be helpful for tooth enamel strength. A few more [[trace element]]s may play some role in the health of mammals. [[Boron]] and [[silicon]] are notably necessary for plants but have uncertain roles in animals. The elements aluminium and silicon, although very common in the earth's crust, are conspicuously rare in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;Table data from {{cite book

'''''Aramis, or the Love of Technology''''', was written by French [[sociologist]]/[[anthropologist]] [[Bruno Latour]]. ''Aramis'' was originally published in French in 1993; the English translation by Catherine Porter, copyrighted in 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-674-04323-7}}, is now in its fourth edition (2002). Latour describes his text as "scientifiction," which he describes as "a hybrid genre... for a hybrid task" (p. ix). The genre includes voices of a young engineer discussing his "sociotechnological initiation," his professor's commentary which introduces [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT), field documents - including real-life interviews, and the voice of Aramis—a failed technology (&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno. (1996). Aramis, or the Love of Technology. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; p. x).

The book is a quasi-mystery, which attempts to discover who killed [[Aramis (personal rapid transit)]]. Aramis was supposed to be implemented as a [[Personal Rapid Transit]] (PRT) system in Paris. Simultaneously, while investigating Aramis's demise, Latour delineates the tenets of Actor-network theory. Latour argues that the technology failed not because any particular actor killed it, but because the actors failed to sustain it through negotiation and adaptation to a changing social situation.

Among American [[Adolescence|adolescents]], '''baseball metaphors for sex''' are often used as [[euphemism]]s for the degree of [[physical intimacy]] achieved in [[Human sexual activity|sexual encounters]] or relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Offside: Soccer and American Exceptionalism|first1=Steven L.|last1=Hellermann|first2= Andrei S.|last2=Markovits|year=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=069107447X|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the metaphor, first prevalent in the [[aftermath of World War II]], sexual activities are described as if they are actions in a game of [[baseball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communicating Gender|first=Suzanne|last=Romaine|year=1999| publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|isbn=0-8058-2926-1|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dark Ages, Life in the United States, 1945–1960|first=Marty|last=Jezer| year=1982|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0-89608-127-3|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details and popularity==
Among the most commonly used metaphors are the ''bases'' describing levels of physical intimacy (generally from a heterosexual perspective). Definitions vary, but the following are typical usages of the terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Third Base Ain't What it Used to Be: What Your Kids Are Learning About Sex Today—and How to Teach Them to Become Sexually Healthy Adults | author=Levkoff, Logan | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4qhuD3G0-8C | chapter=Sex Talk Among Teens | publisher=Open Road Media | year=2012 | isbn=9781453262924}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book | title=The Routledge Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English | author=Dalzell, Tom | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neVBmSyNRnEC | publisher=Routledge | year=2008 | isbn=9781134194780}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book | title=The Gender of Sexuality: Exploring Sexual Possibilities |author1=Rutter, Virginia  |author2=Schwartz, Pepper  |lastauthoramp=yes | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbpIbqiEy2sC | year=2012 | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | isbn=9780742570030}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''First base'' – mouth-to-mouth [[kissing]], especially [[French kiss]]ing;
*''Second base'' – skin-to-skin touching/kissing of the [[Human breast#Sexual characteristic|breasts]]; in some contexts, it may instead refer to touching any [[erogenous zones]] through the clothes (i.e., not actually touching the skin), or [[Mutual masturbation|manual stimulation of the genitals]];
*''Third base'' – touching below the waist (without [[sexual intercourse]]); in some contexts, it may instead refer to [[oral sex|oral stimulation of the genitals]];
*''Home run'' (''home base'' or ''scoring'')&amp;nbsp;– "full" sexual intercourse.

Additionally,
*''Strikeout'' – a failure to engage in any form of [[foreplay]] or other [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]];

Additionally, there are two metaphors used to refer to [[men who have sex with men]]:
* ''Pitching '' – the man performing [[anal sex]]
* ''Catching''  – the man receiving anal sex

Other similar metaphors include:
* ''Switch hitter''  – a bisexual individual, referencing a player who can bat from either side
* ''Playing for the other team''  – usually indicating a person is gay or lesbian
* ''Playing for both teams''  – usually indicating a person is bisexual

The metaphors are found variously in popular American culture, with one well-known example in the [[Meat Loaf]] song "[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]", which describes a young couple "[[making out]]", with a [[voice-over]] [[Sports commentary|commentary]], by baseball announcer [[Phil Rizzuto]], of a portion of a baseball game as a metaphor for the couple's activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=pearlman/070816|title=Phil and Meat Loaf will always have "Paradise"|first=Jeff|last= Pearlman|authorlink=Jeff Pearlman|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2007-08-29|accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example can be found in [[Billy Joel]]'s song "[[Zanzibar (Billy Joel song)|Zanzibar]]" in which he compares himself to [[Pete Rose]] and sings the lines "Me, I'm trying just to get to second base and I'd steal it if she only gave the sign.

==Sex education==

Educators have found the baseball metaphor an effective instructional tool when providing sex education to [[middle school]] students.&lt;ref name=Cooperstown&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cooperstown Symposium on Baseball and American Culture 1998|first1=Alvin L.|last1=Hall|first2=Thomas L.|last2=Altherr|chapter=Eros at the Bat: American Baseball and Sexuality in Historical Context|pages=157–182|year= 2002|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=0-7864-0954-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leman and Bell, in their book ''A Chicken's Guide to Talking Turkey With Your Kids About Sex'', make use of it to aid parents in the discussion of [[puberty]] with their children, dividing the topics into "first base" ("Changes from the neck up"), "second base" ("Changes from the neck to the waist"), "third base" ("Changes from the waist down"), and "home plate" ("The Big 'It'").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Chicken's Guide to Talking Turkey With Your Kids About Sex|first1=Kevin|last1=Leman|first2=Kathy Flores|last2=Bell|year=2004|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=031025096X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative views==

This sequence of "running the bases" is often regarded as a script, or pattern, for young people who are experimenting with sexual relationships. The script may have slightly changed since the 1960s. Kohl and Francoeur state that with the growing emphasis in the 1990s on [[safe sex]] to expand sex beyond heterosexual penetrative intercourse, the "home run" has taken on the additional dimension of oral sex. Richters and [[Christopher Rissel|Rissel]] conversely state that "third base" is now sometimes considered to comprise oral sex as part of the accepted pattern of activities, as a precursor to "full" (i.e. penetrative) sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Doing it Down Under: The Sexual Lives of Australians|author=Juliet Richters and [[Chris Rissel]]|year=2005 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |isbn=1-74114-326-8|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scent of Eros: Mysteries of Odor in Human Sexuality|first1= James V.|last1=Kohl|first2=Robert T.|last2=Francoeur|year=2002|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=059523383X|pages=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''buffer zone''' is generally a [[wikt:zone|zonal]] area that lies between two or more other areas (often, but not necessarily, [[country|countries]]), but depending on the type of buffer zone, the reason for it may be to segregate regions or to conjoin them.
Common types of buffer zones are [[demilitarized zone]]s, [[border zone]]s and certain restrictive easement zones and [[Green Belt|green belts]]. Such zones may be, but not necessarily be, comprised by a sovereign state, forming a [[buffer state]].

Buffer zones have various purposes, political or otherwise. They can be set up to prevent violence, protect the environment, protect residential and commercial zones from industrial accidents or natural disasters, keep prisoners intent on escaping from rapidly acquiring hostages or a hiding place, and have uses in several other scenarios. Buffer zones often result in large uninhabited regions which are themselves noteworthy in many increasingly developed or crowded parts of the world.{{examples|date=October 2013}}

== Conservation ==

For use in nature conservation, a buffer zone is often created to enhance the protection of areas under management for their [[biodiversity]] importance. The buffer zone of a [[protected area]] may be situated around the periphery of the region or may be a connecting zone within it which links two or more protected areas, therefore increasing their dynamics and conservation productivity. A buffer zone can also be one of the [[IUCN Protected Area Management Categories|protected area categories]] (e.g. category V or VI of IUCN Protected Area) or a classification scheme (e.g. NATURA 2000) depending on the conservation objective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/areas/10/ A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: Buffer Zones]&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'buffer zone' initially gained prominence in the conservation of natural and cultural heritage through its usage in the establishment of [[UNESCO]]'s World Heritage Convention, and the term was intended to be used as follows:

{{cquote|A buffer zone serves to provide an additional layer of protection to a [[World Heritage site|World Heritage property]]. The concept of a buffer zone was first included in the ''Operational Guidelines for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention'' in 1977. In the most current version of the ''Operational Guidelines'' of 2005 the inclusion of a buffer zone into a nomination of a site to the World Heritage List is strongly recommended but not mandatory.|cquote}}

The buffer zone is one of the [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best Management Practices]] (BMPs). A buffer zone is intended to avert the effect of negative environmental or human influences, whether or not it embodies great natural or cultural value itself.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Oliver, and Piatti, Giovanna (ed.) ''World Heritage and
Buffer Zones'', International Expert Meeting on World Heritage and Buffer Zones Davos, Switzerland 11 – 14 March 2008 (Paris: UNESCO, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The importance and function of a buffer zone and the necessary protective measures derived thereof is a relatively new concept in conservation science and can differ greatly for each site.&lt;ref&gt;Ebregt, Arthur and de Greve, Pol, ''Buffer Zones and their Management: Policy and Best Practices for Terrestrial Ecosystems in Developing Countries'' (Wageningen: Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological functions (conservation) ==

=== Improve water quality ===
It shows that the quality of surface water in many countries is getting worse because humans do not use land properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=S. R.|last2=Caraco|first2=N. F.|last3=Correll|first3=D. L.|last4=Howarth|first4=R. W.|last5=Sharpley|first5=A. N.|last6=Smith|first6=V. H.|date=1998-08|title=Nonpoint Pollution of Surface Waters with Phosphorus and Nitrogen|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2641247|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=8|issue=3|pages=559|doi=10.2307/2641247|issn=1051-0761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the buffer zone occupies a small area, it greatly improves the quality of water in the agricultural [[wikt:drainage basin|watershed]] due to its filtering effect on nutrients in the underground water and surface water. 

Because farmland is sprayed with large amounts of pesticides, some of which can seep into surface water. It will have a negative impact on fish and other aquatic life, which can lead to environmental damage. Vegetation buffer has been proved to be an effective filter for sediment, especially for sediment-bound pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syversen|first=Nina|last2=Bechmann|first2=Marianne|date=2004-05|title=Vegetative buffer zones as pesticide filters for simulated surface runoff|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.05.002|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=22|issue=3|pages=175–184|doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.05.002|issn=0925-8574}}&lt;/ref&gt; When pesticides are sprayed in excess, a vegetation buffer can be built to reduce the penetration of pesticides into surface water. The buffer zone also prevents heavy metals or toxins from spreading to [[Protected area|protected areas]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deroanne-Bauvin|first=J|last2=Delcarte|first2=E|last3=Impens|first3=R|date=1987-01|title=Monitoring of lead deposition near highway: A ten years study|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(87)90447-5|journal=Science of The Total Environment|volume=59|pages=257–266|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(87)90447-5|issn=0048-9697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stabilize the riverbanks ===
When the riverbanks are low, due to the plant root can enter the interior of the riverbank vertically, the sediment of riverbank is affected by the action of plant root, and the ability to resist erosion is higher than that without plant root. But when the riverbanks are higher, the roots of the plants do not penetrate deeply into the soil, and the lakeshore soil is not very strong. Herbaceous plants can play a role to some extent, but in the long term, vegetation buffer zone can effectively solve the problem of water level rise and water erosion. 

The adsorption capacity of buffer zone can reduce the speed of surface runoff and increase the effective water content of soil. Through increasing soil organic matter content and improving soil structure, it has a positive effect on soil water storage performance. In addition, plant roots make the soil stronger, withstand waves and rainstorm, mitigate the erosion of riverbanks by [[Flood|floods]], and effectively control the erosion of the beach. 

=== Provide food and habitat to wildlife ===
The riparian buffer zones have been used in many areas to protect the habitats of many animals which are being devastated by increased human activity. The areas around the buffer zone can form the habitat of many animals, the woody parts and leaves of plants can become food for small [[Aquatic animal|aquatic animals]]. The buffer zone itself can also support the life activities of various [[Amphibian|amphibians]] and birds. Plants and animals can migrate or spread in response to these buffer zones and then increasing the biodiversity in the area. 

A study shows that the species and number of animals and plants in riparian zones are higher than in other ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturtevant|first=Brian R|date=1998-10|title=A model of wetland vegetation dynamics in simulated beaver impoundments|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0304-3800(98)00079-9|journal=Ecological Modelling|volume=112|issue=2-3|pages=195–225|doi=10.1016/s0304-3800(98)00079-9|issn=0304-3800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their ability to provide abundant water, soft soil and stable climate, small animals such as ''[[Mouse-eared bat|Myotis]]'' and ''[[Marten|Martes]]'' prefer to live along riverbanks rather than in hilly areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=A. T.|date=1990-02-20|title=Use of Riparian and Upland Habitats by Small Mammals|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1381312|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=71|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.2307/1381312|issn=1545-1542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buffer zone can also provide a good environment for upland habitat, which is in line with the living conditions of freshwater [[Turtle|turtles]], making them more dependent on the wetland environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Vincent J.|last2=Gibbons|first2=J. Whitfield|date=1995-12|title=Terrestrial Buffer Zones and Wetland Conservation: A Case Study of Freshwater Turtles in a Carolina Bay|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09061365.x|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1365–1369|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09061365.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protection level of the buffer zones will affect the habitat range of amphibians and [[Reptile|reptiles]], and the environmental management of the wetland habitat around buffer zone is extremely important. 

=== Provide [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value ===
As an important part of riparian zone, the vegetation buffer zones form a variety of [[landscape]], and the landscape pattern of combining land and water improves the aesthetic value of river basin landscape. The riparian buffer is rich in plant resources, and the wetland, grassland and forest ecosystem make the landscape more beautiful. In addition, some recreational facilities can be built in the buffer zone to provide better living conditions for residents or tourists and improve people's quality of life. 

In the buffer zone, those trees up to 6 meters tall greatly enhance the aesthetic value of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borin|first=Maurizio|last2=Passoni|first2=Matteo|last3=Thiene|first3=Mara|last4=Tempesta|first4=Tiziano|date=2010-01|title=Multiple functions of buffer strips in farming areas|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003|journal=European Journal of Agronomy|volume=32|issue=1|pages=103–111|doi=10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003|issn=1161-0301}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tall trees have luxuriant branches and leaves, especially their upright posture, making them of higher ornamental value. Some colorful landscape tree species can be planted on both sides of rivers with tourism and sightseeing value to improve the aesthetic value of the place. The establishment of vegetation buffer zone can increase green land, improve forest coverage, beautify environment and visual effect, improve people's living environment, enrich humanistic landscape and enhance aesthetic value. we need to call on people to pay attention to the importance of the buffer zone, encourage local residents to participate in the protection and management of the buffer zone, and set up checkpoints around the buffer zone to make it more secure and effective.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12543">'''COLD-PCR''' ('''co'''-amplification at '''l'''ower '''d'''enaturation temperature-'''PCR''') is a modified [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR) protocol that enriches variant [[alleles]] from a mixture of wildtype and [[mutation]]-containing [[DNA]].  The ability to preferentially amplify and identify minority alleles and low-level [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] DNA mutations in the presence of excess wildtype alleles is useful for the detection of mutations. Detection of mutations is important in the case of early [[cancer]] detection from [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[biopsies]] and body fluids such as [[blood plasma]] or [[Serum (blood)|serum]], assessment of residual [[disease]] after [[surgery]] or [[chemotherapy]], disease staging and molecular profiling for prognosis or tailoring therapy to individual patients, and monitoring of therapy outcome and cancer remission or relapse.  Common PCR will amplify both the major (wildtype) and minor (mutant) alleles with the same efficiency, occluding the ability to easily detect the presence of low-level mutations.  The capacity to detect a mutation in a mixture of variant/wildtype DNA is valuable because this mixture of variant DNAs can occur when provided with a heterogeneous sample – as is often the case with cancer biopsies.  Currently, traditional PCR is used in tandem with a number of different downstream assays for [[genotyping]] or the detection of [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] mutations.  These can include the use of amplified DNA for [[RFLP]] analysis, [[MALDI-TOF]] (matrix-assisted laser-desorption–time-of-flight) genotyping, or direct sequencing for detection of mutations by [[Sanger sequencing]] or [[pyrosequencing]].  Replacing traditional PCR with COLD-PCR for these downstream assays will increase the reliability in detecting mutations from mixed samples, including [[tumors]] and body fluids.

==COLD-PCR Method Overview==
[[File:COLD-PCR.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|alt=An overview of COLD-PCR compared to regular PCR.|Conventional PCR compared to COLD-PCR.]]
The underlying principle of COLD-PCR is that single [[nucleotide]] mismatches will slightly alter the melting temperature (Tm) of the double-stranded DNA.  Depending on the sequence context and position of the mismatch, Tm changes of 0.2-1.5&amp;nbsp;°C (0.36-2.7&amp;nbsp;°F). are common for sequences up to 200bp or higher. Knowing this the authors of the protocol took advantage of two observations:
*Each double-stranded DNA has a ‘critical temperature’ (Tc) lower than its Tm.  The PCR amplification efficiency drops measurably below the Tc.
*The Tc is dependent on DNA sequence.  Two template DNA fragments differing by only one or two nucleotide mismatches will have different amplification efficiencies if the denaturation step of PCR is set to the Tc.

Keeping these principles in mind the authors developed the following general protocol:
#Denaturation stage.  DNA is denatured at a high temperature{{spaced ndash}}usually {{Convert|94|C|F}}.
#Intermediate annealing stage.  Set an intermediate annealing temperature that allows hybridization of mutant and wildtype allele DNA to one another.  Because the mutant allele DNA forms the minority of DNA in the mixture they will be more likely to form mismatch heteroduplex DNA with the wildtype DNA.
#Melting stage.  These heteroduplexes will more readily melt at lower temperatures.  Hence they are selectively denatured at the Tc.
#Primer annealing stage.  The homo-duplex DNA will preferentially remain double stranded and not be available for primer annealing.
#Extension stage.  The DNA polymerase will extend complementary to the template DNA.  Since the heteroduplex DNA is used as template, a larger proportion of minor variant DNA will be amplified and be available for subsequent rounds of PCR.

There are two forms of COLD-PCR that have been developed to date.  Full COLD-PCR and Fast COLD-PCR.
[[File:Fast versus Full COLD-PCR.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|alt=An overview of Full COLD-PCR in comparison to Fast COLD-PCR.|Full COLD-PCR versus Fast COLD-PCR.]]

===Full COLD-PCR===
Full COLD-PCR is identical to the protocol outlined above.  These five stages are used for each round of amplification.

===Fast COLD-PCR===
Fast COLD-PCR differs from Full COLD-PCR in that the denaturation and intermediate annealing stages are skipped.  This is because, in some cases, the preferential amplification of the mutant DNA is so great that ensuring the formation of the mutant/wildtype heteroduplex DNA is not needed.  Thus the denaturation can occur at the Tc, proceed to primer annealing, and then polymerase-mediated extension.  Each round of amplification will include these three stages in that order.  By utilizing the lower denaturation temperature, the reaction will discriminate towards the products with the lower Tm – i.e. the variant alleles.  Fast COLD-PCR produces much faster results due to the shortened protocol.  However, it is important to note that Full COLD-PCR is essential for amplification of all possible mutations in the starting mixture of DNA.

Two-round COLD-PCR is a modified version of Fast COLD-PCR.  During the second round of Fast COLD-PCR nested primers are used.  This improves the sensitivity of mutation detection compared to one-round Fast COLD-PCR.&lt;ref name=nested&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Milbury CA, Li C, Makrigiorgos GM |title=Two-round COLD-PCR-based Sanger sequencing identifies a novel spectrum of low-level mutations in lung adenocarcinoma |journal=Human Mutation |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1583–90 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19760750 |pmc=2784016 |doi=10.1002/humu.21112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of COLD-PCR to Date==
COLD-PCR has been used to improve the reliability of a number of different assays that traditionally use conventional PCR.
[[File:COLD-PCR applications.jpg|thumb|alt=Some of the downstream applications for COLD-PCR.|Downstream applications using conventional PCR that can be replaced by COLD-PCR.]]

===RFLP and COLD-PCR===
A restriction fragment length polymorphism results in the cleavage (or absence thereof) of DNA for a specific mutation by a selected restriction enzyme that will not cleave the wildtype DNA.  In a study using a mixture of wildtype and mutation containing DNA amplified by regular PCR or COLD-PCR, COLD-PCR preceding RFLP analysis was shown to improve the mutation detection by 10-20 fold.&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Wang L, Mamon H, [[Matthew Kulke|Kulke MH]], Berbeco R, Makrigiorgos GM |title=Replacing PCR with COLD-PCR enriches variant DNA sequences and redefines the sensitivity of genetic testing |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=579–84 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18408729 |doi=10.1038/nm1708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanger Sequencing and COLD-PCR===
Sanger sequencing recently was used to evaluate the enrichment of mutant DNA from a mixture of 1:20 mutant:wildtype DNA.  The variant DNA containing a mutation was obtained from a [[breast cancer]] cell line known to contain [[p53]] mutations.&lt;ref name=nested /&gt;  Comparison of Sanger sequencing chromatograms indicated that the mutant allele was enriched 13 fold when COLD-PCR was used compared to traditional PCR alone.&lt;ref name=nested /&gt;  This was determined by the size of the peaks on the chromatogram at the variant allele location.

As well, COLD-PCR was used to detect p53 mutations from lung-[[adenocarcinoma]] samples.  The study was able to detect 8 low level (under 20% abundance) mutations that would likely have been missed using conventional methods that don’t enrich for variant sequence DNA .

===Pyrosequencing and COLD-PCR===
Similar to its use in direct Sanger sequencing, with pyrosequencing COLD-PCR was shown to be capable of detecting mutations that had a prevalence 0.5-1% from the samples used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zuo Z, Chen SS, Chandra PK |title=Application of COLD-PCR for improved detection of KRAS mutations in clinical samples |journal=Modern Pathology |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=1023–31 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19430420 |doi=10.1038/modpathol.2009.59|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; COLD-PCR was used to detect p53 and KRAS mutations by pyrosequencing, and was shown to outperform conventional PCR in both cases.

===MALDI-TOF and COLD-PCR===
The same research group that developed COLD-PCR and used it to compare the sensitivity of regular PCR for genotyping with direct Sanger sequencing, RFLP, and pyrosequencing, also ran a similar study using MALDI-TOF as a downstream application for detecting mutations.  Their results indicated that COLD-PCR could enrich mutation sequences from a mixture of DNA by 10-100 fold and that mutations with an initial prevalence of 0.1-0.5% would be detectable.&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Makrigiorgos GM |title=COLD-PCR: a new platform for highly improved mutation detection in cancer and genetic testing |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=427–32 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19290875 |doi=10.1042/BST0370427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the 5-10% low-level detection rate expected with traditional PCR.

===QPCR and COLD-PCR===
COLD-PCR run on a [[quantitative PCR]] machine, using [[TaqMan]] probes specific for a mutation, was shown to increase the measured difference between mutant and wildtype samples.&lt;ref name=review /&gt;

==Advantages of COLD-PCR==
*Single-step method capable of enriching both known and unknown minority alleles irrespective of mutation type and position.
*Does not require any extra reagents or specialized machinery.  Therefore, the cost is not increased.
*Better than conventional PCR for the detection of mutations in a mixed sample.
*Does not significantly increase experiment run time compared to conventional PCR.

==Disadvantages of COLD-PCR==
*Optimal Tc must be measured and determined for each amplicon.  Adding an extra step to conventional PCR-based procedures.
*Requirement for precise denaturation temperature control during PCR to within ± 0.3&amp;nbsp;°C (0.54&amp;nbsp;°F).
*A suitable critical temperature may not be available that differentiates between mutant and wildtype DNA sequences.
*Restricted to analyzing sequences smaller than approximately 200bp.
*Vulnerable to polymerase-introduced errors.
*Variable overall mutation enrichment which depends on DNA position and nucleotide substitution.
*No guarantee that all low-level mutations will be preferentially enriched.

==History==
COLD-PCR was originally described by Li ''et al.'' in a Nature Medicine paper published in 2008 from Dr. Mike Makrigiorgos’s lab group at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute of Harvard Medical School.&lt;ref name=original /&gt;  As summarized above, the technology has been used in a number of proof-of-principle experiments and medical research diagnostic experiments.

Recently, the COLD-PCR technology has been licensed by Transgenomic, Inc.  The licensing terms include the exclusive rights to commercialize the technology combined with Sanger sequencing.  The plans are to develop commercial applications that will allow for rapid high-sensitivity detection of low-level somatic and mitochondrial DNA mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laboratorytalk editorial team|date=Oct 2009|title=Transgenomics licenses COLD-PCR technology|url=http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/trb/trb121.html|access-date=2010-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718232900/http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/trb/trb121.html#|archive-date=2011-07-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
Other technologies are available for the detection of minority DNA mutations, and these methods can be segregated into their ability to enrich for and detect either known or unknown mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milbury CA, Li J, Makrigiorgos GM |title=PCR-Based Methods for the Enrichment of Minority Alleles and Mutations |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=632–40 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19201784 |pmc=2811432 |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.113035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2287">'''Chromosome jumping''' is a tool of molecular biology that is used in the physical [[genome project|mapping]] of [[genome]]s.  It is related to several other tools used for the same purpose, including [[chromosome walking]]. 

Chromosome jumping is used to bypass regions difficult to [[cloning|clone]], such as those containing [[repetitive DNA]], that cannot be easily mapped by chromosome walking, and is useful in moving along a chromosome rapidly in search of a particular [[gene]].

Chromosome jumping allows more rapid movement through the [[genome]] compared to other techniques, such as [[chromosome walking]], and can be used to generate genomic markers with known chromosomal locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Drumm|first=Micheal|date=May 2001|title=Unit 5.4 Construction of Chromosome Jumping and Linking Libraries in E.coli|journal=Current Protocols in Human Genetics|volume=Chapter 5|pages=Unit 5.4|doi=10.1002/0471142905.hg0504s01|pmid=18428292|isbn=978-0471142904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromosome jumping enables two ends of a DNA sequence to be cloned without the middle section. Genomic DNA may be partially digested using restriction endonucleases and with the aid of DNA ligase, the fragments are circularized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Genetics, Genomics, Proteomics and Informatics|last=|first=|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-1-4020-6753-2|location=|pages=354|date=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From a known [[DNA sequence|sequence]], a [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]] is designed to [[DNA sequencing|sequence]] across the circularised junction. This primer is used to jump 100 [[base pair|kb]]-300 kb intervals: a sequence 100 kb away would have come near the known sequence on circularisation. Thus, sequences not reachable by chromosome walking can be sequenced. Chromosome walking can be used from the new jump position (in either direction) to look for [[gene]]-like sequences, or additional jumps can be used to progress further along the chromosome.

'''Computational Transportation  Science''' (CTS) is an emerging discipline that combines [[computer science]] and engineering with the modeling, planning, and economic aspects of [[transport]]. The discipline studies how to improve the safety, mobility, and sustainability of the transport system by taking advantage of [[information technologies]] and [[ubiquitous computing]]. A list of subjects encompassed by CTS can be found at include.&lt;ref name="dagstuhl10"/&gt;

Computational Transportation Science is an emerging discipline going beyond vehicular technology, addressing pedestrian systems on hand-held devices but also issues such as transport [[data mining]] (or movement analysis), as well as data management aspects. CTS allows for an increasing flexibility of the system as local and autonomous negotiations between transport peers, partners and supporting infrastructure are allowed. Thus, CTS provides means to study localized computing, self-organization, cooperation and simulation of transport systems.

Several academic conferences on CTS have been held up to date:
* The Fourth ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science&lt;ref name="iwcts11"/&gt;
* The Third ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science&lt;ref name="iwcts10"/&gt;
* Dagstuhl Seminar 10121 on Computational Transportation Science&lt;ref name="dagstuhl10"/&gt;
* The Second International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science&lt;ref name="iwcts09"/&gt;
* The First International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science&lt;ref name="iwcts08"/&gt;

There is also an IGERT PHD program on Computational Transportation Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago.&lt;ref name="igertPHD"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10014">A '''computer-assisted proof''' is a [[mathematical proof]] that has been at least partially generated by [[computer]].

Most computer-aided proofs to date have been implementations of large [[Proof by exhaustion|proofs-by-exhaustion]] of a mathematical [[theorem]]. The idea is to use a computer program to perform lengthy computations, and to provide a proof that the result of these computations implies the given theorem.  In 1976, the [[four color theorem]] was the first major theorem to be verified using a [[computer program]].

Attempts have also been made in the area of [[artificial intelligence]] research to create smaller, explicit, new proofs of mathematical theorems from the bottom up using [[machine reasoning]] techniques such as [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] search. Such [[automated theorem prover]]s have proved a number of new results and found new proofs for known theorems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}  Additionally, interactive [[proof assistant]]s allow mathematicians to develop human-readable proofs which are nonetheless formally verified for correctness.  Since these proofs are generally [[Non-surveyable proof|human-surveyable]] (albeit with difficulty, as with the proof of the [[Robbins conjecture]]) they do not share the controversial implications of computer-aided proofs-by-exhaustion.

== Methods ==
One method for using computers in mathematical proofs is by means of so-called [[validated numerics]] or [[rigorous numerics]]. This means computing numerically yet with mathematical rigour. One uses set-valued arithmetic and inclusion principle in order to ensure that the set-valued output of a numerical program encloses the solution of the original mathematical problem. This is done by controlling, enclosing and propagating round-off and truncation errors using for example [[interval arithmetic]]. More precisely, one reduces the computation to a sequence of elementary operations, say &lt;math&gt;(+,-,*,/)&lt;/math&gt;. In a computer, the result of each elementary operation is rounded off by the computer precision. However, one can construct an interval provided by upper and lower bounds on the result of an elementary operation. Then one proceeds by replacing numbers with intervals and  performing  elementary operations between such intervals of representable numbers.

==Philosophical objections==
{{main|Non-surveyable proof}}
Computer-assisted proofs are the subject of some controversy in the mathematical world, with [[Thomas Tymoczko]] first to articulate objections. Those who adhere to Tymoczko's arguments believe that lengthy computer-assisted proofs are not, in some sense, 'real' [[mathematical proof]]s because they involve so many logical steps that they are not practically [[Verification and validation|verifiable]] by human beings, and that mathematicians are effectively being asked to replace logical deduction from assumed axioms with trust in an empirical computational process, which is potentially affected by errors in the computer program, as well as defects in the runtime environment and hardware.&lt;ref name="tymoczko"&gt;{{Citation|last = Tymoczko|first = Thomas|author-link = Thomas Tymoczko|title = The Four-Color Problem and its Mathematical Significance|year = 1979|journal = [[The Journal of Philosophy]]|volume = 76|issue = 2|pages = 57–83|doi=10.2307/2025976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mathematicians believe that lengthy computer-assisted proofs should be regarded as ''calculations'', rather than ''proofs'': the proof algorithm itself should be proved valid, so that its use can then be regarded as a mere "verification".  Arguments that computer-assisted proofs are subject to errors in their source programs, compilers, and hardware can be resolved by providing a formal proof of correctness for the computer program (an approach which was successfully applied to the four-color theorem in 2005) as well as replicating the result using different programming languages, different compilers, and different computer hardware.

Another possible way of verifying computer-aided proofs is to generate their reasoning steps in a machine-readable form, and then use an [[automated theorem prover]] to demonstrate their correctness. This approach of using a computer program to prove another program correct does not appeal to computer proof skeptics, who see it as adding another layer of complexity without addressing the perceived need for human understanding.

Another argument against computer-aided proofs is that they lack [[mathematical elegance]]—that they provide no insights or new and useful concepts.  In fact, this is an argument that could be advanced against any lengthy proof by exhaustion.

An additional philosophical issue raised by computer-aided proofs is whether they make mathematics into a [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empirical science]], where the [[scientific method]] becomes more important than the application of pure reason in the area of abstract mathematical concepts. This directly relates to the argument within mathematics as to whether mathematics is based on ideas, or "merely" an [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] in formal symbol manipulation. It also raises the question whether, if according to the [[mathematical Platonism|Platonist]] view, all possible mathematical objects in some sense "already exist", whether computer-aided mathematics is an [[observational study|observational]] science like astronomy, rather than an experimental one like physics or chemistry. This controversy within mathematics is occurring at the same time as questions are being asked in the physics community about whether twenty-first century [[theoretical physics]] is becoming too mathematical, and leaving behind its experimental roots.

The emerging field of [[experimental mathematics]] is confronting this debate head-on by focusing on numerical experiments as its main tool for mathematical exploration.

==Theorems for sale==
In 2010, academics at The [[University of Edinburgh]] offered people the chance to "buy their own theorem" created through a computer-assisted proof. This new theorem would be named after the purchaser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herald Gazette article on buying your own theorem|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/your-own-maths-theorem-for-15-1.1068654|work=Herald Gazette Scotland|date=November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121000707/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/your-own-maths-theorem-for-15-1.1068654|archivedate=2010-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School of Informatics, Univ.of Edinburgh website|url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/recentnews/theorem|work=School of Informatics, Univ.of Edinburgh|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Equal Rights Amendment''' ('''ERA''') is a [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Proposing amendments|proposed amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] designed to guarantee equal legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex; it seeks to end the legal distinctions between men and women in terms of [[divorce]], [[property]], [[Employment discrimination|employment]], and other matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SZK5BwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA425&amp;dq=wladaver-morgan%20susan%20equal%20rights%20amendment&amp;pg=PA200#v=onepage&amp;q=wladaver-morgan%20susan%20equal%20rights%20amendment&amp;f=false|title=American Economic History: A Dictionary and Chronology: A Dictionary and Chronology|last=Olson|first=James S.|last2=Mendoza|first2=Abraham O.|date=2015-04-28|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610696982|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ERA was originally written by [[Alice Paul]] and [[Crystal Eastman]]. The amendment was introduced in [[United States Congress|Congress]] for the first time in 1921 and has prompted conversations about the meaning of legal equality for women and men ever since.

In the early history of the Equal Rights Amendment, middle-class women were largely supportive, while those speaking for the working class were often opposed, pointing out that employed women needed special protections regarding working conditions and employment hours. With the rise of the [[Women's Movement in the United States (1963-1982)|women's movement in the United States]] during the 1960s, the ERA garnered increasing support, and, after being reintroduced by U.S. Representative [[Martha Griffiths]] (D-Michigan), in 1971, it was approved by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] on October 12 of that year and on March 22, 1972, it was approved by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], thus submitting the ERA to the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] for ratification, as provided for in [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V of the U.S. Constitution]].

Congress had originally set a ratification deadline of March 22, 1979, for the state legislatures to consider the ERA. Through 1977, the amendment received 35 of the necessary 38 state [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification of amendments|ratifications]]. With wide, bipartisan support (including that of both major political parties, both houses of Congress, and Presidents [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Eric C.|date=2015-06-19|title=Phyllis Schlafly's "Positive" Freedom: Liberty, Liberation, and the Equal Rights Amendment|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/584317|journal=Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs|volume=18|issue=2|pages=277–300|issn=1534-5238}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ERA seemed destined for ratification until [[Phyllis Schlafly]] mobilized [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] women in opposition, arguing that the ERA would disadvantage [[housewives]] and cause women to be drafted into the military.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/27/AR2007032702357_pf.html|title=New Drive Afoot to Pass Equal Rights Amendment|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five state legislatures (Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, Tennessee, and South Dakota) voted to revoke their ERA ratifications. Four claim to have rescinded their ratifications before the original March 22, 1979 ratification deadline, while the South Dakota legislature did so by voting to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] its ratification as of that original deadline. However, it remains a legal question as to whether a state can revoke its ratification of a federal constitutional amendment.

In 1978, Congress passed (by simple majorities in each house), and President Carter signed, a joint resolution with the intent of extending the ratification deadline to June 30, 1982. Because no additional state legislatures ratified the ERA between March 22, 1979 and June 30, 1982, the validity of that disputed extension was rendered academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-neuwirth-equal-rights-amendment-for-women-metoo-20180105-story.html|title=Unbelievably, women still don't have equal rights in the Constitution|date=January 5, 2018|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2017, the 45th anniversary of Congress' submission of the ERA to the nation's state lawmakers, the [[Nevada Legislature]] became the first to ratify the ERA after the expiration of both deadlines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/21/520962541/nevada-on-cusp-of-ratifying-equal-rights-amendment-35-years-after-deadline|title=Nevada Ratifies The Equal Rights Amendment ... 35 Years After The Deadline|author1=Colin Dwyer|author2=Carrie Kaufman|date=March 21, 2017|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its adoption of Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 (designated as "POM-15" by the U.S. Senate and published verbatim in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' of April 5, 2017, at pages S2361 and S2362).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2017-04-04/pdf/CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2361.pdf#page=1|title=Congressional Record - April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Illinois General Assembly]] then ratified the ERA on May 30, 2018 with its adoption of Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment No. 4 (designated as "POM-299" by the U.S. Senate and likewise published verbatim in the ''Congressional Record'' of September 12, 2018, at page S6141).&lt;ref&gt;((cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2018-09-12/pdf/CREC-2018-09-12-pt1-PgS6141-3.pdf#page=1|title=Congressional Record - September 12, 2018))&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

On September 25, 1921, the [[National Woman's Party]] announced plans to campaign for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to guarantee women equal rights with men. The text of the proposed amendment read:

{{quote|Section 1. No political, civil, or legal disabilities or inequalities on account of sex or on account of marriage, unless applying equally to both sexes, shall exist within the United States or any territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof.

Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.&lt;ref name=BaltSun&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=[[c:File:Equal Rights Amendment proposed in Congress 1921.jpg|WOMAN'S PARTY ALL READY FOR EQUALITY FIGHT; Removal Of All National and State Discriminations Is Aim. SENATE AND HOUSE TO GET AMENDMENT; A Proposed Constitutional Change To Be Introduced On October 1]]|last=Henning|first=Arthur Sears|date=26 September 1921|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|access-date=|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alice Paul, the head of the National Women's Party, believed that the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] would not be enough to ensure that men and women were treated equally regardless of sex. In 1923, she revised the proposed amendment to read:

{{quote|Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who was Alice Paul|url=http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul/|website=Alice Paul Institute|access-date=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Paul named this version the [[Lucretia Mott]] Amendment, after a female abolitionist who fought for women's rights and attended the First Women's Rights Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/lucretia-mott.htm.|title="Lucretia Mott" National Park Service|website=National Park Service|publisher=United States Government|access-date=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Alice Paul further revised the amendment to reflect the wording of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]] and Nineteenth Amendments. This text became Section 1 of the version passed by Congress in 1972.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/336era.html|title=Equal Rights Amendments, 1923-1972|website=history.hanover.edu|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, in the 1940s, ERA opponents proposed an alternative, which provided that "no distinctions on the basis of sex shall be made except such as are reasonably justified by differences in physical structure, biological differences, or social function." It was quickly turned down by both pro and anti-ERA coalitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ioM-8naFn60C|title=Moving the Mountain: The Women's Movement in America Since 1960|last=Davis|first=Flora|date=1999-01-01|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252067822|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminists split===
Since the 1920s, the Equal Rights Amendment has been accompanied by discussion among [[Feminism|feminists]] about the meaning of women's equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Judith|last=Sealander|title=Feminist Against Feminist: The First Phase of the Equal Rights Amendment Debate, 1923–1963|journal=South Atlantic Quarterly|year=1982|volume=81|issue=2|pages=147–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice Paul]] and her [[National Woman's Party]] asserted that women should be on equal terms with men in all regards, even if that means sacrificing benefits given to women through protective legislation, such as shorter work hours and no night work or heavy lifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Nancy|last=Cott|title=Feminist Politics in the 1920s: The National Woman's Party |journal=[[Journal of American History]]|year=1984|volume=71|issue=1|pages=43–68|jstor=1899833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the amendment, such as the [[Women's Joint Congressional Committee]], believed that the loss of these benefits to women would not be worth the supposed gain to them in equality. Although it now appears courts would indeed consider physical distinctions when applying the amendment, and determine whether a compelling government interest was met by sex-based government classifications, those discussing the amendment at the time had not yet seen the thoughtful Constitutional interpretations relating to civil rights and sex-based classifications that occurred years later. In 1924, ''The Forum'' hosted a debate between [[Doris Stevens]] and [[Alice Hamilton]] concerning the two perspectives on the proposed amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Susan|editor-last=Ware|chapter=New Dilemmas for Modern Women|title=Modern American Women: A Documentary History|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=1997|isbn=0-07-071527-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their debate reflected the wider tension in the developing feminist movement of the early 20th century between two approaches toward gender equality. One approach emphasized the common humanity of women and men, while the other stressed women's unique experiences and how they were different from men, seeking recognition for specific needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nancy|last=Cott|authorlink=Nancy Cott|title=The Grounding of Modern Feminism|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1987|isbn=0-300-04228-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition to the ERA was led by [[Mary Anderson (labor leader)|Mary Anderson]] and the [[Women's Bureau]] beginning in 1923. These feminists argued that legislation including mandated minimum wages, safety regulations, restricted daily and weekly hours, lunch breaks, and maternity provisions would be more beneficial to the majority of women who were forced to work out of economic necessity, not personal fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dorothy Sue|last=Cobble|title=The Other Women's Movement: Workplace Justice and Social Rights in Modern America|location=Princeton, New Jersey|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2004|page=51|isbn=0-691-06993-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate also drew from struggles between working class and professional women. Alice Hamilton, in her speech "Protection for Women Workers," said that the ERA would strip working women of the small protections they had achieved, leaving them powerless to further improve their condition in the future, or to attain necessary protections in the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Genora Johnson|last=Dollinger|chapter=Women and Labor Militancy|editor-first=Susan|editor-last=Ware|title=Modern American Women: A Documentary History|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=1997|isbn=0-07-071527-0|pages=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Woman's Party]] already had tested its approach in [[Wisconsin]], where it won passage of the Wisconsin Equal Rights Law in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Genevieve G.|last=McBride|chapter=‘Forward’ Women: Winning the Wisconsin Campaign for the Country's First ERA, 1921|editor-first=Peter G.

Instead, it was usually blocked in committee; except in 1946, when it was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 38 to 35 — not receiving the required two-thirds supermajority.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Hayden rider and protective labor legislation===
In 1950 and 1953, the ERA was passed by the Senate with a provision known as "the Hayden rider", introduced by [[Arizona]] Senator [[Carl Hayden]]. The Hayden rider added a sentence to the ERA to keep special protections for women: "The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair any rights, benefits, or exemptions now or hereafter conferred by law upon persons of the female sex." By allowing women to keep their existing and future special protections, it was expected that the ERA would be more appealing to its opponents. Though opponents were marginally more in favor of the ERA with the Hayden rider, supporters of the original ERA believed it negated the amendment's original purpose—causing the amendment not to be passed in the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt6f59n89c&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text|title=Conversations with Alice Paul: Woman Suffrage and the Equal Rights Amendment.|website=cdlib.org|publisher=Suffragists Oral History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/lawandpolicy/eraname.htm|title=What's in a Name?

ERA supporters were hopeful that the second term of President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] would advance their agenda. Eisenhower had publicly promised to "assure women everywhere in our land equality of rights," and in 1958, Eisenhower asked a [[joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] to pass the Equal Rights Amendment, the first president to show such a level of support for the amendment. However, the National Woman's Party found the amendment to be unacceptable and asked it to be withdrawn whenever the Hayden rider was added to the ERA.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] included support of the ERA in its platform beginning in [[1940 Republican National Convention|1940]], renewing the plank every four years until [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]].&lt;ref name="'70s 245"&gt;{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|last=Frum|first=David|authorlink=David Frum|year=2000|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-465-04195-7|pages=245–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ERA was strongly opposed by the [[American Federation of Labor]] and other labor unions, which feared the amendment would invalidate protective labor legislation for women. [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and most [[New Deal]]ers also opposed the ERA. They felt that ERA was designed for middle class women, but that working class women needed government protection. They also feared that the ERA would undercut the male-dominated labor unions that were a core component of the [[New Deal coalition]]. Most northern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], who aligned themselves with the anti-ERA labor unions, opposed the amendment.&lt;ref name="'70s 245" /&gt; The ERA was supported by southern Democrats and almost all Republicans.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt;

At the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]], the Democrats made the divisive step of including the ERA in their platform, but the Democratic Party did not become united in favor of the amendment until congressional passage in 1972.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt; The main support base for the ERA until the late 1960s was among middle class Republican women. The [[League of Women Voters]], formerly the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]], opposed the Equal Rights Amendment until 1972, fearing the loss of protective labor legislation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===1960s===
[[File:Women in favor of ERA - Tallahassee (32611083663).jpg|thumb|left|Women in favor of ERA - Tallahassee]]
At the [[1960 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention in 1960]], a proposal to endorse the ERA was rejected after it met explicit opposition from liberal groups including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), the [[AFL–CIO]], labor unions such as the [[American Federation of Teachers]], [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA), the [[American Nurses Association]], the Women's Division of the [[Methodist Church (USA)|Methodist Church]], and the National Councils of Jewish, Catholic, and Negro Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jo Freeman]]|title=A Room at a Time: How Women Entered Party Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LF8ov6Vc4YQC&amp;pg=PA209|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9805-9|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The losing side then demanded that presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] announce his support of the ERA; he did so in an October 21, 1960, letter to the chairman of the National Woman's Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=74146|author=Kennedy, John F|date=October 21, 1960|title=Letter to Mrs. Emma Guffey Miller, Chairman of the National Woman's Party|website=ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kennedy was elected, he made [[Esther Peterson]] the highest-ranking woman in his administration as an Assistant Secretary of Labor. Peterson publicly opposed the Equal Rights Amendment based on her belief that it would weaken protective labor legislation.&lt;ref name="fofweb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fofweb.com/History/MainPrintPage.asp?iPin=awhm0502&amp;DataType=Women&amp;WinType=Free|title=Peterson, Esther Eggertsen|work=Facts on File History Database|publisher=Infobase Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson referred to the National Woman's Party members, most of them veteran suffragists and preferred the "specific bills for specific ills" approach to equal rights.&lt;ref name="fofweb.com"/&gt; Ultimately, Kennedy's ties to labor unions meant that he and his administration did not support the ERA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph M. Siracusa|title=Encyclopedia of the Kennedys: The People and Events That Shaped America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEojQDou7MIC&amp;pg=PA864|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=864|isbn=9781598845396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a concession to feminists, Kennedy appointed a [[Blue-ribbon panel|blue-ribbon commission]] on women, the [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women|President's Commission on the Status of Women]], to investigate the problem of sex discrimination in the United States. The commission was chaired by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] who opposed the ERA but no longer spoke against it publicly. In the early 1960s, Eleanor Roosevelt announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA was no longer a threat to women as it once may have been and told supporters that, as far as she was concerned, they could have the amendment if they wanted it. However, she never went so far as to endorse the ERA. The commission that she chaired reported (after her death) that no ERA was needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurine Hoffman Beasley|title=Eleanor Roosevelt and the Media: A Public Quest for Self-fulfillment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55XG0oS3XyYC&amp;pg=PA184|year=1987|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=184|isbn=9780252013768}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission did, though, help win passage of the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]] which banned sex discrimination in wages in a number of professions (it would later be amended in the early 1970s to include the professions that it initially excluded) and secured an [[executive order]] from Kennedy eliminating sex discrimination in the [[civil service]]. The commission, composed largely of anti-ERA feminists with ties to labor, proposed remedies to the widespread sex discrimination it unearthed and in its 1963 final report held that on the issue of equality "a constitutional amendment need not now be sought".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Keetley|editor1-first=Dawn|editor2-last=Pettegrew|editor2-first=John|title=Public Women, Public Words: A Documentary History of American Feminism, Volume III: 1960 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDd2aNCoGlYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=251|isbn=9780742522367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national commission spurred the establishment of state and local commissions on the status of women and arranged for follow-up conferences in the years to come. The following year, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] banned workplace discrimination not only on the basis of race, religion, and national origin, but also on the basis of sex, thanks to the lobbying of [[Alice Paul]] and [[Coretta Scott King]] and the skillful politicking of Representative [[Martha Griffiths]] of [[Michigan]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

A new women's movement gained ground in the later 1960s as a result of a variety of factors: [[Betty Friedan]]'s bestseller ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]''; the network of women's rights commissions formed by Kennedy's national commission; the frustration over women's social and economic status; and anger over the lack of government and [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] enforcement of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In June 1966, at the Third National Conference on the Status of Women in [[Washington, D.C.]], Betty Friedan and a group of activists frustrated with the lack of government action in enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act formed the [[National Organization for Women]] to act as an "[[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] for women", demanding full equality for American women and men.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In 1967, at the urging of Alice Paul, NOW endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}  The decision caused some union Democrats and social conservatives to leave the organization and form the [[Women's Equity Action League]] (within a few years WEAL also endorsed the ERA), but the move to support the amendment benefited NOW, bolstering its membership. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}} By the late 1960s, NOW had made significant political and legislative victories and was gaining enough power to become a major lobbying force. In 1969, newly-elected Representative [[Shirley Chisholm]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] gave her famous speech "Equal Rights for Women" on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Congressional passage==
[[File:Martha Griffiths.jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. Representative [[Martha W. Griffiths]] championed the ERA]]
In February 1970, NOW picketed the United States Senate, a subcommittee of which was holding hearings on a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age to 18. NOW disrupted the hearings and demanded a hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment and won a meeting with Senators to discuss the ERA. That August, over 20,000 American women held a nationwide [[Women's Strike for Equality]] protest to demand full social, economic, and political equality.&lt;ref name=wommarch&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902696,00.html/ Nation, Women on] ''Time'' (New York), September 7, 1970 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406112028/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902696,00.html/|date=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said [[Betty Friedan]] of the strike, "All kinds of women's groups all over the country will be using this week on August 26 particularly, to point out those areas in women's life which are still not addressed. For example, a question of equality before the law; we are interested in the Equal Rights Amendment."

In Washington, D.C., protesters presented a sympathetic Senate leadership with a petition for the Equal Rights Amendment at the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]]. Influential news sources such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' also supported the cause of the protestors.&lt;ref name=wommarch /&gt; Soon after the strike took place, activists distributed literature across the country as well.&lt;ref name=femis209 /&gt; In 1970, congressional hearings began on the ERA.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

On August 10, 1970, Michigan Democrat [[Martha Griffiths]] successfully brought the Equal Rights Amendment to the House Floor, after fifteen years of the joint resolution languishing in the House Judiciary Committee. The joint resolution passed in the House and continued on to the Senate, which voted for the ERA with an added clause that women would be exempt from the military. The [[91st United States Congress|91st Congress]], however, ended before the joint resolution could progress any further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.house.gov/People/Listing/G/GRIFFITHS,-Martha-Wright-(G000471)/|title=GRIFFITHS, Martha Wright {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art &amp; Archives|website=history.house.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffiths reintroduced the ERA, and achieved success on Capitol Hill with her House Joint Resolution No. 208, which was adopted by the House on October 12, 1971, with a vote of 354 yeas (For), 24 nays (Against) and 51 not voting.&lt;ref&gt;117 ''Congressional Record'' 35815&lt;/ref&gt; Griffiths' joint resolution was then adopted by the Senate—without change—on March 22, 1972, by a vote of 84 yeas, 8 nays and 7 not voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/congressionalrec118funit#page/n93/mode/2up|title=Congressional record|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate version, drafted by Senator [[Birch Bayh]] of Indiana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cruikshank|first=Kate|title=The Art of Leadership: A Companion to an Exhibition from the Senatorial Papers of Birch Bayh, United States Senator from Indiana, 1963–1980|url=http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=8621|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed after the defeat of an amendment proposed by Senator [[Sam Ervin]] of North Carolina that would have exempted women from the [[Conscription|draft]].&lt;ref name="'70s 245" /&gt; President [[Richard Nixon]] immediately endorsed the ERA's approval upon its passage by the [[92nd United States Congress|92nd Congress]].&lt;ref name="'70s 245" /&gt;

===Ratifications===
On March 22, 1972, the ERA was placed before the state legislatures, with a seven-year deadline to acquire ratification by three-fourths (38) of the state legislatures. A majority of states ratified the proposed constitutional amendment within a year. Hawaii became the first state to ratify the ERA, which it did on the same day the amendment was approved by Congress: The U.S. Senate's vote on House Joint Resolution No. 208 took place in the mid-to-late afternoon in Washington D.C., when it was still midday in Hawaii. The [[Hawaii Senate]] and [[Hawaii House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] voted their approval shortly after noon Hawaii Standard Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Jone|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/which-states-ratified-the-era-3528872|title=Which States Ratified the ERA and When Did They Ratify?|publisher=Thoughtco.com|date=October 31, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1972, a total of 22 state legislatures ratified the amendment and eight more joined in early 1973. Between 1974 and 1977, only five states approved the ERA, and advocates became worried about the approaching March 22, 1979 deadline.&lt;ref name="ERA: History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/history.htm|title=ERA: History|website=www.equalrightsamendment.org|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the legislatures of four states which had ratified the ERA then adopted legislation purporting to rescind those ratifications. If, indeed, a state legislature has the ability to rescind, then the ERA actually had ratifications by only 31 states{{snd}}not 35{{snd}}when March 22, 1979, arrived.

(Refer to "Executive branch involvement in ratification process" below).

===Ratifying state with self-declared March 22, 1979 sunset provision===
The action of the 95th Congress in October 1978 to extend the ERA ratification deadline from March 22, 1979, to June 30, 1982, was not universally accepted. On December 23, 1981, a federal district court ruled in ''Idaho v. Freeman'' that Congress had no power to extend ERA's ratification deadline.  On January 25, 1982, the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] opted to [[Stay of proceedings|stay]] the district court's decision.  Taking no further action on the matter until October 4, 1982, the High Court, on that date, ruled in ''NOW v. Idaho'' and ''Carmen v. Idaho'' that the controversy had been rendered moot by virtue of the fact that no additional state legislatures ratified ERA between March 22, 1979 and June 30, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eagleforum.org/era/now-v-idaho.html|title=NOW v. Idaho {{!}} 459 U.S. 809 (1982)|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those rejecting Congress's claim to even hold such authority, the [[South Dakota Legislature]] adopted Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 on March 1, 1979. The joint resolution stipulated that South Dakota's 1973 ERA ratification would be [[Sunset provision|"sunsetted"]] as of the original March 22, 1979 deadline. South Dakota's 1979 sunset joint resolution declared: "...the Ninety-fifth Congress ex post facto has sought unilaterally to alter the terms and conditions in such a way as to materially affect the congressionally established time period for ratification..." (designated as "POM-93" by the U.S. Senate and published verbatim in the ''Congressional Record'' of March 13, 1979, at pages 4861 and 4862).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1979-pt4/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1979-pt4-4-2.pdf#page=43&lt;/ref&gt;

The action on the part of South Dakota lawmakers—occurring 21 days prior to originally agreed-upon March 22, 1979 deadline—could be viewed as slightly different from a rescission. As noted in ''The Constitution of the United States Analysis and Interpretation'' (Centennial edition, 2017, at page 1005): "Four states had rescinded their ratifications [of the ERA] and a fifth had declared that its ratification would be void unless the [Equal Rights] amendment was ratified within the original time limit"; (see footnote 43 at the bottom of page 1005, which identifies South Dakota as that "fifth" state).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/content/conan/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2017.pdf#page=1031&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=941086029119014015123093108002102030040035068060068038011064116081004087098007002121027055021115000042004088076118087010119115062049001061039127092121098009126089039001020105065001123111009088107112069125001030090103100094119087113005006096065074015&amp;EXT=pdf|title=Buried Alive: The Reboot of the Equal Rights Amendment|last=Magliocca|first=Gerald N.|publisher=[[Social Science Research Network]]|page=10|date=June 22, 2018|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive branch involvement in ratification process===
The Constitution is silent as to whether the governor—or acting governor—of a state has any formal role to play regarding state ratification of an amendment to the Constitution. However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Hollingsworth v. Virginia]]'' (1798)&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Hollingsworth v. Virginia|volume=3|page=378|year=1798|reporter=Dall.|reporter-volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[President of the United States]] has no formal role in that process.

===Non-ratifying states with one-house approval===
At various times, in 7 of the 13 non-ratifying states, one house of the legislature approved the ERA. It failed in those states because both houses of a state's legislature must approve, during the same session, in order for that state to be deemed to have ratified.

==Congressional extension of ratification deadline==
The original joint resolution (H. J. Res. 208), by which the [[92nd United States Congress|92nd Congress]] proposed the amendment to the states, was prefaced by the following resolving clause:

{{quote|Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States ''within seven years from the date of its submission by the Congress'': [emphasis added]}}

As the joint resolution was passed on March 22, 1972, this effectively set a March 22, 1979 deadline for the amendment to be ratified by the requisite number of states. However, the 92nd Congress did not incorporate any time limit into the body of the actual text of the proposed amendment, as had been done with a number of other proposed amendments.&lt;ref&gt;Section 3 of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]], Section 6 of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], Section 3 of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]], Section 2 of the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], and Section 4 of the rejected [[District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, as the original 1979 deadline approached, the [[95th United States Congress|95th Congress]] adopted House Joint Resolution No. 638 (H. J. Res. 638), by Representative [[Elizabeth Holtzman]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], which purported to extend the ERA's ratification deadline to June 30, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Volume 92, ''United States Statutes At Large,'' page 3799&lt;/ref&gt; H. J. Res. 638 received less than two-thirds of the vote (a [[Majority|simple majority]], not a [[supermajority]]) in both the House of Representatives and the Senate; for that reason, ERA supporters deemed it necessary that H. J. Res. 638 be transmitted to then-President [[Jimmy Carter]] for signature as a safety precaution. Carter signed the joint resolution, although he noted, on strictly procedural grounds, the irregularity of his doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Equal_Rights_Amendment_-_Extension_of_ratification_deadline/id/1367020 Equal Rights Amendment - Extension of ratification deadline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019174107/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Equal_Rights_Amendment_-_Extension_of_ratification_deadline/id/1367020|date=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this disputed extension of slightly more than three years, no additional states ratified or [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Rescinding a ratification|rescinded]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The purported extension of ERA's ratification deadline was vigorously contested in 1978 as scholars were divided as to whether Congress actually has authority to revise a previously agreed-to deadline for the states to act upon a Federal constitutional amendment. On June 18, 1980, a resolution in the Illinois House of Representatives resulted in a vote of 102-71 in favor, but Illinois' internal parliamentary rules required a three-fifths majority on constitutional amendments and so the measure failed by five votes. In 1982, seven female ERA supporters went on a fast and seventeen chained themselves to the entrance of the Illinois Senate chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=O'Dea, Suzanne|title=From Suffrage to the Senate: An Encyclopedia of American Women in Politics, Volume 1|date=1999|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Si6ZVqdOqIgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780874369601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hungryheart"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholson, Zoe Ann|title=The Hungry Heart: A Woman's Fast for Justice|date=2004|publisher=Lune Soleil Press|isbn=0972392831|url=http://www.lunesoleilpress.com/the-hungry-heart-a-womans-fast-for-justice.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes-era"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheppard|first=Nathaniel|title=Women say they'll end fast but not rights fight|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/24/us/women-say-they-ll-end-fast-but-not-rights-fight.html|date=June 24, 1982|accessdate=September 18, 2016|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest that the ERA came to gaining an additional ratification between the original deadline of March 22, 1979 and the revised June 30, 1982, expiration date was when it was approved by the [[Florida House of Representatives]] on June 21, 1982. In the final week before the revised deadline, that ratifying resolution, however, was defeated in the [[Florida Senate]] by a vote of 16 yeas and 22 nays. Even if Florida had ratified the ERA, the proposed amendment would still have fallen short of the required 38.

According to research by Professor Jules B. Gerard, professor of law at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], of the 35 legislatures that passed ratification resolutions, 24 of them explicitly referred to the original 1979 deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to House Judiciary Committee, June 14, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the courts==
On December 23, 1981, a federal district court, in the case of ''Idaho v. Freeman'', ruled that the extension of the ERA ratification deadline to June 30, 1982, was not valid and that, ERA had actually expired from state legislative consideration more than two years earlier on the original expiration date of March 22, 1979.  On January 25, 1982, however, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Stay of proceedings|"stayed"]] the lower court's decision, thus signaling to the legislatures of still-unratified states that they may continue consideration of ERA during their spring 1982 legislative sessions.

After the disputed June 30, 1982, extended deadline had come and gone, the Supreme Court, at the beginning of its new term, on October 4, 1982, in the separate case of ''NOW v.

In the 1939 case of ''[[Coleman v. Miller]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13916201793014079286&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr|title=Coleman v. Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled that Congress has the final authority to determine whether, by lapse of time, a proposed constitutional amendment has lost its vitality before being ratified by enough states, and whether state ratifications are effective in light of attempts at subsequent withdrawal. The Court stated: "We think that, in accordance with this historic precedent, the question of the efficacy of ratifications by state legislatures, in the light of previous rejection or attempted withdrawal, should be regarded as a political question pertaining to the political departments, with the ultimate authority in the Congress in the exercise of its control over the promulgation of the adoption of the amendment."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court, in 1939, upheld Congressional authority to determine in 1868 that the Fourteenth Amendment was properly ratified, including states that had attempted to rescind prior ratifications.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the context of this judicial precedent, nonpartisan counsel to a Nevada state legislative committee concluded in 2017 that "If three more states sent their ratification to the appropriate federal official, it would then be up to Congress to determine whether a sufficient number of states have ratified the Equal Rights Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Minutes/Assembly/LOE/Final/428.pdf|title=Minutes, Hearing of the Assembly Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections}}, p.16 (Mar. 7, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, an informal advisory provided to Virginia State Senator Scott A. Surovell from the Virginia Attorney General’s office stated that Congress has the power to extend the ratification deadline even further. The advisory also stated that even without such a further extension, a contemporary ratification of the ERA by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] could be found valid by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginias-hopes-of-era-ratification-go-down-in-flames-this-year/2018/02/09/7acfbf80-0dab-11e8-8890-372e2047c935_story.html|title=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2018, a formal opinion letter of Virginia Attorney General [[Mark Herring]] concurred, stating:&lt;ref&gt;See Virginia Attorney General Opinion Letter, supra, at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In light of Congress's significant control over the amendment process, I cannot conclude that it lacks the power to extend the period in which an amendment can be ratified and recognize a State's intervening ratifying resolution as legally effective for purposes of determining whether the ERA has been ratified. Although the precise issue you raise has not been conclusively resolved, the historical evidence and case law demonstrate Congress's significant, even plenary, power over the amending process."

The Attorney General added, citing extensive sources: "As recognized by the constitutional scholars who testified before Congress and in the report of the House Judiciary Committee recommending extension, the limited Supreme Court precedent in this area suggests that Congress has authority to extend a ratification deadline."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

After thorough discussion of legal precedent and testimony at the Congressional hearings, the opinion letter concluded: "It is my opinion that the lapse of the ERA's original and extended ratification periods has not disempowered the [Virginia] General Assembly from passing a ratifying resolution. Given Congress's substantial power over the amending process, I cannot conclude that Congress would be powerless to extend or remove the ERA's ratification deadline and recognize as valid a State's intervening act of ratification. Indeed, legislation currently pending in Congress seeks to exercise that very power."&lt;ref&gt;Id., at 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for the ERA==
Supporters of the ERA point to the lack of a specific guarantee in the Constitution for equal rights protections on the basis of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/why.htm|title=ERA: Why|website=www.equalrightsamendment.org|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, future Supreme Court Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] summarized a supporting argument for the ERA in the [[American Bar Association Journal]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The equal rights amendment, in sum, would dedicate the nation to a new view of the rights and responsibilities of men and women. It firmly rejects sharp legislative lines between the sexes as constitutionally tolerable. Instead, it looks toward a legal system in which each person will be judged on the basis of individual merit and not on the basis of an unalterable trait of birth that bears no necessary relationship to need or ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ginsburg |first=Ruth Bader |title=The Need for the Equal Rights Amendment |journal=American Bar Association Journal |volume=59 |issue=9 |year=1973 |pages=1013–1019 |jstor=25726416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the early 1940s both the Democratic and Republican parties added support for the ERA to their platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/history.htm|title=ERA: History|website=www.equalrightsamendment.org|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) and ERAmerica, a coalition of almost 80 organizations, led the pro-ERA efforts. Between 1972 and 1982, ERA supporters held rallies, petitioned, picketed, went on hunger strikes, and performed acts of civil disobedience.&lt;ref name="ERA: History"/&gt; On July 9, 1978, NOW and other organizations hosted a national march in Washington D.C., which garnered over 100,000 supporters, and was followed by a Lobby Day on July 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://feminist.org/blog/index.php/2014/07/09/july-9-1978-feminists-make-history-with-biggest-ever-march-for-the-equal-rights-amendment/|title=July 9, 1978: Feminists Make History With Biggest-Ever March for the Equal Rights Amendment {{!}} Feminist Majority Foundation Blog|website=feminist.org|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1982, NOW sponsored marches in states that had not passed the ERA including Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, and Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/07/us/thousands-march-for-equal-rights.html|title=THOUSANDS MARCH FOR EQUAL RIGHTS|last=Times|first=Winston Williams, Special To The New York|date=1982-06-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-13|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key feminists of the time, such as [[Gloria Steinem]], spoke out in favor of the ERA, arguing that ERA opposition was based on gender myths that overemphasized difference and ignored evidence of unequal treatment between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/7025/|title="All Our Problems Stem from the Same Sex Based Myths": Gloria Steinem Delineates American Gender Myths during ERA Hearings|website=historymatters.gmu.edu|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for the ERA among people of color===
Many women in the African American community have supported the ERA in light of the dual effects of both race and sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="SEDWICK 24–29"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SEDWICK|first=CATHY|last2=WILLIAMS|first2=REBA|date=1976-01-01|title=BLACK WOMEN AND THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT|journal=The Black Scholar|volume=7|issue=10|pages=24–29|jstor=41065957}}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent female supporter was New York Representative [[Shirley Chisholm]]. On August 10, 1970, she gave a speech on the ERA called "For the Equal Rights Amendment" in Washington D.C. In her address, she pointed out how widespread sex discrimination had become and how the ERA would remedy it. She also said that laws to protect women in the workforce from unsafe working conditions would be needed by men, too, and thus the ERA would help all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.vod.umd.edu/civil/chisholm1970int.htm|title=Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm, "For the Equal Rights Amendment" (10 August 1970)|website=archive.vod.umd.edu|access-date=2017-04-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424030341/http://archive.vod.umd.edu/civil/chisholm1970int.htm|archivedate=24 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1976, 60% of African American women and 63% of African American men were in favor of the ERA, and the legislation was supported by organizations such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], [[National Council of Negro Women]], [[Coalition of Black Trade Unionists]], National Association of Negro Business, and the [[National Black Feminist Organization]].&lt;ref name="SEDWICK 24–29"/&gt;

==Opposition to the ERA==
[[File:Anti-ERA women dnd0215.jpg|thumb|Anti-ERA women watching a committee meeting of the Florida Senate in 1979, where consideration of the ERA was postponed, thus effectively killing the resolution for the 1979 session]]
Opponents of the ERA focused on traditional gender roles, such as how men do the fighting in wartime. They argued that the amendment would guarantee the possibility that women would be subject to [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] and be required to have military combat roles in future wars if it were passed. Defense of traditional [[gender role]]s proved to be a useful tactic. In Illinois, supporters of [[Phyllis Schlafly]], a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Republican activist from that state, used traditional symbols of the American [[housewife]]. They took homemade bread, jams, and apple pies to the state legislators, with the slogans, "Preserve us from a congressional jam; Vote against the ERA sham" and "I am for Mom and apple pie."&lt;ref name=Rosenberg225&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosenberg, Rosalind|title=Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century|date=2008|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|page=225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-GMcnUaLhEC&amp;pg=PA225|isbn=9780809016310}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appealed to married women by stressing that the amendment would invalidate protective laws such as alimony and eliminate the tendency for mothers to obtain custody over their children in divorce cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhode, Deborah L.|title=Justice and Gender: Sex Discrimination and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1qosJPdqPkC&amp;pg=PA66|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=66–67|isbn=9780674042674}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that single-sex bathrooms would be eliminated and same-sex couples would be able to get married if the amendment were passed.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Women who supported traditional gender roles started to oppose the ERA.&lt;ref name=kllap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/57c.asp|title=The Equal Rights Amendment|website=ushistory.org|publisher=Independence Hall Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlafly said the ERA was designed for the benefit of young career women and warned that if men and women had to be treated identically it would threaten the security of middle-aged housewives with no job skills. They could no longer count on alimony or Social Security.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Opponents also argued that men and women were already equal enough with the passage of the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]] and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&amp;psid=3345|title=Digital History|website=www.digitalhistory.uh.edu|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that women's colleges would have to admit men. Schlafly's argument that protective laws would be lost resonated with working-class women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosenberg, Rosalind|title=Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-GMcnUaLhEC&amp;pg=PA225|date=2008|pages=225–26|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|isbn=9780809016310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phyllis Schlafly by Gage Skidmore.jpg|upright=0.85|thumb|left|[[Phyllis Schlafly]], a conservative activist, organized opposition to the ERA and argued that it "would lead to women being drafted by the military and to [[unisex public toilet|public unisex bathrooms]]"&lt;ref name=eilperin&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/27/AR2007032702357_pf.html|work=The Washington Post|title=New Drive Afoot to Pass Equal Rights Amendment|first=Juliet|last=Eilperin|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
At the [[1980 Republican National Convention]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] platform was amended to end its support for the ERA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlez|first=Jane|title=Plan to omit rights amendment from platform brings objections|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/17/us/plan-to-omit-rights-amendment-from-platform-brings-objections.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=July 24, 2013|date=May 17, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent opponent of the ERA was Schlafly. Leading the Stop ERA campaign, Schlafly defended traditional gender roles and would often attempt to incite feminists by opening her speeches with lines such as, "I'd like to thank my husband for letting me be here tonight{{snd}} I always like to say that, because it makes the libs so mad."&lt;ref&gt;Critchlow, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; When Schlafly began her campaign in 1972, public polls showed support for the amendment was widely popular and thirty states had ratified the amendment by 1973. After 1973, the number of ratifying states slowed to a trickle. Support in the states that had not ratified fell below 50%.&lt;ref&gt;Jane J. Mansbridge, ''Why we lost the ERA'' (University of Chicago Press, 1986) p 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Critchlow and Stachecki noted that public opinion in key states shifted against the ERA as opponents, operating on the local and state levels, won over the public. The state legislators in battleground states followed public opinion in rejecting the ERA.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Experts agree that Phyllis Schlafly was a key player in the defeat. Political scientist [[Jane Mansbridge]] in her history of the ERA argues that the draft issue was the single most powerful argument used by Schlafly and the other opponents to defeat ERA.&lt;ref&gt;Jane  Mansbridge, "Who's in Charge Here? Decision by Accretion and Gatekeeping in the Struggle for the ERA", ''Politics &amp; Society'' (1984) 13#4 pp 343-382.&lt;/ref&gt; Mansbridge concluded, "Many people who followed the struggle over the ERA believed{{snd}} rightly in my view{{snd}} that the Amendment would have been ratified by 1975 or 1976 had it not been for Phyllis Schlafly's early and effective effort to organize potential opponents."&lt;ref&gt;Mansbridge, ''Why we lost the ERA'' (1986) p 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal scholar [[Joan C. Williams]] maintained, "ERA was defeated when Schlafly turned it into a war among women over gender roles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Joan|title=Unbending Gender: Why Family and Work Conflict and What To Do About It|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxtNubyWAEMC&amp;pg=PA147|year=1999|publisher=Oxford UP|page=147|isbn=9780199840472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Judith Glazer-Raymo asserted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As moderates, we thought we represented the forces of reason and goodwill but failed to take seriously the power of the family values argument and the single-mindedness of Schlafly and her followers. The ERA's defeat seriously damaged the women's movement, destroying its momentum and its potential to foment social change....Eventually, this resulted in feminist dissatisfaction with the Republican Party, giving the Democrats a new source of strength that when combined with overwhelming minority support, helped elect Bill Clinton to the presidency in 1992 and again in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glazer-Raymo|first=Judith|title=Shattering the Myths: Women in Academe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTWzBcW07RwC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2001|publisher=Johns Hopkins UP|page=19|isbn=9780801866418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many ERA supporters blamed their defeat on [[Advocacy group|special interest]] forces, especially the insurance industry and conservative organizations, suggesting that they had funded an opposition that subverted the democratic process and the will of the pro-ERA majority.&lt;ref&gt;Critchlow and Stachecki (2008). ''The Equal Rights Amendment Reconsidered''. pp. 157-8&lt;/ref&gt; Such supporters argued that while the public face of the anti-ERA movement was Phyllis Schlafly and her STOP ERA organization, there were other important groups in the opposition as well, such as the powerful National Council of Catholic Women, [[Labor feminism|labor feminists]]{{verification needed|date=May 2018}} and (until 1973) the [[AFL–CIO]]. Opposition to the amendment was particularly high among religious conservatives, who argued that the amendment would guarantee universal abortion rights and the right for homosexual couples to marry.&lt;ref name="Francis ERA History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/history.htm|author=Francis, Roberta W.|title=The History Behind the Equal Rights Amendment|website=equalrightsamendment.org|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David W. Brady and Kent L. Tedin, "Ladies in Pink: Religion and Political Ideology in the Anti-ERA Movement", ''Social Science Quarterly'' (1976) 56#4 pp 564-75&lt;/ref&gt;  Critchlow and Stachecki say the anti-ERA movement was based on strong backing among Southern whites, Evangelical Christians, Mormons, Orthodox Jews, and Roman Catholics, including both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Critchlow and Stachecki (2008). ''The Equal Rights Amendment Reconsidered''. p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sonia Johnson]], a traditionally-raised Mormon housewife whose eventual feminist advocacy for the ERA's passage led to her excommunication by the LDS church, subsequently wrote about her experiences in the memoir ''From Housewife to Heretic''. Johnson and others led a hunger strike/fast at the Illinois State Senate chamber in an unsuccessful effort to push the Illinois General Assembly toward ERA ratification before the 1982 revised deadline.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Post-deadline ratifications and the "three-state strategy"==

Beginning in the mid 1990s, ERA supporters began an effort to win ratification of the ERA by the legislatures of states that did not ratify it between 1972 and 1982. These proponents state that Congress can remove the ERA's ratification deadline despite the deadline having expired, allowing the states again to ratify it. They also state that the ratifications ERA previously received remain in force and that rescissions of prior ratifications are not valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Three-State Strategy|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/strategy.htm|publisher=Alice Paul Institute in collaboration with the ERA Task Force of the National Council of Women's Organizations|accessdate=April 25, 2014|author=Francis, Roberta W.|website=equalrightsamendment.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127031352/http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/strategy.htm|archivedate=January 27, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who espouse the "three-state strategy" (now down to only one state if the Nevada Legislature's and the Illinois General Assembly's belated ERA approvals are deemed legitimate) were spurred, at least in part, by the unconventional 202-year-long ratification of the Constitution's [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]] (sometimes referred to as the "Madison Amendment") which became part of the Constitution in 1992 after pending before the state legislatures since 1789.  Although the "Madison Amendment" was not associated with a ratification deadline, whereas the proposing clause of the ERA did include a deadline, states have in the past ratified amendments after a deadline, and Congress has not rejected those ratifications (as the Supreme Court has said, "Congress in controlling the promulgation of the adoption of a constitutional amendment has the final determination of the question whether by lapse of time its proposal of the amendment had lost its vitality prior to the required ratifications").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coleman v. Miller|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/307/433/|publisher=Justia|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, 2009, the [[National Organization for Women]] decided to support both efforts to obtain additional state ratifications for the 1972 ERA and any strategy to submit a fresh-start ERA to the states for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 National NOW Conference Resolutions: Equal Rights Amendment|url=http://www.now.org/organization/conference/resolutions/2009.html|date=June 21, 2009|publisher=National Organization for Women|accessdate=2009-08-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812221001/http://www.now.org/organization/conference/resolutions/2009.html|archivedate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[Congressional Research Service]] issued a report saying that ratification deadlines are a [[political question]]:{{quote|ERA proponents claim that the Supreme Court's decision in ''Coleman v. Miller'' gives Congress wide discretion in setting conditions for the ratification process.}} The report goes on to say:{{quote|Revivification opponents caution ERA supporters against an overly broad interpretation of ''Coleman v.

However, most recently, ERA Action has both led and brought renewed vigor to the movement by instituting what has become known as the "three state strategy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Held, Herndon, and Stager|first=Allsion, Sheryl, and Danielle|date=1997|title=The Equal Rights Amendment: Why the ERA Remains Legally Viable And Properly Before the States|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/misc/WM_law_article.pdf|journal=William &amp; Mary Journal of Women and the Law|volume=3:113|pages=113–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in 2013 that ERA Action began to gain traction with this strategy through their coordination with U.S. Senators and Representatives not only to introduce legislation in both houses of Congress to remove the ratification deadline, but also in gaining legislative sponsors. The Congressional Research Service then issued a report on the "three state strategy" on April 8, 2013 entitled "The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: Contemporary Ratification Issues",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42979.pdf|title=The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: Contemporary Ratification Issues|last=Neale|first=Thomas|quote=Congressional Research Service|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the approach was viable.

In 2014, under the auspices of ERA Action and their coalition partners, both the Virginia and Illinois state senates voted to ratify the ERA. That year, votes were blocked in both states' House chambers. In the meantime, the ERA ratification movement continued with the resolution being introduced in 10 state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/index.htm|title=ERA: Home|website=www.equalrightsamendment.org|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/21/520962541/nevada-on-cusp-of-ratifying-equal-rights-amendment-35-years-after-deadline|title=Nevada Ratifies The Equal Rights Amendment ... 35 Years After The Deadline|work=NPR|access-date=2017-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bal-cardin-equal-rights-amendment-20170121-story.html|title=As women march in D.C., Cardin co-sponsors new Equal Rights Amendment|last=Brown|first=Matthew Hay|work=baltimoresun.com|access-date=2017-04-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2017, the Nevada Legislature became the first state in 40 years to ratify the ERA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aauw.org/2015/11/05/ratify-the-era/|title=Let's Ratify the ERA: A Look at Where We Are Now|last=says|first=Quora|website=AAUW: Empowering Women Since 1881|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illinois lawmakers and citizens took another look at the ERA, with hearings, testimony, and research including work by the law firm Winston &amp; Strawn to address common legal questions about the ERA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.winston.com/images/content/1/3/v2/137207/ERA-Common-Legal-Questions.pdf|title=Common Legal Questions About the ERA|website=www.winston.com|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 2018, the final day of that year's legislative session on which the Virginia General Assembly committees could have brought up the four ERA resolutions for consideration, women and men from the [[League of Women Voters]], Liberal Women of Chesterfield County, and several other women's rights groups across Virginia packed the committee chamber rooms of the [[Virginia General Assembly]]; when the chairmen did not bring up the ERA for a vote, they demanded, to resulting in applause in the room that the resolutions be given a fair hearing and vote. The House committee did not bring up the resolutions for consideration, and the Virginia Senate Rules Committee voted to table the resolution until the following year, citing an alleged statement from an official at the National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Patrick|title=Women pack committee rooms demanding Virginia debate ERA|issue=General Assembly 2018|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=February 10, 2018|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=A9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Patricia|title=Virginia’s hopes of ERA ratification go down in flames this year|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginias-hopes-of-era-ratification-go-down-in-flames-this-year/2018/02/09/7acfbf80-0dab-11e8-8890-372e2047c935_story.html|website=Washington Post|accessdate=February 15, 2018|date=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Archives and Records Administration later noted that the alleged statement had never occurred.

==Subsequent congressional action==

The amendment has been reintroduced in every session of Congress since 1982. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] (D-Massachusetts) championed it in the Senate from the [[99th United States Congress|99th Congress]] through the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]]. Senator [[Robert Menendez]] (D-New Jersey) introduced the amendment symbolically at the end of the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] and has supported it in the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]]. In the House of Representatives, [[Carolyn Maloney]] (D-New York) has sponsored it since the [[105th United States Congress|105th Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Equal Rights Amendment: 111th Congress|url=http://maloney.house.gov/sites/maloney.house.gov/files/documents/women/era/AUGUST%2012%20Facts%20About%20the%20ERA%20in%20the%20111th%20Congress.pdf|format=PDF|date=July 13, 2009|website=maloney.house.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; most recently in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:h.j.res.56:|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status 113th Congress (2013 - 2014) H.J. Res. 56 |website=loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the ERA passed through House committees with the same text as in 1972; however, it failed by six votes to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote on the House floor. That was the last time that the ERA received a floor vote in either house of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RD3wqORd9jMC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;lpg=PA308&amp;dq=1983+%22equal+rights+amendment%22+%22six+votes%22#v=onepage&amp;q=1983%20%22equal%20rights%20amendment%22%20%22six%20votes%22&amp;f=false|author=Randall, Vicky|title=Women and Politics: An International Perspective|page=308|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1987|isbn=9780226703923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 112th Congress on January 6, 2011, Senator Menendez, along with Representatives Maloney, [[Jerrold Nadler]] (D-New York) and [[Gwen Moore]] (D-Wisconsin), held a press conference advocating for the Equal Rights Amendment's adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://maloney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/constitution-read-aloud-maloney-menendez-nadler-moore-cite-need-equal-rights-amendment|title=As Constitution is read aloud, Maloney, Menendez, Nadler, Moore cite need for Equal Rights Amendment|date=January 6, 2011|website=maloney.house.gov|accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[113th United States Congress|113th Congress]] had a record number of women. On March 5, 2013, the ERA was reintroduced by Senator Menendez as S.J. Res. 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:S.J.+Res.+10:|title=Bill Text 113th Congress (2013-2014) S.J.RES.10.IS|website=loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/07/1192277/-Democrats-re-re-re-reintroduce-Equal-Rights-Amendment-but-shhhh-don-t-tell-anyone|author=Gray, Kaili Joy|date=March 7, 2013|title=Democrats re-re-re-reintroduce Equal Rights Amendment ... but shhhh, don't tell anyone|website=dailykos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "New ERA" introduced in 2013, sponsored by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, adds an additional sentence to the original text: "Women shall have equal rights in the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Equal Means Equal|last=Neuwirth|first=Jessica|publisher=The New Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1-62097-039-3|location=New York|page=102|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed removal of ratification deadline===

On March 8, 2011, the 100th anniversary of [[International Women's Day]], Representative [[Tammy Baldwin]] (D-Wisconsin) introduced legislation (H.J. Res. 47) to remove the congressionally imposed deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=229427|title=U.S. Rep.

On March 22, 2012, the 40th anniversary of the ERA's congressional approval, Senator [[Benjamin L. Cardin]] (D-Maryland) introduced (S.J. Res. 39){{snd}} which is worded with slight differences from Representative Baldwin's (H.J. Res. 47). Senator Cardin was joined by ten other Senators who added their names to the Senate Joint Resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/39/all-info|title=All Bill Information (Except Text) for S.J.Res.39 - A joint resolution removing the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment|website=congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 2013, the [[New Mexico House of Representatives]] adopted House Memorial No. 7 asking that the congressionally-imposed deadline for ERA ratification be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/13%20Regular/memorials/house/HM007.pdf|format=PDF|title=House Memorial 7|author=51st Legislature, State of New Mexico, First Session, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsun-news.com/las_cruces-news/ci_22568975/roundhouse-roundup-feb-11-2013|title=Roundhouse roundup, Feb. 11, 2013|work=Las Cruces Sun-News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203021428/http://www.lcsun-news.com/las_cruces-news/ci_22568975/roundhouse-roundup-feb-11-2013|archivedate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; House Memorial No. 7 was officially received by the U.S. Senate on January 6, 2014, was designated as "POM-175", was referred to the Senate's Committee on the Judiciary, and was published verbatim in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' at page S24.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.congress.gov/crec/2014/01/06/CREC-2014-01-06-pt1-PgS21.pdf#page=4|format=PDF|author=113th Congress, 2nd Session

==State equal rights amendments==
{{Further|State equal rights amendments}}

Twenty-four states have adopted constitutions or constitutional amendments providing that equal rights under the law shall not be denied because of sex. Most of these provisions mirror the broad language of the ERA, while the wording in others resembles the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs7397/m1/1/high_res_d/RS20217_2004Aug23.pdf|title=Equal Rights Amendment: State Provisions|last=Gladstone|first=Leslie|date=August 23, 2004|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1879 [[Constitution of California]] contains the earliest state equal rights provision on record. Narrowly written, it limits the equal rights conferred to "entering or pursuing a business, profession, vocation, or employment". Near the end of the 19th century two more states, Wyoming (1890) and Utah (1896), included equal rights provisions in their constitutions. These provisions were broadly written to ensure political and civil equality between women and men.&lt;ref name="CRSReport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Equal Rights Amendments: State Provisions|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs7397/m1/1/high_res_d/RS20217_2004Aug23.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515010101/http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark%3A/67531/metacrs7397/m1/1/high_res_d/RS20217_2004Aug23.pdf|work=CRS Report for Congress|publisher=Congressional Research Service - The Library of Congress|author=Leslie W. Gladstone|archivedate=May 15, 2015|dead-url=yes|date=August 23, 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several states crafted and adopted their own equal rights amendments during the 1970s and 1980s, while the ERA was before the states, or afterward.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3119">The '''Escuela Superior Latinoamericana de Informática''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Latin American Superior School of Informatics", ESLAI) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] undergraduate school of [[computer science]] established in 1986. Classes were held in a former countryhouse at the Pereyra Iraola Park in [[Buenos Aires Province]], at approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km from [[Buenos Aires]].

The school had Argentine mathematician [[Manuel Sadosky]] among its main founders. In spite of its short life, it had a considerable impact on informatics teaching and research in Argentina and [[South America]]. ESLAI courses were attended by students from several Spanish-speaking countries in South America such as Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. All students had a full scholarship and the admission process was passed by about 15% of applicants. 

The school established cooperation programs with a number of foreign universities in the [[Americas]] as well as in [[Europe]]. Those agreements sponsored important visitors to the school, such as [[Alberto O. Mendelzon]], [[Jean-Raymond Abrial]], Ugo Montanari, [[Carlo Ghezzi]] and Giorgio Ausiello, and enabled its students to attend graduate school at foreign universities.

The school had a remarkable European influence and was oriented towards theoretical aspects of computer science, such as [[typed lambda calculus]], [[formal verification]], and Martin-Löf's [[intuitionistic type theory]].

Unfortunately, the school was never able to develop a relationship with local companies, which in an emergent economy like Argentina's is essential to be involved with more practical problems. Without financial support, ESLAI had to close down in September 1990 during the [[president of Argentina|presidency]] of [[Carlos Menem]].

In [[artificial intelligence]], an '''expert system''' is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert.&lt;ref name="Jackson1998"&gt;{{Citation |title= Introduction To Expert Systems |year= 1998 |publisher= Addison Wesley |edition= 3 |last= Jackson |first= Peter |isbn= 978-0-201-87686-4 |page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by [[automated reasoning|reasoning]] through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as [[Rule-based system|if–then rules]] rather than through conventional [[Procedural programming|procedural code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=conventional+programming&amp;i=40325,00.asp |title=Conventional programming |publisher=Pcmag.com |access-date=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="durkinhistory"&gt;{{cite book |first= Cornelius T. |last= Leondes |title= Expert systems: the technology of knowledge management and decision making for the 21st century |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-12-443880-4 |pages= 1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) software.&lt;ref name="Simon &amp; Schuster"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart|last2=Norvig|first2=Peter|title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|date=1995|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0-13-103805-2|pages=22–23|url=http://stpk.cs.rtu.lv/sites/all/files/stpk/materiali/MI/Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach.pdf|access-date=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=227–331}}{{sfn|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 17.4}}{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=327–335, 434–435}}{{sfn|Crevier|1993|pp=145–62, 197−203}} However, some experts point out that expert systems were not part of true [[artificial intelligence]] since they lack the ability to learn autonomously from external data.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681318301393 Kaplan Andreas and Michael Haenlein (2018) Siri, Siri in my Hand, who's the Fairest in the Land?

An expert system is divided into two subsystems: the [[inference engine]] and the [[knowledge base]]. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrmars.com/admin/pics/261.pdf Nwigbo Stella and Agbo Okechuku Chuks], School of Science Education, Expert system: a catalyst in educational development in Nigeria: "''Knowledge-based systems collect the small fragments of human know-how into a knowledge-base which is used to reason through a problem, using the knowledge that is appropriated''"&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Expert systems were introduced around 1965&lt;ref&gt;[http://biology.kenyon.edu/slonc/bio3/AI/TIMELINE/timeline.html kenyon.edu: AI Timeline], retrieved October 27, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; by the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project led by [[Edward Feigenbaum]], who is sometimes termed the "father of expert systems"; other key early contributors were Bruce Buchanan and Randall Davis. The Stanford researchers tried to identify domains where expertise was highly valued and complex, such as diagnosing infectious diseases ([[Mycin]]) and identifying unknown organic molecules ([[Dendral]]). The idea that "intelligent systems derive their power from the knowledge they possess rather than from the specific formalisms and inference schemes they use"&lt;ref&gt;Edward Feigenbaum, 1977. Paraphrased by Hayes-Roth, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; – as Feigenbaum said – was at the time a significant step forward, since the past research had been focused on heuristic computational methods, culminating in attempts to develop very general-purpose problem solvers (foremostly the conjunct work of [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert_A._Simon|Herbert Simon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|pages=6–7|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas|last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expert systems became some of the first truly successful forms of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) software.&lt;ref name="Simon &amp; Schuster"/&gt;{{sfn|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=227–331}}{{sfn|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 17.4}}{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=327–335, 434–435}}{{sfn|Crevier|1993|pp=145–62, 197−203}}

Research on expert systems was also active in France. While in the US the focus tended to be on rule-based systems, first on systems hard coded on top of [[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]] programming environments and then on expert system shells developed by vendors such as [[IntelliCorp (software)|Intellicorp]], in France research focused more on systems developed in [[Prolog]]. The advantage of expert system shells was that they were somewhat easier for nonprogrammers to use.  The advantage of Prolog environments was that they weren't focused only on ''if-then'' rules; Prolog environments provided a much fuller realization of a complete [[First Order Logic]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;George F. Luger and William A. Stubblefield, Benjamin/Cummings Publishers, Rule Based Expert System Shell: example of code using the Prolog rule based expert system shell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://promethee.philo.ulg.ac.be/engdep1/download/prolog/htm_docs/prolog.htm A. Michiels], Université de Liège, Belgique: "PROLOG, the first declarative language&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, expert systems proliferated.  Universities offered expert system courses and two thirds of the [[Fortune 500]] companies applied the technology in daily business activities.&lt;ref name=durkinhistory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Durkin, J. Expert Systems: Catalog of Applications. Intelligent Computer Systems, Inc., Akron, OH, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was international with the [[Fifth generation computer|Fifth Generation Computer Systems project]] in Japan and increased research funding in Europe.

In 1981, the first [[IBM PC]], with the [[IBM PC DOS|PC DOS]] operating system, was introduced. The imbalance between the high affordability of the relatively powerful chips in the PC, compared to the much more expensive cost of processing power in the mainframes that dominated the corporate IT world at the time, created a new type of architecture for corporate computing, termed the [[client-server model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfali|first=Robert|title=The Essential Client/Server Survival Guide|year=1996|publisher=Wiley Computer Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-471-15325-7|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calculations and reasoning could be performed at a fraction of the price of a mainframe using a PC. This model also enabled business units to bypass corporate IT departments and directly build their own applications. As a result, client server had a tremendous impact on the expert systems market. Expert systems were already outliers in much of the business world, requiring new skills that many IT departments did not have and were not eager to develop. They were a natural fit for new PC-based shells that promised to put application development into the hands of end users and experts. Until then, the main development environment for expert systems had been high end [[Lisp machine]]s from [[Xerox]], [[Symbolics]], and [[Texas Instruments]]. With the rise of the PC and client server computing, vendors such as Intellicorp and Inference Corporation shifted their priorities to developing PC based tools. Also, new vendors, often financed by [[venture capital]] (such as Aion Corporation, [[Neuron Data]], Exsys, and many others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurwitz|first=Judith|title=Smart or Lucky: How Technology Leaders Turn Chance into Success|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Son|isbn=1118033787|page=164|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3KrTQzQHl7AC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=expert+systems+failed+to+live+up+to+hype#v=onepage&amp;q=expert%20systems%20failed%20to%20live%20up%20to%20hype&amp;f=false|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert J. |last=Dunn |date=September 30, 1985 |title=Expandable Expertise for Everyday Users |page=30 |journal=InfoWorld |volume=7 |issue=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iS8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |access-date=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;), started appearing regularly.

The first expert system to be used in a design capacity for a large-scale product was the SID (Synthesis of Integral Design) software program, developed in 1982. Written in [[LISP]], SID generated 93% of the [[VAX 9000]] CPU logic gates.&lt;ref name="SIDDTJ"&gt;Carl S. Gibson, et al, VAX 9000 SERIES, Digital Technical Journal of Digital Equipment Corporation, Volume 2, Number 4, Fall 1990, pp118-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Input to the software was a set of rules created by several expert logic designers. SID expanded the rules and generated software [[logic synthesis]] routines many times the size of the rules themselves. Surprisingly, the combination of these rules resulted in an overall design that exceeded the capabilities of the experts themselves, and in many cases out-performed the human counterparts.  While some rules contradicted others, top-level control parameters for speed and area provided the tie-breaker. The program was highly controversial, but used nevertheless due to project budget constraints. It was terminated by logic designers after the VAX 9000 project completion.

In the 1990s and beyond, the term ''expert system'' and the idea of a standalone AI system mostly dropped from the IT lexicon. There are two interpretations of this. One is that "expert systems failed": the IT world moved on because expert systems didn't deliver on their over hyped promise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0501.htm#w AI Expert Newsletter: W is for Winter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ejlt.org//article/view/14/1 Leith P., "The rise and fall of the legal expert system", in European Journal of Law and Technology, Vol 1, Issue 1, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The other is the mirror opposite, that expert systems were simply victims of their success: as IT professionals grasped concepts such as rule engines, such tools migrated from being standalone tools for developing special purpose ''expert'' systems, to being one of many standard tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haskin|first=David|title=Years After Hype, 'Expert Systems' Paying Off For Some|journal=Datamation|date=January 16, 2003|url=http://www.datamation.com/netsys/article.php/1570851/Years-After-Hype-Expert-Systems-Paying-Off-For-Some.htm|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the leading major business application suite vendors (such as [[SAP (software)|SAP]], [[Siebel Systems|Siebel]], and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]) integrated expert system abilities into their suite of products as a way of specifying business logic – rule engines are no longer simply for defining the rules an expert would use but for any type of complex, volatile, and critical business logic; they often go hand in hand with business process automation and integration environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SAP News Desk|title=SAP News Desk IntelliCorp Announces Participation in SAP EcoHub|url=http://laszlo.sys-con.com/node/946452|work=laszlo.sys-con.com |publisher=LaszloTrack|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pegasystems|title=Smart BPM Requires Smart Business Rules|url=http://www.pega.com/business-rules |work=pega.com|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Zhao |first=Kai |first2=Shi |last2=Ying |first3=Linlin |last3=Zhang |first4=Luokai |last4=Hu |title=Achieving business process and business rules integration using SPL |book-title=Future Information Technology and Management Engineering (FITME) |date=9–10 Oct 2010 |volume=2 |pages=329–332 |location=Changzhou, China |publisher=IEEE |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5656297&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5656297 |doi=10.1109/fitme.2010.5656297 |isbn=978-1-4244-9087-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software architecture ==
An expert system is an example of a [[knowledge-based system]]. Expert systems were the first commercial systems to use a knowledge-based architecture. A knowledge-based system is essentially composed of two sub-systems: the [[knowledge base]] and the [[inference engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Reid |title=Knowledge-Based Systems Concepts, Techniques, Examples |url=http://www.reidgsmith.com/Knowledge-Based_Systems_-_Concepts_Techniques_Examples_08-May-1985.pdf |website=Reid G. Smith |access-date=9 November 2013|date=May 8, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The knowledge base represents facts about the world. In early expert systems such as Mycin and Dendral, these facts were represented mainly as flat assertions about variables. In later expert systems developed with commercial shells, the knowledge base took on more structure and used concepts from object-oriented programming. The world was represented as classes, subclasses, and instances and assertions were replaced by values of object instances. The rules worked by querying and asserting values of the objects.

The inference engine is an [[automated reasoning system]] that evaluates the current state of the knowledge-base, applies relevant rules, and then asserts new knowledge into the knowledge base. The inference engine may also include abilities for explanation, so that it can explain to a user the chain of reasoning used to arrive at a particular conclusion by tracing back over the firing of rules that resulted in the assertion.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Roth 1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas|last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are mainly two modes for an inference engine: [[forward chaining]] and [[backward chaining]]. The different approaches are dictated by whether the inference engine is being driven by the antecedent (left hand side) or the consequent (right hand side) of the rule. In forward chaining an antecedent fires and asserts the consequent. For example, consider the following rule:

&lt;math&gt;R1: \mathit{Man}(x) \implies \mathit{Mortal}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

A simple example of forward chaining would be to assert Man(Socrates) to the system and then trigger the inference engine. It would match R1 and assert Mortal(Socrates) into the knowledge base.

Backward chaining is a bit less straight forward. In backward chaining the system looks at possible conclusions and works backward to see if they might be true. So if the system was trying to determine if Mortal(Socrates) is true it would find R1 and query the knowledge base to see if Man(Socrates) is true. One of the early innovations of expert systems shells was to integrate inference engines with a user interface. This could be especially powerful with backward chaining. If the system needs to know a particular fact but doesn't, then it can simply generate an input screen and ask the user if the information is known. So in this example, it could use R1 to ask the user if Socrates was a Man and then use that new information accordingly.

The use of rules to explicitly represent knowledge also enabled explanation abilities. In the simple example above if the system had used R1 to assert that Socrates was Mortal and a user wished to understand why Socrates was mortal they could query the system and the system would look back at the rules which fired to cause the assertion and present those rules to the user as an explanation. In English if the user asked "Why is Socrates Mortal?" the system would reply "Because all men are mortal and Socrates is a man".  A significant area for research was the generation of explanations from the knowledge base in natural English rather than simply by showing the more formal but less intuitive rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccis2k.org/iajit/PDF/vol.4,no.1/9-Nabil.pdf Nabil Arman], Polytechnic University of Palestine, January 2007, Fault Detection in Dynamic Rule Bases Using Spanning Trees and Disjoin Sets: ""&lt;/ref&gt;

As expert systems evolved, many new techniques were incorporated into various types of inference engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mettrey|first=William|title=An Assessment of Tools for Building Large Knowledge-Based Systems|journal=AI Magazine|year=1987|volume= 8 |issue= 4|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewArticle/625}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most important of these were:

* Truth maintenance. These systems record the dependencies in a knowledge-base so that when facts are altered, dependent knowledge can be altered accordingly. For example, if the system learns that Socrates is no longer known to be a man it will revoke the assertion that Socrates is mortal.
* Hypothetical reasoning. In this, the knowledge base can be divided up into many possible views, a.k.a. worlds. This allows the inference engine to explore multiple possibilities in parallel. For example, the system may want to explore the consequences of both assertions, what will be true if Socrates is a Man and what will be true if he is not?
* Fuzzy logic. One of the first extensions of simply using rules to represent knowledge was also to associate a probability with each rule. So, not to assert that Socrates is mortal, but to assert Socrates ''may'' be mortal with some probability value. Simple probabilities were extended in some systems with sophisticated mechanisms for uncertain reasoning and combination of probabilities.
* Ontology classification. With the addition of object classes to the knowledge base, a new type of reasoning was possible. Along with reasoning simply about object values, the system could also reason about object structures. In this simple example, Man can represent an object class and R1 can be redefined as a rule that defines the class of all men.  These types of special purpose inference engines are termed [[Deductive classifier|classifiers]]. Although they were not highly used in expert systems, classifiers are very powerful for unstructured volatile domains, and are a key technology for the Internet and the emerging [[Semantic Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=Robert|title=Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation|journal=IEEE Expert|date=June 1991|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=87683&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D87683|access-date=10 November 2013|doi=10.1109/64.87683|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|first2=James|last2=Hendler|first3=Ora|last3=Lassila|title=The Semantic Web A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities|journal=Scientific American|date=May 17, 2001|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34|volume=284|pages=34–43|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|archivedate=April 24, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages  ==
The goal of knowledge-based systems is to make the critical information required for the system to work explicit rather than implicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|page=6|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas|last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a traditional computer program the logic is embedded in code that can typically only be reviewed by an IT specialist. With an expert system the goal was to specify the rules in a format that was intuitive and easily understood, reviewed, and even edited by domain experts rather than IT experts. The benefits of this explicit knowledge representation were rapid development and ease of maintenance.

Ease of maintenance is the most obvious benefit. This was achieved in two ways. First, by removing the need to write conventional code, many of the normal problems that can be caused by even small changes to a system could be avoided with expert systems.  Essentially, the logical flow of the program (at least at the highest level) was simply a given for the system, simply invoke the inference engine. This also was a reason for the second benefit: [[rapid prototyping]]. With an expert system shell it was possible to enter a few rules and have a prototype developed in days rather than the months or year typically associated with complex IT projects.

A claim for expert system shells that was often made was that they removed the need for trained programmers and that experts could develop systems themselves. In reality, this was seldom if ever true. While the rules for an expert system were more comprehensible than typical computer code, they still had a formal syntax where a misplaced comma or other character could cause havoc as with any other computer language. Also, as expert systems moved from prototypes in the lab to deployment in the business world, issues of integration and maintenance became far more critical. Inevitably demands to integrate with, and take advantage of, large legacy databases and systems arose. To accomplish this, integration required the same skills as any other type of system.&lt;ref name="Wong 1995 141–152"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Bo K.|first2=John A.|last3=Monaco|title=Expert system applications in business: a review and analysis of the literature|journal=Information and Management|date=September 1995|volume=29|issue=3|pages=141–152|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=218565&amp;CFID=383824649&amp;CFTOKEN=44575196|access-date=29 November 2013|doi=10.1016/0378-7206(95)00023-p|last2=Monaco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
The most common disadvantage cited for expert systems in the academic literature is the [[knowledge acquisition]] problem. Obtaining the time of domain experts for any software application is always difficult, but for expert systems it was especially difficult because the experts were by definition highly valued and in constant demand by the organization. As a result of this problem, a great deal of research in the later years of expert systems was focused on tools for knowledge acquisition, to help automate the process of designing, debugging, and maintaining rules defined by experts. However, when looking at the life-cycle of expert systems in actual use, other problems – essentially the same problems as those of any other large system – seem at least as critical as knowledge acquisition: integration, access to large databases, and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Performance could be especially problematic because early expert systems were built using tools (such as earlier Lisp versions) that interpreted code expressions without first compiling them. This provided a powerful development environment, but with the drawback that it was virtually impossible to match the efficiency of the fastest compiled languages (such as [[C (programming language)|C]]). System and database integration were difficult for early expert systems because the tools were mostly in languages and platforms that were neither familiar to nor welcome in most corporate IT environments – programming languages such as Lisp and Prolog, and hardware platforms such as [[Lisp machine]]s and personal computers. As a result, much effort in the later stages of expert system tool development was focused on integrating with legacy environments such as [[COBOL]] and large database systems, and on porting to more standard platforms. These issues were resolved mainly by the client-server paradigm shift, as PCs were gradually accepted in the IT environment as a legitimate platform for serious business system development and as affordable [[minicomputer]] servers provided the processing power needed for AI applications.&lt;ref name="Wong 1995 141–152"/&gt;

== Applications ==
Hayes-Roth divides expert systems applications into 10 categories illustrated in the following table. The example applications were not in the original Hayes-Roth table, and some of them arose well afterward. Any application that is not footnoted is described in the Hayes-Roth book.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Roth 1983"/&gt; Also, while these categories provide an intuitive framework to describe the space of expert systems applications, they are not rigid categories, and in some cases an application may show traits of more than one category.

Hearsay was an early attempt at solving voice recognition through an expert systems approach. For the most part this category or expert systems was not all that successful. Hearsay and all interpretation systems are essentially pattern recognition systems—looking for patterns in noisy data. In the case of Hearsay recognizing phonemes in an audio stream. Other early examples were analyzing sonar data to detect Russian submarines. These kinds of systems proved much more amenable to a [[artificial neural network|neural network]] AI solution than a rule-based approach.

CADUCEUS and [[MYCIN]] were medical diagnosis systems. The user describes their symptoms to the computer as they would to a doctor and the computer returns a medical diagnosis.

Dendral was a tool to study hypothesis formation in the identification of organic molecules. The general problem it solved—designing a solution given a set of constraints—was one of the most successful areas for early expert systems applied to business domains such as salespeople configuring [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) [[VAX]] computers and mortgage loan application development.

[[File:Fan-Coil Unit.jpg|thumb|Fan-Coil Unit]]
[[Image:Fancoil 1.jpg|250px|right]]
[[Image:Fancoil 2.jpg|250px|right]]
A '''fan coil unit''' (FCU) is a simple device consisting of a heating and/or cooling [[heat exchanger]] or 'coil' and [[Fan (mechanical)|fan]]. It is part of an [[HVAC]] system found in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. A fan coil unit is a diverse device sometimes using [[Duct (HVAC)|ductwork]], and is used to control the temperature in the space where it is installed, or serve multiple spaces. It is controlled either by a manual on/off switch or by a [[thermostat]], which controls the throughput of water to the heat exchanger using a [[Control valves|control valve]] and/or the fan speed.

Due to their simplicity and flexibility, fan coil units can be more economical to install than ducted [[Variable air volume|100% fresh air systems (VAV)]] or central heating systems with [[air handling unit]]s or [[Chilled beam|chilled beams]]. Various unit configurations are available, including horizontal (ceiling mounted) or vertical (floor mounted).

Noise output from FCUs, like any other form of air conditioning, is principally due to the design of the unit and the building materials around it. Some offer noise levels as low as [http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/nr-noise-rating-d_60.html NR25] or [http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/nc-noise-criterion-d_725.html NC25]

The output from an FCU can be established by looking at the temperature of the air entering the unit and the temperature of the air leaving the unit, coupled with the volume of air being moved through the unit. This is a simplistic statement, and there is further reading on [http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/shr-sensible-heat-ratio-d_700.html sensible heat ratios] and the specific [[heat capacity]] of air, both of which have an effect on thermal performance..

==Design and operation==
''Fan Coil Unit'' covers a range of products and will mean different things to users, specifiers, and installers in different countries and regions, particularly in relation to product size and output capability.

Fan Coil Unit falls principally into two main types: blow through and draw through. As the names suggest, in the first type the fans are fitted such that they blow through the heat exchanger, and in the other type the fans are fitted after the coil such that they draw air through it. Draw through units are considered thermally superior, as ordinarily they make better use of the heat exchanger. However they are more expensive, as they require a chassis to hold the fans whereas a blow-through unit typically consists of a set of fans bolted straight to a coil.

A fan coil unit may be concealed or exposed within the room or area that it serves.

An exposed fan coil unit may be wall-mounted, freestanding or ceiling mounted, and will typically include an appropriate enclosure to protect and conceal the fan coil unit itself, with return air [[grille]] and supply air [[diffuser (thermodynamics)|diffuser]] set into that enclosure to distribute the air.

A concealed fan coil unit will typically be installed within an accessible ceiling void or services zone. The return air grille and supply air diffuser, typically set flush into the ceiling, will be ducted to and from the fan coil unit and thus allows a great degree of flexibility for locating the grilles to suit the ceiling layout and/or the partition layout within a space. It is quite common for the return air not to be ducted and to use the ceiling void as a return air plenum.

The coil receives hot or cold water from a central plant, and removes heat from or adds heat to the air through [[heat transfer]]. Traditionally fan coil units can contain their own internal [[thermostat]], or can be wired to operate with a remote thermostat. However, and as is common in most modern buildings with a [[Building Management System|Building Energy Management System]] (BEMS), the control of the fan coil unit will be by a local digital controller or outstation (along with associated room temperature sensor and control valve actuators) linked to the BEMS via a communication network, and therefore adjustable and controllable from a central point, such as a supervisors head end computer.

Fan coil units circulate hot or cold water through a coil in order to condition a space. The unit gets its hot or cold water from a central plant, or [[mechanical room]] containing equipment for removing heat from the central building's closed-loop. The equipment used can consist of machines used to remove heat such as a [[chiller]] or a [[cooling tower]] and equipment for adding heat to the building's water such as a [[boiler]] or a commercial [[water heater]].

Fan coil units are divided into two types: Two-pipe fan coil units or four-pipe fan coil units. Two-pipe fan coil units have one (1) supply and one (1) return pipe. The supply pipe supplies either cold or hot water to the unit depending on the time of year. Four-pipe fan coil units have two (2) supply pipes and two (2) return pipes. This allows either hot or cold water to enter the unit at any given time. Since it is often necessary to heat and cool different areas of a building at the same time, due to differences in internal heat loss or heat gains, the four-pipe fan coil unit is most commonly used.

Fan coil units may be connected to piping networks using various topology designs, such as "direct return", "reverse return", or "series decoupled".  See ASHRAE Handbook "2008 Systems &amp; Equipment", Chapter 12. 

Depending upon the selected chilled water temperatures and the relative humidity of the space, it is likely that the cooling coil will dehumidify the entering air stream, and as a by product of this process, it will at times produce a condensate which will need to be carried to drain. The fan coil unit will contain a purpose designed drip tray with drain connection for this purpose. The simplest means to drain the condensate from multiple fan coil units will be by a network of pipework laid to falls to a suitable point. Alternatively a condensate pump may be employed where space for such gravity pipework is limited.

Speed control of the fan motors within a fan coil unit is partly used to control the heating and cooling output desired from the unit. Some manufacturers accomplish speed control by adjusting the taps on an AC transformer supplying the power to the fan motor. Typically this would require adjustment at the commissioning stage of the building construction process and is therefore set for life at a fixed speed. Other manufacturers provide custom-wound Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) motors with speed taps in the windings, set to the desired speed levels for the fan coil unit design. A simple speed selector switch (Off-High-Medium-Low) is provided for the local room occupant to control the fan speed. Typically this speed selector switch is integral to the room thermostat, and is set manually or is controlled automatically by the digital room thermostat.  Building Energy Management Systems can be used for automatic fan speed and temperature control. Fan motors are typically AC Shaded Pole or Permanent Split Capacitor.  More recent developments include brushless DC designs with electronic commutation. Compared to units with asynchronous 3-speed motors, the fan coil units with brushless motors will reduce the power consumption up to 70%.[http://heinenhopman.com/en/merchant/fan-coil-unit/]

==DC/EC motor powered units==
These motors are sometimes called DC motors, sometimes called [[Brushless DC electric motor|EC motors]] and occasionally [[Brushless DC electric motor|EC/DC motors]]. DC stands for Direct Current and EC stands for Electronically Commutated.

[[DC motor]]s allow the speed of the fans within a Fan Coil Unit to be controlled by means of a 0-10 Volt input 'Signal' to the motor/s, the transformers and speed switches associated with AC Fan Coils are not required. Up to a signal voltage of 2.5 Volts (which may vary with different fan/motor manufacturers) the fan will be in a stopped condition but as the signal voltage is increased, the fan will seamlessly increase in speed until the maximum is reached at a signal Voltage of 10 Volts. Fan Coils will generally operate between approximately 4 Volts and 7.5 Volts because below 4 Volts the air volumes are ineffective and above 7.5 Volts the Fan Coil is likely to be too noisy for most commercial applications.

The 0-10 Volt signal voltage can be set via a simple potentiometer and left or the 0-10 Volt signal voltage can be delivered to the fan motors by the terminal controller on each of the Fan Coil Units. The former is very simple and cheap but the latter opens up the opportunity to continuously alter the fan speed depending on various external conditions/influences. These conditions/criteria could be the 'real time' demand for either heating or cooling, occupancy levels, window switches, time clocks or any number of other inputs from either the unit itself, the Building Management System or both. 

The reason that these DC Fan Coil Units are, despite their apparent relative complexity, becoming more popular is their improved energy efficiency levels compared to their AC motor driven counterparts of only a few years ago. A straight swap, AC to DC, will reduce electrical consumption by 50% but applying Demand and Occupancy dependent fan speed control can take the savings to as much as 80%. In areas of the world where there are legally enforceable energy efficiency requirements for Fan Coils (such as the UK), DC Fan Coil Units are rapidly becoming the only choice. 

Examples of EC/DC Fan Coil Units:
*Ability Projects [https://web.archive.org/web/20110907151111/http://www.abilityprojects.com/products/]

==Areas of use==
[[Image:Fan coil 1.jpg|200px|left]]
[[Image:Fan coil 2.jpg|200px|left]]In high-rise buildings, fan coils may be vertically stacked, located one above the other from floor to floor and all interconnected by the same piping loop.

Fan coil units are an excellent delivery mechanism for hydronic [[chiller boiler|chiller boiler systems]] in large residential and light commercial applications.  In these applications the fan coil units are mounted in bathroom ceilings and can be used to provide unlimited comfort zones - with the ability to turn off unused areas of the structure to save energy.

==Installation==
In high-rise residential construction, typically each fan coil unit requires a rectangular through-penetration in the [[concrete]] slab on top of which it sits. Usually, there are either 2 or 4 pipes made of ABS, steel or copper that go through the floor. The pipes are usually insulated with refrigeration insulation, such as acrylonitrile butadiene/polyvinyl chloride (AB/PVC) flexible foam (Rubatex or Armaflex brands) on all pipes, or at least on the chilled water lines to prevent condensate from forming.

==Unit ventilator==
A unit ventilator is a fan coil unit that is used mainly in classrooms, hotels, apartments and condominium applications. A unit ventilator can be a wall mounted or ceiling hung cabinet, and is designed to use a [[Fan (mechanical)|fan]] to blow outside air across a coil, thus conditioning and ventilating the space which it is serving.

==European market==
The Fan Coil is composed of one quarter of 2-pipe-units and three quarters of 4-pipe-units, and the most sold products are "with casing" (35%), "without casing" (28%), "cassette" (18%) and "ducted" (16%).&lt;ref&gt;Eurovent Market Intelligence https://www.eurovent-marketintelligence.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bufo periglenes2.jpg|thumb|Male [[golden toad]]]]

''Herpetology'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἑρπετόν ''herpetón'', meaning "reptile" or "creeping animal") is the branch of [[zoology]] concerned with the study of [[amphibian]]s (including [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[newt]]s, and caecilians ([[gymnophiona]])) and [[reptile]]s (including [[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[amphisbaenia|amphisbaenids]], [[turtle]]s, [[terrapin]]s, [[tortoise]]s, [[crocodilia]]ns, and the [[tuatara]]s).  

Herpetology is concerned with [[poikilothermic]], [[ectothermic]] [[tetrapod]]s. Under this definition "herps" (or sometimes "herptiles" or "herpetofauna") exclude fish, but it is not uncommon for herpetological and [[ichthyology|ichthyological]] scientific societies to "team up", publishing joint journals and holding conferences in order to foster the exchange of ideas between the fields, as the [[American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists]] does. Many [[Herpetological_society|herpetological societies]] have been formed to promote interest in reptiles and amphibians, both captive and wild.

Herpetology offers benefits to humanity in the study of the role of amphibians and reptiles in [[ecology|global ecology]], especially because amphibians are often very sensitive to environmental changes, offering a visible warning to humans that significant changes are taking place. Some toxins and venoms produced by reptiles and amphibians are useful in human medicine. Currently, some snake venom has been used to create [[anti-coagulants]] that work to treat strokes and heart attacks.

==Etymology==
The word "herpetology" is from [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]]: ἑρπετόν, ''herpeton'', "creeping animal" and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'', "knowledge". People with an avid interest in herpetology and who keep different reptiles or amphibians often refer to themselves as "herpers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/herpers/profile |title=herpers&amp;nbsp;— Community Profile |publisher=Community.livejournal.com |date=2001-06-09 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020120358/http://community.livejournal.com/herpers/profile |archivedate=2008-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Herp" is a vernacular term for non-avian [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s. It is derived from the old term "herpetile", with roots back to [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus's]] classification of animals, in which he grouped reptiles and amphibians together in the same class. There are over 6700 [[species]] of amphibians&lt;ref name="AmphibiaWeb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/ |title=AmphibiaWeb |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 9000 species of reptiles.&lt;ref name="ReptileSpecies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reptile-database.org/db-info/SpeciesStat.html |title=Species Statistics February 2012 |publisher=Reptile-database.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of its modern taxonomic irrelevance, the term has persisted, particularly in the names of herpetology, the scientific study of non-avian reptiles and amphibians, and [[herpetoculture]], the captive care and breeding of reptiles and amphibians.

==Subfields==
The field of herpetology contains specialists in particular groups of reptiles and/or amphibians.
*'''[[Batrachology]]''', the study of amphibians in particular (a somewhat outdated term, as reptiles and amphibians are commonly studied together, yet is used by some French authors)&lt;ref name="Wareham2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.C.

*'''Ophiology''' (or Ophidiology), the study of snakes.
*'''Saurology''', the study of lizards.
*'''[[Cheloniology]]''' (also chelonology or '''testudinology'''), the study of turtles and tortoises.

==Careers==
Career options in the field of herpetology include, but are not limited to lab research, field studies and survey, zoological staff, museum staff and college teaching.

In modern academic science, it is rare for individuals to consider themselves a herpetologist first and foremost. Most individuals focus on a particular field such as [[ecology]], [[evolution]], [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[physiology]], or [[molecular biology]], and within that field ask questions pertaining to or best answered by examining reptiles and amphibians. For example, an evolutionary biologist who is also a herpetologist may choose to work on an issue such as the evolution of warning coloration in [[coral snake]]s.

Modern herpetological writers include [[Mark O'Shea (herpetologist)|Mark O'Shea]] and [[Philip A. Purser|Philip Purser]]. Modern herpetological showmen include [[Jeff Corwin]], [[Steve Irwin]], popularly known as the "Crocodile Hunter", and the star [[Austin Stevens]], popularly known as "AustinSnakeman" in the TV series ''[[Austin Stevens: Snakemaster]]''.

==Study==
Most colleges or universities do not offer a major in herpetology at the [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] or even the [[graduate school|graduate level]]. Instead, persons interested in herpetology select a major in the [[biology|biological sciences]]. The knowledge learned about all aspects of the biology of animals is then applied to an individual study of herpetology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10950">The term '''high-κ dielectric''' refers to a material with a high [[dielectric constant]] κ (as compared to [[silicon dioxide]]).  High-κ dielectrics are used in [[semiconductor manufacturing]] processes where they are usually used to replace a silicon dioxide [[gate oxide|gate dielectric]] or another dielectric layer of a device.  The implementation of high-κ gate dielectrics is one of several strategies developed to allow further miniaturization of microelectronic components, colloquially referred to as extending [[Moore's Law]].

Sometimes these materials are called "high-k" instead of "high-κ" (high [[kappa]]).

==Need for high-κ materials==

Silicon dioxide (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has been used as a gate oxide material for decades.  As transistors have decreased in size, the thickness of the silicon dioxide gate dielectric has steadily decreased to increase the gate capacitance and thereby drive current, raising device performance. As the thickness scales below 2 [[Nanometer|nm]], leakage currents due to [[Quantum tunneling|tunneling]] increase drastically, leading to high power consumption and reduced device reliability.  Replacing the silicon dioxide gate dielectric with a high-κ material allows increased gate capacitance without the associated leakage effects.

===First principles===

The gate oxide in a [[MOSFET]] can be modeled as a parallel plate capacitor.  Ignoring quantum mechanical and depletion effects from the [[silicon|Si]] substrate and gate, the [[capacitance]] ''C'' of this parallel plate [[capacitor]] is given by
: &lt;math&gt;C=\frac{\kappa\varepsilon_{0}A}{t} &lt;/math&gt;
[[File:High-k.svg|right|thumbnail|upright=1.4|Conventional silicon dioxide gate dielectric structure compared to a potential high-k dielectric structure where κ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;16]] 
[[File:FET cross section.png|thumbnail|upright=1.4|Cross-section of an n-channel [[MOSFET]] transistor showing the gate oxide dielectric]]

Where

*''A'' is the capacitor area
*κ is the [[dielectric constant|relative dielectric constant]] of the material (3.9 for [[silicon dioxide]])
*ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Vacuum permittivity|permittivity of free space]]
*''t'' is the thickness of the capacitor oxide insulator

Since leakage limitation constrains further reduction of ''t'', an alternative method to increase gate capacitance is alter κ by replacing silicon dioxide with a high-κ material. In such a scenario, a thicker gate oxide layer might be used which can reduce the [[subthreshold leakage|leakage current]] flowing through the structure as well as improving the gate dielectric [[Reliability engineering|reliability]].

===Gate capacitance impact on drive current===
The drain current ''I&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a [[MOSFET]] can be written (using the gradual channel approximation) as
 
:&lt;math&gt;I_{D,Sat} = \frac{W}{L} \mu\, C_{inv}\frac{(V_{G}-V_{th})^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
*''W'' is the width of the transistor channel
*''L'' is the channel length
*μ is the channel carrier mobility (assumed constant here)
*''C&lt;sub&gt;inv&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the capacitance density associated with the gate dielectric when the underlying channel is in the inverted state
*''V&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the voltage applied to the transistor gate
*''V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[threshold voltage]]

The term ''V&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; − V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;'' is limited in range due to reliability and room temperature operation constraints, since a too large ''V&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' would create an undesirable, high electric field across the oxide. Furthermore, ''V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;'' cannot easily be reduced below about 200 mV, because leakage currents due to increased oxide leakage (that is, assuming high-κ dielectrics are not available) and [[subthreshold conduction]] raise stand-by power consumption to unacceptable levels. (See the industry roadmap,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itrs.net/Links/2006Update/FinalToPost/04_PIDS2006Update.pdf |work=International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors: 2006 Update |title=Process Integration, Devices, and Structures |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025913/http://www.itrs.net/Links/2006Update/FinalToPost/04_PIDS2006Update.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which limits threshold to 200 mV, and Roy ''et al.'' &lt;ref name=Roy&gt;

==Materials and considerations==
Replacing the silicon dioxide gate dielectric with another material adds complexity to the manufacturing process.  Silicon dioxide can be formed by [[thermal oxidation|oxidizing]] the underlying silicon, ensuring a uniform, conformal oxide and high interface quality.  As a consequence, development efforts have focused on finding a material with a requisitely high dielectric constant that can be easily integrated into a manufacturing process.  Other key considerations include [[electronic band structure|band]] alignment to [[silicon]] (which may alter leakage current), film morphology, thermal stability, maintenance of a high [[electron mobility|mobility]] of charge carriers in the channel and minimization of electrical defects in the film/interface.  Materials which have received considerable attention are [[hafnium silicate]], [[zirconium silicate]], [[hafnium dioxide]] and [[zirconium dioxide]], typically deposited using [[atomic layer deposition]].

It is expected that [[defect states]] in the high-k dielectric can influence its electrical properties. Defect states can be measured for example by using zero-bias thermally stimulated current, zero-temperature-gradient zero-bias thermally stimulated [[dark current spectroscopy|current spectroscopy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.119590|title=Detection of defect states responsible for leakage current in ultrathin tantalum pentoxide (Ta[sub 2]O[sub 5]) films by zero-bias thermally stimulated current spectroscopy|year=1997|last1=Lau|first1=W.

==Use in industry==
The industry has employed [[silicon oxynitride|oxynitride]] gate dielectrics since the 1990s, wherein a conventionally formed silicon oxide dielectric is infused with a small amount of nitrogen.  The nitride content subtly raises the dielectric constant and is thought to offer other advantages, such as resistance against dopant diffusion through the gate dielectric.

In early 2007, [[Intel]] announced the deployment of [[hafnium]]-based high-k dielectrics in conjunction with a metallic gate for components built on [[45 nanometer]] technologies, and has shipped it in the 2007 processor series codenamed [[Penryn (microarchitecture)|Penryn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/technology/architecture-silicon/45nm-core2/index.htm |title=Intel 45nm High-k Silicon Technology Page |publisher=Intel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/oct07/5553 IEEE Spectrum: The High-k Solution]&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, [[IBM]] announced plans to transition to high-k materials, also hafnium-based, for some products in 2008.  While not identified, the most likely dielectric used in such applications are some form of nitrided hafnium silicates (HfSiON). HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HfSiO are susceptible to crystallization during dopant activation annealing. [[NEC]] Electronics has also announced the use of a HfSiON dielectric in their 55&amp;nbsp;nm ''UltimateLowPower'' technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.necel.com/process/en/lowpower_overview.html |title=UltimateLowPower Technology&amp;#124;Advanced Process Technology&amp;#124;Technology&amp;#124;NEC Electronics |publisher=Necel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219033938/http://www.necel.com/process/en/lowpower_overview.html |archivedate=2010-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even HfSiON is susceptible to trap-related leakage currents, which tend to increase with stress over device lifetime. This leakage effect becomes more severe as hafnium concentration increases. There is no guarantee however, that hafnium will serve as a de facto basis for future high-k dielectrics. The 2006 [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors|ITRS]] roadmap predicted the implementation of high-k materials to be commonplace in the industry by 2010.

[[Roller coaster]] amusement rides have origins back to ice slides constructed in 18th-century [[Russia]]. Early technology featured sleds or wheeled carts that were sent down hills of snow reinforced by wooden supports. The technology evolved in the 19th century to feature [[Track (rail transport)|railroad track]] using wheeled cars that were securely locked to the track. Newer innovations emerged in the early 20th century with side friction and underfriction technologies to allow for greater speeds and sharper turns. By the mid-to-late 20th century, these elements intensified with the introduction of steel roller coaster designs and the ability for them to invert riders.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The world's oldest roller coasters descended from the "[[Russian Mountains]]," which were specially constructed hills of snow &lt;ref&gt;Coker, Robert (2002). ''Roller Coasters: A Thrill Seeker's Guide to the Ultimate Scream Machines'', Metrobooks, New York. {{ISBN|1586631721}}. pg 14&lt;/ref&gt; located in the gardens of  palaces around the Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], in the 18th century. This attraction  was called a ''Katalnaya Gorka'' or "sliding mountain" in Russian.  The slides were built to a height of between {{convert|70|ft|m|0}} and {{convert|80|ft|m|0}}, had  a 50 degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports.  Sometimes wheeled carts were used instead of sleds.  These slides became popular with the Russian upper class, and with  [[Catherine II of Russia]] herself, who had such mountains built in the gardens of the [[Oranienbaum Palace]] near St. Petersburg, with a pavilion next to it for drinking tea after the sliding.  "Russian mountains" remains the term for roller coasters in many languages, such as Spanish (''[[:es:Montaña rusa|la montaña rusa]]''), Italian (''[[:it:Montagne russe|montagne russe]]''), and French (''[[:fr:Montagnes russes|les montagnes russes]]''). Ironically, the Russian term for roller coaster, ''[[:ru:американские горки|американские горки]]'' (amerikanskie gorki), translates literally as "American mountains."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rambler.ru/dict/new-enru/00/12/99.shtml  Rambler New English-Russian Dictionary: "American"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Promenades Aeriennes Jardin Baujon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Promenades-Aeriennes in Paris (1817).]]
Russian soldiers occupying Paris from 1815 through 1816, after the defeat of [[Napoleon]] at Waterloo, may have introduced the Russian amusement of sledding down steep hills.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Valérie RANSON-ENGUIALE, « Promenades aériennes », Histoire par l'image [en ligne], consulté le 28 Mai 2017. URL : http://www.histoire-image.org/etudes/promenades-aeriennes &lt;/ref&gt; In July 1817, a French banker named Nicolas Beaujon opened the Parc Beaujon, an amusement park on the [[Champs Elysees]]. Its most famous feature was the ''Promenades Aériennes'' or "Aerial Strolls." &lt;ref&gt;Fierro, Alfred, ''Histoire et Dictionnaire de Paris'', (1996). Robert Laffont, page 1051. &lt;/ref&gt; It featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds. &lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;David Bennett (1998). ''Roller Coaster: Wooden and Steel Coasters, Twisters and Corkscrews''.  Edison, New Jersey: Chartwell Books. 9. {{ISBN|0-7865-0885-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The three-wheel carts were towed to the top of a tower,  and then released to descend two curving tracks on either side.  King [[Louis XVIII of France]] came to see the park, but it is not recorded if he tried the ride. Before long there were seven similar rides in Paris: ''Les Montagnes françaises'' (The French Mountains), ''le Delta'', ''les Montagnes de Belleville'' (The Mountains of Belleville),  ''les Montagnes américaines'' (the American Mountains), ''Les Montages lilliputiennes'', (The miniature mountains), ''Les Montagnes susses'' (The Swiss mountains)  and ''Les Montagnes égyptiennes'' (The Egyptian mountains).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In the beginning, these attractions were primarily for the upper classes. In 1845 a new amusement park opened in Copenhagen, [[Tivoli Gardens|Tivoli]], which was designed for the middle class. These new parks featured roller coasters as permanent attractions. The first permanent loop track was probably also built in Paris from an English design in 1846, with a single-person wheeled sled running through a 13-foot (4 m) diameter vertical loop. These early single loop designs were called Centrifugal Railways.  In 1887, a French entrepreneur, [[Joseph Oller]], the owner of the [[Moulin Rouge]] music  hall,  built ''Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville'' (''The Russian Mountains of Belleville'')  a permanent  roller coaster with a length of two hundred meters in the form of a double-eight, later enlarged to four figure-eight-shaped loops.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Image:Mount Pisgah plane looking up.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Mount Pisgah with the [[Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway]].]]

===Scenic railways===
In the 1850s, a mining company in [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania]], constructed the [[Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway|Mauch Chunk]] [[gravity railroad]], a brakeman-controlled, 8.7-mile (14&amp;nbsp;km) downhill track used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk (now known as [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania|Jim Thorpe]]), [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/coasters/history/start/america.shtml Roller Coaster History: Early Years In America]. Retrieved 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; By 1872, the "Gravity Road" (as it became known) was selling rides to thrill seekers. Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.
[[Image:Thompsons Switchback Railway 1884.jpg|thumb|150px|Thompson's [[Switchback Railway]], 1884.]] 

Using this idea as a basis, [[LaMarcus Adna Thompson]] began work on a gravity [[Switchback Railway]] that opened at [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Sheedy |title= Icons&amp;nbsp;— In the Beginning...

Urbanowicz (2002). ''The Roller Coaster Lover's Companion''.  Kensington, New York: Citadel Press. 4. {{ISBN|0-8065-2309-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, Phillip Hinkle introduced the first complete-circuit coaster with a [[lift hill]], the ''Gravity Pleasure Road'', which became the most popular attraction at Coney Island.&lt;ref name="Urbanowicz"/&gt; Not to be outdone, in 1886 LaMarcus Adna Thompson patented his design for a roller coaster that included dark tunnels with painted scenery. "Scenic Railways" were soon found in amusement parks across the county,&lt;ref name="Urbanowicz"/&gt; with [[Frederick Ingersoll]]'s construction company building many of them in the first two decades of the 20th century.

===Growing popularity and innovations===
[[File:Coneyisland1906.jpg|thumb|[[Loop the Loop (Coney Island)|Loop the Loop]], an early looping roller coaster at Coney Island, 1906]]
As it grew in popularity, experimentation in coaster dynamics took off. In the 1880s the concept of a vertical loop was again explored by [[Lina Beecher]], and in 1895 the concept came into fruition with the ''[[Flip Flap Railway]]'', located at [[Sea Lion Park]] in Brooklyn, and shortly afterward with ''[[Loop the Loop (Olentangy Park)|Loop the Loop]]'' at [[Olentangy Park]] near [[Columbus, Ohio]] as well as similar coasters in [[Loop the Loop (Young's Million Dollar Pier)|Atlantic City]] and [[Loop the Loop (Coney Island)|Coney Island]]. The rides were incredibly dangerous, and many passengers suffered [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]]. Both were soon dismantled, and looping coasters had to wait for over a half century before making a reappearance.

By 1919, the first [[underfriction]] roller coaster had been developed by [[John Miller (entrepreneur)|John Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01319888&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page|title=Patent Images|website=patimg2.uspto.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, roller coasters spread to amusement parks all around the world. Perhaps the best known historical roller coaster, ''[[Coney Island Cyclone|The Cyclone]]'', was opened at [[Coney Island]] in 1927. Like ''The Cyclone'', all early roller coasters were made of wood. Many old [[wooden roller coaster]]s are still operational, at parks such as [[Kennywood]] near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and [[Pleasure Beach Blackpool]], England. The oldest operating roller coaster is ''[[Leap-The-Dips]]'' at [[Lakemont Park]] in Pennsylvania, a [[side friction roller coaster]] built in 1902. The oldest wooden roller coaster in the [[United Kingdom]] is the ''Scenic Railway'' at [[Dreamland Margate|Dreamland]] Amusement Park in [[Margate]], [[Kent]] and features a system where the brakeman rides the car with wheels. It was severely damaged by fire on April 7, 2008, but was subsequently restored and reopened to the public in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7335519.stm Retrieved on 8th April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scenic Railway'' at [[Melbourne's Luna Park]] built in 1912, is the world's oldest continually-operating roller coaster, and it also still features a system where the brakeman rides the car with wheels. One of only 13 remaining examples of John Miller's work worldwide is the wooden roller coaster at Lagoon in Utah.  The coaster opened in 1921 and is the 6th oldest coaster in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aceonline.org/CoasterAwards/details.aspx?id=46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression marked the end of the golden age of roller coasters, as amusement parks generally went into a decline that resulted in less demand for new coasters. This lasted until 1972, when ''[[Racer (Kings Island)|The Racer]]'' opened at [[Kings Island]] amusement park located in what was then a part of [[Deerfield Township, Warren County, Ohio|Deerfield Township]] in [[Warren County, Ohio]]. Designed by [[John C. Allen]], the instant success of ''The Racer'' helped to ignite a renaissance for roller coasters, reviving worldwide interest throughout the industry.

===The rise of steel===
[[Image:MatterhornBobsled2000 wb.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Matterhorn Bobsleds]], the world's first tubular [[steel roller coaster]].]]
In 1959, the [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] theme park introduced a new design breakthrough in roller coasters with the ''[[Matterhorn Bobsleds]]''. This was the first roller coaster to use a tubular [[Steel roller coaster|steel track]]. Unlike conventional wooden rails, which are generally formed using steel strips mounted on laminated wood, tubular steel can be bent in any direction, which allows designers to incorporate loops, corkscrews, and many other maneuvers into their designs. Most modern roller coasters are made of steel, although wooden roller coasters are still being built along with hybrids of steel and wood.

In 1975 the first modern-day roller coaster to perform an inverting element opened: [[Corkscrew (Silverwood)|Corkscrew]], located at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in [[Buena Park, California|Buena Park]], [[California]]. In 1976 the vertical loop made a permanent comeback with the [[The New Revolution (roller coaster)|Great American Revolution]] at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]] in [[Valencia, California|Valencia]], California.

[[File:Cribbing.jpg|thumb|A house raised and held on box cribs during foundation work]]
'''House raising''' (house lifting, house jacking, barn jacking, building jacking) is the process of separating a building from its [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] and temporarily raising it with hydraulic  screw [[Jack (device)|jacks]]. The process is the first step in [[structure relocation]] in which the building is moved to a different location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nachi.org/house-raising.htm House Raising], [[International Association of Certified Home Inspectors]]&lt;/ref&gt; House raising may also be a part of a [[renovation]] to build a foundation under an existing house or make a house larger by building a new floor level creating a two story house. Often employed in areas that are prone to flooding and storm damage, this process can be achieved through the use of either timber piles or helical piles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.myfoundationsolutions.com/disaster-recovery/|title = House Raising Solutions by My Foundation Solutions|website = www.myfoundationsolutions.com|access-date = 2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a house is raised and supported on [[Box crib|cribbing]], a new foundation can be constructed beneath it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/pdf/rebuild/mat/sec5.pdf Elevating Your House - Federal Emergency Management Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Sandy]] large numbers of houses in parts of Louisiana, New York and New Jersey were raised to avoid future flooding.

Other house raising technologies include the Atlas House Lifting System which is emerging as an alternative to traditional jacking and shoring methods. Utilizing an electromechanical jacking mechanism, the engineered system offers clear span maneuvering beneath lifted structures.

Jacking and [[shoring]], such as using [[jack post]]s, are used to hold a wooden building up during foundation and [[Sill plate|sill]] repairs.

Little published information is available about building jacking methods. The skills are usually acquired through experience working for a building jacking or moving company.

'''Hydraulic engineering''' as a sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]] is concerned with the flow and conveyance of [[fluid]]s, principally [[water]] and sewage. One feature of these systems is the extensive use of gravity as the motive force to cause the movement of the fluids. This area of civil engineering is intimately related to the design of [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s, [[canal]]s, and [[levee]]s, and to both sanitary and [[environmental engineering]].

Hydraulic engineering is the application of the principles of fluid mechanics to problems dealing with the collection, storage, control, transport, regulation, measurement, and use of water.&lt;ref name="Prasuhn, Alan L. 1987"&gt;Prasuhn, Alan L. ''Fundamentals of Hydraulic Engineering''. Holt, Rinehart, and Winston: New York, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Before beginning a hydraulic engineering project, one must figure out how much water is involved. The hydraulic engineer is concerned with the transport of sediment by the river, the interaction of the water with its alluvial boundary, and the occurrence of scour and deposition.&lt;ref name="Prasuhn, Alan L. 1987"/&gt;  "The hydraulic engineer actually develops conceptual  designs for the various features which interact with water such as spillways and outlet works for dams, culverts for highways, canals and related structures for irrigation projects,  and cooling-water facilities for [[thermal power plant]]s."  &lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, John J., Chaudhry, M. Hanif, and Roberson, John A. "Hydraulic Engineering", John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental principles==

A few examples of the fundamental principles of hydraulic engineering include [[fluid mechanics]], [[fluid]] flow, behavior of real fluids, [[hydrology]], pipelines, open channel hydraulics, mechanics of [[sediment]] transport, physical modeling, hydraulic machines, and drainage hydraulics.

=== Fluid mechanics ===

''Fundamentals of Hydraulic Engineering'' defines hydrostatics as the study of fluids at rest.&lt;ref name="Prasuhn, Alan L. 1987"/&gt; In a fluid at rest, there exists a force, known as pressure, that acts upon the fluid's surroundings. This pressure, measured in N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is not constant throughout the body of fluid. Pressure, p, in a given body of fluid, increases with an increase in depth. Where the upward force on a body acts on the base and can be found by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;p=\rho gy&lt;/math&gt;

where, 
:''&amp;rho;'' = density of water
:''g'' = specific gravity
:''y'' = depth of the body of liquid

Rearranging this equation gives you the [[pressure head]] ''p/&amp;rho;g'' = ''y''. Four basic devices for [[pressure measurement]] are a [[piezometer]], [[manometer]], differential manometer, [[Bourdon gauge]], as well as an inclined manometer.&lt;ref name="Prasuhn, Alan L. 1987"/&gt;

As Prasuhn states:&lt;br /&gt;
:On undisturbed submerged bodies, pressure acts along all surfaces of a body in a liquid, causing equal perpendicular forces in the body to act against the pressure of the liquid. This reaction is known as equilibrium. More advanced applications of pressure are that on plane surfaces, curved surfaces, dams, and quadrant gates, just to name a few.&lt;ref name="Prasuhn, Alan L. 1987"/&gt;

=== Behavior of real fluids ===

==== Real and ideal fluids ====

The main difference between an ideal fluid and a real fluid is that for ideal flow ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and for real flow ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Ideal fluid is incompressible and has no viscosity. Real fluid has viscosity. Ideal fluid is only an imaginary fluid as all fluids that exist have some viscosity.

==== Viscous flow ====

A viscous fluid will deform continuously under to  a shear force by the pascles law, whereas an ideal fluid doesn't deform.

==== Laminar flow and turbulence ====

The various effects of disturbance on a viscous flow are stable, transition and unstable.

==== Bernoulli's equation ====

For an ideal fluid, [[Bernoulli's equation]] holds along streamlines.

''p/&amp;rho;g'' + ''u''²/2''g'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''&amp;rho;g'' + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;²/2''g'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ρ''g'' + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;²/2''g''

==== Boundary layer ====

Assuming a flow is bounded on one side only, and that a rectilinear flow passing over a stationary flat plate which lies parallel to the flow, the flow just upstream of the plate has a uniform velocity. As the flow comes into contact with the plate, the layer of fluid actually 'adheres' to a solid surface. There is then a considerable shearing action between the layer of fluid on the plate surface and the second layer of fluid. The second layer is therefore forced to decelerate (though it is not quite brought to rest), creating a shearing action with the third layer of fluid, and so on. As the fluid passes further along the plate, the zone in which shearing action occurs tends to spread further outwards. This zone is known as the 'boundary layer'. The flow outside the boundary layer is free of shear and viscous-related forces so it is assumed to act like an ideal fluid. The intermolecular cohesive forces in a fluid are not great enough to hold fluid together.  Hence a fluid will flow under the action of the slightest stress and flow will continue as long as the stress is present.&lt;ref name="Finnemore"&gt;E. John Finnemore, Joseph Franzini "Fluid Mechanics with Engineering Applications",McGraw-Hill,2002&lt;/ref&gt; The flow inside the layer can be either viscous or turbulent, depending on Reynolds number.&lt;ref name="Prasuhn, Alan L. 1987"/&gt;

==Applications==

Common topics of design for hydraulic engineers include hydraulic structures such as [[dams]], [[levees]], water distribution networks, water collection networks, sewage collection networks, [[storm water]] management, [[sediment transport]], and various other topics related to [[transportation engineering]] and [[geotechnical engineering]]. Equations developed from the principles of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[fluid mechanics]] are widely utilized by other engineering disciplines such as mechanical, [[aerospace engineering|aeronautical]] and even traffic engineers.

Related branches include [[hydrology]] and [[rheology]] while related applications include hydraulic modeling, flood mapping, catchment flood management plans, shoreline management plans, estuarine strategies, coastal protection, and flood alleviation.

==History==

===Antiquity===
{{See also|Sanitation of the Indus Valley Civilization}}
{{See also|Architecture of the Philippines|Cultural achievements of pre-colonial Philippines}}
Earliest uses of hydraulic engineering were to [[irrigation|irrigate crops]] and dates back to [[Mesopotamia|the Middle East]] and [[ancient Egypt|Africa]]. Controlling the movement and supply of water for growing food has been used for many thousands of years. One of the earliest hydraulic machines, the [[water clock]] was used in the early 2nd millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, Bamber. “History of Clocks”. History World. From 2001, ongoing. http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2322&amp;HistoryID=ac08&amp;gtrack=pthc&lt;/ref&gt; Other early examples of using gravity to move water include the [[Qanat]] system in ancient Persia and the very similar [[Turpan water system]] in ancient China as well as irrigation canals in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;"Qanats" Water History. From 2001, ongoing. http://www.waterhistory.org/histories/qanats/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[History of China#Ancient era|ancient China]], hydraulic engineering was highly developed, and engineers constructed massive canals with levees and dams to channel the flow of water for irrigation, as well as locks to allow ships to pass through. [[Sunshu Ao]] is considered the first Chinese hydraulic engineer. Another important Hydraulic Engineer in China, [[Ximen Bao]] was credited of starting the practice of large scale canal irrigation during the [[Warring States period]] (481&amp;nbsp;BC-221&amp;nbsp;BC), even today hydraulic engineers remain a respectable position in China.

[[Eupalinos]] of [[Megara]], was an [[ancient Greek]] [[engineer]] who built the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]] on [[Samos]] in the 6th century BC, an important feat of both civil and hydraulic engineering. The civil engineering aspect of this tunnel was the fact that it was dug from both ends which required the diggers to maintain an accurate path so that the two tunnels met and that the entire effort maintained a sufficient slope to allow the water to flow.

Hydraulic engineering was highly developed in Europe under the aegis of the [[Roman Empire]] where it was especially applied to the construction and maintenance of [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s to supply water to and remove sewage from their cities.&lt;ref name="Finnemore"/&gt;  In addition to supplying the needs of their citizens they used [[hydraulic mining]] methods to prospect and extract alluvial [[gold]] deposits in a technique known as [[hushing]], and applied the methods to other ores such as those of [[tin]] and [[lead]].

In the 15th century, the [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]] was the only [[hydraulic empire]] in Africa. As a hydraulic empire, the Ajuran State monopolized the [[water resources]] of the [[Jubba river|Jubba]] and [[Shebelle River]]s. Through hydraulic engineering, it also constructed many of the [[limestone]] [[Water well|wells]] and [[cistern]]s of the state that are still operative and in use today. The rulers developed new systems for [[agriculture]] and [[taxation]], which continued to be used in parts of the [[Horn of Africa]] as late as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="His 40"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FlL2vE_qRQ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The History of Somalia |page=26 |date= |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further advances in hydraulic engineering occurred in the [[Muslim world]] between the 8th to 16th centuries, during what is known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. Of particular importance was the '[[water management technological complex]]' which was central to the [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|Islamic Green Revolution]] and,&lt;ref name=Burke-174&gt;{{citation|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165–186 [174]}}&lt;/ref&gt; by extension, a precondition for the emergence of modern technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165–186 [168]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various components of this 'toolkit' were developed in different parts of the [[Afro-Eurasia]]n landmass, both within and beyond the Islamic world. However, it was in the medieval Islamic lands where the technological complex was assembled and standardized, and subsequently diffused to the rest of the Old World.&lt;ref name=Burke-173&gt;{{citation|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165–186 [168 &amp; 173]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the rule of a single Islamic [[Caliphate]], different regional hydraulic technologies were assembled into "an identifiable [[water management]] technological complex that was to have a global impact." The various components of this complex included [[canal]]s, [[dam]]s, the ''[[qanat]]'' system from Persia, regional water-lifting devices such as the ''[[noria]], [[shaduf]]'' and [[screwpump]] from [[Egypt]], and the [[windmill]] from Islamic [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=Burke-173/&gt; Other original Islamic developments included the ''[[Sakia|saqiya]]'' with a [[flywheel]] effect from Islamic Spain,&lt;ref name=Flywheel&gt;Ahmad Y Hassan, [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%204.htm Flywheel Effect for a ''Saqiya''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007124513/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%204.htm |date=2010-10-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Reciprocating motion|reciprocating]] [[suction]] [[pump]]&lt;ref name=Hill2&gt;Donald Routledge Hill, "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, pp. 64–9.

===Modern times===
In many respects, the fundamentals of hydraulic engineering haven't changed since ancient times. Liquids are still moved for the most part by gravity through systems of canals and aqueducts, though the supply reservoirs may now be filled using pumps. The need for water has steadily increased from ancient times and the role of the hydraulic engineer is a critical one in supplying it. For example, without the efforts of people like [[William Mulholland]] the Los Angeles area would not have been able to grow as it has because it simply doesn't have enough local water to support its population. The same is true for many of our world's largest cities. In much the same way, the central valley of California could not have become such an important agricultural region without effective water management and distribution for irrigation. In a somewhat parallel way to what happened in California, the creation of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) brought work and prosperity to the South by building dams to generate cheap electricity and control flooding in the region, making rivers navigable and generally modernizing life in the region.

Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) performed experiments, investigated and speculated on waves and jets, eddies and streamlining.   Isaac Newton (1642–1727) by formulating the laws of motion and his law of viscosity, in addition to developing the calculus, paved the way for many great developments in fluid mechanics.  Using Newton's laws of motion, numerous 18th-century mathematicians solved many frictionless (zero-viscosity) flow problems.  However, most flows are dominated by viscous effects, so engineers of the 17th and 18th centuries found the inviscid flow solutions unsuitable, and by experimentation they developed empirical equations, thus establishing the science of hydraulics.&lt;ref name="Finnemore"/&gt;

Late in the 19th century, the importance of dimensionless numbers and their relationship to turbulence was recognized, and dimensional analysis was born.  In 1904 Ludwig Prandtl published a key paper, proposing that the flow fields of low-viscosity fluids be divided into two zones, namely a thin, viscosity-dominated boundary layer near solid surfaces, and an effectively inviscid outer zone away from the boundaries.  This concept explained many former paradoxes and enabled subsequent engineers to analyze far more complex flows.  However, we still have no complete theory for the nature of turbulence, and so modern fluid mechanics continues to be combination of experimental results and theory.&lt;ref&gt;Fluid Mechanics&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern hydraulic engineer uses the same kinds of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) tools as many of the other engineering disciplines while also making use of technologies like [[computational fluid dynamics]] to perform the calculations to accurately predict flow characteristics, [[global positioning system|GPS]] mapping to assist in locating the best paths for installing a system and laser-based surveying tools to aid in the actual construction of a system.

The '''Mathematics Institute of Jussieu–Paris Rive Gauche''' (''Institut de mathématiques de Jussieu–Paris Rive Gauche'', IMJ-PRG) is a French research institute in [[Pure mathematics|fundamental mathematics]]. It is a "mixed research unit", with three parent organizations: the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]], [[Sorbonne University]], and [[Paris Diderot University]]. It is located in [[Paris]], split between two campuses: [[Jussieu Campus|Jussieu]] and [[Paris Rive Gauche]].

It is the largest research center for fundamental mathematics in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hceres.fr/content/download/32603/497683/file/D2019-EV-0751723R-DER-PUR190015906-024200-RF.pdf|title=Évaluation de l'unité : Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu-Paris Rive Gauche|last=Haut Conseil de l'évaluation de la recherche et de l'enseignement supérieur|first=|authorlink=|date=|website=hceres.fr|language=French|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200 permanents researchers work at the institute, around 100 PhD students, as well as [[Emeritus|emeritus professors]], postdocs, invited researchers, and ATERs, and support staff. 

The IMJ-PRG is the largest research unit linked to the [[doctoral school]] of mathematical sciences of Paris center (''École doctorale de sciences mathématiques de Paris-Centre''). It has its own [[Academic journal|journal]], the ''Journal de l'institut de mathématiques de Jussieu'', published by [[Cambridge University Press]] and covering all areas of fundamental mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-institute-of-mathematics-of-jussieu|title=Journal of the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu {{!}} Cambridge Core|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year since 2001, the institute organizes an international [[summer school]] dedicated to a hot topic in current mathematical research.

== History ==
The institute was created on January 1st, 1994, under the name ''Institut de mathématiques de Jussieu''. It moved in 1999 to the Chevaleret location in Paris. In 2010, half of the institute moved back to Jussieu; in 2013, the other half moved to Paris Rive Gauche and the institute changed its name to the current one.

The institute is one of the founding members of the [[Research Federation in Mathematics of Paris Center]] (''Fédération de recherche en mathématiques de Paris centre''). Since 2007, it has been affiliated with the [[Mathematical Sciences Foundation of Paris]] (''Fondation sciences mathématiques de Paris'').

The '''Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality''' (est. 1976) is an [[Unaccredited institutions of higher education|unaccredited]],&lt;ref name="ed"&gt;[[U.S. Department of Education]] [http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/ "Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs].&lt;/ref&gt; for-profit, degree-granting institution and resource center in the field of [[sexology]] located in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="IASHS_home"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iashs.edu/ |title=Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality |accessdate=2009-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Degree and certificate programs focus on [[public health]], [[sex therapy]], and sexological research.

The Institute grew out of research in the 1960s highlighting the general lack of understanding of and formal training in human sexuality. The library and archives are a collection of [[Pornographic film|adult films]], academic [[Sexology|sexological]] and erotological resources, and [[sex therapy]] training materials.

The IASHS has trained many of the current directors of sexology programs in other countries. Most recently, a sister school of the IASHS has been launched in China.

Like all post-secondary schools in California, IASHS is required by California law to register with the State of California [[Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education]], an anti-fraud or anti-[[diploma mill]] unit of the [[California Department of Consumer Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bppe.ca.gov/schools/accredited_institutions.shtml|title=Approval by Means of Accreditation Overview|publisher=Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education|accessdate=5 April 2013 |quote=&lt;br&gt;'''Q'''.

An approval to operate signifies that an institution is in compliance with state standards as set forth in the Private Postsecondary Education Act. Only accrediting agencies can accredit an institution. Accreditation is a voluntary non-governmental review process. On the other hand, state approval is mandatory for a person operating an institution subject to the [[California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;   IASHS has BPPE "approval to operate", which means that IASHS meets the minimum legal standards for "offering of ''bona fide'' instruction by qualified faculty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://app.dca.ca.gov/bppe/default.asp|title=Approved Institutions|publisher=Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The path that led to the founding of the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in 1976 began in 1962 with a program called the National Young Adult Project (NYAP). Originating in the then Methodist Church, the NYAP ultimately became an ecumenical project that included the Evangelical United Brethren, Presbyterian Church USA, and United Church of Christ denominations on the national level. Other church bodies (African Methodist Episcopal, American Baptist, Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, Protestant Episcopal, United Presbyterian Church in the USA, and Lutheran Church of America) also participated on a regional or local level. Dr. Ted McIlvenna, a Methodist minister, and cofounder, owner and president of the Institute, headed the San Francisco project for the NYAP. Of the 50+ nationwide projects the NYAP developed by 1968, only the three connected to him and to Glide Memorial Methodist Church had anything to do with sexuality issues. McIlvenna believed that there was a lack of research on human sexuality and the absence of demonstrated effective training and educational methodologies. A meeting in 1967 at the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction|Institute for Sex Research]] led to the formation of the National Sex Forum as part of the [[Glide Foundation]] to address this lack.&lt;ref name="sex_enc1994" /&gt;

By 1974, it was clear to the Forum that a free-standing institute dedicated to the study of and education and training in the emerging field of [[sexology]] was required. They divided the creation of the academic institute as: McIlvenna to re-envision the Forum as an academic setting; Laird Sutton to collect a graphic-resource library; Herbert Vandervoort to organize and prepare the academic work of the study team; and Marguerite Rubenstein, Loretta Haroian, and Phyllis Lyon to define the professional training standards for the new academically trained professional sexologists.&lt;ref name="sex_enc1994"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bullough, Bonnie |author2=Bullough, Vern L. |title=Human sexuality: an encyclopedia |publisher=Garland Pub |location=New York |year=1994 |pages=310&amp;ndash;312 |isbn=0-8240-7972-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wardell Pomeroy]] was the first Academic Dean.&lt;ref name="HirsArch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/CHR07.HTM#kopf |title=Archive for Sexology: Modern Sex Research (1938– ) |accessdate=2009-10-23 |publisher=Magnus Hirschfeld Archive for Sexology at Humboldt University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute was integral to the development of ''[[Humanistic psychology|humanistic sexology]]'', emphasizing experiential techniques and sexual pleasure over positivist empiricism. The culture of casual as well as clinical nudity and the inclusion of various [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]] and [[erotic massage]] techniques led to the Institute being nicknamed "Fuck U" by some critics.&lt;ref name="Irvine2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Irvine, Janice M. |title=Disorders of desire: sexuality and gender in modern American sexology |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=1-59213-151-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of [[Reichian therapy]] and other techniques not well founded in research has similarly led to criticism.&lt;ref name="Irvine2005" /&gt;

== Academics ==
Degrees are offered in Master of Human Sexuality, Master of Public Health in Human Sexuality, and Doctor of Human Sexuality, as well as Doctor of Education and Doctor of Philosophy degrees with a focus in sexology and erotology. They also offer [[Professional certification|professional certificates]] in: Associate in [[Sex Education]], [[Clinical Sexology]], [[Sexological Bodywork]], Sexological Instructor/Advisor of AIDS/[[STI Prevention]], [[Sex Coaching]], and [[Erotology]] Certificates.

Coursework varies by degree sought, but includes formal academic lectures, group-based discussion, video lectures and webinars (which may be undertaken off-site as part of a [[distance education]] program), and hands-on training in therapy and [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]]. Research-based degrees include independent or directed use of the Institute's extensive primary and secondary archives of sexological material.&lt;ref name="Irvine2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="courses"&gt;[http://www.humansexualityeducation.com/courses.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all of the faculty listed on the Institute's website obtained their most advanced degree from the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humansexualityeducation.com/faculty-administration.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==
The Institute is not accredited.&lt;ref name="ed" /&gt; The Institute's FAQ page, in response to the question "Is the Institute an accredited academic institution?", states that the Institute is approved by the [[California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education]] (BPPE).&lt;ref&gt;[https://app.dca.ca.gov/bppe/view-school.asp?schlcode=3800061 Database record for IASHS]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the BPPE is not an [[List of recognized higher education accreditation organizations#United States|accrediting agency]]; the agency's main focus is on identifying [[diploma mills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://finance.boston.com/boston/news/read?GUID=17952325 | work=The Boston Globe | title=More financial news | date=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ftp://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0651-0700/sb_675_cfa_20110428_143825_sen_comm.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the BPPE sent a [http://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/ntc_3800061.pdf Notice to Comply] to IASHS regarding several violations. In early 2016, the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education sent a [http://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation_1516058.pdf Citation: Assessment of Fine and Order of Abatement] to IASHS, for seven violations.

As of September 2014, IASHS is required by [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB1247 CA SB1247] to seek and obtain accreditation.

[[Quackwatch]] identifies the Institute as a "Questionable Organization".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quackwatch.com/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecorg.html&lt;/ref&gt; Students at unaccredited institutions are never eligible for [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]], including [[student loans]], through any government agency. In some states, it can be illegal to use a degree from an unaccredited institution, unless approved by the state licensing agency.&lt;ref name=DM&gt;U.S. Department of Education, [http://www.ed.gov/students/prep/college/diplomamills/accreditation.html Diploma Mills and Accreditation]&lt;/ref&gt;

“We don’t take federal money and that’s why we won’t be accredited by the traditional state agencies. We don’t want to be handcuffed as to what we can provide, say and do. We’ve been approached by accrediting bodies run by Mormons and Roman Catholics that wanted us to change our code of ethics to promote contraception and change our name to reflect ‘family and marriage counseling’ instead of sexuality. We won’t do it,” according to IASHS founder Dr. Ted McIlvenna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
In addition to its educational and archival mission, the Institute engages in outreach, such as teaching [[sex education]] to underserved teenagers in demographics at high risk for [[Teenage pregnancy|pregnancy]].

In [[astrometry]], an '''International Celestial Reference Frame''' ('''ICRF''') is a realization of the [[International Celestial Reference System]] (ICRS) using reference celestial sources observed at radio wavelengths.  In the context of the ICRS, a [[frame of reference|reference ''frame'']] is the ''physical realization'' of a reference ''system,'' i.e., the reference frame is the set of reported coordinates of the reference sources, with the coordinates derived using the procedures spelled out by the ICRS.&lt;ref name="USNO"&gt;{{cite web |title=International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/ICRS_doc.php |website=aa.usno.navy.mil |publisher=US Navy |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRF creates a quasi-[[inertial frame of reference]] centered at the [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]] of the [[Solar System]], whose axes are defined by the measured positions of [[extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic sources]] (mainly [[quasar]]s) observed using [[very long baseline interferometry]]. Although [[general relativity]] implies that there are no true inertial frames around [[gravitation|gravitating]] bodies, the ICRF is important because it does not exhibit any measurable [[angular motion]] since the extragalactic sources used to define the ICRF are so far away. The ICRF is now the standard reference frame used to define the positions of the planets (including the [[Earth]]) and other [[astronomical object]]s.

==ICRF1==

The ICRF, now called ICRF1, was adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] on 1 January 1998.&lt;ref name=ICRF2_tn35&gt;{{cite web|title=IERS Technical Note No. 35: The Second Realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame by Very Long Baseline Interferometry|url=https://www.iers.org/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/IERS/Publications/tn/TechnNote35/tn35.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1|publisher=International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS)|accessdate=5 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725164148/http://ww2.iers.org/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/IERS/Publications/tn/TechnNote35/tn35.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1%2CtemplateId%3Draw%2Cproperty%3DpublicationFile.pdf%2Ftn35.pdf|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICRF1 had an angular [[noise floor]] of approximately 250 [[microarcsecond]]s (µas) and a reference axis stability of approximately 20 µas; this was an order-of-magnitude improvement over the previous reference frame derived from [[Fifth Fundamental Catalog]] (FK5).&lt;ref name=ICRF2_tn35 /&gt; The ICRF1 contains 212 defining sources and also contains positions of 396 additional non-defining sources for reference. The positions of these sources have been adjusted in later extensions to the catalogue. The ICRF1 agrees with the orientation of the Fifth Fundamental Catalog (FK5) "[[J2000.0]]" frame to within the (lower) precision of the latter.

==ICRF2==

An updated reference frame ICRF2 was created in 2009.&lt;ref name=ICRF2_tn35/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steigerwald2009"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Steigerwald |first1=Bell |title=NASA - New Celestial Map Gives Directions for GPS |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2009/icrf2.html |website=www.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |accessdate=5 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The update was a joint collaboration of the [[International Astronomical Union]], the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]], and the [[International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry]].&lt;ref name="Fey2009"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fey |first1=Alan L. |title=The International Celestial Reference Frame |url=http://rorf.usno.navy.mil/ICRF2/ |website=rorf.usno.navy.mil |publisher=US Naval Office (USNO) |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICRF2 is defined by the position of 295 compact radio sources (97 of which also define ICRF1).  Alignment of ICRF2 with ICRF1-Ext2, the second extension of ICRF1, was made with 138 sources common to both reference frames. Including non-defining sources, it comprises 3414 sources measured using [[very-long-baseline interferometry]]. The ICRF2 has a noise floor of approximately 40&amp;nbsp;µas and an axis stability of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;µas. Maintenance of the ICRF2 will be accomplished by a set of 295 sources that have especially good positional stability and unambiguous spatial structure. 

The data used to derive the reference frame come from approximately 30 years of VLBI observations, from 1979 to 2009.&lt;ref name=ICRF2_tn35/&gt; Radio observations in both the S-band (2.3GHz) and X-band (8.4GHz) were recorded simultaneously to allow correction for [[ionospheric]] effects. The observations resulted in about 6.5 million group-delay measurements among pairs of telescopes. The group delays were processed with software that takes into account atmospheric and geophysical processes. The positions of the reference sources were treated as unknowns to be solved for by minimizing the [[mean squared error]] across group-delay measurements. The solution was constrained to be consistent with the [[International Terrestrial Reference Frame]] (ITRF2008) and [[earth orientation parameters]] (EOP) systems. 

ICRF3 is in development with a planned release date of August 2018.&lt;ref name="Gaume2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gaume USNO |first1=Ralph |last2=Ma, GSFC |first2=Chopo |title=ICRF-3 Overview |url=https://www.iers.org/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/IERS/Workshops/Retreat2013/2_Gaume.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1 |publisher=IERS DB Retreat, Paris, France, 23 May 2013 |accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jerzy Sikorski''' (born July 25, 1935) is a Polish historian, [[Copernicus|Copernicologist]], [[medievalist]], [[museologist]], author, publisher, journalist, and encyclopedist, who writes and publishes primarily in Polish.  He is a resident of [[Olsztyn]], Poland.

==Life==
===Early life===
Jerzy Sikorski was born on July 25, 1935 in [[Vilnius]] ([[Polish language|Polish]]: Wilno), to Anna Wołk-Lewanowicz (1914–1995) and Feliks Sikorski (1889–1980).  Five years later (1940) Sikorski's sister Maria Danuta was born.

In October 1944, during [[World War II]], Sikorski's mother Anna was arrested by the [[People's Commissariat for State Security]] along with 40 other people, when she was exposed as a courier between Vilnius' "Kedyw" and the general staff of the Polish [[Home Army]]. Early in January 1945 Sikorski's father Feliks was also arrested because he was a soldier of the 1st Polish Corps under the [[Poland|Polish]] general [[Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki]] in the ''Polish-Soviet War,'', but he was released after three months. Upon his release, Feliks made efforts to obtain Anna's release from prison, locate and take care of Jerzy and Maria, and reunite his family. Anna was released from prison camp in June 1946, and the family moved to Olsztyn. They chose Olsztyn based on the fact that most of the Vilnius board of education where Feliks once worked had been evacuated to Olsztyn, and Feliks could resume his position there.&lt;ref name=js2012&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (2012). "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/biografia Biografia: Jerzy Sikorski – O Sobie]". ''www.jerzysikorski.pl'', Olsztyn. Accessed 2018-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Following World War II, Sikorski's mother was prevented from teaching due to political persecution. After Sikorski graduated from high school in 1953, he was repeatedly denied entry to university in spite of passing exams in [[Gdańsk]], [[Warsaw]], [[Toruń]], and [[Poznań]]. Each time, he received the characteristic preprinted postcard with "not accepted due to lack of space".   On the advice of a Polish studies specialist teacher (Polish [[philologist]]), Janina Kirkicka, Sikorski was able to enroll in a two-year teacher's college in Olsztyn, but after two weeks the director Bolesław Wytrążek instructed Sikorski to leave the college, due the decision of the local [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) in [[Olsztyn]].  Through [[:pl:Hieronim_Skurpski|Hieronim Skurpski]], who was the director at the Museum of [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]] located at [[Olsztyn Castle]], Sikorski obtained employment (1954–1955) at the [[:pl:Muzeum Mikołaja Kopernika we Fromborku|Nicolas Copernicus Museum in Frombork]], which was under the patronage of the regional museum in Olsztyn.  The work at Frombork’s museum and the person of the great Polish Astronomer [[Nicolas Copernicus]], who spent most of his life in Frombork and Warmia region, made a lasting impression on Sikorski. As a result, Copernicus and ''Copernicana'' research became the dominant subject in Sikorski's lifetime work and in his professional affiliations with various research centers. Ultimately, it led to Sikorski's discovery and publication of Copernicus' resting place at Frombork’s cathedral in 1973, which was confirmed archaeologically in 2005.

In the fall of 1955 Sikorski enrolled at the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń]], where he chose to study under professor [[:pl:Karol Górski|Karol Górski]], who among other scholarly pursuits studied and researched the life and politics of Copernicus' maternal uncle, Bishop [[Lucas Watzenrode]].&lt;ref name=gorski1973&gt;Górski Karol (1973). ''Łukasz Watzenrode. Życie i działalność polityczna (1447–1512).'' Wrocław 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sikorski wrote his master’s thesis on Watzenrode, and   subsequently wrote his doctoral dissertation "Polish monarchy and Warmia at the end of the 15th century:  Issues in systemic-law and politics".&lt;ref name=js1978&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1978).  ''Monarchia polska i Warmia u schyłku XV wieku. Zagadnienia prawno-ustrojowe i polityczne''. Olsztyn, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completing of his academic studies at the Nicolas Copernicus University in Toruń in 1960, Sikorski accepted a position at the Museum of Warmia at [[Lidzbark Warmiński Castle]], where Copernicus spent at least seven years (1503–1509). Copernicus had strong ties to the city of Lidzbark, and had visited there at the invitation of his maternal uncle Bishop Lucas Watzenrode in 1495. Sikorski worked at the museum from 1961 to 1962.

Lidzbark Warmiński Castle was of substantial significance for Jerzy Sikorski's ''Copernicana'' studies in terms of the history of astronomy; as well as because the castle was a strongly fortified seat of the bishops of Warmia and the administration center of their lands  from the second half of the 14th century. At that time, Lidzbark city had one of the largest populations in Warmia, similar to [[Braniewo]].  In Lidzbark, Sikorski researched historic documents pertaining to the history of Poland's [[Baltic Sea|Baltic seashore]] ([[Pomerania]], [[Warmia]], [[Mazury]], [[Prussia]]), and its extant architectural relics, documents, and other materials relating to Nicolaus Copernicus.  Following the death of bishop Watzenrode in Toruń on March 29, 1512, Copernicus only sporadically visited Lidzbark, either as an emissary of the Warmia Chapter, or as a personal medical doctor for the successive bishops: [[:pl:Fabian Luzjański|Fabian Luzjański]] (d. 1523), [[Mauritius Ferber]] (Polish: Maurycy Ferber 1471–1537), and [[Johannes Dantiscus]] (Polish: Jan Dantyszek; 1485–1548).&lt;ref name=js2012/&gt;

==Author==
An organized index of published books and articles by Sikorski is listed at [http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/lista-publikacji his web portal], covering four areas of research: 1. Copernicana; 2.  Cities and castles of Prussia; 3.  Historic tradition of the region; and, 4. The History of Science.

An additional indexed list of Sikorski's complete articles and papers is available online at the [http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/baza-artykulow Database of Articles] (in Polish), including two English language papers: "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/empirical-table-olsztyn-question-nicolaus-copernicus-scientific-workshop The Empirical Table of Olsztyn the Question of Nicolaus Copernicus' Scientific Workshop]", and "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/practice-bishops-burials-frombork-cathedral-and-question-grave-nicolaus-copernicus-s-uncle The Practice of Bishops' Burials in Frombork Cathedral and the Question of the Grave of Nicolaus Copernicus' Uncle Łukasz Watzenrode]".
       
In 1973, in time for the 500th anniversary of Nicolas Copernicus' birth, Sikorski authored a popular [[monograph]] on the astronomer's life, work, and times.&lt;ref name=js1973&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1973).

==Journalist==
Between 1966 and 2007 Jerzy Sikorski published a number of articles in ''Mazury-Warmian Communications'' (''[[:pl:Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie|Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie]]''), on the history of [[Poland]]'s ancestral [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seashore [[Pomerania]], and the Polish regions of [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]]. He also published articles on the life and activities of the Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].&lt;ref name=js1969&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1969). ''Wieża, dom i obserwatorium fromborskie Mikołaja Kopernika oraz jego folwarki''. Copernicana. Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie nr 4, 619-645, 1969. Contains English Summary: "''The tower, house, and observatory of Nicholas Copernicus at Frombork, and his allodiums''."  Digitized by Muzeum Historii Polski (bashum.mushp.pl).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sikorski was a member of the editorial staff at ''Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie'', and also a member of staff at ''Frombork's Commentaries'' (''Komentarze Fromborskie''), and also the substitute editor-in-chief of ''Olsztyn Yearly'' (''[[:pl:Rocznik Olsztyński|Rocznik Olsztyński]]''),&lt;ref name=js2007&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (2007).

==Encyclopedist==
Jerzy Sikorski published a number of short biographies of Warmian Chapter canons and members in the ''[[Polish Biographical Dictionary]]'', which is printed by the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]. These included biographies of Preuck Jan (1575–1631), Preuck Jerzy (d. 1556), Reich Feliks (c. 1475–1539), Sculteti Aleksander (1485–1564), Sculteti Bernard (d. 1518), and Sculteti Jan (d. 1526).

===Copernicus' Polish nationality and descent===
[[File:Locationes mansorum desertorum Nicolaus Copernicus.JPG|thumb| Nicolaus [Nicolas] Copernicus' extant manuscript, 15 pages –  ''Locationes mansorum desertorum'' (''Allocation of abandoned fiefs'')]]
Reviewing the document ''Locationes mansorum desertorum'' (''Allocation of abandoned fiefs''), which was written by Copernicus in the region of Olsztyn Castle, Olsztyn, Poland, Jerzy Sikorski discovered that, out of the 136 names of allocation of fiefs, 60 were Polish names (peasants had only first names) written in phonetically correct Polish.&lt;ref name=js2011/&gt;{{rp|131}}  Sikorski also cites an extant document where Copernicus’ witness was Copernicus’ Polish servant: ''Wojciech Cebulski''.&lt;ref name=js2011/&gt;{{rp|128}} These documents indicate that Copernicus spoke and wrote Polish.

In a letter to king Sigismund I of Poland handwritten by Nicolas Copernicus in Olsztyn Castle, the administrator, chancellor, and commander in chief of the defense of Olsztyn Castle Copernicus and Warmia Canons together affirm their Polish nationality as subjects to King Sigismund I of Poland against the enemy, the German Teutonic Order. The writers say that they are willing to die defending Olsztyn Castle, Warmia, and Poland from the Teutonic Knights.  Nicolas Copernicus is directly associated with Sigismund I of Poland in the wars against the Teutonic Order, the reform of royal mints and the minting of coins, in establishing modern market economy in 16th century Poland, in direct contacts with king's personal medical doctor, with Cracow (Kraków) and the Jagiellonian University, and with the Polish Roman Catholic Church in Cracow.

Sikorski wrote "the intellectual adventure of my life were my discoveries of Copernicus’ Polish ancestry and nationality".&lt;ref name=js2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=fedo2015&gt;Fedoniuk B. (2015).

===Copernicus’ resting place===

Copernicus was reportedly buried in [[Frombork Cathedral]], but archaeologists searched there in vain for centuries for his remains. Efforts to locate the remains in 1581, 1626, 1802, 1909, 1939 and 2004 came to nought. In 1973 Dr Jerzy Sikorski published the location of Copernicus' resting place in his book, including the photo of the Altar of Saint Wacław, today Altar of Saint Cross, with a subscription (English translation of Polish) "The remains of Mikołaj Kopernik rest unnamed next to this altar".&lt;ref name=js1973/&gt;{{rp|193}}

===Location of Copernicus’ observatories===

[[File:Frombork-Cathedral-Altars-Tower-Curia-4b-final.jpg|thumb|Photographs of Frombork Cathedral and defensive walls, Copernicus’ extant Canonic Curia inside the walls (''Curiae intra muros''), and the location of Copernicus’ no-longer-extant Canonic Curia outside walls (''Curiae extra muros'').]]

Sikorski discovered the location of Copernicus' Canonic Curia outside the walls of Frombork (the ''Curiae extra muros'').&lt;ref name=js1969/&gt;{{cn|reason=Need a reference to a reliable secondary source.|date=September 2018}}  The building is not extant, having been burned by Teutonic Knights on February 1, 1520, but the foundation remains. 

Sikorski searched the area nearby with instruments such as [[ground-penetrating radar]] in an effort to find Copernicus’ observatory "pavimentum", which was believed to have been nearby, but did not find it.
Sikorski was aided in the search by the notebook of Elias Olsen, who was sent by [[Tycho Brahe]] to Frombork in 1584 to use the still-extant ''pavimentum'' to obtain astronomic observations for comparison with those of Copernicus. {{As of|2011}} the ''pavimentum'' has still not been located. Its foundations may have been destroyed during extensive ground works near Copernicus’ external curia.  

Sikorski since 1973 researched and wrote on Copernicus' observatory in Olsztyn, which contains a still-extant plaster astronomical table that was used by Copernicus from 1516 to 1521.

==Recognition==
Sikorski has been awarded Polish presidential medals for his professional work as a historian and Copernicologist: the [[Gold Cross of Merit]] (1975) and Knight's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] (1986).&lt;ref&gt;Formal statement from the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland, BON – Department of Orders and Decorations, Reference: BON.0600.454.2.2017, July 27, 2017, Warsaw, addressed and forwarded by BON to Mr Artur Chojecki, the Province Region Governor of Warmia &amp; Mazury.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Journal of Law and Religion''''' is a peer-reviewed, interdisciplinary journal published through [[Cambridge University Press]] and edited by the [[Center for the Study of Law and Religion]] at [[Emory University School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-and-religion|title=Journal of Law and Religion|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary interests include topics related to the relationship between religion and law, including subjects related to theological [[jurisprudence]] and [[political theology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The journal was founded at [[Hamline University School of Law]] by the Harvard Law professor [[Harold J. Berman]] in 1982 along with Stephen B.Young, then Dean of the law school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamline.edu/HUNewsDetail.aspx?id=2110|title=Journal of Law &amp; Religion Salutes 25 Years of "Building Community and Deepening Understanding"|last=|first=|date=|website=Hamline University Law School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council on Religion and Law and Harvard Divinity School Professor [[James Luther Adams]] were also instrumental in starting the Journal. The goal of the Journal was to provide multiple frameworks of analysis for the study and discussion of structures of positive law. The Journal moved to the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at [[Emory University School of Law|Emory]] in 2013, two years prior to Hamline's merger with [[William Mitchell College of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationaljurist.com/national-jurist-magazine/journal-law-and-religion-moves-hamline-emory|title=Journal of Law and Religion moves from Hamline to Emory|last=|first=|date=8 August 2013|website=The National Jurist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology of kinship}}
{{Anthropology |social/cultural}}
{{Close relationships |types}}
In [[anthropology]], '''kinship''' is the web of social relationships that form an important part of the lives of all humans in all societies, although its exact meanings even within this discipline are often debated. Anthropologist [[Robin Fox]] states that "the study of kinship is the study of what man does with these basic facts of life{{spndash}}mating, gestation, parenthood, [[socialization]], siblingship etc." Human society is unique, he argues, in that we are "working with the same raw material as exists in the animal world, but [we] can conceptualize and categorize it to serve social ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox |first=Robin |year=1967 |title=Kinship and Marriage |publisher=Pelican Books |location=Harmondsworth, UK |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These social ends include the socialization of children and the formation of basic economic, political and religious groups.

Kinship can refer both to the patterns of social relationships themselves, or it can refer to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures (i.e. kinship studies). Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms in the study of kinship, such as [[Descent (disambiguation)|descent]], descent group, [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]], [[Affinity (law)|affinity/affine]], [[Consanguinity|consanguinity/cognate]] and [[fictive kinship]]. Further, even within these two broad usages of the term, there are different theoretical approaches.

Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related by both descent –&amp;nbsp;i.e. social relations during development&amp;nbsp;– and by [[marriage]]. Human kinship relations through [[marriage]] are commonly called "affinity" in contrast to the relationships that arise in one's group of origin, which may be called one's descent group. In some cultures, kinship relationships may be considered to extend out to people an individual has economic or political relationships with, or other forms of social connections. Within a culture, some descent groups may be considered to lead back to [[Deity|gods]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uca.edu.ar/esp/sec-ffilosofia/esp/docs-institutos/s-cehao/boletin/damqatum2_eng07.pdf On Kinship and Gods in Ancient Egypt: An Interview with Marcelo Campagno] [[Damqatum]] 2 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; or animal ancestors ([[totem]]s). This may be conceived of on a more or less literal basis.

Kinship can also refer to a principle by which individuals or groups of individuals are organized into [[social groups]], roles, categories and [[genealogy]] by means of [[Kinship terminology|kinship terminologies]]. [[Family]] relations can be represented concretely (mother, brother, grandfather) or abstractly by degrees of relationship (kinship distance). A relationship may be relative (e.g. a father in relation to a child) or reflect an absolute (e.g. the difference between a mother and a childless woman). Degrees of relationship are not identical to [[Inheritance|heirship]] or legal succession. Many codes of [[ethics]] consider the bond of kinship as creating obligations between the related persons stronger than those between strangers, as in [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[filial piety]].

In a more general sense, kinship may refer to a similarity or [[wikt:affinity|affinity]] between entities on the basis of some or all of their characteristics that are under focus. This may be due to a shared [[Ontology|ontological]] origin, a shared historical or cultural connection, or some other perceived shared features that connect the two entities. For example, a person studying the ontological roots of human languages ([[etymology]]) might ask whether there is kinship between the English word ''seven'' and the German word ''sieben''. It can be used in a more diffuse sense as in, for example, the news headline "[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] feels kinship with vilified [[Wallis Simpson]]", to imply a felt similarity or [[empathy]] between two or more entities.

In biology, "kinship" typically refers to the degree of genetic relatedness or [[coefficient of relationship]] between individual members of a species (e.g. as in [[kin selection]] theory). It may also be used in this specific sense when applied to human relationships, in which case its meaning is closer to [[consanguinity]] or [[genealogy]].

== Basic concepts ==

=== Family  types ===
{{Main|Family}}

Family is a [[Social group|group]] of [[people]] affiliated by [[consanguinity]] (by recognized birth), [[Affinity (law)|affinity]] (by marriage), or co-residence/shared consumption (see [[Nurture kinship]]). In most societies it is the principal institution for the socialization of children. As the basic unit for raising children, Anthropologists most generally classify family organization as  [[Matrifocal family|matrifocal]] (a mother and her children); conjugal (a husband, his wife, and children; also called [[nuclear family]]); [[avuncular]] (a brother, his sister, and her children); or [[extended family]] in which parents and children co-reside with other members of one parent's family.

However, producing children is not the only function of the family; in societies with a sexual division of labor, [[marriage]], and the resulting relationship between two people, it is necessary for the formation of an economically productive [[household]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric. 1982 Europe and the People Without History. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]]. 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harner, Michael 1975 "Scarcity, the Factors of Production, and Social Evolution," in Population. Ecology, and Social Evolution, Steven Polgar, ed. Mouton Publishers: [[the Hague]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rivière, Peter 1987 "Of Women, Men, and Manioc", Etnologiska Studien (38).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kinship terminologies ===
{{Main|Kinship terminology}}
[[File:Beowulf - cynne.jpg|thumb|A mention of "cȳnne" (kinsmen) in the ''[[Beowulf]]'']]
Different societies classify kinship relations differently and therefore use different systems of kinship terminology – for example some languages distinguish between [[Affinal kin|affinal]] and [[consanguine]] uncles, whereas others
have only one word to refer to both a father and his brothers. Kinship terminologies include the terms of address used in different languages or communities for different relatives and the terms of reference used to identify the relationship of these relatives to ego or to each other.

Kin terminologies can be either descriptive or [[Classificatory kinship|classificatory]]. When a descriptive terminology is used, a term refers to only one specific type of relationship, while a classificatory terminology groups many different types of relationships under one term. For example, the word ''[[brother]]'' in English-speaking societies indicates a son of one's same parent; thus, English-speaking societies use the word ''brother'' as a descriptive term referring to this relationship only.  In many other classificatory kinship terminologies, in contrast, a person's male first cousin ( whether mother's brother's son, mother's sister's son, father's brother's son, father's sister's son) may also be referred to as brothers.

The major patterns of kinship systems that are known which [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] identified through kinship terminology in his 1871 work ''Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family'' are:
* [[Iroquois kinship]] (also known as "bifurcate merging")
* [[Crow kinship]] (an expansion of bifurcate merging)
* [[Omaha kinship]] (also an expansion of bifurcate merging)
* [[Eskimo kinship]] (also referred to as "lineal kinship")
* [[Hawaiian kinship]] (also referred to as the "generational system")
* [[Sudanese kinship]] (also referred to as the "descriptive system"){{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

There is a seventh type of system only identified as distinct later:
* [[Dravidian kinship]] (the classical type of [[classificatory kinship]], with bifurcate merging but totally distinct from Iroquois). Most [[Australian Aboriginal kinship]] is also classificatory.

The six types (Crow, Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Omaha, Sudanese) that are not fully classificatory (Dravidian, Australian) are those identified by Murdock (1949) prior to Lounsbury's (1964) rediscovery of the linguistic principles of classificatory kin terms.

=== Descent ===

==== Descent rules ====
In many societies where kinship connections are important, there are rules, though they may be expressed or be taken for granted. There are four main headings that anthropologists use to categorize rules of descent. They are bilateral, unilineal, ambilineal and double descent.&lt;ref&gt;Oke Wale, An Introduction to Social Anthropology Second Edition, Part 2, Kinship.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[wikt:bilateral|Bilateral]] descent or two-sided descent affiliates an individual more or less equally with relatives on his father's and mother's sides. A good example is the [[Yakurr people|Yakurr]] of the Crossriver state of Nigeria.
*[[Unilineal]] rules affiliates an individual through the descent of one sex only, that is, either through males or through females. They are subdivided into two: [[patrilineal]] (male) and [[matrilineal]] (female). Most societies are patrilineal. Examples of a matrilineal system of descent are the [[Nyakyusa people|Nyakyusa]] of Tanzania and the Nair of [[Kerala]], India. Many societies that practise a matrilineal system often have a patrilocal residence and men still exercise significant authority.
*Ambilineal (or Cognatic) rule affiliates an individual with [[wikt:kinsman|kinsmen]] through the father's or mother's line. Some people in societies that practise this system affiliate with a group of relatives through their fathers and others through their mothers. The individual can choose which side he wants to affiliate to. The [[Samoans]] of the South Pacific are an excellent example of an ambilineal society. The core members of the Samoan descent group can live together in the same compound.
*Double descent refers to societies in which both the patrilineal and matrilineal descent group are recognized. In these societies an individual affiliates for some purposes with a group of patrilineal kinsmen and for other purposes with a group of matrilineal kinsmen.  The most widely known case of double descent is the [[Afikpo]] of Imo state in Nigeria. Although patrilineage is considered an important method of organization, the Afikpo considers matrilineal ties to be more important.

==== Descent groups ====
A descent group is a [[Group (sociology)|social group]] whose members talk about common ancestry. A [[Unilineal descent|unilineal]] society is one in which the descent of an individual is reckoned either from the mother's or the father's line of descent. With [[Matrilineality|matrilineal descent]] individuals belong to their mother's descent group. Matrilineal descent includes the mother's brother, who in some societies may pass along inheritance to the sister's children or succession to a sister's son. With [[Patrilineality|patrilineal descent]], individuals belong to their father's descent group. Societies with the [[Iroquois kinship]] system, are typically uniliineal, while the Iroquois proper are specifically matrilineal.

In a society which reckons descent bilaterally (bilineal), descent is reckoned through both father and mother, without unilineal descent groups. Societies with the [[Eskimo kinship]] system, like the [[Inuit]], [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]], and most Western societies, are typically bilateral. The egocentric kindred group is also typical of bilateral societies.

Some societies reckon descent patrilineally for some purposes, and matrilineally for others. This arrangement is sometimes called double descent. For instance, certain property and titles may be inherited through the male line, and others through the female line.

Societies can also consider descent to be [[Ambilineal descent|ambilineal]] (such as [[Hawaiian kinship]]) where offspring determine their lineage through the [[Matrilineality|matrilineal line]] or the [[Patrilineality|patrilineal line]].

==== Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides ====
A lineage is a [[unilineal descent]] group that can demonstrate their common descent from a known [[Most recent common ancestor|apical ancestor]]. Unilineal lineages can be matrilineal or patrilineal, depending on whether they are traced through mothers or fathers, respectively. Whether matrilineal or patrilineal descent is considered most significant differs from culture to culture.

A [[clan]] is generally a descent group claiming common descent from an apical ancestor. Often, the details of parentage are not important elements of the clan tradition. Non-human apical ancestors are called [[totem]]s. Examples of clans are found in [[teip|Chechen]], [[Consort clan|Chinese]], [[Irish clans|Irish]], [[Japanese clans|Japanese]], [[Polish clans|Polish]], [[Scottish clan|Scottish]], [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], and  [[Somali clan|Somali]] societies.

A [[phratry]] is a descent group composed of two or more clans each of whose apical ancestors are descended from a further common ancestor.

If a society is divided into exactly two descent groups, each is called a [[wikt:moiety|moiety]], after the [[French language|French]] word for ''half''. If the two halves are each obliged to marry out, and into the other, these are called matrimonial [[Moiety (kinship)|moieties]]. Houseman and White (1998b, bibliography) have discovered numerous societies where kinship network analysis shows that two halves marry one another, similar to matrimonial moieties, except that the two halves—which they call matrimonial ''sides''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Houseman and White|1998b}}&lt;/ref&gt;—are neither named nor descent groups, although the egocentric kinship terms may be consistent with the pattern of sidedness, whereas the sidedness is culturally evident but imperfect.&lt;ref name="Houseman1998a" /&gt;

The word ''deme'' refers to an endogamous local population that does not have unilineal descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Murphy |first=Michael Dean |title=Kinship Glossary |url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a deme is a local endogamous community without internal segmentation into clans.

===== House societies =====
{{Main|House society}}
In some societies kinship and political relations are organized around membership in corporately organized dwellings rather than around [[descent group]]s or [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineages]], as in the "[[House of Windsor]]". The concept of a house society was originally proposed by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] who called them "''sociétés a maison''".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lévi-Strauss |first=Claude |year=1982 |title=The Way of the Mask |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. 1987. Anthropology and Myth: Lectures, 1951–1982. R. Willis, trans. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been applied to understand the organization of societies from [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Moluccas]] to [[North Africa]] and medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Rosemary A. &amp; Susan D. Gillespie (eds.). 2000. Beyond Kinship: Social and Material Reproduction in House Societies. University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carsten, Janet &amp; Stephen Hugh-Jones (eds.) About the House: Lévi-Strauss and Beyond. Cambridge University Press, May 4, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Lévi-Strauss introduced the concept as an alternative to 'corporate kinship group' among the cognatic kinship groups of the Pacific region. The socially significant groupings within these societies have variable membership because kinship is reckoned bilaterally (through both father's and mother's kin) and come together for only short periods. Property, genealogy and residence are not the basis for the group's existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Errington |first=Shelly |year=1989 |title=Meaning and Power in a Southeast Asian Realm |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage (affinity) ===
{{Main|Marriage}}
Marriage is a socially or ritually recognized union or legal contract between [[spouse]]s that establishes rights and obligations between them, between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haviland |first1=William A. |last2=Prins |first2=Harald E. L. |last3=McBride |first3=Bunny |last4=Walrath |first4=Dana |year=2011 |title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge |edition=13th |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-81178-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of marriage varies according to different cultures, but it is principally an [[institution]] in which interpersonal relationships, usually [[Intimate relationship|intimate]] and sexual, are acknowledged. When defined broadly, marriage is considered a [[cultural universal]]. A broad definition of marriage includes those that are [[Monogamy|monogamous]], [[Polygamy|polygamous]], [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex]] and temporary.

The act of marriage usually creates [[normative]] or legal obligations between the individuals involved, and any offspring they may produce. Marriage may result, for example, in "a union between a man and a woman such that children born to the woman are the recognized legitimate offspring of both partners."&lt;ref name="Notes"&gt;{{cite book |year=1951 |title=Notes and Queries on Anthropology |publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edmund Leach argued that no one definition of marriage applied to all cultures, but offered a list of ten rights frequently associated with marriage, including sexual monopoly and rights with respect to children (with specific rights differing across cultures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leach |first=Edmund |date=Dec 1955 |title=Polyandry, Inheritance and the Definition of Marriage |journal=Man |doi=10.2307/2795331 |volume=55 |issue=12 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is wide cross-cultural variation in the social rules governing the selection of a partner for marriage. In many societies the choice of partner is limited to suitable persons from specific social groups. In some societies the rule is that a partner is selected from an individual's own social group – [[endogamy]], this is the case in many class and caste based societies. But in other societies a partner must be chosen from a different group than one's own – [[exogamy]], this is the case in many societies practicing [[totem]]ic religion where society is divided into several exogamous totemic clans, such as most [[Aboriginal Australian]] societies.

=== Alliance (marital exchange systems) ===
{{Main|Alliance theory}}
Systemic forms of preferential marriage may have wider social implications in terms of economic and political organization. In a wide array of lineage-based societies with a [[Kinship system|classificatory kinship system]], potential spouses are sought from a specific class of relative as determined by a prescriptive marriage rule. Insofar as regular marriages following prescriptive rules occur, lineages are linked together in fixed relationships; these ties between lineages may form political alliances in kinship dominated societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radcliffe-Brown, A.R.|first=Daryll Forde|title=African Systems of Kinship and Marriage|year=1950|publisher=KPI Limited|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; French [[Structuralism (sociology)|structural]] anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] developed [[alliance theory]] to account for the "elementary" kinship structures created by the limited number of prescriptive marriage rules possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi-Strauss|first=Claude|title=Structural Anthropology|year=1963|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claude Lévi-Strauss argued in ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (1949), that the [[incest taboo]] necessitated the exchange of women between kinship groups. Levi-Strauss thus shifted the emphasis from descent groups to the stable ''structures'' or relations between groups that preferential and prescriptive marriage rules created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=The Reinvention of Primitive Society: Transformations of a myth|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=179–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of kinship studies ==

One of the foundational works in the anthropological study of kinship was [[Lewis Henry Morgan|Morgan's]] ''[[Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family]]'' (1871). As is the case with other social sciences, Anthropology and kinship studies emerged at a time when the understanding of the Human species' comparative place in the world was somewhat different from today's. Evidence that life in stable social groups is not just a feature of humans, but also of many other [[Primate#Behavior|primates]], was yet to emerge and [[society]] was considered to be a uniquely human affair. As a result, early kinship theorists saw an apparent need to explain not only the details of ''how'' human social groups are constructed, their patterns, meanings and obligations, but also ''why'' they are constructed at all. The ''why'' explanations thus typically presented the fact of life in social groups (''which appeared to be unique to humans'') as being largely a result of human ideas and values.

=== Morgan's early influence ===

{{Main|Kinship terminology}}

Morgan's explanation for why humans live in groups was largely based on the notion that all humans have an inherent ''natural valuation'' of genealogical ties (an unexamined assumption that would remain at the heart of kinship studies for another century, see below), and therefore also an inherent desire to construct social groups around these ties. Even so, Morgan found that members of a society who are ''not'' close genealogical relatives may nevertheless use what he called ''kinship terms'' (which he considered to be originally based on genealogical ties). This fact was already evident in his use of the term ''affinity'' within his concept of the ''system of kinship''. The most lasting of Morgan's contributions was his discovery of the difference between descriptive and [[classificatory kinship]] terms, which situated broad kinship classes on the basis of imputing abstract social patterns of relationships having little or no overall relation to genetic closeness but instead cognition about kinship, social distinctions as they affect linguistic usages in [[kinship terminology]], and strongly relate, if only by approximation, to patterns of marriage.&lt;ref name="Houseman1998a"&gt;{{Harvnb|Houseman and White|1998a (Bibliography)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kinship networks and social process&lt;ref&gt;White and Johansen, 2005, Chapters 3 and 4 (Bibliography)&lt;/ref&gt; ===

A more flexible view of kinship was formulated in British [[social anthropology]]. Among the attempts to break out of universalizing assumptions and theories about kinship, [[Radcliffe-Brown]] (1922, The [[Andaman Islands]]; 1930, The social organization of Australian tribes) was the first to assert that kinship relations are best thought of as concrete networks of relationships among individuals. He then described these relationships, however, as typified by interlocking interpersonal roles. [[Malinowski]] (1922, Argonauts of the Western Pacific) described patterns of events with concrete individuals as participants stressing the relative stability of institutions and communities, but without insisting on abstract systems or models of kinship. [[Max Gluckman|Gluckman]] (1955, The judicial process among the Barotse of Northern Rhodesia) balanced the emphasis on stability of institutions against processes of change and conflict, inferred through detailed analysis of instances of social interaction to infer rules and assumptions.  [[John Barnes (anthropologist)|John Barnes]], [[Victor Turner]], and others, affiliated with Gluckman's Manchester school of anthropology, described patterns of actual network relations in communities and fluid situations in urban or migratory context, as with the work of [[J. Clyde Mitchell]] (1965, Social Networks in Urban Situations). Yet, all these approaches clung to a view of stable [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]], with kinship as one of the central stable institutions.

=== "Kinship system" as systemic pattern ===

The concept of “system of kinship” tended to dominate anthropological studies of kinship in the early 20th century. Kinship systems as defined in anthropological texts and ethnographies were seen as constituted by patterns of behavior and attitudes in relation to the differences in terminology, listed above, for referring to relationships as well as for addressing others. Many anthropologists went so far as to see, in these patterns of kinship, strong relations between [[Kinship terminology|kinship categories]] and patterns of marriage, including forms of marriage, restrictions on marriage, and cultural concepts of the boundaries of [[incest]]. A great deal of inference was necessarily involved in such constructions as to “systems” of kinship, and attempts to construct systemic patterns and reconstruct kinship evolutionary histories on these bases were largely invalidated in later work. However, anthropologist Dwight Read later argued that the way in which kinship categories are defined by individual researchers are substantially inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Read|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when working within a systemic cultural model that can be elicited in fieldwork, but also allowing considerable individual variability in details, such as when they are recorded through relative products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wallace and Atkins|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflicting theories of the mid 20th century&lt;ref&gt;White and Johansen, 2005, Chapter 4.  (Bibliography)&lt;/ref&gt; ===

In trying to resolve the problems of dubious inferences about kinship "systems", [[George P. Murdock]] (1949, Social Structure) compiled kinship data to test a theory about universals in human kinship in the way that terminologies were influenced by the behavioral similarities or social differences among pairs of kin, proceeding on the view that the psychological ordering of kinship systems radiates out from ego and the [[nuclear family]] to different forms of [[extended family]]. [[Lévi-Strauss]] (1949, Les Structures Elementaires), on the other hand, also looked for global patterns to kinship, but viewed the [[alliance theory|“elementary” forms]] of kinship as lying in the ways that families were connected by marriage in different fundamental forms resembling those of [[Alliance theory|modes of exchange]]: symmetric and direct, reciprocal delay, or generalized exchange.

=== Recognition of fluidity in kinship meanings and relations ===

Building on Lévi-Strauss's (1949) notions of kinship as caught up with the fluid languages of exchange, [[Edmund Leach]] (1961, Pul Eliya) argued that kinship was a flexible idiom that had something of the grammar of a language, both in the uses of terms for kin but also in the fluidities of language, meaning, and networks. His field studies criticized the ideas of structural-functional stability of kinship groups as corporations with charters that lasted long beyond the lifetimes of individuals, which had been the orthodoxy of [[British Social Anthropology]]. This sparked debates over whether kinship could be resolved into specific organized sets of rules and components of meaning, or whether kinship meanings were more fluid, symbolic, and independent of grounding in supposedly determinate relations among individuals or groups, such as those of descent or prescriptions for marriage.

From the 1950s onwards, reports on kinship patterns in the New Guinea Highlands added some momentum to what had until then been only occasional fleeting suggestions that living together (co-residence) might underlie social bonding, and eventually contributed to the general shift away from a genealogical approach (see below section). For example, on the basis of his observations, Barnes suggested:

{{quote|[C]learly, genealogical connexion of some sort is one criterion for membership of many social groups. But it may not be the only criterion; birth, or residence, or a parent's former residence, or utilization of garden land, or participation in exchange and feasting activities or in house-building or raiding, may be other relevant criteria for group membership.”(Barnes 1962,6)&lt;ref name="B1962"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barnes | first1 = J.A. | year = 1962 | title = African models in the New Guinea Highlands | url = | journal = Man | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 5–9 | doi=10.2307/2795819}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, Langness' ethnography of the ''Bena Bena'' also emphasized the primacy of residence patterns in 'creating' kinship ties:

{{quote|''The sheer fact of residence in a Bena Bena group can and does determine kinship.''  People do not necessarily reside where they do because they are kinsmen: rather they become kinsmen because they reside there.”  (Langness 1964, 172 emphasis in original)&lt;ref name="L1964"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Langness | first1 = L.L. | year = 1964 | title = Some problems in the conceptualization of Highlands social structures | jstor = 668436 | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 66 | issue = 4 pt 2 | pages = 162–182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
In 1972 [[David M. Schneider]] raised &lt;ref name="S1972"&gt;Schneider,  D. 1972. What is Kinship all About. In ''Kinship Studies in the Morgan Centennial Year'', edited by P. Reining. Washington: Anthropological Society of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; deep problems with the notion that human social bonds and 'kinship' was a natural category built upon genealogical ties and made a fuller argument in his 1984 book ''A critique of the study of Kinship''&lt;ref name="S1984"&gt;Schneider, D. 1984. A critique of the study of kinship. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which had a major influence on the subsequent study of kinship.

=== Schneider's critique of genealogical concepts ===

Before the questions raised within anthropology about the study of 'kinship' by [[David M. Schneider]] &lt;ref name="S1984" /&gt; and others from the 1960s onwards, anthropology itself had paid very little attention to the notion that kinship bonds were anything other than connected to consanguineal (or genealogical) relatedness (or its local cultural conceptions). Schneider's 1968 study&lt;ref name="S1968"&gt;Schneider,  D. 1968.  American kinship:  a cultural account,  Anthropology of modern societies series. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; of the symbolic meanings surrounding ideas of kinship in American Culture found that Americans ascribe a special significance to 'blood ties' as well as related symbols like the naturalness of marriage and raising children within this culture.  In later work (1972 and 1984) Schneider argued that unexamined genealogical notions of kinship had been embedded in anthropology since Morgan's early work&lt;ref name="M1870"&gt;Morgan, Lewis Henry.  1870.  Systems of consanguity and affinity of the human family.  Vol.  17, Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution.&lt;/ref&gt; because American anthropologists (and anthropologists in western Europe) had made the mistake of assuming these ''particular cultural values'' of 'blood is thicker than water', common in their own societies, were 'natural' and universal for all human cultures (i.e. a form of ethnocentrism). He concluded that, due to these unexamined assumptions, the whole enterprise of 'kinship' in anthropology may have been built on faulty foundations. His 1984 book ''A Critique of The Study of Kinship'' gave his fullest account of this critique.

{{quote|Certainly for Morgan (1870:10) the actual bonds of blood relationship had a force and vitality of their own quite apart from any social overlay which they may also have acquired, and it is this biological relationship itself which accounts for what Radcliffe-Brown called "the source of social cohesion". (Schneider 1984, 49)}}

Schneider himself emphasised a distinction between the notion of a social relationship as intrinsically ''given'' and inalienable (''from birth''), and a social relationship as created, constituted and maintained by a process of interaction, or ''doing'' (Schneider 1984, 165). Schneider used the example of the citamangen / fak relationship in Yap society, that his own early research had previously glossed over as a ''father / son'' relationship, to illustrate the problem;

{{quote|The crucial point is this: in the relationship between ''citamangen'' and ''fak'' the stress in the definition of the relationship is more on doing than on being. That is, it is more what the ''citamangen'' does for ''fak'' and what ''fak'' does for ''citamangen'' that makes or constitutes the relationship. This is demonstrated, first, in the ability to terminate absolutely the relationship where there is a failure in the doing, when the ''fak'' fails to do what he is supposed to do; and second, in the reversal of terms so that the old, dependent man becomes ''fak'', to the young man, ''tam''. The European and the anthropological notion of consanguinity, of blood relationship and descent, rest on precisely the opposite kind of value. It rests more on the state of being... on the biogenetic relationship which is represented by one or another variant of the symbol of 'blood' (consanguinity), or on 'birth', on qualities rather than on performance. We have tried to impose this definition of a kind of relation on all peoples, insisting that kinship consists in relations of consanguinity and that kinship as consanguinity is a universal condition.(Schneider 1984, 72)}}

Schneider preferred to focus on these often ignored processes of "performance, forms of doing, various codes for conduct, different roles" (p.&amp;nbsp;72) as the most important constituents of kinship. His critique quickly prompted a new generation of anthropologists to reconsider how they conceptualized, observed and described social relationships ('kinship') in the cultures they studied.

=== Post-Schneider ===
{{See also|nurture kinship}}

Schneider's critique is widely acknowledged &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collier|first1=Jane Fishburne|last2=Yanagisako|first2=Sylvia Junko|title=Gender and kinship: Essays toward a unified analysis|date=1987|publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carsten|first1=Janet|title=Cultures of relatedness: New approaches to the study of kinship|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strathern|first1=Marilyn|title=After nature: English kinship in the late twentieth century|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have marked a turning point in anthropology's study of social relationships and interactions. Some anthropologists moved forward with kinship studies by teasing apart biological and social aspects, prompted by Schneider's question;

{{quote|The question of whether kinship is a privileged system and if so, why, remains without a satisfactory answer. If it is privileged because of its relationship to the functional prerequisites imposed by the nature of physical kinship, this remains to be spelled out in even the most elementary detail. (Schneider 1984, 163)}}

Schneider also dismissed the sociobiological account of biological influences, maintaining that these did not fit the ethnographic evidence (see more below). [[Janet Carsten]] employed her studies with the Malays&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carsten|first1=Janet|title=The substance of kinship and the heart of the hearth|date=1995|journal=American Ethnologist|doi=10.1525/ae.1995.22.2.02a00010|volume=22|pages=223–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reassess kinship. She uses the idea of ''relatedness'' to move away from a pre-constructed analytic opposition between the biological and the social. Carsten argued that relatedness should be described in terms of indigenous statements and practices, some of which fall outside what anthropologists have conventionally understood as kinship;

{{quote| Ideas about relatedness in Langkawi show how culturally specific is the separation of the 'social' from the 'biological' and the latter to sexual reproduction. In Langkawi relatedness is derived both from acts of procreation and from living and eating together. It makes little sense in indigenous terms to label some of these activities as social and others as biological. (Carsten 1995, 236)}}

Philip Thomas' work with the Temanambondro of [[Madagascar]] highlights that nurturing processes are considered to be the 'basis' for kinship ties in this culture, notwithstanding genealogical connections;

{{quote|Yet just as fathers are not simply made by birth,  neither are mothers,  and although mothers are not made by  "custom" they,  like fathers,  can make themselves through another type of performatively constituted relation,  the giving of "nurture". Relations of ancestry are particularly important in contexts of ritual,  inheritance and the defining of marriageability and incest;  they are in effect the  "structuring structures" (Bourdieu  1977)  of social reproduction and intergenerational continuity.  Father, mother and children are, however,  also performatively related through the giving and receiving of "nurture" (fitezana). Like ancestry, relations of "nurture" do not always coincide with relations by birth; but unlike ancestry, "nurture" is a largely ungendered relation, constituted in contexts of everyday practical existence, in the intimate, familial and familiar world of the household, and in ongoing relations of work and consumption, of feeding and farming. (Thomas 1999, 37)&lt;ref name="T1999"&gt;Thomas, Philip. (1999) ''No substance, no kinship? Procreation, Performativity and Temanambondro parent/child relations''. In ''Conceiving persons: ethnographies of procreation, fertility, and growth'' edited by P. Loizos and P. Heady. New Brunswick, NJ: Athlone Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similar ethnographic accounts have emerged from a variety of cultures since Schneider's intervention. The concept of [[nurture kinship]] highlights the extent to which kinship relationships may be brought into being through the performance of various acts of nurture between individuals. Additionally the concept highlights ethnographic findings that, in a wide swath of human societies, people understand, conceptualize and symbolize their relationships predominantly in terms of giving, receiving and sharing nurture. These approaches were somewhat forerun by [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski]], in his [[ethnography|ethnographic]] study of [[Human sexual behavior|sexual behaviour]] on the [[Trobriand Islands]] which noted that the Trobrianders did not believe pregnancy to be the result of [[sexual intercourse]] between the man and the woman, and they denied that there was any physiological relationship between father and child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Malinowski|1929|pp=179–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, while paternity was unknown in the "full biological sense", for a woman to have a child without having a husband was considered socially undesirable. Fatherhood was therefore recognised as a social and nurturing role; the woman's husband is the "man whose role and duty it is to take the child in his arms and to help her in nursing and bringing it up";&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Malinowski|1929|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Thus, though the natives are ignorant of any physiological need for a male in the constitution of the family, they regard him as indispensable socially".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Malinowski|1929|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biology, psychology and kinship ==
{{See also|Human inclusive fitness|Attachment theory}}

Like Schneider, other anthropologists of kinship have largely rejected sociobiological accounts of human social patterns as being both reductionistic and also empirically incompatible with ethnographic data on human kinship. Notably, [[Marshall Sahlins]] strongly critiqued the sociobiological approach through reviews of ethnographies in his 1976 ''The Use and Abuse of Biology''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sahlins|first1=Marshal|title=The Use and Abuse of Biology|date=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that for humans "the categories of 'near' and 'distant' [kin] vary independently of consanguinal distance and that these categories organize actual social practice" (p.&amp;nbsp;112).
 
Independently from anthropology, biologists studying organisms' social behaviours and relationships have been interested to understand under what conditions significant social behaviors can evolve to become a typical feature of a species (see [[inclusive fitness]] theory). Because complex social relationships and cohesive social groups are common not only to humans, but also to most primates, biologists maintain that these biological theories of sociality should in principle be generally applicable. The more challenging question arises as to how such ideas can be applied to the human species whilst fully taking account of the extensive ethnographic evidence that has emerged from anthropological research on kinship patterns.

Early developments of biological [[inclusive fitness]] theory and the derivative field of [[Sociobiology]], encouraged some [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] to approach human kinship with the assumption that [[inclusive fitness]] theory predicts that kinship relations in humans ''are indeed'' expected to depend on genetic relatedness, which they readily connected with the ''genealogy'' approach of early anthropologists such as Morgan (see above sections). However, this is the position that Schneider, Sahlins and other anthropologists explicitly reject.

=== Nonreductive biology and nurture kinship ===
{{See also|Social bonding and nurture kinship}}

In agreement with Schneider, [[Social bonding and nurture kinship|Holland]] argued&lt;ref name="SBNK"&gt;Holland, Maximilian. (2012) [[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship|''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches'']]. North Charleston: Createspace Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that an accurate account of biological theory and evidence supports the view that social bonds (and kinship) are indeed mediated by a shared social environment and processes of frequent interaction, care and nurture, rather than by genealogical relationships ''per se'' (even if genealogical relationships frequently correlate with such processes). In his 2012 book ''Social bonding and nurture kinship'' Holland argues that sociobiologists and later evolutionary psychologists misrepresent biological theory, mistakenly believing that [[inclusive fitness]] theory predicts that genetic relatedness ''per se'' is the condition that ''mediates'' social bonding and social cooperation in organisms. Holland points out that the biological theory (see [[inclusive fitness]]) only specifies that a statistical relationship between social behaviors and genealogical relatedness is a criterion for the ''evolution'' of social behaviors. The theory's originator, [[W.D.Hamilton]] considered that organisms' social behaviours were likely to be mediated by general conditions that typically ''correlate'' with genetic relatedness, but are not likely to be mediated by genetic relatedness ''per se''&lt;ref name="H1987"&gt;Hamilton, W.D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In ''Kin recognition in animals'', edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Human inclusive fitness]] and [[Kin recognition]]). Holland reviews fieldwork from social mammals and primates to show that social bonding and cooperation in these species is indeed mediated through processes of shared living context, familiarity and [[Attachment theory|attachments]], not by genetic relatedness ''per se''. Holland thus argues that both the biological ''theory'' and the biological ''evidence'' is nondeterministic and nonreductive, and that biology as a theoretical and empirical endeavor (as opposed to 'biology' as a cultural-symbolic nexus as outlined in Schneider's 1968 book) actually supports the ''[[nurture kinship]]'' perspective of cultural anthropologists working post-Schneider (see above sections). Holland argues that, whilst there is nonreductive compatibility around human kinship between anthropology, biology and psychology, for a full account of kinship in any ''particular'' human culture, ethnographic methods, including accounts of the people themselves, the analysis of historical contingencies, symbolic systems, economic and other cultural influences, remain centrally important.

Holland's position is widely supported by both cultural anthropologists and biologists as an approach which, according to Robin Fox, ''"gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior"''.&lt;ref name=RF2012&gt;Robin Fox comment (book cover) |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary psychology ===
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology}}

The other approach, that of Evolutionary psychology, continues to take the view that genetic relatedness (or genealogy) is key to understanding human kinship patterns. In contrast to Sahlin's position (above), Daly and Wilson argue that "the categories of 'near' and 'distant' do not 'vary independently of consanguinal distance', not in any society on earth." (Daly et al. 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Martin|last2=Salmon|first2=Catherine|last3=Wilson|first3=Margo|title=Kinship: the conceptual hole in psychological studies of social cognition and close relationships|date=1997|publisher=Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt; p282). A current view is that humans have an inborn but culturally affected system for detecting certain forms of genetic relatedness. One important factor for [[sibling]] detection, especially relevant for older siblings, is that if an infant and one's mother are seen to care for the infant, then the infant and oneself are assumed to be related. Another factor, especially important for younger siblings who cannot use the first method, is that persons who grew up together see one another as related. Yet another may be genetic detection based on the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (See [[Major Histocompatibility Complex and Sexual Selection]]). This kinship detection system in turn affects other genetic predispositions such as the [[incest taboo]] and a tendency for [[altruism]] towards relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = D. | last2 = Tooby | first2 = J. | last3 = Cosmides | first3 = L. | doi = 10.1038/nature05510 | title = The architecture of human kin detection | journal = Nature | volume = 445 | issue = 7129 | pages = 727–731 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17301784| pmc = 3581061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One issue within this approach is why many societies organize according to descent (see below) and not exclusively according to kinship. An explanation is that kinship does not form clear boundaries and is centered differently for each individual. In contrast, descent groups usually do form clear boundaries and provide an easy way to create cooperative groups of various sizes.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 31 Kinship and descent by Lee Conk and Drew Gerkey&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an evolutionary psychology hypothesis that assumes that descent systems are optimized to assure high genetic probability of relatedness between lineage members, males should prefer a patrilineal system if paternal certainty is high; males should prefer a matrilineal system if paternal certainty is low. Some research supports this association with one study finding no patrilineal society with low paternity confidence and no matrilineal society with high paternal certainty. Another association is that [[pastoral]] societies are relatively more often patrilineal compared to [[horticultural]] societies. This may be because wealth in pastoral societies in the form of mobile cattle can easily be used to pay [[bride price]] which favor concentrating resources on sons so they can marry.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007 /&gt;

The evolutionary psychology account of biology continues to be rejected by most cultural anthropologists.

As social and biological concepts of parenthood are not necessarily coterminous, the terms "pater" and "genitor" have been used in anthropology to distinguish between the man who is socially recognised as father (pater) and the man who is believed to be the physiological parent (genitor); similarly the terms "mater" and "genitrix" have been used to distinguish between the woman socially recognised as mother (mater) and the woman believed to be the physiological parent (genitrix).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1977|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a distinction is useful when the individual who is considered the legal parent of the child is not the individual who is believed to be the child's biological parent. For example, in his ethnography of the [[Nuer people|Nuer]], [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Evans-Pritchard]] notes that if a [[widow]], following the death of her husband, chooses to live with a lover outside of her deceased husband's kin group, that lover is only considered genitor of any subsequent children the widow has, and her deceased husband continues to be considered the pater. As a result, the lover has no legal control over the children, who may be taken away from him by the kin of the pater when they choose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans-Pritchard|1951|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "pater" and "genitor" have also been used to help describe the relationship between children and their parents in the context of divorce in Britain. Following the divorce and remarriage of their parents, children find themselves using the term "mother" or "father" in relation to more than one individual, and the pater or mater who is legally responsible for the child's care, and whose [[family name]] the child uses, may not be the genitor or genitrix of the child, with whom a separate parent-child relationship may be maintained through arrangements such as [[Contact (law)|visitation rights]] or [[joint custody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1994|pp=831–851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that the terms "genitor" or "genetrix" do not necessarily imply actual biological relationships based on [[consanguinity]], but rather refer to the socially held belief that the individual is physically related to the child, derived from culturally held ideas about how biology works. So, for example, the [[Ifugao people|Ifugao]] may believe that an illegitimate child might have more than one physical father, and so nominate more than one genitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barnes|1961|pp=296–299}}&lt;/ref&gt; J.A. Barnes therefore argued that it was necessary to make a further distinction between genitor and genitrix (the supposed biological mother and father of the child), and the actual [[genetics|genetic]] father and mother of the child.

===Composition of relations===
{{Main|Composition of relations}}
The study of kinship may be abstracted to [[binary relation]]s between people. For example, if ''x'' is the [[parent]] of ''y'', the relation may be symbolized as xPy. The [[converse relation]], that ''y'' is the child of ''x'', is written yP&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;x. Suppose that ''z'' is another child of ''x'': zP&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;y. Then ''x'' is a [[sibling]] of ''z'' as they share the parent ''y'': &lt;math&gt;zP^TyPx \implies z(P^T P) x .&lt;/math&gt; Here the relation of siblings is expressed as the composition P&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;P of the parent relation with its inverse.

The relation of [[grandparent]] is the composition of parent (P) with itself. The relation of [[uncle]] is the composition of parent with brother, while the relation of [[aunt]] composes parent with sister. Suppose ''x'' is the [[grandparent]] of ''y'': xGy. Then ''y'' and ''z'' are [[cousin]]s if &lt;math&gt;y G^T x G z .&lt;/math&gt;

The symbols applied here to express kinship are used more generally in [[algebraic logic]] to develop a calculus of relations with sets other than human beings.

The '''legal history of the [[Catholic Church]]''' is the history of the oldest continuously functioning legal system in the West,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dr. Edward N. Peters]], [http://www.canonlaw.info CanonLaw.info], accessed Jul-1-2013&lt;/ref&gt; much later than [[Roman law]] but predating the evolution of modern European [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] traditions. The history of Latin [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] can be divided into four periods: the ''jus antiquum'', the ''jus novum'', the ''jus novissimum'' and the ''Code of Canon Law''.&lt;ref name=Manual13&gt;Manual of Canon Law, pg. 13, #8&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the Code, history can be divided into the ''jus vetus'' (all law before the Code) and the ''jus novum'' (the law of the Code, or ''jus codicis'').&lt;ref name=Manual13/&gt; Eastern canon law developed separately.

==Latin canon law==
=== ''Jus Antiquum'' ===
{{main|Collections of ancient canons}}
The most ancient collections of canonical legislation are certain very early Apostolic documents, known as the [[Ancient Church Orders|Church Orders]]: for instance, the ''[[Didache]] ton dodeka apostolon'' or "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles", which dates from the end of the first or the beginning of the 2nd century; the [[Apostolic Church-Ordinance]]; the ''[[Didascalia]]'', or "Teaching of the Apostles"; the [[Apostolic Canons]] and [[Apostolic Constitutions]]. These collections have never had any official value, no more than any other collection of this first period. However, the Apostolic Canons and, through it, the Apostolic Constitutions, were influential for a time in that later collections would draw upon these earliest sources of Church law.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Fournier and Gabriel Le Bras, ''Histoire des Collections Canoniques en Occident depuis les Fausses Décrétales jusqu’au Décret de Gratien'', 2 vols. (Paris, 1931), vol I, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It was in the East, after Constantine I's [[Edict of Milan]] of toleration (313), that arose the first systematic collections. We cannot so designate the chronological collections of the canons of the councils of the 4th and 5th centuries (314-451); the oldest systematic collection, made by an unknown author in 535, has not come down. The most important collections of this epoch are the ''Synagoge kanonon'', or the collection of [[John the Scholastic]] (Joannes Scholasticus), compiled at [[Antioch]] about 550, and the [[Nomocanons]], or compilations of civil laws affecting religious matters (''nomos'') and ecclesiastical laws (''kanon''). One such mixed collection is dated in the 6th century and has been erroneously attributed to John the Scholastic; another of the 7th century was rewritten and much enlarged by the schismatical ecumenical patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] (883).
 
In the Western Church one collection of canons, the ''Collectio Dionysiana'', exercised an influence far beyond the limits of the country in which it was composed. This collection was the work of [[Dionysius Exiguus]], who compiled several collections that now go under the name ''Dionysiana''. Dionysius appears to have done most of his work shortly after the year 600.&lt;ref&gt;On the controversial date of the Dionysian collections, see E. Wirbelauer, ed., ''Zwei Päpste in Rom: der Konflikt zwischen Laurentius und Symmachus (498–514)'', Studien und Texte, Quellen und Forschungen zur antiken Welt 16 (Munich, 1993), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; His collections contain his own Latin translation of the canons of the ancient third-, fourth- and fifth-century councils, excerpts from a (probably) confected collection of African canons (which Dionysius calls the ''Registrum ecclesiae Carthaginensis'', c.f. [[Church of Carthage]]), and a collection of (38) papal letters (''Epistolæ decretales'') dating from the reign of [[Pope Siricius]] (384-398) to that of [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]] (died 498). The influence of this Italian collection grew enormously during the seventh and eighth centuries, especially in England and France. It was continuously enlarged and modified, the most famous modification being a version supposedly send by Pope [[Adrian I]] to [[Charlemagne]] in 774 and therefore known today as the ''[[Collectio Dionysio-Hadriana]]''.

Besides the ''Dionysiana'' Italy also produced two 5th-century Latin translations of the Greek synods known as the '' Corpus canonum Africano-Romanum'' and ''Collectio prisca'', both of which are now lost though large portions of them survive in two very large Italian collections known as the ''[[Collectio canonum Quesnelliana]]'' and ''[[Collectio canonum Sanblasiana]]'' respectively. In Italy was also produced a popular fifth-century collection of forgeries known today as the ''[[Symmachean forgeries]]''. Africa possessed a late fourth-century collection known as the ''Breviarium Hipponense'' as well as an early fifth-century collection known as the ''Codex Apiarii causae''; also the ''Breviatio canonum'', or digest of the canons of the councils by [[Fulgentius Ferrandus]] (died c. 546), and the ''Concordia canonum'' of [[Cresconius Africanus]], an adaptation of the ''Dionysiana'' (about 690). In Gaul many important collections were produced, like the collection known today as the ''Concilium Arelatense secundum'' and, at the beginning of the 6th century, the ''Statuta Ecclesiæ antiqua'', erroneously attributed to Africa. Also from Gaul/France are the collections known today as the ''[[Collectio canonum quadripartita]]'' and the ''Libri duo de synodalibus causis'' composed by [[Regino of Prüm]]. Gaul/France also produced two immensely important collections known as the ''[[Collectio canonum vetus Gallica]]'' (compiled in Lyons about 600) and the ''[[Collectio canonum Dacheriana]]'' (about 800), the latter so called from the name of its editor, Luc d'Achéry. The ''Collectio canonum Hibernensis'' or Irish collection of canons, compiled in the 8th century, influenced both [[England]], [[Gaul]] and (though much later) Italy.&lt;ref&gt;David N. Dumville, "Ireland, Brittany and England: Transmission and Use of the ''Collectio canonum Hibernensis''", in Catherine Laurent and Helen Davis (eds.), ''Irlande et Bretagne : vingt siècles d'histoire'', Actes du colloque de Rennes, 29-31 mars 1993 (Rennes, 1994), pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike almost every other region, England never produced a 'national' collection, though English personnel played an important role in copying and disseminating Irish and Italian collections in Germany and France.&lt;ref&gt;M. Elliot, ''Canon Law Collections in England ca 600–1066: The Manuscript Evidence'', unpubl. PhD dissertation (University of Toronto, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Around the year 700 there developed in either England or Germany a [[Paenitentiale Theodori|collection of penitential canons]] attributed to [[Theodore of Tarsus]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] (died 690). This collection marked a major advance in the development of penitential-canonical collections, which had already been in development for centuries especially within the Irish church. Collection like the one attributed to Theodore were known as ''[[penitentials]]'', and were often rather short and simple, most likely because they were meant as handbooks for the use of confessors. There were many such books circulating in Europe from the seventh to the eleventh century, each penitential containing rules indicating exactly how much penance was required for which sins. In various ways these penitentials, mainly Insular in origin, came to affect the larger canon law collections in development on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Fournier and Le Bras, ''Histoire des Collections Canoniques en Occident'', vol I, pp. 51-62.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Iberia (i.e. Spain) possessed the ''Capitula Martini'', compiled about 572 by Martin, Bishop of Braga (in Portugal), and the immense and influential ''Collectio Hispana'' dating from about 633, attributed in the 9th century to [[St. Isidore of Seville]]. In the 9th century arose several apocryphal collections, viz. those of [[Benedictus Levita]], of [[Pseudo-Isidore]] (also [[Isidorus Mercator]], Peccator, Mercatus), and the ''Capitula Angilramni''. An examination of the controversies which these three collections give rise to will be found elsewhere (see [[False Decretals]]). The Pseudo-Isidorian collection, the authenticity of which was for a long time admitted, has exercised considerable influence on ecclesiastical discipline, without however modifying it in its essential principles. Among the numerous collections of a later date, we may mention the ''Collectio Anselmo dedicata'', compiled in Italy at the end of the 9th century, the ''Libellus de ecclesiasticis disciplinis'' of Regino of Prum (died 915); the ''Collectarium canonum'' of [[Burchard of Worms]] (died 1025); the collection of the younger [[St. Anselm of Lucca]], compiled towards the end of the 11th century; the ''Collectio trium partium'', the ''Decretum'' and the ''Panormia'' of [[Yves of Chartres]] (died 1115 or 1117); the ''Liber de misericordia et justitia'' of Algerus of Liège, who died in 1132; the Collection in 74 Titles — all collections which Gratian made use of in the compilation of his ''Decretum''

===''Jus Novum''===
The period of canonical history known as the ''Jus Novum'' ("new law") or ''middle period'' covers the time from [[Decretum Gratiani|Gratian]] to the [[Council of Trent]] (mid-12th century–16th century).&lt;ref name=Manual13/&gt;

The spurious conciliar canons and papal decrees were gathered together into collections, both unofficial and official.  In the year 1000, there was no book that had attempted to summarized the whole body of canon law, to systematize it in whole or in part.&lt;ref name=Law&amp;Rev116&gt;Law and Revolution, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, many collections of the decrees of councils and great bishops. These collections usually only had regional force and were usually organized chronologically by type of document (e.g. letters of popes, canons of councils, etc.), or occasionally, by general topic.&lt;ref name=Law&amp;Rev116/&gt; Before the late 11th century, canon law was highly decentralized, depending on many different codifications and sources, whether of local councils, ecumenical councils, local bishops, or of the [[pope|Bishops of Rome]].&lt;ref name=Law&amp;Rev116/&gt;

The first truly systematic collection was assembled by the [[Camaldolese]] monk [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] in the 11th century, commonly known as the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'' ("Gratian's Decree") but originally called ''The Concordance of Discordant Canons''&lt;ref&gt;Law and Revolution, pg. 240&lt;/ref&gt; (''Concordantia Discordantium Canonum''). Canon law greatly increased from 1140 to 1234. After that it slowed down, except for the laws of local councils (an area of canon law in need of scholarship), and secular laws supplemented.&lt;ref&gt;NYTimes.com, [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/13/books/neighbors-and-wives.html ''Neighbors and Wives'' book review] of Nov-13-1988, accessed 27 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1234 [[Pope]] [[Gregory IX]] promulgated the first official collection of canons, called the ''[[Decretals of Gregory IX|Decretalia Gregorii Noni]]'' or ''Liber Extra''.  This was followed by the ''Liber Sextus'' (1298) of [[Boniface VIII]], the ''Clementines'' (1317) of [[Clement V]], the ''[[Extravagantes Joannis XXII]]'' and the ''[[Extravagantes Communes]]'', all of which followed the same structure as the ''Liber Extra''.  All these collections, with the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', are together referred to as the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]''. After the completion of the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'', subsequent [[papal]] legislation was published in periodic volumes called ''[[Bullarium|Bullaria]]''.

Johannes Gratian was a monk who taught theology at a monastery in [[Bologna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06730a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; He produced a comprehensive and ''comprehensible'' collection of canon law. He resolved contradictions and discrepancies in the existing law.&lt;ref name="High Middle Ages pp. 127"&gt;Europe in the High Middle Ages, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1140s his work became the dominant legal text.&lt;ref&gt;Europe in the High Middle Ages, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The papacy appreciated and approved the [[Decretum Gratiani|''Decretum'' of Gratian]]. The ''Decretum'' formed the core of the [[Corpus Iuris Canonici|body of canon law]] upon which a greater legal structure was built.&lt;ref name="High Middle Ages pp. 127"/&gt;{{clarify|note that the [[Decretum Gratiani]] says that his work was NOT approved by the church. This needs resolution either here or in that article|date=February 2013}} Before Gratian there was no "jurisprudence of canon law" (system of legal interpretation and principles). Gratian is the founder of canonical jurisprudence, which merits him the title "Father of Canon Law".&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Kenneth J.

The canon law as a system was more than rules; it was a process, a dialectical process of adapting rules to new situations. This was inevitable if only because of the limits imposed upon its jurisdiction, and the consequent competition which it faced from the secular legal systems that coexisted with it."&lt;ref&gt;Harold J. Berman, "Law and Revolution: The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition", pg. 254&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the thirteenth century, the Roman Church began to collect and organize its canon law, which after a millennium of development had become a complex and difficult system of interpretation and cross-referencing.  The official collections were the ''Liber Extra'' (1234) of Pope [[Gregory IX]], the  ''Liber Sextus'' (1298) of [[Boniface VIII]] and the ''Clementines'' (1317), prepared for [[Clement V]] but published by [[John XXII]].  These were addressed to the universities by papal letters at the beginning of each collection, and these texts became textbooks for aspiring canon lawyers.   In 1582 a compilation was made of the Decretum, Extra, the Sext, the Clementines and the ''[[Extravagantes]]'' (that is, the decretals of the popes from [[Pope John XXII]] to [[Pope Sixtus IV]]).

===''Jus Novissimum''===
After the [[Council of Trent]], an attempt to secure a new official collection of church laws was made about 1580, when [[Gregory XIII]] charged three cardinals with the task. The work continued during the pontificate of [[Sixtus V]], was accomplished under [[Clement VIII]] and was printed (Rome, 1598) as: "Sanctissimi Domini nostri Clementis papæ VIII Decretales", sometimes also "Septimus liber Decretalium". This collection, never approved either by Clement VIII or by [[Paul V]], was edited (Freiburg, 1870) by Sentis. In 1557 the Italian canonist [[Paul Lancelottus]] attempted unsuccessfully to secure from Paul IV, for the four books of his "Institutiones juris canonici" (Rome, 1563), an authority equal to that which its model, the "Institutiones" of Emperor [[Justinian]], once enjoyed in the Roman Empire. A private individual, Pierre Mathieu of Lyons, also wrote a "[[Liber Septimus]] Decretalium", inserted in the appendix to the Frankfort (1590) edition of the "Corpus Juris Canonici". This work was put on the Index.

===''Jus Codicis''===

====Pio-Benedictine law====
{{Main|1917 Code of Canon Law}}
At the [[First Vatican Council]] several bishops asked for a new codification of the canon law, and after that several canonists attempted to compile treatises in the form of a full code of canonical legislation, e.g. de Luise (1873), Pillet (1890), Pezzani (1894), Deshayes (1894), Collomiati (1898–1901). [[Pius X]] determined to undertake this work by his decree "Arduum sane munus" (19 March 1904), and named a commission of cardinals to compile a new "Corpus Juris Canonici" on the model of the [[codification (law)|codes of civil law]]. The 1917 ''Codex Iuris Canonici'' (CIC, Code of Canon Law) was the first instance of a new code completely re-written in a systematic fashion, reduced to a single book or "codex" for ease of use. It took effect on 29 May 1918. It had 2,414 canons.

====Johanno-Pauline law====
{{Main|1983 Code of Canon Law}}
In 1959, Pope John XXIII announced, together with his intention to call the Second Vatican Council and a Synod of the Diocese of Rome, that the 1917 Code would be completely revised.&lt;ref name="John XXIII 1959 pp. 68-69"&gt;John XXIII, [[allocution]] ''Questa festiva'' (25 Jan. 1959), [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis|AAS]] 51 (1959) pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canonlaw.info"&gt;CanonLaw.info, [http://canonlaw.info/canonlaw_LegisHistory.htm "Legislative History of the 1983 Code of Canon Law"]; accessed June-7-2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, the commission appointed to undertake the task decided to delay the project until the Council had been concluded. After Vatican II closed in 1965, it became apparent that the Code would need to be revised in light of the documents and theology of Vatican II. After decades of discussion and numerous drafts, the project was nearly complete upon the death of [[Paul VI]] in 1978. The work was completed in the pontificate of Pope [[John Paul II]]. The revision was promulgated by the [[apostolic constitution]] "[[Sacrae Disciplinae Leges]]" on 25 January 1983, taking effect on 27 November 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apostolic Constitution ''Sacrae Disciplinae Leges''| author=Pope John Paul II| accessdate=2007-04-08| date=1983-01-25| publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana| url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_25011983_sacrae-disciplinae-leges_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects of the  ''Codex Iuris Canonici'' (CIC, [[Code of Canon Law]]) are the world's 1.2 billion Catholics of what the Code itself calls the [[Latin Rite|Latin Church]]. It has 7 books and 1,752 canons.

==Oriental canon law==
{{main|Oriental canon law}}
Distinct from the canonical tradition of the [[Latin Church]] is the tradition of the [[Eastern Catholic]] Churches.  The earliest [[Oriental canon law]] collections were called [[nomocanon]]s, which were collections of both [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]].

In the early twentieth century, when Eastern Churches began to come back to full communion with the [[Holy See]], [[Pope Benedict XV]] created the [[Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Church]] in order to preserve the rights and traditions of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].

Since the early twentieth century, [[Oriental canon law]] had been in the process of codification. Some of these [[Eastern canonical reforms of Pius XII|Oriental canon law reforms]] were [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgated]] by [[Pope Pius XII]]. The codification effort culminated with the [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 1990 promulgation of the ''Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium'' (CCEO, [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]]) which incorporates certain differences in the hierarchical, administrative, and judicial ''fora'' for the 23 ''[[sui juris]]'' particular [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], which were each encouraged to issue codes of particular law peculiar to each church, so that all of the [[Catholic Church]]'s canon law would be [[codification (law)|codified]].

'''The Life Cube Project''' is a community interactive art installation based upon the creator's idea that if you write something down, it is far more likely to happen. The Life Cube installation encourages members of the community and the general public to decorate it with inspirational writing, [[painting]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[mural]]s, and [[tapestry|tapestries]] for all its visitors to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalystcreativ.com/creativweek-march-2014-scott-cohen-the-life-cube-project/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109172409/http://catalystcreativ.com/creativweek-march-2014-scott-cohen-the-life-cube-project/ |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through four iterations at the annual Burning Man festival in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2015; thousands of participants touched, climbed, inscribed, painted, and added their personal visions to the Life Cube. In 2014, the Life Cube Project made its way out of Burning Man and into its first major city in the United States as experiential and [[interactive art]].

==History of the Life Cube at Burning Man==
Over the course of three years, and returning as an Honorarium project in 2015, the Artist and his project team designed, built, and burned Life Cubes at [[Burning Man]]. The first Life Cube, an eight-foot square, was planned in 2010 and erected in 2011, and the artist was motivated to build another version of the Life Cube the following year. In 2012, its dimensions expanded to sixteen feet, enhanced by writable surfaces for greater interactivity and a more creative and graphic external skin. The third Cube came together in 2013. It featured a more complex and compelling multi-level architectural design with a pillared facade, more surfaces for writing and drawing, a tapestry wall, colored strobes and spotlights, and giant painted murals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/nov/20/joe-downtown-why-giant-burning-cube-can-change-you/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Life Cube at Downtown Las Vegas==
In 2013, artist Scott Cohen was invited by the Downtown Project to develop the Life Cube Project for [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ignitechannel.com/artist-interview-scott-cohen-life-cube-project/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109184755/https://ignitechannel.com/artist-interview-scott-cohen-life-cube-project/ |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, a Life Cube was constructed on an entire city block in the East Fremont district of downtown Las Vegas. Open to the public 24/7,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/as-we-see-it/2014/feb/05/burning-man-inspired-life-cube-downtown-las-vegas/&lt;/ref&gt; local artists and members of the community painted all of its surfaces. The Life Cube was covered in constantly evolving and overlapping murals, hosting handwritten and painted messages from its visitors who wrote their personal hopes and dreams on "wish-stick" postcards and dropped them inside.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2014/feb/04/burn-downtowns-life-cube-inviting-canvas-artists/&lt;/ref&gt; Locally owned shops, bars, and restaurants joined with the Gay and Lesbian Community Center, churches, and Las Vegas’ City Hall in the project’s goal-setting theme to their constituencies through the satellite cube program.&lt;ref&gt;http://virtual-rebel.com/2014/03/17/life-cube-set-to-burn-in-downtown-festival/&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of March 21, the Cube burned in a ceremony involving thousands of participants and viewers.

The Life Cube returned to downtown Las Vegas in March 2016 and burned on April 2, 2016 in yet another celebration.

==Other Installations==
In 2015, a non-burning metal and glass Life Cube was featured at the Reno Sculpture Fest. The 12’ sculpture included murals, Tapestry Walls, and art and wishes contributed by 1,000s of schoolchildren with outreach to prison inmates, recovering addicts, and challenged youth. Unlike previous Cubes, where "Wish-Stick" postcards were placed inside and burned, this Cube featured a Wish-Tag Wall, where participants wrote on colorful tags tied to the Cube for others to read.

The Life Cube was also featured in Yerington, NV in 2015 for a non-burning installation created specifically for the Mason Valley Boys and Girls Club. This installation included a Tapestry Wall consisting of 1,500 8′ by 8′ canvas panels and a Wish-Tag Wall created by students, teachers, staff, and volunteers from nine middle schools and high schools in the area. During this installation, artist Scott Cohen was also invited to speak at the Youth of the Year banquet &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rgj.com/story/news/local/mason-valley/2016/01/20/artist-speak-youth-year-banquet/79080302/?hootPostID=86e7c732a3c0ca201c3fcfd53d7758b1&lt;/ref&gt; to encourage students to follow their hopes, wishes, and dreams.

In October 2016, the Life Cube Project was featured in its first New York installation at the Riverdale School &lt;ref&gt;http://www.riverdale.edu/page.cfm?p=917&amp;newsid=369&amp;ncat=7,11,10,6,8,1,2,5,4,3&lt;/ref&gt; in Bronx, NY. The 12' Cube remained on Jones Lawn for over a week inviting students, parents, faculty, and other visitors to paint, draw, write, and collaborate. This Cube did not burn, but the evolving and inspiring art on the structure invited dozens of participants nonetheless.

The Life Cube Project was invited to El Paso, TX from October 6 - 8, 2017 for the 10th anniversary of the annual Chalk the Block arts festival, organized by the City of El Paso Museum and Cultural Affairs Department (MCAD). The artist, Scott Cohen, spent ten days leading up to the installation visiting over 20 local schools to talk to students about goal-setting and connecting art with community. He spoke to youth from military families at Fort Bliss as well as folks at Opportunity house, a local shelter. Following these artist talks and workshops, the 12' x 12' brushed metal and canvas Life Cube installation was erected on San Jacinto Square, in the heart of the Arts District of downtown El Paso, and was open to the general public for three days.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theprospectordaily.com/2017/10/09/chalk-the-block-celebrates-ten-years-with-largest-attendance/&lt;/ref&gt; The Life Cube for Chalk the Block El Paso included all the elements of its signature approach to connecting art and community: live-painting of murals by several local artists, Dream Tags, a Tapestry Wall featuring canvases created by thousands of El Paso students, and—of course—chalk.

==Satellite Cubes==
Designed and implemented expressly for the Las Vegas Life Cube Project, nearly one hundred four-foot cubes were distributed to various venues where they were decorated by local artists, teachers, and children of all ages in establishments and schools throughout the Valley.&lt;ref&gt;http://ccsd.net/district/news/schools/2014/mar/7/scott-es-among-schools-to-participate-in-life-cube-project&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite cubes were gathered and returned to the Life Cube site for the final burn, combining their accumulated wishes with those of the Life Cube.

==Burning the Life Cube==
The burn usually takes place as a closing ceremony for the Life Cube. The Las Vegas Cubes required the assistance and support of the [[Las Vegas Fire &amp; Rescue|Las Vegas Fire Department]], an expert burn master, a burn perimeter team, a plethora of municipal permits, event organizers, a traffic plan, engineering, fire safety and air quality reports, cleanup crews, and additional provisions for security, hygiene, and disposal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1957">A '''loosely associated statement''' is a type of [[simple non-inferential passage]] wherein statements about a general subject are juxtaposed but make no inferential claim.&lt;ref name="Conciselogic"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 10th ed. | publisher=Thompson Wadsworth | author=Hurley, Patrick J. | year=2008 | pages=17 | isbn=0-495-50383-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[rhetorical device]], loosely associated statements may be intended by the speaker to infer a claim or conclusion, but because they lack a coherent logical structure any such interpretation is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] as loosely associated statements prove nothing and attempt no obvious conclusion.&lt;ref name="Logicofarguments"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.julianhermida.com/algoma/law1studyarguments.htm | title=The logic of arguments | accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Loosely associated statements can be said to serve no obvious purpose, such as illustration or explanation.&lt;ref name="NONargument"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/polen/LC9_Help/1/12loosely.htm | title=NONargument - Loosely associated statements | accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Included statements can be premises, conclusions or both, and both true or false, but missing from the passage is a claim that any one statement supports another.

== Examples ==
In ''A concise introduction to logic'', Hurley demonstrates the concept with a quote by [[Lao-Tzu]]:

{{quote |Not to honor men of worth will keep the people from contention; not to value goods which are hard to come by will keep them from theft; not to display what is desirable will keep them from being unsettled of mind. |Lao-Tzu}}

While each clause in the quote may seem related to the others, each provides no reason to believe another.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5801">'''Master of Science in Management''', abbreviated '''MSc''', '''MScM''', '''MIM''' or '''MSM''', is a [[Master of Science]] [[academic degree]]. In terms of content, it is similar to the [[MBA]] degree as it contains general management courses.

According to a [[Financial Times]] ranking, the [[University of St. Gallen]] in Switzerland, [[HEC Paris]] in France offer the best Master in Management programmes in the world in 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/masters-in-management-2017|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times - FT.com|website=rankings.ft.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==
Graduates holding an MSc in Management have commonly studied the following subjects:
* [[Business Ethics]]
* Corporate and Business Strategy
* [[Economics]]
* [[Engineering management]]
* [[Entrepreneurship]]
* [[Finance]]
* [[Financial Management]] and [[managerial accounting]]
* [[Human Resources Management]] and [[Organizational Behavior]]
* [[Management Information Systems]]
* Management Theory
* [[Marketing]] or [[Marketing Management]]
* [[Operations Management]] and [[Supply Chain Management]]
* [[Protected Area]] Management
* Personal student [[dissertation]] ([[thesis]])
In [[Canada]], a highly specialized MSc in Management is also quite common (ex: MSc in Management in Finance and Accounting). These degrees are meant to provide students with a highly specialized set of skills for industry or for further academic study.

==Comparison to MBA==
As is the case with the MBA degree, as the number of school granting MSc in Management degrees has grown, so has the diversity of characteristics defining these programs. In most cases, the MSc in Management is an academic degree with no or some requirements for previous job experience, while the MBA is also a professional degree for persons with minimum 2–3 years job experience or 2nd class lower division honorers. However, there are also schools where the MSM degree is granted only to managers with extensive (typically 10 years or more) of work and managerial experience. Whereas MBA programs are open to people from all academic disciplines, about one third of the MSc in Management programs worldwide require a first degree in business or economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Graf |url=http://www.mim-compass.com/content/download/4362/193346/version/9/file/Global_MIM_Study_2012_Report.pdf/ |title=Global MIM Survey 2012|publisher=Master in Management Compass |date= |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim the MSc degree is more theory-oriented, and some programs do focus on specific skill set development for managers, while the MBA degree can be more practice-oriented and financially focused. In some schools, the MSc in Management degree studies the academic discipline of [[Management]], while the MBA degree studies the academic discipline of [[Business Administration]].  Thus, some MSc degree programs focus on research in a specialized area, while the MBA degree would place more emphasis on strategy. According to one school, "While the MBA program focuses on the practical application of management theory, the M.Sc. in Management will provide for an advanced-level conceptual foundation in a student’s chosen field, and allow for the pursuit of highly focused research through a master’s level thesis."&lt;ref name="Brock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bus.brocku.ca/msc/ |title=Master of Science in Management &amp;#124; Brock University |publisher=Bus.brocku.ca |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both degrees contain strong professional focus and are both very well suited for professionals wishing to improve positions in their respective industries. Most MSc in Management programs contain very directed content geared towards development of a particular set of leadership skills for the mid-career professional looking to improve their credentials. A typical degree MSc in Management can be completed in less than 2 years in an online accelerated program.&lt;ref name="MSUOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michiganstateuniversityonline.com/programs/masters-degree/ms-management-strategy-leadership/ |title=Master of Science in Management, Strategy and Leadership |publisher=MSUOnline.com |date=2014-10-23 |accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, some can be "completed 100% online in as few as 12 months."&lt;ref name="SBU Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.sbu.edu/programs/master/msl |title=M.A. Strategic Leadership |publisher=online.sbu.edu |date=2016-09-01 |accessdate=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons admitted to the degree of MSc in Management are entitled to add the designation ''MSc'' or MSM after their names (e.g. Domeng Gomez MSc), while those holding an MBA can add the designation ''MBA'' (e.g. Domeng Gomez MBA). 
While the MBA degree was started in the [[United States]], the MSc in Management degree is of [[Europe]]an origin. There seems to be a tendency that the demand for MBA is saturated whereas the demand for Masters in Management is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCormack |first=Steve |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/special-attention-the-rising-demand-for-masters-in-management-courses-2142804.html |title=Special attention: The rising demand for Masters in management courses - Higher - Education |publisher=The Independent |date=2010-11-25 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peterborough Psalter c 1220-25 Mercy and Truth.jpg|thumb|''Mercy and Truth'' are shown together in a 13th-century representation of [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Psalms#85|Psalm 85 (10)]]]]
'''Mercy''' ([[Middle English]], from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] ''merci'', from [[Medieval Latin]] ''merced-'', ''merces'', from [[Latin]], "price paid, wages", from ''merc-'', ''merxi'' "merchandise") is [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]], [[forgiveness]], and [[kindness]] in a variety of ethical, religious, social, and [[Law|legal]] contexts.

The concept of a merciful God appears in various religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]]. Performing acts of mercy as a component of religious beliefs is also emphasized through actions such as the giving of alms, and care for the sick and [[Works of Mercy]].

In the social and legal context, mercy may refer both to compassionate behavior on the part of those in power (e.g. mercy shown by a judge toward a convict), or on the part of a humanitarian third party, e.g., a mission of mercy aiming to treat war victims.&lt;ref name=Sarat &gt;Sarat, Austin and Hussain, Nasser. ''Forgiveness, mercy, and clemency'', 2006 {{ISBN|0-8047-5333-4}} pp. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Menke&gt;Menke, Christopher. ''Reflections of equality'' by Christoph Menke 2006 {{ISBN|0-8047-4474-2}} p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
"Mercy" can be defined as "compassion or forbearance shown especially to an offender or to one subject to one's power"; and  also "a blessing that is an act of divine favor or compassion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mercy "Mercy", Merriam-Webster.com]&lt;/ref&gt; "To be at someone's mercy" indicates a person being "without defense against someone."&lt;ref&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/at+the+mercy+of "At the mercy of", McGraw-Hill Dictionary of American Idioms and Phrasal Verbs. © 2002 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and ethics==
[[File:Spirit of Compassion.jpg|thumb|150px|The ''Spirit of Compassion'', commemorating [[World War I]], [[National War Memorial (South Australia)|South Australia]], 1931]]
In a judicial context mercy is often termed "clemency". It is a sovereign prerogative that resides in the executive and is entirely discretionary. [[John Locke]] defined it as "the power to act according to discretion, for the public good, without the prescription of the Law, and sometimes even against it."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Second Treatise on Civil Government'', (C.B MacPherson, ed.), Indianapolis, Indiana. Hackett, 1980, §§ 159-160&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] explained that "The very nature of clemency is that it is grounded solely in the will of the dispenser of clemency. He need give no reasons for granting it or for denying it."&lt;ref&gt;''In re Sapp'', 118 F. 3d 460, 465 (6th Cir. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
===Christianity===
{{see also|Works of Mercy}}
Hebrews 4:16 says, "So let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help."&lt;ref&gt;Hebrews 4:16, NAB&lt;/ref&gt; Grace and mercy are similar in that both are free gifts of God and both are dispensed absent any merit on the part of the recipient. Grace is the favor of God, a divine assistance. Grace is what one receives that they do not deserve while mercy is what one receives when they do ''not'' get that which they deserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/christiancrier/2014/03/17/what-is-the-difference-between-mercy-and-grace/ Wellman, Jack. "What Is The Difference Between Mercy and Grace?"], ''Patheos'', March 17, 2104&lt;/ref&gt; 

An emphasis on mercy appears in the [[New Testament]], for example in the [[Magnificat]] &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:46-55|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]] (Song of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:68-79|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Luke's Gospel]], and in the [[Beatitudes]] in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#5:7|Matthew 5:7]]: "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy".&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 /&gt; In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Ephesians#2:4|Ephesians 2:4]] [[Apostle Paul]] refers to the mercy of God in terms of salvation: "God, being rich in mercy,... even when we were dead through our sins, made us alive together with Christ".

[[Psalm 117]] calls upon all nations to praise the Lord, and that on account of his "merciful kindness". This is quoted by the Apostle Paul in Romans 15:11 to show that God has now fulfilled this prophecy and promise through Jesus Christ, who has been merciful in giving his life as a sacrifice for his people, both Jew and Gentile. Thus St Peter writes in 1 Peter 2:9,10:
:''But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light; Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.''

This devotional element of mercy as part of the Christian tradition was echoed by [[Saint Augustine]] who called mercy "ever ancient, ever new".&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 &gt;''Mercies Remembered'' by Matthew R Mauriello 2011 {{ISBN|1-61215-005-5}} page 149-160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine]], ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', Book X, 27&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Works of Mercy]] (seven corporal and seven spiritual works) are part of the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox]] traditions.&lt;ref name=Apostoli105 /&gt;

In the encyclical ''[[Dives in misericordia]]'' ("Rich in Mercy") Pope John Paul II examines the role of mercy—both God's mercy, and also the need for human mercy.&lt;ref name=Dives&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_30111980_dives-in-misericordia_en.html Pope John Paul II. ''Dives in misericordia'', November 30, 1980, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt; He sees in the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#15:11|Luke 15:11-32]]) "the essence of the divine mercy".&lt;ref name=Dives/&gt; Having squandered his patrimony, justice would dictate that the prodigal should only expect to be received back as a hireling. The figure of the father is analogous to God as Father, who goes beyond the requirements of justice to welcome his son with compassion.

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] emphasizes the importance of the [[Works of Mercy]] (item 2447) and in [[Roman Catholic]] teachings, the mercy of God flows through the work of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=Apostoli105 &gt;''We Believe in the Holy Spirit'' by Andrew Apostoli 2002 {{ISBN|1-931709-31-9}} pages 105-107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Catechism2447 &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a7.htm#2447 Vatican website Catechism item 2447]&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholic [[liturgy]] includes frequent references to mercy, e.g., as in ''[[Kyrie|Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison]]'': Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08714a.htm Catholic encyclopedia: ''Kyrie Eleison'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercy has also been an important subject of Christian [[iconography]]. Since the [[Middle Ages]], many representations in art encouraged people to practice the [[works of mercy]] and, as the art historian [[Ralf van Bühren]] explains using the example of [[Caravaggio]], helped "the audience to explore mercy in their own lives".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf van Bühren]], ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23753234.2017.1287283 Caravaggio’s ‘Seven Works of Mercy’ in Naples. The relevance of art history to cultural journalism]'', in ''Church, Communication and Culture'' 2 (2017), pp. 63-87, quotation from pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, there was new focus on mercy in the Roman Catholic Church, partly due to the [[Divine Mercy]] devotion.&lt;ref name=Withyou548 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ball175 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; The primary focus of the Divine Mercy devotion is the merciful love of God and the desire to let that love and mercy flow through one's own heart towards those in need of it.&lt;ref name=Ball175 &gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} page 175&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[Pope John Paul II]] was a follower of the Divine Mercy devotion, due to Saint [[Mary Faustina Kowalska]] (1905–1938), who is known as the ''[[Faustina Kowalska|Apostle of Mercy]]''.&lt;ref name=Butler &gt;''Butler's lives of the saints: the third millennium'' by Paul Burns, Alban Butler 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-86012-383-5}} page 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drake85 &gt;''Saints of the Jubilee'' by Tim Drake 2002 {{ISBN|978-1-4033-1009-5}} pages 85-95&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of Roman Catholic [[shrines]] are specifically dedicated to Divine Mercy, e.g.
the [[Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Krakow)|Basilica of Divine Mercy]] in Krakow Poland, and the [[National Shrine of The Divine Mercy (Stockbridge, Massachusetts)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_07061997_sr-faustina_en.html Vatican website: Shrine of Divine Mercy]&lt;/ref&gt; During the dedication of the Basilica of Divine Mercy John Paul II quoted [[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul|the Diary of Faustina]] and called mercy the "greatest attribute of God Almighty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20020817_shrine-divine-mercy_en.html  Vatican website: Dedication of the Shrine of Divine Mercy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''World Apostolic Congress on Mercy'' was held in Rome in April 2008 and was inaugurated by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407083540/http://www.zenit.org/article-22184?l=english |title=Zenit April 2, 2008 |date=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080408194854/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0801799.htm |title=Catholic News Service, APril 3, 2008 |date=2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April, 2015, at St. Peter's Basillica, in a Papal Bull of Indiction entitled ''Misericordiae Vultus'' ("The Face of Mercy"), [[Pope Francis]] proclaimed a Special and Extraordinary Holy Year [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee Year]] of Mercy, from December 8, 2015: [[Solemnity]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], until November 21, 2016: the Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus [[Christ the King]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/bulls/documents/papa-francesco_bolla_20150411_misericordiae-vultus.html Pope Francis, ''Misericordiae Vultus'', April 11, 2015, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of the Extraordinary Jubilee is taken from Luke 6:36, "Merciful, Like the Father".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-declares-2016-to-be-a-jubilee-for-mercy-84325/ Harris, Elise. "Pope Francis declares Holy Year for Mercy", Catholic News Agency, March 13, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]] the title "Most Merciful" (al-Rahman) is one of the [[names of Allah]] and Compassionate (al-Rahim), is the most common name occurring in the [[Quran]]. Rahman and Rahim both derive from the root Rahmat, which refers to tenderness and benevolence.&lt;ref name=Rafiabadi &gt;''World religions and Islam: a critical study, Part 1'' by Hamid Naseem Rafiabadi, 2003 Sarup and Sons Publishers {{ISBN|81-7625-414-2}} page 211&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of mercy, the giving of alms ([[zakat]]) is the fourth of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]] and one of the requirements for the faithful.&lt;ref name=Hooker&gt;Hooker, Richard (July 14, 1999). "arkan ad-din the five pillars of religion". Washington State University. {{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/5PILLARS.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203124633/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/5PILLARS.HTM |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
The Hebrew word  for mercy is ''Rachamim'' which is always in plural form so that it literally means "mercies". "Mercy includes showing kindness to those who don’t deserve it, and forgiving those that deserve punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shema.com/gods-attributes-the-mercy-of-god-3043/ Rabbi Loren. "God’s Attributes: The Mercy of God", Congregation Shema Yisrael]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercy is one of the defining characteristics of [[God]]. Exodus 34:6 says: "The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness."&lt;ref&gt;''After the exile'' by John Barton, David James Reimer 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-86554-524-3}} page 90&lt;/ref&gt; This is also emphasized in the context of the Babylonian exile in Isaiah: "For the Lord has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his suffering ones. But Zion said, 'The Lord has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me.' Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you." (Isaiah 49:13-15) Also: "It is good to pray and fast, to be merciful and just." (Tobit 12:8) 

When [[David]], because of his sin, was told to choose between a three-year famine, pursuit by his enemies for three months, or a three-day pestilence, he chose the pestilence saying, "Let us fall by the hand of God, for he is most merciful; but let me not fall by the hand of man."&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 24:14, NAB&lt;/ref&gt; Psalm 103:8 praises God for his mercy.

===Other religions and beliefs===
[[Kwan Yin]] the bodhisattva of mercy and compassion, is one of the best known and most venerated [[Bodhisattva]] in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;''Guan Yin: goddess of compassion'' by Kok Kiang Koh 2004 {{ISBN|981-229-379-5}} pages 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karuṇā]] (often translated as "compassion") is part of the beliefs of both [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. Karuṇā is present in all schools of Buddhism and in Jainism it is viewed as one of the reflections of universal friendship.

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] described God as being "all-merciful and eternally benevolent" in his [[Parvardigar Prayer|O Parvardigar]] prayer, and he held that we can approach God through the "invocation of His mercy."&lt;ref&gt; Kalchuri, Bhau (1986). ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher''. '''18'''. Myrtle Beach: Manifestation, Inc. p. 5986.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metal profile sheet''' systems are used to build efficient, reliable and cost-efficient envelopes of mostly commercial buildings. They have evolved from the single skin [[Cladding (metalworking)|metal cladding]] often associated with agricultural buildings to multi-layer systems for industrial&lt;!--, retrial ??--&gt; and leisure application. &lt;!-- However, as with all construction components, the ability of the cladding to satisfy its functional requirements is dependent on its correct specification and installation. And equally as important, on its interaction with the other elements of the building envelope and structure.  &lt;&lt; ?? --&gt;

== History ==
Trapezoidal profiles and cassettes have been known in [[Europe]] for around 100 years. Today's characteristic profile shape came to Europe from the [[United States|USA]] in the 50s and has gained relevance since about 1960. At present the proportion of load bearing, room sealing trapezoidal profiles used in the overall area of new and slightly sloping roofs amounts to 90%. Above all else the wide acceptance has resulted from the simple constructive training, fast assembly, and the low costs of the trapezoidal profile construction.

== Description ==
Metal profile sheets are metal structural members that due to the fact they can have different profiles, with different heights and different thickness, engineers and architects can use them for a huge variety of buildings, from a simple industrial building to a high demand design building.  
Trapezoidal profiles are large metal structural members, which, thanks to the profiling and its thickness, retain their high load bearing capability. They have been developed from the [[corrugated galvanized iron|corrugated profile]]. The profile programme offered by specific manufacturers covers a total of approx. 60 profile shapes with different heights.
Cassettes are components that are mainly used as the inner shell in dual-shell wall constructions. They are mainly used in walls today, even though they were originally designed for use in roofs.

== Specification of the metal profile ==

=== Weathertightness ===
The primary function of the cladding system is to provide a weathertight building envelope, suitable for the intended use of the building.
Trapezoidal metal roof sheets with through fix fasteners are generally suitable for slopes of 4% or steeper. This limit is critical to the performance of the cladding.  For shallower pitches, down to 1.5%, a fix system with no exposed through fasteners, special side laps and preferably no end laps should be used. For low pitch roof, ponding is a potential problem that must be considered at the design stage in order to avoid the deleterious effects of prolonged soaking and the increased loading, due to the weight of the water.

=== Building appearance ===
Building envelope made from metal sheet provide builders and architects with products, which meet all of the highest demand regarding construction characteristics and design. The [[steel]] from which profiled cladding sheets are made is available pre-coated in a wide range of colors and textures, allowing architects to choose a finish that best suits the location and function of the building. Profile shape is also a characteristic that can be adapted to the demand of the architects.

=== Thermal performance ===
Buildings are responsible of the 40% of European energy consumption, consequently, improving the thermal performance of the cladding and associated components is very important. The elemental U-value (thermal transmittance, W/m2K) of a cladding panel, depends on the conductivity and thickness of the insulation which is added, the profile shape and the presence of thermal bridges.  
So, metal profile sheets can achieve thermal performance regulations thanks of insulations and profile shape.
It is very important to analyze and avoid all possible thermal bridges within the roof and wall cladding assembly, to minimize local heat/cold losses.

=== Acoustics ===
Roofs constructed with trapezoidal profiles have excellent sound suppression characteristics. The sound reduction assessments of up to 53&amp;nbsp;dB have been realised.  
The measured sound reduction for wall constructions using cassettes has been assessed at an RW of 57&amp;nbsp;dB. 
The acoustic performance of a particular cladding system will depend on the insulation material, the weather sheet and liner sheet profiles and the method of assembly.
To minimize reverberation architects may take advantage of the sound absorbing properties of the cladding insulation layer by replacing the standard liner sheet with a perforated liner.

=== Durability ===
In order to ensure that the building envelope remains fully functional throughout its design life, it is important that it receives regular maintenance, including inspection, removal of debris, cleaning and repair of damage. Inspection can include man-made or natural wear. Weather exposure, natural movement, installation error and manufacturing defects are examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Regular Inspections Are Key to Building  Envelope Integrity|author=Arthur L. Sanders|url=http://www.hoffarch.com/assets/Journal11.pdf|publisher= Hoffmann Architects |accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need of maintenance may be greatly reduced using specific coating depending on the weather conditions, this coating guarantee the expected design life of the cladding. The commonly used 302 stainless steel alone is resistant to acetic acid, acetone and boric acid, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metals and Corrosion Resistance|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/metal-corrosion-resistance-d_491.html|publisher=The Engineering Toolbox|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainability ===
Metal profiles sheets have a high recycled scrap steel content and all steel is recyclable.  Many steel components can be unbolted and even reused for future applications.  The possibility of reusing building elements makes steel construction even more sustainable than the already significant contribution of today’s simple material recycling.  Steel can be repeatedly recycled because it does not lose any of its inherent physical properties as a result of the recycling process. Stainless steel fasteners have excellent corrosion resistance and durability, as well as being a sustainable material. Custom fasteners in this material make for the utmost of sustainability with high recyclability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Stainless Steel Fasteners, Glaser &amp; Associates, Inc.|author=Kosaku Yoshino|url=http://www.glaserbolt.com/products/stainless-steel-fasteners|publisher= Glaser &amp; Associates Inc. |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural performance ===
Metal cladding systems are required to carry externally applied loads, such as snow and wind loading without deflecting excessively or compromising the other performance requirements. The individual characteristic loads (actions) should be obtained from the appropriate part of EN 1991, taking into account the building geometry and location as applicable. These individual actions should then be combined using the appropriate safety factors from EN 1990 to obtain the load cases used in design. 
*Permanent actions:
For most application of metal cladding technology, the only permanent action which the roof cladding needs to be designed is its own self-weight.
For wall cladding, it is not normally necessary to consider permanent actions, since the self-weight acts in the plan of the cladding.  
*Variable actions:
In addition to its self-weight, the roof cladding must also be designed for the following variable actions as specified in the appropriate parts of EN 1991:
-Access for cleaning and maintenance. 
-A uniformly distributed load due to snow over the complete roof area. The value of this load will depend on the building’s location.
-Asymmetric snow load and loading due to snow drifts.
-Wind loading due to pressure and suction. 
*Deflections:
Care must be taken on site to avoid excessive local deflection.  Typical deflection limits imposed on the cladding are depend on the loading regime considered, the location of the structural component and whether a brittle material is present.  Deflection limits may be specifies by National regulation.

== Main uses ==
Metal profile sheets due to their versatility mechanical and design properties can be used as roof and roof cladding, as external walls and wall cladding and also as floors. They are used in industry and in residential sector, and the two sectors can be used in both new construction and rehabilitation. Some of the applications where metal profile sheets are used are:
*industrial buildings,
*commercial buildings,
*public buildings,
*sport buildings,
*educational buildings,
*offices and administration buildings,
*multi-storey buildings
*power plants,
*residential house,
*high design demand buildings, 
*etc.

[[File:Sani Pass heading into Lesotho.jpg|thumb|[[Sani Pass]] in [[Lesotho]].]]
[[File:Bwlch Maesgwm contour map.png|thumb|A mountain pass as it appears on a contour map: Bwlch Maesgwm in [[Snowdonia]], north [[Wales]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{coord|53|4|52.8|N|4|7|57|W}}, height contours from [[SRTM]] data.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''mountain pass''' is a navigable route through a [[mountain range]] or over a [[ridge]]. Since many of the world's mountain ranges have presented formidable barriers to travel, passes have played a key role in [[trade]], [[war]], and both [[Human migration|human]] and [[animal migration]] throughout Earth's history. At lower elevations it may be called a '''hill pass'''. The [[Extreme points of Earth|highest vehicle-accessible pass in the world]] appears to be [[Mana Pass]], located in the [[Himalayas]] on the border between [[India]] and [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]], [[China]].

==Overview==
[[File:Saddleroute3.JPG|thumb|Idealised mountain pass represented as the green line; the [[saddle point]] is in red.]]
Mountain passes make use of a [[gap (landform)|gap]], [[saddle (landform)|saddle]], or [[col]] (also sometimes a [[notch (landform)|notch]], the low point in a ridge). A topographic saddle is analogous to the mathematical concept of a [[saddle surface]], with a [[saddle point]] marking the highest point between two valleys and the lowest point along a ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Eberhart |first= Mark E. |title= Why Things Break: Understanding the World by the Way it Comes Apart |year= 2004 |publisher= Random House |isbn= 978-1-4000-4883-0 |page= 232 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wo9wGKk9MVsC&amp;pg=PT236 |accessdate= 6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bishop |first1= Michael P. |last2= Shroder |first2= John F. |title= Geographic Information Science and Mountain Geomorphology |year= 2004 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-3-540-42640-0 |pages= 86–87 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6TGu7-mwSNYC&amp;pg=PA86 |accessdate= 6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a [[topographic map]], passes are characterized by [[contour lines]] with an hourglass shape, which indicates a low spot between two higher points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Harvey |first1= Mark William Thornton |last2= Simer |first2= Peter |title= The National Outdoor Leadership School Wilderness Guide: The Classic Handbook |year= 1999 |publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn= 978-0-684-85909-5 |page= 185 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BHKUvFAzliYC&amp;pg=PA185 |accessdate= 6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passes are often found just above the [[Source (river or stream)|source of a river]], constituting a [[drainage divide]]. A pass may be very short, consisting of steep slopes to the top of the pass, or may be a valley many kilometres long, whose highest point might only be identifiable by [[surveying]].

Roads have long been built through passes, as well as railways more recently. Some high and rugged passes may have tunnels bored underneath a nearby mountainside (like the [[Eisenhower Tunnel]] bypassing [[Loveland Pass]] in the Rockies) to allow faster traffic flow throughout the year.

The top of a pass is frequently the only flat ground in the area, and is a high vantage point. In some cases this makes it a preferred site for buildings. If a national border follows a mountain range, a pass over the mountains is typically on the border, and there may be a [[border control]] or [[customs]] station, and possibly a military post as well. For instance [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] share the world's third-longest international border, {{convert|5300|km|mi}} long. The border runs north–south along the [[Andes]] mountains, with a total of 42 mountain passes.&lt;ref name=pasos/&gt;&lt;ref name=pasos_chile/&gt; On a road over a pass, it is customary to have a small roadside sign giving the name of the pass and its [[elevation]] [[above mean sea level]].

As well as offering relatively easy travel between valleys, passes also provide a route between two mountain tops with a minimum of descent. As a result, it is common for tracks to meet at a pass; this often makes them convenient routes even when travelling between a summit and the valley floor. Passes traditionally were places for trade routes, communications, cultural exchange, military expeditions etc. A typical example is the [[Brenner pass]] in the [[Alps]].

Some mountain passes above the [[tree line]] have problems with [[snow drift]] in the winter. This might be alleviated by building the road a few meters above the ground, which will make snow blow off the road.

==Synonyms==
There are many words for ''pass'' in the English-speaking world. In the United States, ''pass'' is very common in the [[Western United States|West]], the word ''gap'' is common in the southern [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]], ''notch'' in parts of [[New England]], and ''saddle'' in northern [[Idaho]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://itouchmap.com/?f=gap&amp;s=ID&amp;a1=&amp;start=255 Map showing "saddle" names in Idaho]&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland has the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] term ''bealach'' (anglicised "balloch"), while Wales has the similar ''bwlch'' (both being [[Insular Celtic languages|British Celtic]] languages). In the [[Lake District]] of north-west England, the term ''hause'' is often used, although the term ''pass'' is also common—one distinction is that a pass can refer to a route, as well as the highest part thereof, while a hause is simply that highest part, often flattened somewhat into a high-level plateau.

==Around the world==
There are thousands of named passes around the world, some of which are well-known, such as the [[Great St. Bernard Pass]] at {{convert|2473|m|ft}} in the [[Alps]], the [[Chang La]] at {{convert|5360|m|ft}}, and the [[Khardung La]] at {{convert|5359|m|ft}} in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], India. The roads at [[Mana Pass]] at {{convert|5610|m|ft}} and [[Marsimik La]] at {{convert|5582|m|ft}}, on and near the China-India border respectively, appear to be world's two highest motorable passes. [[Khunjerab Pass]] between [[Pakistan]] and China at {{Convert|4693|m|ft}} is also a high-altitude motorable mountain pass.

'''The Mshatta Facade''' is the decorated part of the [[facade]] of the 8th century [[Umayyad]] residential palace of [[Qasr Mshatta]], one of the [[Desert Castles of Jordan]], which is now installed in the south wing of the [[Pergamon Museum]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It is part of the permanent exhibition of the [[Pergamon Museum of Islamic Art]] dedicated to [[Islamic art]] from the 8th to the 19th centuries.  This was only a relatively small section of the full length of the facade, surrounding the main entrance; most of the wall was undecorated and remains ''in situ''.

==History==
[[File:Pergamon Museum Berlin 2007131.jpg|thumb|left|detail]]
The facade belonged to the Qasr Mshatta or Mshatta palace, which was excavated about 30&amp;nbsp;km south of the contemporary Jordanian capital of [[Amman]]. It is thought to have served as a winter residence and storage halls during the [[Umayyad]] period. The building of the palace probably dates to the era of the [[caliph]] [[Al-Walid II]] (743-744). After Al Walid was murdered, it was left incomplete and later ruined in an [[earthquake]].  The sections of the outer wall remaining ''in situ'' are much plainer.

Unusually for an Umayyad building, the main structures are built from burnt bricks resting on a foundation layer of finely dressed stone; the carved facade is also in stone. The name of the place, Mshatta, is a name used by the modern [[Bedouin]]s in the area, and the original name remains unknown.

The remains of the palace were excavated in 1840. The facade was a gift from the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] to Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany]]. A large part of it was brought to the then [[Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum]] (now the [[Bode Museum]]) in Berlin in 1903. It was reconstructed as a 33 metres long, 5 metres high facade, with two towers, and parts of a central gateway.  In 1932 it was reconstructed in the Pergamon Museum. It was seriously damaged during the Second World War and the bombardment of Berlin. Today, it is one of the most important exhibits of the ''Museum für Islamische Kunst'' in the [[Pergamon Museum]], and a key monument of early [[Islamic art]] and architecture, demonstrating early forms of the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], [[millefleur]] and also animals carved in [[relief]].

There has been much discussion of the fact that the decoration on the left side of the facade contains many animals among the foliar forms, while on the right of the entranceway in the centre there are no animals. It has been suggested that this is because the right-hand side was the outside wall of the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ettinghausen, [[Oleg Grabar]] and Marilyn Jenkins-Madina, 2001, ''Islamic Art and Architecture: 650-1250'', 50, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-08869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World''''' is an academic anthology edited by the British [[religious studies]] scholars  Joanne Pearson, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel which was published by [[Edinburgh University Press]] in 1998. Containing fourteen separate papers produced by various scholars working in the field of [[Pagan studies]], the book examines different forms of [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Paganism]] as practiced in Europe and North America.

Divided into three parts, the first, entitled "A Chthonic Imperative? Religion and Nature in the Modern World" contained papers from scholars such as Peter Beyer, Steven Sutcliffe and Wouter J. Hanegraaff and dealt with the relationship between contemporary Paganism and various features of contemporary society, such as [[globalisation]] and the [[secularisation]] of the natural world. The second part, entitled "The Pagan Alternative: the Goddess and Nature", contained papers by Prudence Jones, [[Ronald Hutton]], Susan Greenwood, Elizabeth Puttick and Geoffrey Samuel dealing with the role of goddess figures in the Pagan movement. Finally, the third part of the book, entitled "Nature Religion in Practice", contained articles by Jone Salomonsen, Philip Shallcrass, [[Vivianne Crowley]] and Alastair McIntosh dealing with the various religious practices of Pagans.

==Origins==
The first international academic conference on the subject of Pagan studies had been held at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], North-East England in 1993, having been organised by the religious studies scholars [[Graham Harvey (author)|Graham Harvey]] and Charlotte Hardman.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996 a larger conference dealing with contemporary Paganism then took place at [[Ambleside]] in the [[Lake District]]; organised by the Department of Religious Studies at the [[University of Lancaster]], North-West England, it was entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s".&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson 1998 1"&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference's organisers later described its original intentions, remarking that through it they "sought to explore the innovations in practice and belief which constitute contemporary Paganism, and which appear to be a part of a widespread cultural response to the decay of main-line religions and to a widely felt awareness of ecological crisis."&lt;ref name="Pearson 1998 1"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Part One: A Cthonic Imperative? Religion and Nature in the Modern World===

====Beyer's "Globalisation and the Religion of Nature"====
The anthology's opening paper was written by Peter Beyer, then an Associate Professor of Religious Studies at the [[University of Ottawa]], Canada, and the author of the book ''Religion and Globalization'' (1994). In this paper, Beyer delved the definition of "[[nature religion]]" developed by the American religious studies scholar Catherine Albanese, looking at those religious movements whose "devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeding to provide a basic summary of [[globalisation]], he then made a brief discussion of how the two interact, arguing that nature religions had a tendency to develop a counter-structural strategy in dealing with globalising forces. In this manner they emphasise the idea that spiritual authenticity is stronger among the oppressed, such as those indigenous communities who adhere to nature religionist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. pp. 16&amp;ndash;21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hanegraaff's "Reflections on New Age and the Secularisation of Nature"====
Beyer's paper was followed by that provided by Wouter J. Hanegraaff, then a Research Associate at the [[University of Utrecht]] and the author of ''New Age Religion and Western Culture: Esotericism in the Mind of Secular Thought'' (1996).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5339">'''Organized religion''' (or '''organised religion'''—see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|spelling differences]]), also known as '''institutional religion''', is [[religion]] in which [[belief system]]s and [[ritual]]s are systematically arranged and [[Formal organization|formally established]]. Organized religion is typically characterized by an official [[doctrine]] (or [[dogma]]), a [[hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] or [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[leadership]] structure, and a [[Religious law|codification]] of [[Religious behaviour|rules and practices]].  

==Definition==
Organized religion, or institutional religion, is [[religion]] in which [[belief system]]s and [[ritual]]s are systematically arranged and [[Formal organization|formally established]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Molnar, Darin R., PhD|title= Three Worldviews|date= 9 December 2010|url= http://www.middlewaymanagement.com/three-worldviews/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized religion is typically characterized by an official [[doctrine]] (or [[dogma]]), a [[hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] or [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[leadership]] structure, and a [[Religious law|codification]] of [[Religious behaviour|rules and practices]].

Organized religion is distinguished from the broader idea of [[religion]] especially in [[anthropology]], [[sociology]] and [[philosophy]]. American philosopher [[William James]] states that &lt;blockquote&gt;Religion... shall mean for us the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude... in relation to whatever they may consider the divine. Since the relation may be either moral, physical, or ritual, it is evident that out of religion in the sense in which we take it, theologies, philosophies, and ecclesiastical organizations may secondarily grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= James, William|title= The Varieties of Religious Experience|chapter= Lecture II: Circumscription of the Topic|page= 31|publisher= Arc Manor LLC|year= 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; James further comments that the essential elements of "institutional religion" are "[[worship]] and [[sacrifice]], procedures for working on the dispositions of the deity [i.e.] [[theology]], and [[ceremony]] and [[Clergy|ecclesiastical organization]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= James, Williams|title= The Varieties of Religious Experience|chapter= Lecture II: Circumscription of the Topic|page= 30|publisher= Arc Manor LLC|year= 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized religion seems to have gained prevalence since the [[Neolithic|Neolithic era]] with the rise of wide-scale [[civilization]] and [[History of agriculture|agriculture]].{{cn|date=August 2018}} Organized religions may include a [[state religion|state's official religion]], or [[state church]]. However, most political states have any number of organized religions practiced within their jurisdiction. Due to their structured, standardized, and easily proliferated form, organized religions comprise many of the world's [[major religious groups]].{{cn|date=June 2017}} The [[Abrahamic religion]]s are all largely considered organized (including [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]), as well as some schools of thought within [[Indian religion]]s (for example, some schools of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Religions that are not considered organized religions, or only loosely so, include many [[indigenous religion|indigenous]] and [[folk religion]]s, such as [[traditional African religion]]s, [[Native American religion]]s and [[prehistoric religion]]s, as well as personal religions including some strands of [[Hinduism]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Modern views==
In the modern era, the definition of the term 'religion' is becoming increasingly opaque, making the task of defining 'organised religion' difficult. Anthropologists, theologians and scholars have thus attempt to embed the idea of an 'organisation' into the definition of religion itself. Some examples of this are found in the definition provided by Clifford Geertz, who defines religion as a "Cultural system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=V86CXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=geertz+religion+as+a+cultural+system&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn7Y_ukYXdAhUVdt4KHb6_AHQQ6AEIKTAA|title=Religion as a Cultural System|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|date=1966|publisher=Tavistock|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Max Weber's prominent definition of a religion includes the idea of a 'Church,' not necessarily in the Christian formulation, but insisting on the notion of an organised hierarchy constituting a palpable religious body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=abS61el-VEMC&amp;dq=Weber+definition+of+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQvKSJkoXdAhUXfd4KHecABDsQ6AEILDAA|title=The Sociology of Religion|last=Weber|first=Max|date=1993|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=9780807042052|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it becomes apparent that 'organised religion' has also been considered as part of the definition of religion itself, which in the modern era has caused a degree of controversy with the prominence of aforementioned personalized faith systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3953">'''PDE surfaces''' are used in [[geometric modelling]] and [[computer graphics]] for creating smooth surfaces conforming to a given boundary configuration. PDE surfaces use [[partial differential equations]] to generate a surface which usually satisfy a mathematical [[boundary value problem]].

PDE surfaces were first introduced into the area of [[geometric modelling]] and [[computer graphics]] by two British mathematicians, Malcolm Bloor and Michael Wilson. 

==Technical details==
The PDE method involves generating a surface for some boundary by means of solving an [[Elliptic operator|elliptic partial differential equation]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\left( \frac{\partial ^{2}}{ \partial
 u^{2}} + a^{2}\frac {\partial^{2}}{\partial v^{2}} \right)^{2}
X(u,v) = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;X(u,v) &lt;/math&gt; is a function parameterised by the two [[parameter]]s &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;X(u,v) = (x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v)) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; z &lt;/math&gt; are the usual [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian coordinate]] space. The boundary conditions on the function &lt;math&gt;X(u,v) &lt;/math&gt; and its 
normal derivatives &lt;math&gt; \partial{X}/\partial{{n}} &lt;/math&gt;  
are imposed at the edges of the surface patch.

With the above formulation it is notable that the elliptic partial differential operator in the above PDE represents a smoothing process in which the value of the function at any point on the surface is, in some sense, a weighted average of the surrounding 
values. In this way a surface is obtained as a smooth transition between 
the chosen set of [[boundary condition]]s.  The parameter &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is a special design parameter which controls the relative smoothing of the surface in the &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; directions.

When &lt;math&gt; a=1 &lt;/math&gt;, the PDE is the [[biharmonic equation]]: &lt;math&gt; X_{uuuu} + 2X_{uuvv} + X_{vvvv}=0 &lt;/math&gt;.  The biharmonic equation is the equation produced by applying the [[Euler–Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange equation]] to the simplified [[thin plate energy functional]] &lt;math&gt; X_{uu}^2 + 2X_{uv}^2 + X_{vv}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.  So solving the PDE with &lt;math&gt; a=1 &lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to minimizing the thin plate energy functional subject to the same boundary conditions.

==Applications==
PDE surfaces can be used in many application areas. These include [[computer-aided design]], interactive design,  parametric design, [[computer animation]], computer-aided physical analysis and design optimisation.

A '''proportional–integral–derivative controller''' ('''PID controller''' or '''three-term controller''') is a [[control loop]] [[feedback mechanism]] widely used in [[industrial control system]]s and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an ''error value'' &lt;math&gt;e(t)&lt;/math&gt; as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] (SP) and a measured [[process variable]] (PV) and applies a correction based on [[Proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms (denoted ''P'', ''I'', and ''D'' respectively), hence the name.

In practical terms it automatically applies accurate and responsive correction to a control function. An everyday example is the [[cruise control]] on a car, where external influences such as hills (gradients) would decrease speed. The PID algorithm restores from current speed to the desired speed in an optimal way, without delay or overshoot, by controlling the power output of the vehicle's engine. 

The first theoretical analysis and practical application was in the field of automatic steering systems for ships, developed from the early 1920s onwards. It was then used for automatic process control in manufacturing industry, where it was widely implemented in pneumatic, and then electronic, [[Controller (control theory)|controllers]]. Today there is universal use of the PID concept in applications requiring accurate and optimised automatic control.

==Fundamental operation==
[[File:PID en.svg|thumb|400x400px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller in a feedback loop. ''r''(''t'') is the desired process value or setpoint (SP), and ''y''(''t'') is the measured process value (PV).]] 
The distinguishing feature of the PID controller is the ability to use the three ''control terms'' of proportional, integral and derivative influence on the controller output to apply accurate and optimal control. The block diagram on the right shows the principles of how these terms are generated and applied. It shows a PID controller, which continuously calculates an ''error value'' &lt;math&gt;e(t)&lt;/math&gt; as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]]&lt;math&gt;\text{SP} = r(t)&lt;/math&gt; and a measured [[process variable]] &lt;math&gt;\text{PV} = y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and applies a correction based on [[proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms. The controller attempts to minimize the error over time by adjustment of a ''control variable'' &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt;, such as the opening of a [[control valve]], to a new value determined by a [[weighted sum]] of the control terms.

In this model:
* Term '''P''' is proportional to the current value of the SP − PV error ''e''(''t''). For example, if the error is large and positive, the control output will be proportionately large and positive, taking into account the gain factor "K". Using proportional control alone in a process with compensation such as temperature control, will result in an error between the setpoint and the actual process value, because it requires an error to generate the proportional response. If there is no error, there is no corrective response.
* Term '''I''' accounts for past values of the SP − PV error and integrates them over time to produce the ''I'' term. For example, if there is a residual SP − PV error after the application of proportional control, the integral term seeks to eliminate the residual error by adding a control effect due to the historic cumulative value of the error. When the error is eliminated, the integral term will cease to grow. This will result in the proportional effect diminishing as the error decreases, but this is compensated for by the growing integral effect.
* Term '''D''' is a best estimate of the future trend of the SP − PV error, based on its current rate of change. It is sometimes called "anticipatory control", as it is effectively seeking to reduce the effect of the SP − PV error by exerting a control influence generated by the rate of error change. The more rapid the change, the greater the controlling or dampening effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eolss.net/ebooks/Sample%20Chapters/C18/E6-43-03-03.pdf | title = PID Control | last = Araki | first = M. | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Tuning''' – The balance of these effects is achieved by "loop tuning" (see later) to produce the optimal control function. The tuning constants are shown below as "K" and must be derived for each control application, as they depend on the response characteristics of the complete loop external to the controller. These are dependent on the behaviour of the measuring sensor, the final control element (such as a control valve), any control signal delays and the process itself. Approximate values of constants can usually be initially entered knowing the type of application, but they are normally refined, or tuned, by "bumping" the process in practice by introducing a setpoint change and observing the system response. 

'''Control action''' – The mathematical model and practical loop above both use a "direct" control action for all the terms, which means an increasing positive error results in an increasing positive control output for the summed terms to apply correction. However, the output is called "reverse" acting if it is necessary to apply negative corrective action. For instance, if the valve in the flow loop was 100–0% valve opening for 0–100% control output – meaning that the controller action has to be reversed. Some process control schemes and final control elements require this reverse action. An example would be a valve for cooling water, where the [[fail-safe]] mode, in the case of loss of signal, would be 100% opening of the valve; therefore 0% controller output needs to cause 100% valve opening.

===Mathematical form===
The overall control function can be expressed mathematically as
:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = K_\text{p} e(t) + K_\text{i} \int_0^t e(t') \,dt' + K_\text{d} \frac{de(t)}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;K_\text{p}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt;, all non-negative, denote the coefficients for the [[proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms respectively (sometimes denoted ''P'', ''I'', and ''D'').

In the ''standard form'' of the equation (see later in article), &lt;math&gt;K_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt; are respectively replaced by &lt;math&gt;K_\text{p}/T_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_\text{p} T_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt;; the advantage of this being that &lt;math&gt;T_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt; have some understandable physical meaning, as they represent the integration time and the derivative time respectively.

===Selective use of control terms===
Although a PID controller has three control terms, some applications use only one or two terms to provide the appropriate control. This is achieved by setting the unused parameters to zero and is called a PI, PD, P or I controller in the absence of the other control actions. PI controllers are fairly common, since derivative action is sensitive to measurement noise, whereas the absence of an integral term may prevent the system from reaching its target value.

===Applicability===
The use of the PID algorithm does not guarantee [[optimal control]] of the system or its [[Nyquist stability criterion|control stability]] {{See below |Limitations of PID control}}. Situations may occur where there are excessive delays: the measurement of the process value is delayed, or the control action does not apply quickly enough.  In these cases [[Lead–lag compensator|lead–lag compensation]] is required to be effective. The response of the controller can be described in terms of its responsiveness to an error, the degree to which the system [[overshoot (signal)|overshoots]] a setpoint, and the degree of any system oscillation. But the PID controller is broadly applicable, since it relies only on the response of the measured process variable, not on knowledge or a model of the underlying process.

==History==
[[File:Scross helmsman.jpg|thumb|Early PID theory was developed by observing the actions of [[helmsmen]] in keeping a vessel on course in the face of varying influences such as wind and sea state.]]
[[File:Pneumatische regelaar.jpg|thumb|Pneumatic PID (Three term) controller. The magnitude of the "three terms" P, I and D are adjusted by the dials at the top.]]
===Origins===
Continuous control, before PID controllers were fully understood and implemented, has one of its origins in the [[centrifugal governor]] which uses rotating weights to control a process. This had been invented by [[Christian Huygens]] in the 17th century to regulate the gap between [[millstone]]s in [[windmill]]s depending on the speed of rotation, and thereby compensate for the variable speed of grain feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hills|first=Richard L|title=Power From the Wind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Adaptive Control Processes: A Guided Tour |author=Richard E. Bellman |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=December 8, 2015 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwbWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22Centrifugal+Governor%22+Huygens&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq8cC3uaHPAhWCmBoKHR2OCqwQ6AEIPjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Centrifugal%20Governor%22%20Huygens&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the invention of the low-pressure, stationary steam engine there was a need for automatic speed control, and [[James Watt]]’s self-designed, "conical pendulum" governor, a set of revolving steel balls attached to a vertical spindle by link arms, came to be an industry standard. This was based on the mill stone gap control concept.&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt;

Rotating governor speed control, however, was still variable under conditions of varying load, where the shortcoming of what is now known as proportional control alone was evident. The error between the desired speed and the actual speed would increase with increasing load. In the 19th century the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1868 in his now-famous paper ''On Governors''. He explored the mathematical basis for control stability, and progressed a good way towards a solution, but made an appeal for mathematicians to examine the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. C. |last=Maxwell |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell |title=On Governors |date=1868 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=100 |issue= |pages= |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/On_Governors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt;  The problem was examined further by [[Edward Routh]] in 1874, [[Jacques Charles François Sturm|Charles Sturm]] and in 1895, [[Adolf Hurwitz]], who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria.&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt;
In practice, speed governors were further refined, notably by American scientist [[Willard Gibbs]], who in 1872 theoretically analysed Watt’s conical pendulum governor.

About this time, the invention of the [[Whitehead torpedo]] posed a control problem which required accurate control of the running depth. Use of a depth pressure sensor alone proved inadequate, and a pendulum which measured the fore and aft pitch of the torpedo was combined with depth measurement to become the [[pendulum-and-hydrostat control]]. Pressure control provided only a proportional control which, if the control gain was too high, would become unstable and go into overshoot, with considerable instability of depth-holding. The pendulum added what is now known as derivative control, which damped the oscillations by detecting the torpedo dive/climb angle and thereby the rate of change of depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newpower |first=Anthony |title=Iron Men and Tin Fish: The Race to Build a Better Torpedo during World War II |publisher=Praeger Security International |year=2006 |isbn=0-275-99032-X}} p.&amp;nbsp; citing {{citation |first=Edwyn |last=Gray |title=The Devil's Device: Robert Whitehead and the History of the Torpedo |location=Annapolis, MD |publisher=U.S. Naval Institute |date=1991 |page=33 |ref=none}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This development (named by Whitehead as  "The Secret" to give no clue to its action) was around 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sleeman |first=C.

Another early example of a PID-type  controller was developed by [[Elmer Sperry]] in 1911 for ship-steering, though his work was intuitive rather than mathematically-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html |title=A Brief Building Automation History |accessdate=2011-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708104028/http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 1922, however, that a formal control law for what we now call PID or three-term control was first developed using theoretical analysis, by [[Russian American]] engineer [[Nicolas Minorsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Nicolas |authorlink=Nicolas Minorsky |title=Directional stability of automatically steered bodies |journal=J. Amer. Soc. Naval Eng. |year=1922 |volume=34 |pages=280–309 |issue=2 |ref=harv |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; |doi=10.1111/j.1559-3584.1922.tb04958.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minorsky was researching and designing automatic ship steering for the US Navy and based his analysis on observations of a [[helmsman]]. He noted the helmsman steered the ship based not only on the current course error, but also on past error, as well as the current rate of change;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|loc = [https://books.google.com/books?id=VD_b81J3yFoC&amp;pg=PA67 p. 67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was then given a mathematical treatment by Minorsky.&lt;ref name="ben96"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His goal was stability, not general control, which simplified the problem significantly. While proportional control provided stability against small disturbances, it was insufficient for dealing with a steady disturbance, notably a stiff gale (due to [[#Steady-state error|steady-state error]]), which required adding the integral term. Finally, the derivative term was added to improve stability and control.

Trials were carried out on the [[USS New Mexico (BB-40)|USS ''New Mexico'']], with the controllers controlling the ''[[angular velocity]]'' (not angle) of the rudder. PI control yielded sustained yaw (angular error) of ±2°. Adding the D element yielded a yaw error of ±1/6°, better than most helmsmen could achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Navy ultimately did not adopt the system due to resistance by personnel. Similar work was carried out and published by several others in the 1930s.

===Industrial control===
[[File:Nozzle and flapper proportional controller.png|thumb|Proportional control using nozzle and flapper high gain amplifier and negative feedback]]
The wide use of feedback controllers did not become feasible until the development of wide band high-gain amplifiers to use the concept of negative feedback. This had been developed in telephone engineering electronics by [[Harold Black]] in the late 1920s, but not published until 1934.&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt; Independently, Clesson E Mason of the Foxboro Company in 1930 invented a wide-band pneumatic controller by combining the [[nozzle and flapper]] high-gain pneumatic amplifier, which had been invented in 1914, with negative feedback from the controller output. This dramatically increased the linear range of operation of the nozzle and flapper amplifier, and integral control could also be added by the use of a precision bleed valve and a bellows generating the Integral term. The result was the "Stabilog" controller which gave both proportional and integral functions using feedback bellows.&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt; Later the derivative term was added by a further bellows and adjustable orifice. 

From about 1932 onwards, the use of wideband pneumatic controllers increased rapidly in a variety of control applications. Compressed air was used both for generating the controller output, and for powering the process modulating device; such as a diaphragm operated [[control valve]].  They were simple low maintenance devices which operate well in a harsh industrial environment, and did not present an explosion risk in [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|hazardous locations]]. They were the industry standard for many decades until the advent of discrete electronic controllers and [[distributed control system]]s.

With these controllers, a pneumatic industry signalling standard of {{cvt|3|-|15|psi|bar|1}} was established, which had an elevated zero to ensure devices were working within their linear characteristic and represented the control range of 0-100%.

In the 1950s, when high gain electronic amplifiers became cheap and reliable, electronic PID controllers became popular, and 4–20 mA [[current loop]] signals were used which emulated the pneumatic standard. However field actuators still widely use the pneumatic standard because of the advantages of pneumatic motive power for [[control valves]] in process plant environments.
[[File:Analogue control loop evolution.png|thumb|Showing the evolution of analogue control loop signalling from the pneumatic to the electronic eras.]]
[[File:Smart current loop positioner.png|thumb|Current loops used for sensing and control signals. A modern electronic "smart" [[control valve|valve positioner]] is shown, which will incorporate its own PID controller.]]

Most modern PID controls in industry are implemented in [[distributed control system]]s (DCS), [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs), computer-based controllers or as a [[compact controller]]. Software implementations have the advantages that they are relatively cheap and flexible with respect to the implementation of the PID algorithm in a particular control scenario.

===Electronic analogue controllers===
Electronic analog PID control loops were often found within more complex electronic systems, for example, the head positioning of a [[disk drive]], the power conditioning of a [[power supply]], or even the movement-detection circuit of a modern [[seismometer]]. Discrete electronic analogue controllers have been largely replaced by digital controllers using [[microcontrollers]] or [[FPGA]]s to implement PID algorithms. However, discrete analog PID controllers are still used in niche applications requiring high-bandwidth and low-noise performance, such as laser-diode controllers.&lt;ref name="Toptica"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.toptica.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Articles_Application_Notes/toptica_AP_1012_laser_locking_2012.pdf|last = Neuhaus|first = Rudolf|authorlink = |title = Diode Laser Locking and Linewidth Narrowing|work = |accessdate = June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control loop example==
{{Further information|Control system}}
Let's take the example of a [[robotic arm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ee.hacettepe.edu.tr/~solen/ELE356/exp1.pdf|title=Position control system|publisher=Hacettepe University Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;, that can be moved and positioned by a control loop. An [[electric motor]] may lift or lower the arm, depending on forward or reverse power applied, but power cannot be a simple function of position because of the [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]] of the arm, forces due to gravity, external forces on the arm such as a load to lift or work to be done on an external object.
* The sensed position is the [[process variable]] (PV).
* The desired position is called the setpoint (SP).
* The difference between the PV and SP is the error (e), which quantifies whether the arm is too low or too high and by how much.
* The input to the process (the [[electric current]] in the motor) is the output from the PID controller. It is called either the manipulated variable (MV) or the control variable (CV).

By measuring the position (PV), and subtracting it from the setpoint (SP), the error (e) is found, and from it the controller calculates how much electric current to supply to the motor (MV).

===Proportional===
The obvious method is '''proportional''' control: the motor current is set in proportion to the existing error. However, this method fails if, for instance, the arm has to lift different weights: a greater weight needs a greater force applied for a same error on the down side, but a smaller force if the error is on the upside. That's where the integral and derivative terms play their part.

===Integral===
An '''integral''' term increases action in relation not only to the error but also the time for which it has persisted. So, if applied force is not enough to bring the error to zero, this force will be increased as time passes. A pure "I" controller could bring the error to zero, however, it would be both slow reacting at the start (because action would be small at the beginning, needing time to get significant) and brutal (the action increases as long as the error is positive, even if the error has started to approach zero).

===Derivative===
A '''derivative''' term does not consider the error (meaning it cannot bring it to zero: a pure D controller cannot bring the system to its setpoint), but the rate of change of error, trying to bring this rate to zero. It aims at flattening the error trajectory into a horizontal line, damping the force applied, and so reduces overshoot (error on the other side because too great applied force). Applying too much impetus when the error is small and decreasing will lead to overshoot. After overshooting, if the controller were to apply a large correction in the opposite direction and repeatedly overshoot the desired position, the output would [[oscillate]] around the setpoint in either a constant, growing, or decaying [[sine wave|sinusoid]]. If the amplitude of the oscillations increase with time, the system is unstable. If they decrease, the system is stable. If the oscillations remain at a constant magnitude, the system is [[marginal stability|marginally stable]].

===Control damping===
In the interest of achieving a controlled arrival at the desired position (SP) in a timely and accurate way, the controlled system needs to be [[critically damped]]. A well-tuned position control system will also apply the necessary currents to the controlled motor so that the arm pushes and pulls as necessary to resist external forces trying to move it away from the required position. The setpoint itself may be generated by an external system, such as a [[programmable logic controller|PLC]] or other computer system, so that it continuously varies depending on the work that the robotic arm is expected to do. A well-tuned PID control system will enable the arm to meet these changing requirements to the best of its capabilities.

===Response to disturbances===
If a controller starts from a stable state with zero error (PV = SP), then further changes by the controller will be in response to changes in other measured or unmeasured inputs to the process that affect the process, and hence the PV. Variables that affect the process other than the MV are known as disturbances. Generally controllers are used to reject disturbances and to implement setpoint changes. A change in load on the arm constitutes a disturbance to the robot arm control process.

===Applications===
In theory, a controller can be used to control any process which has a measurable output (PV), a known ideal value for that output (SP) and an input to the process (MV) that will affect the relevant PV. Controllers are used in industry to regulate [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[force]], [[feed rate]],&lt;ref name="Kebriaei et. al. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kebriaei|first=Reza|author2=Frischkorn, Jan |author3=Reese, Stefanie |author4=Husmann, Tobias |author5=Meier, Horst |author6=Moll, Heiko |author7= Theisen, Werner |title=Numerical modelling of powder metallurgical coatings on ring-shaped parts integrated with ring rolling|journal=Material Processing Technology|volume=213|issue=1|pages=2015–2032|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Volumetric flow rate|flow rate]], chemical composition (component [[concentration]]s), [[weight]], [[position (vector)|position]], [[speed]], and practically every other variable for which a measurement exists.

==PID controller theory==
:''This section describes the parallel or non-interacting form of the PID controller. For other forms please see the section [[#Alternative nomenclature and PID forms|Alternative nomenclature and PID forms]].''

The PID control scheme is named after its three correcting terms, whose sum constitutes the manipulated variable (MV). The proportional, integral, and derivative terms are summed to calculate the output of the PID controller. Defining &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; as the controller output, the final form of the PID algorithm is
:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = \mathrm{MV}(t) = K_\text{p} e(t) + K_\text{i} \int_0^t e(\tau) \,d\tau + K_\text{d} \frac{de(t)}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;

where
: &lt;math&gt;K_\text{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the proportional gain, a tuning parameter,
: &lt;math&gt;K_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the integral gain, a tuning parameter,
: &lt;math&gt;K_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative gain, a tuning parameter,
: &lt;math&gt;e(t) = \mathrm{SP} - \mathrm{PV}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the error (SP is the setpoint, and PV(''t'') is the process variable),
: &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time or instantaneous time (the present),
: &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the variable of integration (takes on values from time 0 to the present &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;).

Equivalently, the transfer function in the [[Laplace transform|Laplace domain]] of the PID controller is
:&lt;math&gt;L(s) = K_\text{p} + K_\text{i}/s + K_\text{d} s,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the complex frequency.

===Proportional term===
[[File:PID varyingP.jpg|right|thumb|320px|Response of PV to step change of SP vs time, for three values of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; held constant)]]

The proportional term produces an output value that is proportional to the current error value. The proportional response can be adjusted by multiplying the error by a constant ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, called the proportional gain constant.

The proportional term is given by
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = K_\text{p} e(t).&lt;/math&gt;

A high proportional gain results in a large change in the output for a given change in the error. If the proportional gain is too high, the system can become unstable (see [[#Loop tuning|the section on loop tuning]]). In contrast, a small gain results in a small output response to a large input error, and a less responsive or less sensitive controller. If the proportional gain is too low, the control action may be too small when responding to system disturbances. Tuning theory and industrial practice indicate that the proportional term should contribute the bulk of the output change.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Steady-state error====

Because a non-zero error is required to drive it, a proportional controller generally operates with a so-called ''steady-state error''.{{efn|The only exception is where the target value is the same as the value obtained when the proportional gain is equal to zero.}} Steady-state error (SSE) is proportional to the process gain and inversely proportional to proportional gain. SSE may be mitigated by adding a compensating [[biasing|bias term]] to the setpoint AND output, or corrected dynamically by adding an integral term.

===Integral term===
[[File:Change with Ki.png|right|thumb|320px|Response of PV to step change of SP vs time, for three values of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; held constant)]]

The contribution from the integral term is proportional to both the magnitude of the error and the duration of the error. The [[integral]] in a PID controller is the sum of the instantaneous error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have been corrected previously. The accumulated error is then multiplied by the integral gain (''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) and added to the controller output.

The integral term is given by
:&lt;math&gt;I_\text{out} = K_\text{i} \int_0^t e(\tau) \,d\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral term accelerates the movement of the process towards setpoint and eliminates the residual steady-state error that occurs with a pure proportional controller. However, since the integral term responds to accumulated errors from the past, it can cause the present value to [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] the setpoint value (see [[#Loop tuning|the section on loop tuning]]).

===Derivative term===
[[File:Change with Kd.png|right|thumb|320px|Response of PV to step change of SP vs time, for three values of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; (''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; held constant)]]

The derivative of the process error is calculated by determining the slope of the error over time and multiplying this rate of change by the derivative gain ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. The magnitude of the contribution of the derivative term to the overall control action is termed the derivative gain, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.

The derivative term is given by
:&lt;math&gt;D_\text{out} = K_\text{d} \frac{de(t)}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

Derivative action predicts system behavior and thus improves settling time and stability of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=Introduction&amp;section=ControlPID |title=Introduction: PID Controller Design |publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=PID without a PhD |url=http://igor.chudov.com/manuals/Servo-Tuning/PID-without-a-PhD.pdf |publisher=EE Times-India |date=October 2000 |author=Tim Wescott}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ideal derivative is not [[causal system|causal]], so that implementations of PID controllers include an additional low-pass filtering for the derivative term to limit the high-frequency gain and noise. Derivative action is seldom used in practice though – by one estimate in only 25% of deployed controllers {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} – because of its variable impact on system stability in real-world applications.

==Loop tuning==
''Tuning'' a control loop is the adjustment of its control parameters (proportional band/gain, integral gain/reset, derivative gain/rate) to the optimum values for the desired control response. Stability (no unbounded oscillation) is a basic requirement, but beyond that, different systems have different behavior, different applications have different requirements, and requirements may conflict with one another.

PID tuning is a difficult problem, even though there are only three parameters and in principle is simple to describe, because it must satisfy complex criteria within the [[#Limitations of PID control|limitations of PID control]]. There are accordingly various methods for loop tuning, and more sophisticated techniques are the subject of patents; this section describes some traditional manual methods for loop tuning.

Designing and tuning a PID controller appears to be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. PID controllers often provide acceptable control using default tunings, but performance can generally be improved by careful tuning, and performance may be unacceptable with poor tuning. Usually, initial designs need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired.

Some processes have a degree of [[nonlinear system|nonlinearity]] and so parameters that work well at full-load conditions don't work when the process is starting up from no-load; this can be corrected by [[gain scheduling]] (using different parameters in different operating regions).

===Stability===

If the PID controller parameters (the gains of the proportional, integral and derivative terms) are chosen incorrectly, the controlled process input can be unstable, i.e., its output [[divergence (computer science)|diverges]], with or without [[oscillation]], and is limited only by saturation or mechanical breakage. Instability is caused by ''excess'' gain, particularly in the presence of significant lag.

Generally, stabilization of response is required and the process must not oscillate for any combination of process conditions and setpoints, though sometimes [[marginal stability]] (bounded oscillation) is acceptable or desired.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Mathematically, the origins of instability can be seen in the Laplace domain.&lt;ref name=Bechhoefer&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bechhoefer | first = John | title = Feedback for Physicists: A Tutorial Essay On Control | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 783–835 | publisher = APS Physics | url = http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.77.783 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.77.783| citeseerx = 10.1.1.124.7043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total loop transfer function is:
:&lt;math&gt;H(s)=\frac{K(s)G(s)}{1+K(s)G(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;K(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the PID transfer function and
:&lt;math&gt;G(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the plant transfer function

The system is called unstable where the closed loop transfer function diverges for some &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bechhoefer"/&gt; This happens for situations where &lt;math&gt;K(s)G(s)=-1&lt;/math&gt;. Typically, this happens when &lt;math&gt;|K(s)G(s)|=1&lt;/math&gt; with a 180 degree phase shift. Stability is guaranteed when &lt;math&gt;K(s)G(s)&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; for frequencies that suffer high phase shifts. A more general formalism of this effect is known as the [[Nyquist stability criterion]].

===Optimal behavior===
The optimal behavior on a process change or setpoint change varies depending on the application.

Two basic requirements are ''regulation'' (disturbance rejection&amp;nbsp;– staying at a given setpoint) and ''command tracking'' (implementing setpoint changes)&amp;nbsp;– these refer to how well the controlled variable tracks the desired value. Specific criteria for command tracking include [[rise time]] and [[settling time]]. Some processes must not allow an overshoot of the process variable beyond the setpoint if, for example, this would be unsafe. Other processes must minimize the energy expended in reaching a new setpoint.

===Overview of tuning methods===
There are several methods for tuning a PID loop. The most effective methods generally involve the development of some form of process model, then choosing P, I, and D based on the dynamic model parameters. Manual tuning methods can be relatively time consuming, particularly for systems with long loop times.

The choice of method will depend largely on whether or not the loop can be taken "offline" for tuning, and on the response time of the system. If the system can be taken offline, the best tuning method often involves subjecting the system to a step change in input, measuring the output as a function of time, and using this response to determine the control parameters. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Manual tuning===
If the system must remain online, one tuning method is to first set &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; values to zero. Increase the &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; until the output of the loop oscillates, then the &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; should be set to approximately half of that value for a "quarter amplitude decay" type response. Then increase &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt; until any offset is corrected in sufficient time for the process. However, too much &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt; will cause instability. Finally, increase &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt;, if required, until the loop is acceptably quick to reach its reference after a load disturbance. However, too much &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; will cause excessive response and overshoot. A fast PID loop tuning usually overshoots slightly to reach the setpoint more quickly; however, some systems cannot accept overshoot, in which case an [[overdamped]] closed-loop system is required, which will require a &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; setting significantly less than half that of the &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; setting that was causing oscillation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Ziegler–Nichols method===
{{Details|Ziegler–Nichols method}}

Another heuristic tuning method is formally known as the [[Ziegler–Nichols method]], introduced by [[John G. Ziegler]] and [[Nathaniel B. Nichols]] in the 1940s. As in the method above, the &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; gains are first set to zero. The proportional gain is increased until it reaches the ultimate gain, &lt;math&gt;K_u&lt;/math&gt;, at which the output of the loop starts to oscillate. &lt;math&gt;K_u&lt;/math&gt; and the oscillation period &lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt; are used to set the gains as follows:

| &lt;math&gt;3{K_u}{T_u}/40&lt;/math&gt;
|}

These gains apply to the ideal, parallel form of the PID controller. When applied to the standard PID form, only the integral and derivative time parameters &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_d&lt;/math&gt; are dependent on the oscillation period &lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt;. Please see the section "[[#Alternative nomenclature and PID forms|Alternative nomenclature and PID forms]]".

===Cohen–Coon parameters===
This method was developed in 1953 and is based on a first-order + time delay model. Similar to the [[Ziegler–Nichols method]], a set of tuning parameters were developed to yield a closed-loop response with a decay ratio of 1/4. Arguably the biggest problem with these parameters is that a small change in the process parameters could potentially cause a closed-loop system to become unstable

===Relay (Åström–Hägglund) method===
Published in 1984 by [[Karl Johan Åström]] and Tore Hägglund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.controleng.com/search/search-single-display/relay-method-automates-pid-loop-tuning/4a5774decc.html |title=Relay Method Automates PID Loop Tuning |first=Vance |last=VanDoren |journal=Control Engineering |date=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relay method temporarily operates the process using [[bang-bang control]] and measures the resultant oscillations.  The output is switched (as if by a [[relay]], hence the name) between two values of the control variable.  The values must be chosen so the process will cross the setpoint, but need not be 0% and 100%; by choosing suitable values, dangerous oscillations can be avoided.

As long as the process variable is below the setpoint, the control output is set to the higher value.  As soon as it rises above the setpoint, the control output is set to the lower value.  Ideally, the output waveform is nearly square, spending equal time above and below the setpoint.  The period and amplitude of the resultant oscillations are measured, and used to compute the ultimate gain and period, which are then fed into the Ziegler–Nichols method.

Specifically, the ultimate period &lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be equal to the observed period, and the ultimate gain is computed as &lt;math&gt;K_u = 4b/\pi a,&lt;/math&gt; where {{mvar|a}} is the amplitude of the process variable oscillation, and {{mvar|b}} is the amplitude of the control output change which caused it.

There are numerous variants on the relay method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Review of Relay Auto-tuning Methods for the Tuning of PID-type Controllers |first=Stephen |last=Hornsey |journal=Reinvention |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=29 October 2012 |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/iatl/reinvention/issues/volume5issue2/hornsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PID tuning software===
Most modern industrial facilities no longer tune loops using the manual calculation methods shown above. Instead, PID tuning and loop optimization software are used to ensure consistent results. These software packages will gather the data, develop process models, and suggest optimal tuning. Some software packages can even develop tuning by gathering data from reference changes.

Mathematical PID loop tuning induces an impulse in the system, and then uses the controlled system's frequency response to design the PID loop values. In loops with response times of several minutes, mathematical loop tuning is recommended, because trial and error can take days just to find a stable set of loop values. Optimal values are harder to find. Some digital loop controllers offer a self-tuning feature in which very small setpoint changes are sent to the process, allowing the controller itself to calculate optimal tuning values.

Other formulas are available to tune the loop according to different performance criteria. Many patented formulas are now embedded within PID tuning software and hardware modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Yun |last1=Li |first2=Kiam Heong |last2=Ang |first3=Gregory C.Y. |last3=Chong |title=Patents, software, and hardware for PID control: An overview and analysis of the current art |journal=IEEE Control Systems Magazine |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=42–54 |date=February 2006 |url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3816/1/IEEE2pdf.pdf |doi=10.1109/MCS.2006.1580153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in automated PID loop tuning software also deliver algorithms for tuning PID Loops in a dynamic or non-steady state (NSS) scenario. The software will model the dynamics of a process, through a disturbance, and calculate PID control parameters in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |title=On Automation of the PID Tuning Procedure |first=Kristian |last=Soltesz |publisher=[[Lund university]] |date=January 2012 |type=[[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] theis |url=http://www.control.lth.se/documents/2012/sol2012lic.pdf |id=[http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/2293573 847ca38e-93e8-4188-b3d5-8ec6c23f2132]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations of PID control==
While PID controllers are applicable to many control problems, and often perform satisfactorily without any improvements or only coarse tuning, they can perform poorly in some applications, and do not in general provide [[optimal control|''optimal'' control]]. The fundamental difficulty with PID control is that it is a feedback control system, with ''constant'' parameters, and no direct knowledge of the process, and thus overall performance is reactive and a compromise. While PID control is the best controller in an [[state observer|observer]] without a model of the process, better performance can be obtained by overtly modeling the actor of the process without resorting to an observer.

PID controllers, when used alone, can give poor performance when the PID loop gains must be reduced so that the control system does not overshoot, oscillate or [[hunting oscillation|hunt]] about the control setpoint value. They also have difficulties in the presence of non-linearities, may trade-off regulation versus response time, do not react to changing process behavior (say, the process changes after it has warmed up), and have lag in responding to large disturbances.

The most significant improvement is to incorporate [[feed-forward control]] with knowledge about the system, and using the PID only to control error. Alternatively, PIDs can be modified in more minor ways, such as by changing the parameters (either [[gain scheduling]] in different use cases or adaptively modifying them based on performance), improving measurement (higher sampling rate, precision, and accuracy, and low-pass filtering if necessary), or cascading multiple PID controllers.

===Linearity===
Another problem faced with PID controllers is that they are linear, and in particular symmetric. Thus, performance of PID controllers in non-linear systems (such as [[HVAC control system|HVAC systems]]) is variable. For example, in temperature control, a common use case is active heating (via a heating element) but passive cooling (heating off, but no cooling), so overshoot can only be corrected slowly – it cannot be forced downward. In this case the PID should be tuned to be overdamped, to prevent or reduce overshoot, though this reduces performance (it increases settling time).

===Noise in derivative===

A problem with the derivative term is that it amplifies higher frequency measurement or process [[noise]] that can cause large amounts of change in the output. It is often helpful to filter the measurements with a [[low-pass filter]] in order to remove higher-frequency noise components. As low-pass filtering and derivative control can cancel each other out, the amount of filtering is limited. So low noise instrumentation can be important. A nonlinear [[median filter]] may be used, which improves the filtering efficiency and practical performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3815/1/IEEE_CS_PID_01580152.pdf Li, Y. and Ang, K.H. and Chong, G.C.Y. (2006) PID control system analysis and design - Problems, remedies, and future directions]. IEEE Control Systems Magazine, 26 (1). pp. 32-41. {{ISSN|0272-1708}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the differential band can be turned off with little loss of control. This is equivalent to using the PID controller as a [[#PI controller|PI controller]].

==Modifications to the PID algorithm==
The basic PID algorithm presents some challenges in control applications that have been addressed by minor modifications to the PID form.

===Integral windup===
{{Details|Integral windup}}

One common problem resulting from the ideal PID implementations is [[integral windup]]. Following a large change in setpoint the integral term can accumulate an error larger than the maximal value for the regulation variable (windup), thus the system overshoots and continues to increase until this accumulated error is unwound. This problem can be addressed by:

*Disabling the integration until the PV has entered the controllable region
*Preventing the integral term from accumulating above or below pre-determined bounds
*Back-calculating the integral term to constrain the regulator output within feasible bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.controlguru.com/2008/021008.html|last=Cooper|first=Douglas|title=Integral (Reset) Windup, Jacketing Logic and the Velocity PI Form|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overshooting from known disturbances===
For example, a PID loop is used to control the temperature of an electric resistance furnace where the system has stabilized. Now when the door is opened and something cold is put into the furnace the temperature drops below the setpoint. The integral function of the controller tends to compensate for error by introducing another error in the positive direction. This overshoot can be avoided by freezing of the integral function after the opening of the door for the time the control loop typically needs to reheat the furnace.

===PI controller===
[[File:PI controller.svg|thumb|300x300px|Basic block of a PI controller]]&lt;!--redirects link here--&gt;

A '''PI Controller''' (proportional-integral controller) is a special case of the PID controller in which the derivative (D) of the error is not used.

The controller output is given by
:&lt;math&gt;K_P \Delta + K_I \int \Delta\,dt&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the error or deviation of actual measured value ('''''PV''''') from the setpoint ('''''SP''''').
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = SP - PV.&lt;/math&gt;

A PI controller can be modelled easily in software such as [[Simulink]] or [[Xcos]] using a "flow chart" box involving [[Laplace transform|Laplace]] operators:
:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{G(1+\tau s)}{\tau s}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;G = K_P&lt;/math&gt; = proportional gain
:&lt;math&gt;\frac G \tau = K_I&lt;/math&gt; = integral gain

Setting a value for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is often a trade off between decreasing overshoot and increasing settling time.

The lack of derivative action may make the system more steady in the steady state in the case of noisy data. This is because derivative action is more sensitive to higher-frequency terms in the inputs.

Without derivative action, a PI-controlled system is less responsive to real (non-noise) and relatively fast alterations in state and so the system will be slower to reach setpoint and slower to respond to perturbations than a well-tuned PID system may be.

===Deadband===
Many PID loops control a mechanical device (for example, a valve). Mechanical maintenance can be a major cost and wear leads to control degradation in the form of either [[stiction]] or [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]] in the mechanical response to an input signal. The rate of mechanical wear is mainly a function of how often a device is activated to make a change. Where wear is a significant concern, the PID loop may have an output [[deadband]] to reduce the frequency of activation of the output (valve). This is accomplished by modifying the controller to hold its output steady if the change would be small (within the defined deadband range). The calculated output must leave the deadband before the actual output will change.

===Setpoint step change===
The proportional and derivative terms can produce excessive movement in the output when a system is subjected to an instantaneous step increase in the error, such as a large setpoint change. In the case of the derivative term, this is due to taking the derivative of the error, which is very large in the case of an instantaneous step change. As a result, some PID algorithms incorporate some of the following modifications:

;Setpoint ramping
:In this modification, the setpoint is gradually moved from its old value to a newly specified value using a linear or first order differential ramp function. This avoids the [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]] present in a simple step change.
;Derivative of the process variable
:In this case the PID controller measures the derivative of the measured [[process variable]] (PV), rather than the derivative of the error. This quantity is always continuous (i.e., never has a step change as a result of changed setpoint). This modification is a simple case of setpoint weighting.
;Setpoint weighting
:Setpoint weighting adds adjustable factors (usually between 0 and 1) to the setpoint in the error in the proportional and derivative element of the controller. The error in the integral term must be the true control error to avoid steady-state control errors. These two extra parameters do not affect the response to load disturbances and measurement noise and can be tuned to improve the controller's setpoint response.

===Feed-forward===

The control system performance can be improved by combining the [[feedback]] (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with [[feed forward (control)|feed-forward]] (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or ''error'' remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can be based on the setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.

For example, in most motion control systems, in order to accelerate a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller is being used to control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop feed-forward controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system.

===Bumpless operation===
PID controllers are often implemented with a "bumpless" initialization feature that recalculates the integral accumulator term to maintain a consistent process output through parameter changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.controlguru.com/wp/p71.html|last=Cooper|first=Douglas|title=PI Control of the Heat Exchanger|work=Practical Process Control by Control Guru|accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partial implementation is to store the integral of the integral gain times the error rather than storing the integral of the error and postmultiplying by the integral gain, which prevents discontinuous output when the I gain is changed, but not the P or D gains.

===Other improvements===

In addition to feed-forward, PID controllers are often enhanced through methods such as PID [[gain scheduling]] (changing parameters in different operating conditions), [[fuzzy logic]], or [ftp://www.cc.uah.es/pub/Alumnos/G_Ing_Informatica/Comp_Flexible/Articulos/CI.pdf computational verb logic].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Yang | first= T.|title= Architectures of Computational Verb Controllers: Towards a New Paradigm of Intelligent Control | journal= International Journal of Computational Cognition | volume= 3 | issue= 2 | pages= 74–101 | publisher= Yang's Scientific Press |date= June 2005 | ref= harv | url=  http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.152.9564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Liang| first= Y.-L.()|title= Controlling fuel annealer using computational verb PID controllers | journal= Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Anti-Counterfeiting, security, and identification in communication |pages= 417–420 | publisher= [[IEEE]] | year= 2009 | url=  http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1719210&amp;preflayout=tabs | ref= harv | display-authors= 1 | author2= &lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further practical application issues can arise from instrumentation connected to the controller. A high enough sampling rate, measurement precision, and measurement accuracy are required to achieve adequate control performance. Another new method for improvement of PID controller is to increase the degree of freedom by using [[fractional calculus#PID controllers|fractional order]]. The order of the integrator and differentiator add increased flexibility to the controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tenreiro Machado JA, et al | title = Some Applications of Fractional Calculus in Engineering | journal = Mathematical Problems in Engineering | volume = 2010 | date = 2009 | doi = 10.1155/2010/639801 | url = https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2010/639801/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cascade control==
One distinctive advantage of PID controllers is that two PID controllers can be used together to yield better dynamic performance. This is called cascaded PID control. In cascade control there are two PIDs arranged with one PID controlling the setpoint of another. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as fluid level or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, which reads the output of outer loop controller as setpoint, usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, flowrate or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} that the working frequency of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using cascaded PID controllers.{{Vague|date=February 2009}}.

For example, a temperature-controlled circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, each with its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.

The proportional, integral, and differential terms of the two controllers will be very different. The outer PID controller has a long time constant – all the water in the tank needs to heat up or cool down. The inner loop responds much more quickly. Each controller can be tuned to match the physics of the system ''it'' controls – heat transfer and thermal mass of the whole tank or of just the heater – giving better total response.

==Alternative nomenclature and PID forms==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}

===Ideal (standard) versus parallel PID form===
The form of the PID controller most often encountered in industry, and the one most relevant to tuning algorithms is the ''standard form''. In this form the &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; gain is applied to the &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;D_{\mathrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt; terms, yielding:

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = K_p \left( e(t) + \frac{1}{T_i}\int_0^t e(\tau)\,d\tau + T_d\frac{d}{dt}e(t) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''integral time''
:&lt;math&gt;T_d&lt;/math&gt; is the ''derivative time''

In this standard form, the parameters have a clear physical meaning. In particular, the inner summation produces a new single error value which is compensated for future and past errors. The proportional error term is the current error. The derivative components term attempts to predict the error value at &lt;math&gt;T_d&lt;/math&gt; seconds (or samples) in the future, assuming that the loop control remains unchanged. The integral component adjusts the error value to compensate for the sum of all past errors, with the intention of completely eliminating them in &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; seconds (or samples). The resulting compensated single error value is then scaled by the single gain &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; to compute the control variable.

In the parallel form, shown in the controller theory section
:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_0^t e(\tau)\,d\tau + K_d\frac{d}{dt}e(t)&lt;/math&gt;

the gain parameters are related to the parameters of the standard form through &lt;math&gt;K_i = K_p/T_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_d = K_p T_d&lt;/math&gt;. This parallel form, where the parameters are treated as simple gains, is the most general and flexible form. However, it is also the form where the parameters have the least physical interpretation and is generally reserved for theoretical treatment of the PID controller. The standard form, despite being slightly more complex mathematically, is more common in industry.

===Reciprocal gain, a.k.a. proportional band===
In many cases, the manipulated variable output by the PID controller is a dimensionless fraction between 0 and 100% of some maximum possible value, and the translation into real units (such as pumping rate or watts of heater power) is outside the PID controller. The process variable, however, is in dimensioned units such as temperature. It is common in this case to express the gain &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; not as "output per degree", but rather in the reciprocal form of a ''proportional band'' &lt;math&gt;100/K_p&lt;/math&gt;, which is "degrees per full output": the range over which the output changes from 0 to 1 (0% to 100%).  Beyond this range, the output is saturated, full-off or full-on.  The narrower this band, the higher the proportional gain.

===Basing derivative action on PV===
In most commercial control systems, derivative action is based on process variable rather than error. That is, a change in the setpoint does not affect the derivative action.  This is because the digitized version of the algorithm produces a large unwanted spike when the setpoint is changed. If the setpoint is constant then changes in the PV will be the same as changes in error. Therefore, this modification makes no difference to the way the controller responds to process disturbances.

===Basing proportional action on PV===
Most commercial control systems offer the ''option'' of also basing the proportional action solely on the process variable. This means that only the integral action responds to changes in the setpoint. The modification to the algorithm does not affect the way the controller responds to process disturbances.
Basing proportional action on PV eliminates the instant and possibly very large change in output caused by a sudden change to the setpoint. Depending on the process and tuning this may be beneficial to the response to a setpoint step.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{MV(t)}=K_p\left(\,{-PV(t)} + \frac{1}{T_i}\int_{0}^{t}{e(\tau)}\,{d\tau} - T_d\frac{d}{dt}PV(t)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
King&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Myke |title=Process Control: A Practical Approach |publisher=Wiley |year=2011 |pages=52–78 |isbn=0-470-97587-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes an effective chart-based method.

===Laplace form of the PID controller===
Sometimes it is useful to write the PID regulator in [[Laplace transform]] form:
:&lt;math&gt;G(s)=K_p + \frac{K_i}{s} + K_d{s}=\frac{K_d{s^2} + K_p{s} + K_i}{s}&lt;/math&gt;

Having the PID controller written in Laplace form and having the [[transfer function]] of the controlled system makes it easy to determine the closed-loop transfer function of the system.

===Series/interacting form===
Another representation of the PID controller is the series, or ''interacting'' form
:&lt;math&gt;G(s) = K_c \frac{(\tau_i{s}+1)}{\tau_i{s}} (\tau_d{s}+1)&lt;/math&gt;
where the parameters are related to the parameters of the standard form through
:&lt;math&gt;K_p = K_c \cdot \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_i = \tau_i \cdot \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;T_d = \frac{\tau_d}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1 + \frac{\tau_d}{\tau_i}&lt;/math&gt;.

This form essentially consists of a PD and PI controller in series, and it made early (analog) controllers easier to build. When the controllers later became digital, many kept using the interacting form.

===Discrete implementation===
The analysis for designing a digital implementation of a PID controller in a [[microcontroller]] (MCU) or [[FPGA]] device requires the standard form of the PID controller to be ''discretized''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19070283/Discrete-PI-and-PID-Controller-Design-and-Analysis-for-Digital-Implementation |title=Discrete PI and PID Controller Design and Analysis for Digital Implementation |publisher=Scribd.com |accessdate=2011-04-04 |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximations for first-order derivatives are made by backward [[finite difference]]s. The integral term is discretised, with a sampling time &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, as follows,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{t_k} e(\tau) \, d\tau = \sum_{i=1}^k e(t_i) \, \Delta t &lt;/math&gt;

The derivative term is approximated as,
:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{de(t_k)}{dt}=\dfrac{e(t_k)-e(t_{k-1})}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a ''velocity algorithm'' for implementation of the discretized PID controller in a MCU is obtained by differentiating &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt;, using the numerical definitions of the first and second derivative and solving for &lt;math&gt;u(t_k)&lt;/math&gt; and finally obtaining:

:&lt;math&gt;u(t_k)=u(t_{k-1})+K_p\left[\left(1+\dfrac{\Delta t}{T_i}+\dfrac{T_d}{\Delta t}\right) e(t_k)+\left(-1-\dfrac{2T_d}{\Delta t}\right)e(t_{k-1}) + \dfrac{T_d}{\Delta t}e(t_{k-2})\right]&lt;/math&gt;

s.t. &lt;math&gt; T_i = K_p/K_i, T_d = K_d/K_p&lt;/math&gt;

==Pseudocode==

Here is a simple software loop that implements a PID algorithm:&lt;ref name="codeproject"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/36459/PID-process-control-a-Cruise-Control-example |title=PID process control, a "Cruise Control" example |publisher=CodeProject |accessdate=4 November 2012 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 previous_error = 0
 integral = 0
 loop:
   error = setpoint - measured_value
   integral = integral + error * dt
   derivative = (error - previous_error) / dt
   output = Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative
   previous_error = error
   wait(dt)
   goto loop
In this example, two variables that will be maintained within the loop are [[initialization (programming)|initialized]] to zero, then the loop begins. The current ''error'' is calculated by subtracting the ''measured_value'' (the process variable, or PV) from the current ''setpoint'' (SP). Then, ''[[integral]]'' and ''[[derivative]]'' values are calculated, and these and the ''error'' are combined with three preset gain terms – the proportional gain, the integral gain and the derivative gain – to derive an ''output'' value. 

In the real world, this is [[digital-to-analog converter|D-to-A converted]] and passed into the process under control as the manipulated variable (MV). The current error is stored elsewhere for re-use in the next differentiation, the program then waits until dt seconds have passed since start, and the loop begins again, [[analog-to-digital converter|reading in]] new values for the PV and the setpoint and calculating a new value for the error.&lt;ref name="codeproject"/&gt;

Note that for real code, the use of "wait(dt)" might be inappropriate because it doesn't account for time taken by the algorithm itself during the loop, or more importantly, any preemption delaying the algorithm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3357">The '''Plebs' League''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] educational and political organisation which originated around a [[Marxist]] way of thinking in 1908 and was active until 1926.

Central to the formation of the League was [[Noah Ablett]], a [[miner]] from the [[Rhondda]] who was at the core of a group at [[Ruskin College, Oxford]] who challenged the lecturers' opposition to Marxism.  In the 1907–8 academic year, Ablett began leading unofficial classes in Marxist [[political economy]] which were attended by [[Ebby Edwards]], among others.  Ablett returned to South Wales in 1908, where he began promoting Marxist education through local branches of the [[Independent Labour Party]].&lt;ref name="pitt"&gt;[http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/History/Nextstep.html Syndicalism in South Wales], Bob Pitt&lt;/ref&gt;

A mixture of students and former students at Ruskin founded the Plebs' League in November 1908, also launching the ''Plebs' Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;''Proletcult'', Eden Paul (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first issue of the ''Plebs'', dated February 1909, Ablett contributed an article on the need for independent [[working class education]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders'', A. T. Lane (1995), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The League ran classes teaching Marxist principles and later [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] ideas.&lt;ref name="welsh"&gt;''The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales''. [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]], [[Nigel Jenkins]], Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008), p. 687 {{ISBN|978-0-7083-1953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1909, student agitation for Marxism continued at Ruskin.  The students were supported by the Principal, [[Dennis Hird]], and when he was dismissed the students went on strike, refusing to attend classes.  The rebels formed the [[Central Labour College]], which worked closely with the Plebs' League.&lt;ref name="welsh" /&gt;

By 1910, the Plebs' League was active in South Wales, Lancashire and Scotland.  Activists included [[A. J. Cook (trade unionist)|A. J. Cook]], [[William Mainwaring]], [[Mark Starr (labor educationalist)|Mark Starr]] and [[John Maclean (Scottish socialist)|John Maclean]].&lt;ref name="pitt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1986/12/ruskin.htm The Ruskin Debate: Their college or ours?], ''Socialist Worker Review 93'', [[Duncan Hallas]] (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

The League had sympathies with [[De Leonism]], primarily represented in Britain by the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK, 1903)|Socialist Labour Party]].  It later had a relationship with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="barberis"&gt;''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'', Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley (2000), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

The League was absorbed by the [[National Council of Labour Colleges]] the year after the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike]], although the ''Plebs' Magazine'' continued to appear for many years.&lt;ref name="barberis" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4778">The '''Plummer model''' or '''Plummer sphere''' is a density law that was first used by [[Henry Crozier Keating Plummer|H. C. Plummer]] to fit observations of [[globular cluster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Plummer, H. C. (1911), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1911MNRAS..71..460P On the problem of distribution in globular star clusters], ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.]]'' '''71''', 460&lt;/ref&gt; It is now often used as [[toy model]] in [[N-body simulation]]s of stellar systems.

== Description of the model ==
[[Image:Plummer rho.png|thumb|right|220px|The density law of a Plummer model]]

The Plummer 3-dimensional density profile is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_P(r) = \bigg(\frac{3M}{4\pi a^3}\bigg)\bigg(1+\frac{r^2}{a^2}\bigg)^{-\frac{5}{2}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the total mass of the cluster, and ''a'' is the '''Plummer radius''', a scale parameter which sets the size of the cluster core. The corresponding potential is

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi_P(r) = -\frac{G M}{\sqrt{r^2+a^2}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[gravitational constant]]. The velocity dispersion is

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_P^2(r) = \frac{G M}{6\sqrt{r^2+a^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The distribution function is 

:&lt;math&gt; f(\vec{x},\vec{v}) = \frac{24\sqrt{2}}{7\pi^3} \frac{N a^2}{G^5 M^5} (-E(\vec{x},\vec{v}))^{7/2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f(\vec{x},\vec{v}) = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise, where &lt;math&gt;E(\vec{x},\vec{v})=\frac12 v^2 + \Phi_P(r)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific energy]].

== Properties ==

The mass enclosed within radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;M(&lt;r) = 4\pi\int_0^r r^2 \rho_P(r) dr = M{r^3\over\left(r^2+a^2\right)^{3/2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Many other properties of the Plummer model are described in [[Herwig Dejonghe]]'s comprehensive paper.&lt;ref&gt;Dejonghe, H. (1987), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987MNRAS.224...13D A completely analytical family of anisotropic Plummer models]. ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.]]'' '''224''', 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Core radius &lt;math&gt;r_c&lt;/math&gt;, where the surface density drops to half its central value, is at &lt;math&gt;r_c =a\sqrt{\sqrt{2}-1}\approx0.64a&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Half-mass radius]] is &lt;math&gt;r_h \approx 1.3 a&lt;/math&gt;

[[Virial Theorem#Galaxies and cosmology (virial mass and radius)|Virial radius]] is &lt;math&gt;r_V = \frac{16}{3 \pi} a \approx 1.7 a&lt;/math&gt;

The radial turning points of an orbit characterized by [[specific energy]] &lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{2} v^2 + \Phi(r)&lt;/math&gt; and [[specific relative angular momentum|specific angular momentum]] &lt;math&gt;L=|\vec{r}\times\vec{v}|&lt;/math&gt; are given by the positive roots of the [[cubic function|cubic equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;R^3 + \frac{GM}{E}R^2 - \left(\frac{L^2}{2E} + a^2 \right) R - \frac{GMa^2}{E} = 0  &lt;/math&gt;.

where &lt;math&gt;R=\sqrt{r^2+a^2}&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{R^2-a^2}&lt;/math&gt;. This equation has three real roots for &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, two positive and one negative given that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;L_c(E)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L_c(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the specific angular momentum for a circular orbit for the same energy. Here &lt;math&gt;L_c&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated from single real root of the [[Cubic function #The discriminant|discriminant of the cubic equation]] which is itself another [[cubic function|cubic equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{E}\, \underline{L}_c^3 + \left(6 \underline{E}^2 \underline{a}^2 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\underline{L}_c^2 + \left(12 \underline{E}^3 \underline{a}^4 + 20 \underline{E} \underline{a}^2 \right) \underline{L}_c + \left(8 \underline{E}^4 \underline{a}^6 - 16 \underline{E}^2 \underline{a}^4 + 8 \underline{a}^2\right) = 0  &lt;/math&gt;

where underlined parameters are dimensionless in Henon units defined as &lt;math&gt;\underline{E}=Er_V/(GM)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\underline{L}_c = L_c / \sqrt{G\, M\, r_V}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\underline{a} = a / r_V = 3\pi/16&lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==
The Plummer model comes closest to representing the observed density profiles of [[star clusters]]{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}, although the rapid falloff of the density at large radii (&lt;math&gt;\rho\rightarrow r^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;) is not a good description of these systems.

The behavior of the density near the center does not match observations of elliptical galaxies, which typically exhibit a diverging central density.

The ease with which the Plummer sphere can be realized as a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte-Carlo model]] has made it a favorite choice of [[N-body simulation|N-body experimenters]], in spite of the model's lack of realism.&lt;ref&gt;Aarseth, S.

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |challenges}}

The '''problem of religious language''' considers whether it is possible to talk about [[God]] meaningfully if the traditional conceptions of God as being incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, are accepted. Because these traditional conceptions of God make it difficult to describe God, religious language has the potential to be meaningless. Theories of religious language either attempt to demonstrate that such language is meaningless, or attempt to show how religious language can still be meaningful.

Traditionally, religious language has been explained as [[Apophatic theology|via negativa]], analogy, symbolism, or myth, each of which describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The ''via negativa'' is a way of referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise [[ineffability|ineffable]] experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.

Empiricist [[David Hume|David Hume's]] requirement that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] movement, particularly the philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]. The movement proposed that, for a statement to hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically&amp;nbsp;– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued that he could not have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher [[Antony Flew]] proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.

The analogy of [[language-games|games]]&amp;nbsp;– most commonly associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein&amp;nbsp;– has been proposed as a way of establishing meaning in religious language. The theory asserts that language must be understood in terms of a game: just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done, so each context of language has its own rules determining what is and is not meaningful. Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context. Various parables have also been proposed to solve the problem of meaning in religious language. [[R. M. Hare]] used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of "bliks"&amp;nbsp;– unfalsifiable [[belief-in|belief]]s according to which a worldview is established&amp;nbsp;– which are not necessarily meaningless. [[Basil Mitchell (academic)|Basil Mitchell]] used a parable to show that faith can be logical, even if it seems unverifiable. [[John Hick]] used his parable of the Celestial City to propose his theory of [[eschatological verification]], the view that if there is an afterlife, then religious statements will be verifiable after death.

==Problem of religious language==
Religious language is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises the problem of how (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all,{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=139–140}} which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life.{{sfn|White|2010|p=1}} The French philosopher [[Simone Weil]] expressed this problem in her work ''Waiting for God'', in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him.{{sfn|McFague|1982|p=1}}

The medieval doctrine of [[divine simplicity]] also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental properties]]&amp;nbsp;– these are properties that a being can have which do not contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the [[Bible]] regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the doctrine of divine simplicity.{{sfn|White|2010|p=1–2}}

The theologian [[Sallie McFague]] believes that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased [[secularism|secularisation]] of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both [[idolatry|idolatrous]] because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.{{sfn|McFague|1982|p=1–2}}

==Classical understanding of religious language==

===Via negativa===
[[File:Rambam-portrait.jpg|thumb|18th-century depiction of Maimonides, who developed the ''via negativa'']]

[[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]] [[Maimonides]] believed that God can only be ascribed negative attributes, a view based on two fundamental Jewish beliefs: that the existence of God must be accepted, and that it is forbidden to describe God.{{sfn|Levin|Schweid|2008|p=237}} Maimonides believed that God is [[divine simplicity|simple]] and so cannot be ascribed any essential attributes.{{sfn|Hyman|2008|p=400}} He therefore argued that statements about God must be taken negatively, for example, "God lives" should be taken as "God does not lack vitality".{{sfn|Seeskin|2005|p=88}} Maimonides did not believe that God holds all of his attributes perfectly and without impairment; rather, he proposed that God lies outside of any human measures. To say that God is powerful, for example, would mean that God's power is beyond worldly power, and incomparable to any other power. In doing so, Maimonides attempted to illustrate God's indescribable nature and draw attention to the linguistic limits of describing God.{{sfn|Seeskin|2005|p=89}}

===Analogy===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that statements about God are analogous to human experience.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} An analogous term is partly [[univocity|univocal]] (has only one meaning) and partly [[Equivocation|equivocal]] (has more than one potential meaning) because an analogy is in some ways the same and in some ways different from the subject.{{sfn|Cahalan|1985|p=438}} He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, it does not mean that God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.{{sfn|Weed|2007}}

Philosopher [[Taede A. Smedes|Taede Smedes]] argued that religious language is symbolic.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=44}} Denying any conflict between science and religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, in the context of Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=41}} Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world that there can be no common standard to which both God and the world can be compared.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=43}} He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently).{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=45-46}} Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God ''pro nobis'' (for us) and not ''in se'' (as such) or ''sine nobis'' (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=44}}

In the twentieth century, [[Ian Ramsey]] developed the theory of analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by [[Alister McGrath]]. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation and the nature of God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God.{{sfn|McGrath|2011|loc=ch. 13}} The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied.{{sfn|McGrath|1998|p=183}}

===Symbolism===
[[File:Sri Guru Granth Sahib Nishan.jpg|thumb|Sikh religious text, the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Nishan, in which religious language is used symbolically]]
Philosopher [[Paul Tillich]] argued that religious faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol points to a meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in the meaning of a concept.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=134}} Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality.{{sfn|Dourley|1975|p=85–6}} Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.{{sfn|Rees|2001|p=80}}

[[Louis Dupré (philosopher)|Louis Dupré]] differentiates between signs and symbols, proposing that a sign points to something while a symbol represents it. A symbol holds its own meaning: rather than merely pointing someone towards another object, it takes the place of and represents that object. He believes that a symbol has some ambiguity which does not exist with a sign.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=1}} Dupré believes that a symbol may deserve respect because it contains what is signified within itself.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=1–2}} A symbol reveals a reality beyond what is already perceived and transforms the ways the current reality is perceived.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=2}} Dupré differentiates between religious and [[aesthetic]] symbols, suggesting that a religious symbol points towards something which "remains forever beyond our reach". He proposed that a religious symbol does not reveal the nature of what it signifies, but conceals it.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=6}}

[[Langdon Brown Gilkey]] explained religious language and experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.{{sfn|Pasewark|Pool|1999|p=103}}

In the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religious text the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], religious language is used symbolically and metaphorically. In the text, Sikh Gurus repeat that the [[religious experience|experiences]] they have while [[meditation|meditating]] are [[ineffability|ineffable]], incognizable, incomprehensible, and transensuous&amp;nbsp;– this means that there is no object of their experience that can be conceptualised.{{sfn|Singh|1990|p=185}} To overcome this, the Sikh Gurus used symbolic and metaphorical language, assuming that there is a resemblance between the mystical experience of the divine (the sabad) and those experiencing it. For example, light is used to refer to the spiritual reality.{{sfn|Singh|1990|p=186}}

===Myth===
William Paden argued that religious language uses myth to present truths through stories. He argued that to those who practice a religion, myths are not mere fiction, but provide religious truths. Paden believed that a myth must explain something in the world with reference to a sacred being or force, and dismissed any myths which did not as "[[Folklore|folktale]]s".{{sfn|Paden|1994|p=73–74}} Using the example of [[creation myth]]s, he differentiated myths from scientific hypotheses, the latter of which can be scientifically verified and do not reveal a greater truth; a myth cannot be analysed in the same way as a scientific theory.{{sfn|Paden|1994|p=73–74}}

[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] theologian [[Rudolf Bultmann]] proposed that the Bible contains [[existentialism|existential]] content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'.{{sfn|Sherratt|2006|p=81}} Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding.{{sfn|Sherratt|2006|p=82}} Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.{{sfn|Dray|2002|p=259}}

Christian philosopher John Hick believed that the language of the Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. He offered a demythologised [[Christology]], arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the [[Son of God]] was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented.{{sfn|Mbogu|2008|p=117}} Hick believed that demythologising the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.{{sfn|Hebblethwaite|1987|p=7}}

==Alternative explanations of religious language==

===Political===
Islamic philosopher [[Carl Ernst]] has argued that religious language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists.{{sfn|Ernst|2004|p=8}} Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.{{sfn|Ernst|2004|p=9}}

===Performative===
Peter Donovan argues that most religious language is not about making [[Truth claim|truth-claim]]s; instead, it is used to achieve certain goals.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=78}} He notes that language can be used in alternative ways beyond making statements of fact, such as expressing feelings or asking questions. Donovan calls many of these uses ''performative'', as they serve to perform a certain function within religious life. For example, the words "I promise" perform the action of promising themselves&amp;nbsp;– Donovan argues that most religious language fulfils this function.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=79–80}} Ludwig Wittgenstein also proposed that language could be performative and presented a list of the different uses of language. Wittgenstein argued that "the meaning of the language is in the use", taking the use of language to be performative.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=29}} The philosopher [[J. L. Austin]] argued that religious language is not just cognitive but can perform social acts, including vows, blessings, and the naming of children.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=26}} He distinguished performative statements as those that do not simply describe a state of affairs, but bring them about.{{sfn|Lawson|McCauley|1993|p=51}} Historian of religion Benjamin Ray uses the performance of rituals within religions as evidence for a performative interpretation of language. He argues that the language of rituals can perform social tasks: when a priest announces that a spiritual event has occurred, those present believe it because of the spiritual authority of the priest. He believed that the meaning of a ritual is defined by the language used by the speaker, who is defined culturally as a superhuman agent.{{sfn|Lawson|McCauley|1993|p=51–2}}

===Imperative===
British philosopher [[R. B. Braithwaite]] attempted to approach religious language [[empiricism|empirically]] and adopted Wittgenstein's idea of "meaning as use".{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=49}} He likened religious statements to moral statements because they are both non-descriptive yet still have a use and a meaning; they do not describe the world, but the believer's attitudes towards it. Braithwaite believed that the main difference between a religious and a moral statement was that religious statements are part of a linguistic system of stories, metaphors, and [[parable]]s.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=121}}

Professor [[Nathan Katz (professor)|Nathan Katz]] writes of the analogy of a burning building, used by the [[Buddha]] in the [[Lotus Sutra]], which casts religious language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children at the top of a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.{{sfn|Katz|1982|p=232}}

==Challenges to religious language==

===David Hume===
In the conclusion of his ''[[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'', Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that statements that make claims about reality must be verified by experience, and dismissed those that cannot be verified as meaningless. Hume regarded most religious language as unverifiable by experiment and so dismissed it.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|2008|p=98}}
{{Quote|Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact of existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.|David Hume|''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding''{{sfn|Clack|Clack|2008|p=98}}}}
Hume criticised the view that we cannot speak about God, and proposed that this view is no different from the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=171–2}}

===Logical positivism===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Alfred Jules Ayer.jpg|thumb|A. J. Ayer argued that religious language is meaningless because it is unverifiable.]] --&gt;
The [[logical positivism]] movement originated in the [[Vienna Circle]] and was continued by British philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]. The Vienna Circle adopted the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|distinction between analytic and synthetic statements]]: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}} To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a [[verifiability theory of meaning]], which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable.{{sfn|Weinberg|2001|p=1}} Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}}

In 1936, Ayer wrote ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', in which he claimed that religious language is meaningless.{{sfn|Attfield|2006|p=11}} He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be [[logical truth|necessarily true]], like mathematical statements.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=120}} In doing so, he rejected [[metaphysics]], which considers the reality of a world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless.{{sfn|Oppy|Scott|2010|p=8}} Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God&amp;nbsp;– theistic, atheistic and agnostic&amp;nbsp;– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}}

Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein finished his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' with the proposition that "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." Beverly and Brian Clack have suggested that because of this statement, Wittgenstein was taken for a positivist by many of his disciples because he made a distinction between what can and cannot be spoken about. They argue that this interpretation is inaccurate because Wittgenstein held the ''mystical'', which cannot be described, as important.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|1998|p=110}} Rather than dismissing the mystical as meaningless, as the logical positivists did, Wittgenstein believed that while the facts of the world remain the same, the perspective from which they are viewed will vary.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|1998|p=111}}

===Falsification===
The falsification principle has been developed as an alternative theory by which it may be possible to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning, and those that are meaningless. It proposes that most religious language is [[unfalsifiable]] because there is no way that it could be empirically proven false. In a landmark paper published in 1945, [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher [[Antony Flew]] argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs; for example, the statement "God loves us" both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not love us. Flew maintained that if a religious believer could not say what circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false, then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=120}}

Using [[John Wisdom]]'s [[Parable of the Invisible Gardener|parable of the invisible gardener]], Flew attempted to demonstrate that religious language is unfalsifiable. The parable tells the story of two people who discover a garden on a deserted island; one believes it is tended to by a gardener, the other believes that it formed naturally, without the existence of a gardener. The two watch out for the gardener but never find him; the non-believer consequently maintains that there is no gardener, whereas the believer rationalises the non-appearance by suggesting that the gardener is invisible and cannot be detected.{{sfn|Lumsden|2009|p=44}} Flew contended that if the believer's interpretation is accepted, nothing is left of the original gardener. He argued that religious believers tend to adopt counterpart rationalisations in response to any apparent challenge to their beliefs from empirical evidence; and these beliefs consequently suffer a "death by a thousand qualifications" as they are qualified and modified so much that they end up asserting nothing meaningful.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=172}} Flew applied his principles to religious claims such as God's love for humans, arguing that if they are meaningful assertions they would deny a certain state of affairs. He argued that when faced with evidence against the existence of a loving God, such as the terminal illness of a child, theists will qualify their claims to allow for such evidence; for example they may suggest that God's love is different from human love. Such qualifications, Flew argued, make the original proposition meaningless; he questioned what God's love actually promises and what it guarantees against, and proposed that God's qualified love promises nothing and becomes worthless.{{sfn|Allen|1992|p=283–284}}

Flew continued in many subsequent publications to maintain the falsifiability criterion for meaning; but in later life retracted the specific assertion in his 1945 paper that all religious language is unfalsifiable, and so meaningless.  Drawing specifically on the emerging science of [[molecular genetics]] (which had not existed at the time of his original paper), Flew eventually became convinced that the complexity this revealed in the mechanisms of biological reproduction might not be consistent with the time known to have been available for evolution on Earth to have happened; and that this potentially suggested a valid empirical test by which the assertion "that there is no creator God" might be falsified;  "the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of abiogenesis to get the job done."{{sfn|Flew|2007|p=124}}

==Analogies of games==
The analogy of a game was first proposed by [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] in an attempt to demonstrate the [[epistemology|epistemic]] unity of language. He suggested that language is like a game which everyone participates in and is played by a greater being.{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=111}} Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure of reality and that human language participates in a greater language; [[Christianity]] teaches this to be the [[logos (Christianity)|divine word]] which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ.{{sfn|Cooper|2006|p=217–218}}

Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed a calculus theory of language, which maintained that all language should be analysable in a uniform way. Later in his life he rejected this theory, and instead proposed an alternative [[language-game]] analogy.{{sfn|Labron|2006|p=28}} He likened the differences in languages to the differences in games, arguing that just as there are many different games, each with different rules, so there are many different kinds of language.{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=112}} Wittgenstein argued that different forms of language have different rules which determine what makes a proposition meaningful; outside of its language-game, a proposition is meaningless. He believed that the meaning of a proposition depends on its context and the rules of that context.{{sfn|Glock|1996|p=192–193}} Wittgenstein presented a language game as a situation in which certain kinds of language are used. He provided some examples of language games: "Asking, thanking, greeting, cursing, praying".{{sfn|Brenner|1999|p=16}}
{{quote|It is as if someone were to say: 'A game consists of moving objects about on a surface according to certain rules...'&amp;nbsp;– and we replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are others.|Ludwig Wittgenstein|''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=112}}}}
Wittgenstein believed that religion is significant because it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore believed that religious language is confessional&amp;nbsp;– a confession of what someone feels and believes&amp;nbsp;– rather than consisting of claims to truth. Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.{{sfn|Clack|1999|p=79}}

[[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips]] defended Wittgenstein's theory by arguing that although religious language games are autonomous, they should not be treated as isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical.{{sfn|Lacewing|Pascal|2007|p=173–4}}

Peter Donovan criticises the language-games approach for failing to recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=93}} Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the [[apologetics]] of some, demonstrates that they interact with each other and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=94–95}}

==Parables==

===R. M. Hare===
In response to Flew's falsification principle, British philosopher [[R. M. Hare]] told a parable in an attempt to demonstrate that religious language is meaningful. Hare described a lunatic who believes that all university professors want to kill him; no amount of evidence of kindly professors will dissuade him from this view. Hare called this kind of unfalsifiable conviction a "blik", and argued that it formed an unfalsifiable, yet still meaningful, worldview. He proposed that all people&amp;nbsp;– religious and non-religious&amp;nbsp;– hold bliks, and that they cannot be unseated by [[empirical evidence]]. Nevertheless, he maintained that a blik is meaningful because it forms the basis of a person's understanding of the world.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=173}} Hare believed that some bliks are correct and others are not, though he did not propose a method of distinguishing between the two.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=37–38}}

===Basil Mitchell===
Basil Mitchell responded to Flew's falsification principle with his own parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, even if he is seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=148}} Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views.{{sfn|Griffiths|Taliaferro|2003|p=108–109}} He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=64}}

===John Hick===
{{See also|Eschatological verification}}
Responding to the verification principle, [[John Hick]] used his parable of the Celestial City to describe his theory of [[eschatological verificationism]]. His parable is of two travellers, a theist and an atheist, together on a road. The theist believes that there is a Celestial City at the end of the road; the atheist believes that there is no such city. Hick's parable is an allegory of the Christian belief in an afterlife, which he argued can be verified upon death.{{sfn|Polkinghorne|2003|p=145–146}} Hick believed that eschatological verification is "unsymmetrical" because while it could be verified if it is true, it cannot be falsified if not. This is in contrast to ordinary "symmetrical" statements, which can be verified or falsified.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=39}}

In his biography of Hick, David Cheetham notes a criticism of Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=30}} Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued that religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=30}}

James Morris notes that Hick's eschatological verification theory has been criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in [[religious pluralism]]. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in [[bodily resurrection]] can still be verified.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=64}}

'''Project Neptune'''  is a water distribution project in the United Kingdom with the goal of establishing an optimized and more sustainable system for water distribution. The project was officially announced in April 2007, and received a budget of £2.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www-csd.eng.cam.ac.uk/themes0/water-1/project-neptune-delivering-sustainable-water-systems-by-optimising-existing-infrastructure]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, water service providers (WSPs) are legally obligated to provide drinking water to all of their customers. The difficulty in optimizing this service involves the minimum water pressure and flow standards, as well as the strict regulations regarding water quality. The innovative technologies required to support the goal of Project Neptune are either partially evolved with no proven reliability or do not exist yet. The Centre for Sustainable Development at the [[University of Cambridge]] is heading the work on integrating [[artificial intelligence]] and mathematical simulation technologies to create an efficient online reporting and analyzing system for monitoring performance of the water distribution system.

== Research priority areas ==
In order to address the technological deficiencies of the project, research priority areas (RPA) have been identified by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The RPA three key concentrations include “data and knowledge management, pressure management (including energy management), and the associated complex decision support systems on which to base interventions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savic D. A.|last2=Boxall J. B.|last3=Ulanicki B.|last4=Kapelan Z.|last5=Makropoulos C.|last6=Fenner R.|last7=Soga K.|last8=Marshall I. W.|last9=Maksimovic C.|title=Project Neptune: Improved Operation of Water Distribution Networks|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/41024(340)47|journal=Water Distribution Systems Analysis 2008|series=Proceedings|doi=10.1061/41024(340)47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific objectives of the RPA are focused on developing communication networks, sustainable technologies, real time information feedback system, and optimal operations. The function of the communication network is to evaluate the performance and reliability of already implemented hardware and sensors for collecting faraway data. In order to achieve a reduction in energy usage, sustainable technologies that develop innovative energy harvesting technology and reduce the necessity for constant battery replacement are necessary for the project. Real time information relates to acquiring knowledge related to performance of the water distribution system. Optimal operations can be achieved through improvement in understanding and analyzing relevant data, which includes online models of hydraulics. The first round of RPA work is contributing to the initiative headed by Yorkshire Water Services to install the first prototypes of Ground Penetrating Radar Systems (GPRS). The Yorkshire initiative aims to install around 490 prototypes that are connected to sensors that collect pressure and flow data on a half hourly basis.

== Development goals ==
Project Neptune’s academic and industrial partners aim to address the tasks of developing: energy saving options, online simulation model to provide an overlook of a full day’s water distribution patterns, system to mitigate and manage leakage, automate system adjustments, power harvesting methods, and optimized system for reacting to incidents.

Staff involved in the system controls department of the project have the burden of handling large amounts of data received. The Decision Support System (DSS) was developed in order to alleviate this burden and aid the staff in decision making, prioritizing urgent incidents, and identifying faulty alarms. The DSS functions to combine these strategy and decision making outputs into one single and comprehensive presentation of data for the operator.

== Partners and funding ==
The project today receives funding from the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in order to further advance understanding and contribute knowledge about optimal and efficient water supply systems. Industrial funding is also provided for the project, the main contributors include the United Utilities and Yorkshire Water Services. University of Exeter in the UK carries out research for the project in collaboration with seven other research universities located in the UK, including University of Cambridge, the University of Sheffield, Imperial College London, De Montfort University, Lancaster University, University of Leicester, and University of Sheffield.

[[File:Hypro zyklus 1 en 103.svg|thumb|345px|Sample [[hypnogram]] showing one sleep cycle (the first of the night) from NREM through REM]]
The '''sleep cycle''' is an oscillation between the [[slow-wave sleep|slow-wave]] and [[rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] (paradoxical) phases of [[sleep]]. It is sometimes called the '''[[ultradian]] sleep cycle''', '''sleep–dream cycle''', or '''REM-NREM cycle''', to distinguish it from the [[circadian rhythm|circadian]] alternation between sleep and [[wakefulness]]. In humans this cycle takes 1–2 hours.

== Characteristics ==
[[Electroencephalography]] readily shows the timing of sleep cycles by virtue of the marked distinction in [[brainwave]]s manifested during REM and non-REM sleep. [[Delta wave]] activity, correlating with slow-wave (deep) sleep, in particular shows regular oscillations throughout a good night’s sleep. Secretions of various [[hormone]]s, including [[renin]], [[growth hormone]], and [[prolactin]], correlate positively with delta-wave activity, while secretion of [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] correlates inversely.&lt;ref name=GronfierEtAl1999&gt;Claude Gronfier, Chantal Simon, François Piquard, Jean Ehrhart, &amp; Gabrielle Brandenberger, "[https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/84/8/2686/2864208/Neuroendocrine-Processes-Underlying-Ultradian Neuroendocrine Processes Underlying Ultradian Sleep Regulation in Man]", ''Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism'' 84(8), 1999; [[doi:10.1210/jcem.84.8.5893]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heart rate]] variability, well-known to increase during REM, predictably also correlates inversely with delta-wave oscillations over the ~90-minute cycle.&lt;ref name=BrandenbergerEtAl2001&gt;Gabrielle Brandenberger, Jean Erhart, François Piquard, &amp; Chantal Simon, "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/db12/f3a46522450060675caad0a86d496434f01d.pdf Inverse coupling between ultradian oscillations in delta wave activity and heart rate variability during sleep]"; ''Clinical Neurophysiology'' 112(6), 2001; [[doi:10.1016/S1388-2457(01)00507-7]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homeostasis|Homeostatic]] functions, especially [[thermoregulation]], occur normally during non-REM sleep, but not during REM sleep. Thus, during REM sleep, body temperature tends to drift away from its mean level, and during non-REM sleep, to return to normal. Alternation between the stages therefore maintains body temperature within an acceptable range.&lt;ref&gt;Pier Luigi Parmeggiani, "Modulation of body core temperature in NREM sleep and REM sleep"; in Mallick et al. (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans the transition between non-REM and REM is abrupt; in other animals, less so.&lt;ref name=McCarley2007 /&gt;

Researchers have proposed different models to elucidate the undoubtedly complex rhythm of electrochemical processes that result in the regular alternation of REM and NREM sleep. [[Monoamine]]s are active during NREMS but not REMS, whereas [[acetylcholine]] is more active during REMS. The [[activation-synthesis hypothesis|reciprocal interaction]] model proposed in the 1970s suggested a cyclic give and take between these two systems. More recent theories such as the "flip-flop" model proposed in the 2000s include the regulatory role of in inhibitory neurotransmitter [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA).&lt;ref&gt;James T. McKenna, Lichao Chen, &amp; Robert McCarley, "Neuronal models of REM-sleep control: evolving concepts"; in Mallick et al. (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Length ==
[[File:Sleep Cycle.svg|thumb|100px|Schematic illustration of a normal sleep cycle]]
The standard figure given for the average length of the sleep cycle in an adult man is 90 minutes. N1 (NREM stage 1) is when the person is drowsy or awake to falling asleep. Brain waves and muscle activity start to decrease at this stage. N2 is when the person experiences a light sleep. Eye movement has stopped by this time. Brain wave frequency and muscle tonus is decreased. The heart rate and body temperature goes down. N3 or even N4 are the most difficult stages to be awakened. Every part of the body is now relaxed, breathing, blood pressure and body temperature are reduced. The National Sleep Foundation discusses the different stages of NREM sleep and their importance. They describe REM sleep as "A unique state, in which dreams usually occur. The brain is awake and body paralyzed." This unique stage is usually when the person is in the deepest stage of sleep and dreams.&lt;ref name="Hartmann1968" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McCarley2007&gt;[[Robert W. McCarley]], "Neurobiology of REM and NREM sleep"; ''Sleep Medicine'' 8, June 2007; [[doi:10.1016/j.sleep.2007.03.005]].&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of 90 minutes for the average length of a sleep cycle was popularized by [[Nathaniel Kleitman]] around 1963.&lt;ref name=FeinbergFloyd1979 /&gt; Other sources give 90–110 minutes&lt;ref name=GronfierEtAl1999 /&gt; or 80–120 minutes.&lt;ref name=BrandenbergerEtAl2001 /&gt;

[[File:Sleeping asian elephant.jpg|thumb|left|The captive [[Asian elephant]] (pictured) is thought to have a sleep cycle of 72 minutes.&lt;ref name=Tobler1992&gt;Irene Tobler, "Behavioral sleep in the Asian elephant in captivity"; ''Sleep'' 15(1), 1992; {{PMID|1557589}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[infant]]s the sleep cycle lasts about 50–60 minutes; average length increases as the human grows into adulthood. In [[cat]]s the sleep cycle lasts about 30 minutes, in [[rat]]s about 12 minutes, and in [[elephant]]s up to 120 minutes. (In this regard the [[ontogeny]] of the sleep cycle appears proportionate with [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes, which vary in proportion with organism size. However, shorter sleep cycles detected in some elephants complicate this theory.)&lt;ref name=McCarley2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartmann1968 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tobler1992 /&gt;

The cycle can be defined as lasting from the end of one REM period to the end of the next,&lt;ref name=Hartmann1968 /&gt; or from the beginning of REM, or from the beginning of non-REM stage 2. (The decision of how to mark the periods makes a difference for research purposes because of the unavoidable inclusion or exclusion of the night’s first NREM or its final REM phase if directly preceding [[Wakefulness|awakening]].)&lt;ref name=FeinbergFloyd1979&gt;I. Feinberg &amp; T. C. Floyd, "[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22916025_Systematic_Trends_Across_the_Night_in_Human_Sleep_Cycles Systematic Trends Across the Night in Human Sleep Cycles]"; ''Psychophysiology'' 16(3), 1979; {{doi|10.1111/j.1469-8986.1979.tb02991.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 7–8-hour sleep probably includes five cycles, the middle two of which tend to be longer.&lt;ref name=FeinbergFloyd1979 /&gt; REM takes up more of the cycle as the night goes on.&lt;ref name=McCarley2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Aeschbach, "REM-sleep regulation: circadian, homeostatic, and non-REM sleep-dependent determinants"; in Mallick et al. (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awakening ==
Unprovoked awakening occurs most commonly during or after a period of REM sleep, as [[body temperature]] is rising.&lt;ref&gt;Torbjorn Åkerstedt, Michel Billiard, Michael Bonnet, Gianluca Ficca, Lucile Garma, Maurizio Mariotti, Piero Salzarulo, &amp; Hartmut Schulz. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hartmut_Schulz/publication/10948058_Awakening_from_sleep/links/0912f4ffde427e5ce9000000.pdf Awakening from sleep]", ''Sleep Medicine Reviews'' 6(4), 2002; [[doi:10.1053/smrv.2001.0202]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuation during wakefulness ==
[[Ernest Hartmann]] found in 1968 that humans seem to continue a roughly 90-minute ultradian rhythm throughout a 24-hour day, whether they are asleep or awake.&lt;ref name=Hartmann1968 /&gt; According to this hypothesis, during the period of this cycle corresponding with REM, people tend to [[daydream]] more and show less [[muscle tone]].&lt;ref&gt;Ekkehard Othmer, Mary P. Hayden, and Robert Segelbaum, "Encephalic Cycles during Sleep and Wakefulness in Humans: a 24-Hour Pattern" ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/1726608 JSTOR]); ''Science'' 164(3878), 25 April 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Kleitman and others following have referred to this rhythm as the [[basic rest–activity cycle]], of which the "sleep cycle" would be a manifestation.&lt;ref name=FeinbergFloyd1979 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Kleitman, "[https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/5/4/311/2753285/Basic-Rest-Activity-Cycle-22-Years-Later Basic Rest-Activity Cycle—22 Years Later]"; ''Sleep'' 5(4), 1982; [[doi:10.1093/sleep/5.4.311]].&lt;/ref&gt; A difficulty for this theory is the fact that a long non-REM phase almost always precedes REM, regardless of when in the cycle a person falls asleep.&lt;ref name=FeinbergFloyd1979 /&gt;

== Alteration ==
The sleep cycle has proven resistant to systematic alteration by [[drug]]s. Although some drugs shorten REM periods, they do not abolish the underlying rhythm. Deliberate REM deprivation shortens the cycle temporarily, as the brain moves into REM sleep more readily (the "REM rebound") in an apparent correction for the deprivation.&lt;ref name=Hartmann1968 /&gt;

[[Michel Jouvet]] found that cats with forebrains removed continued to display REM-like characteristics on a 30-minute cycle, despite never entering slow-wave sleep.&lt;ref name=Hartmann1968 /&gt;

In [[software project management]], [[software testing]], and [[software engineering]], '''verification and validation''' ('''V&amp;V''') is the process of checking that a software system meets specifications and that it fulfills its intended purpose. It may also be referred to as [[software quality control]].  It is normally the responsibility of [[software testing|software testers]] as part of the [[software development process|software development lifecycle]]. In simple terms, software verification is: "Assuming we should build X, does our software achieve its goals without any bugs or gaps?" On the other hand, software validation is: "Was X what we should have built? Does X meet the high level requirements?"

==Definitions==
Verification and validation are not the same things, although they are often confused. [[Barry Boehm|Boehm]] succinctly expressed the difference as&lt;ref name="PhamSoft99"&gt;{{cite book |title=Software Reliability |author=Pham, H. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc |page=567 |year=1999 |isbn=9813083840 |quote="Software Validation. The process of ensuring that the software is performing the right process. Software Verification. The process of ensuring that the software is performing the process right." Likewise and also there: "In short, Boehm (3) expressed the difference between the software verification and software validation as follows: Verification: ‘‘Are we building the product right?’’ Validation: ‘‘Are we building the right product?’’."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Verification: Are we building the product right?&lt;!--This definition is correct and sourced to Boehm. Do not change to the competing definition--&gt;
* Validation: Are we building the right product?&lt;!--This definition is correct and sourced to Boehm. Do not change to the competing definition--&gt;

Building the product right implies the use of the Requirements Specification as input for the next phase of the development process, the design process, the output of which is the Design Specification. Then, it also implies the use of the Design Specification to feed the construction process. Every time the output of a process correctly implements its input specification, the software product is one step closer to final verification. If the output of a process is incorrect, the developers are not building the product the stakeholders want correctly. This kind of verification is called "artifact or specification verification".

Building the right product implies creating a Requirements Specification that contains the needs and goals of the stakeholders of the software product. If such artifact is incomplete or wrong, the developers will not be able to build the product the stakeholders want. This is a form of "artifact or specification validation".

Note:  Verification begins before Validation and then they run in parallel until the software product is released. 

=== Software verification ===
It would imply to verify if the specifications are met by running the software but this is not possible (e. g., how can anyone know if the architecture/design/etc. are correctly implemented by running the software?). Only by reviewing its associated artifacts, someone can conclude if the specifications are met.

=== Artifact or specification verification===
The output of each software development process stage can also be subject to verification when checked against its input specification (see the definition by CMMI below).

Examples of artifact verification:
* Of the design specification against the requirement specification: Do the architectural design, detailed design and database logical model specifications correctly implement the functional and non-functional requirement specifications?
* Of the construction artifacts against the design specification: Do the source code, user interfaces and database physical model correctly implement the design specification?

=== Software validation===
Software validation checks that the software product satisfies or fits the intended use (high-level checking), i.e., the software meets the user requirements, not as specification artifacts or as needs of those who will operate the software only; but, as the needs of all the stakeholders (such as users, operators, administrators, managers, investors, etc.). There are two ways to perform software validation: internal and external. During internal software validation, it is assumed that the goals of the stakeholders were correctly understood and that they were expressed in the requirement artifacts precise and comprehensively. If the software meets the requirement specification, it has been internally validated. External validation happens when it is performed by asking the stakeholders if the software meets their needs. Different software development methodologies call for different levels of user and stakeholder involvement and feedback; so, external validation can be a discrete or a continuous event. Successful final external validation occurs when all the stakeholders accept the software product and express that it satisfies their needs. Such final external validation requires the use of an [[acceptance testing|acceptance test]] which is a [[dynamic testing|dynamic test]].

However, it is also possible to perform internal static tests to find out if it meets the requirements specification but that falls into the scope of static verification because the software is not running.

=== Artifact or specification validation ===
Requirements should be validated before the software product as a whole is ready (the waterfall development process requires them to be perfectly defined before design starts; but, iterative development processes do not require this to be so and allow their continual improvement).

Examples of artifact validation:

* User Requirements Specification validation: User requirements as stated in a document called User Requirements Specification are validated by checking if they indeed represent the will and goals of the stakeholders. This can be done by interviewing them and asking them directly (static testing) or even by releasing prototypes and having the users and stakeholders to assess them (dynamic testing).
* User input validation: User input (gathered by any peripheral such as keyboard, bio-metric sensor, etc.) is [[data validation|validated]] by checking if the input provided by the software operators or users meet the domain rules and constraints (such as data type, range, and format).

=== Validation vs. verification===
According to the [[Capability Maturity Model]] (CMMI-SW v1.1),
* Software Validation: The process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements. [IEEE-STD-610]
* Software Verification: The process of evaluating software to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase. [IEEE-STD-610]

Validation during the software development process can be seen as a form of User Requirements Specification validation; and, that at the end of the development process is equivalent to Internal and/or External Software validation. Verification, from CMMI's point of view, is evidently of the artifact kind.

In other words, software verification ensures that the output of each phase of the software development process effectively carry out what its corresponding input artifact specifies (requirement -&gt; design -&gt; software product), while software validation ensures that the software product meets the needs of all the stakeholders (therefore, the requirement specification was correctly and accurately expressed in the first place). Software verification ensures that "you built it right" and confirms that the product, as provided, fulfills the plans of the developers. Software validation ensures that "you built the right thing" and confirms that the product, as provided, fulfills the intended use and goals of the stakeholders.

This article has used the strict or [[Software verification#Narrow_scope|narrow]] definition of verification.

From a testing perspective:
* Fault – wrong or missing function in the code.
* Failure – the manifestation of a fault during execution. The software was not effective. It does not do "what" it is supposed to do.
* Malfunction – according to its specification the system does not meet its specified functionality. The software was not efficient (it took too many resources such as CPU cycles, it used too much memory, performed too many I/O operations, etc.), it was not usable, it was not reliable, etc. It does not do something "how" it is supposed to do it.

==Related concepts==
Both verification and validation are related to the concepts of [[Quality (business)|quality]] and of [[software quality assurance]]. By themselves, verification and validation do not guarantee software quality; planning, [[traceability]], configuration management and other aspects of software engineering are required.

Within the [[modeling and simulation]] (M&amp;S) community, the definitions of verification, validation and accreditation are similar:

* M&amp;S Verification is the process of determining that a [[computer model]], simulation, or federation of models and simulations implementations and their associated data accurately represent the developer's conceptual description and specifications.&lt;ref name="Missile Defense Agency"/&gt;
* M&amp;S Validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model, simulation, or federation of models and simulations, and their associated data are accurate representations of the real world from the perspective of the intended use(s).&lt;ref name="Missile Defense Agency"&gt;{{Cite document
  | year = 2008
  | title = Department of Defense Documentation of Verification, Validation &amp; Accreditation (VV&amp;A) for Models and Simulations
  | publisher = Missile Defense Agency
  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Accreditation]] is the formal certification that a model or simulation is acceptable to be used for a specific purpose.&lt;ref name="Missile Defense Agency"/&gt;
The definition of M&amp;S validation focuses on the accuracy with which the M&amp;S represents the real-world intended use(s).  Determining the degree of M&amp;S accuracy is required because all M&amp;S are approximations of reality, and it is usually critical to determine if the degree of approximation is acceptable for the intended use(s).  This stands in contrast to software validation.

==Classification of methods==
In [[mission-critical]] software systems, where flawless performance is absolutely necessary, [[formal methods]] may be used to ensure the correct operation of a system.&lt;ref name="WangPrecise14"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Bi5BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA262 |chapter=Precise Documentation and Validation of Requirements |title=Formal Techniques for Safety-Critical Systems |author=Wang, C.-W.; Ostroff, J.S.; Hudon, S. |editor=Artho, C.; Ölveczky, P.C. |publisher=Springer |pages=262–279 |year=2014 |isbn=9783319054162 |accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These formal methods can prove costly, however, representing as much as 80 percent of total software design cost.&lt;ref name="KoopmanReli07"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Reliability, Safety, and Security in Everyday Embedded Systems |title=Dependable Computing |author=Koopman, P. |editor=Bondavelli, A.; Brasileiro, F.; Rajsbaum, S. |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-75294-3_1 |isbn=978-3-540-75294-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test cases===
{{main|Test case}}
A test case is a tool used in the process. Test cases may be prepared for software verification and software validation to determine if the product was built according to the requirements of the user. Other methods, such as reviews, may be used early in the life cycle to provide for software validation.

==Independent Verification and Validation==
ISVV stands for '''Independent Software Verification and Validation'''. ISVV is targeted at safety-critical [[software]] systems and aims to increase the quality of software products, thereby reducing risks and costs through the operational life of the software. ISVV provides assurance that software performs to the specified level of confidence and within its designed parameters and defined requirements.

ISVV activities are performed by independent engineering teams, not involved in the software development process, to assess the processes and the resulting products. The ISVV team independency is performed at three different levels: financial, managerial and technical.

ISVV goes far beyond “traditional” verification and validation techniques, applied by development teams. While the latter aim to ensure that the software performs well against the nominal requirements, ISVV is focused on non-functional requirements such as robustness and reliability, and on conditions that can lead the software to fail. ISVV results and findings are fed back to the development teams for correction and improvement.

===ISVV History===
ISVV derives from the application of IV&amp;V (Independent Verification and Validation) to the software. Early ISVV application (as known today) dates back to the early 1970s when the [[U.S. Army]] sponsored the first significant program related to IV&amp;V for the Safeguard [[Anti-Ballistic Missile]] System.

By the end of the 1970s IV&amp;V was rapidly becoming popular. The constant increase in complexity, size and importance of the software lead to an increasing demand on IV&amp;V applied to software (ISVV).

Meanwhile, IV&amp;V (and ISVV for software systems) gets consolidated and is now widely used by organisations such as the DoD, FAA, NASA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivv.nasa.gov NASA IV&amp;V Facility]&lt;/ref&gt; and ESA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int ESA Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; IV&amp;V is mentioned in [DO-178B], [ISO/IEC 12207] and formalised in [IEEE 1012].

Initially in 2004-2005, a European consortium led by the [[European Space Agency]], and composed by DNV(N),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnv.com DNV Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; Critical Software SA(P),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criticalsoftware.com Critical Software SA Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; Terma(DK)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terma.com Terma Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; and CODA Scisys(UK)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scisys.co.uk Scisys Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; created the first version of a guide devoted to ISVV, called "ESA Guide for Independent Verification and Validation" with support from other organizations, e.g. SoftWcare SL (E) (&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softwcare.com SoftWcare SL Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;), etc.

In 2008 the European Space Agency released a second version, being SoftWcare SL was the supporting editor having received inputs from many different European Space ISVV stakeholders. This guide covers the methodologies applicable to all the software engineering phases in what concerns ISVV.

===ISVV Methodology===
ISVV is usually composed by five principal phases, these phases can be executed sequentially or as results of a tailoring process.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''ISVV Planning
* Planning of ISVV Activities
* System Criticality Analysis: Identification of Critical Components through a set of RAMS activities (Value for Money)
* Selection of the appropriate Methods and Tools''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Requirements Verification
* Verification for: Completeness, Correctness, Testability''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Design Verification
* Design adequacy and conformance to Software Requirements and Interfaces
* Internal and External Consistency
* Verification of Feasibility and Maintenance''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Code Verification
* Verification for: Completeness, Correctness, Consistency
* Code Metrics Analysis
* Coding Standards Compliance Verification''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Validation
* Identification of unstable components/functionalities
* Validation focused on Error-Handling: complementary (not concurrent!) validation regarding the one performed by the Development team (More for the Money, More for the Time)
* Compliance with Software and System Requirements
* [[Black box testing]] and [[White box testing]] techniques
* Experience based techniques''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Regulatory environment==
Verification and validation must meet the compliance requirements of law regulated industries, which is often guided by government agencies&lt;ref name=gpsv&gt;{{cite web

A '''torsion box''' consists of [[Sandwich theory|two thin layers of material (skins) on either side of a lightweight core]], usually a grid of beams. It is designed to resist [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] under an applied load. A hollow core door is probably the most common example of a torsion box (stressed skin) structure. The principle is to use less material more efficiently. The torsion box uses the properties of its thin surfaces to carry the imposed loads primarily through tension while the close proximity of the enclosed core material compensates for the tendency of the opposite side to buckle under compression.

Torsion boxes are used in the construction of structural insulated panels for houses, wooden [[table (furniture)|table]]s and [[door]]s, [[ski]]s, [[snowboard]]s, and [[airframe]]s - especially [[wing]]s and [[vertical stabilizer]]s,.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5949">'''Tupper's self-referential formula''' is a [[formula]] that visually represents itself when graphed at a specific location in the (''x'', ''y'') plane.

== History ==

The formula was defined by Jeff Tupper and appears as an example in Tupper's 2001 [[SIGGRAPH]] paper on reliable two-dimensional computer graphing algorithms.
&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/mooncake/papers/SIGGRAPH2001_Tupper.pdf Tupper, Jeff. "Reliable Two-Dimensional Graphing Methods for Mathematical Formulae with Two Free Variables"]&lt;/ref&gt; This paper discusses methods related to the GrafEq formula-graphing program developed by Tupper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peda.com/grafeq/|title=Pedagoguery Software: GrafEq|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the formula is called "[[self-reference|self-referential]]", Tupper did not name it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Narayanan |first1=Arvind |title=Tupper’s Self-Referential Formula Debunked |url=http://arvindn.livejournal.com/132943.html |accessdate=20 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424181239/http://arvindn.livejournal.com/132943.html |archivedate=24 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formula ==

The formula is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;{1\over 2} &lt; \left\lfloor \mathrm{mod}\left(\left\lfloor {y \over 17} \right\rfloor 2^{-17 \lfloor x \rfloor - \mathrm{mod}(\lfloor y\rfloor, 17)},2\right)\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
or, as plaintext,
{{quotation|1/2 &lt; floor(mod(floor(y/17)*2^(-17*floor(x)-mod(floor(y), 17)),2))}}

where ⌊&amp;nbsp;⌋ denotes the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]], and mod is the [[modulo operation]].

Let ''k'' equal the following 543-digit integer:

{{quotation|960 939 379 918 958 884 971 672 962 127 852 754 715 004 339 660 129 306 651 505 519 271 702 802 395 266 424 689 642 842 174 350 718 121 267 153 782 770 623 355 993 237 280 874 144 307 891 325 963 941 337 723 487 857 735 749 823 926 629 715 517 173 716 995 165 232 890 538 221 612 403 238 855 866 184 013 235 585 136 048 828 693 337 902 491 454 229 288 667 081 096 184 496 091 705 183 454 067 827 731 551 705 405 381 627 380 967 602 565 625 016 981 482 083 418 783 163 849 115 590 225 610 003 652 351 370 343 874 461 848 378 737 238 198 224 849 863 465 033 159 410 054 974 700 593 138 339 226 497 249 461 751 545 728 366 702 369 745 461 014 655 997 933 798 537 483 143 786 841 806 593 422 227 898 388 722 980 000 748 404 719}}

If one [[Graph of a function|graphs]] the set of points (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') in 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;106 and ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;17 satisfying the inequality given above, the resulting graph looks like this (the axes in this plot have been reversed, otherwise the picture would be upside-down and mirrored):

[[File:Tupper's self referential formula plot.svg]]
[[File:Tupper_formula_constant_derivation.svg|thumb|91px&lt;!-- 91px gives acceptable text rendering with least overshoot or ugly gaps --&gt;|Derivation of ''k'']]

The formula is a general-purpose method of decoding a bitmap stored in the constant&amp;nbsp;''k'', and it could actually be used to draw any other image.  When applied to the unbounded positive range 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'', the formula tiles a vertical swath of the plane with a pattern that contains all possible 17-pixel-tall bitmaps.  One horizontal slice of that infinite bitmap depicts the drawing formula itself, but this is not remarkable, since other slices depict all other possible formulae that might fit in a 17-pixel-tall bitmap. Tupper has created extended versions of his original formula that rule out all but one slice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot3big.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot2.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot.png&lt;/ref&gt;

The constant ''k'' is a simple [[1-bit color|monochrome]] [[bitmap|bitmap image]] of the formula treated as a binary number and multiplied by 17.  If ''k'' is divided by 17, the [[least significant bit]] encodes the upper-right corner (''k'',&amp;nbsp;0); the 17 least significant bits encode the rightmost column of pixels; the next 17 least significant bits encode the 2nd-rightmost column, and so on.

The '''National Autonomous University of Honduras''' (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras) is the national public university of [[Honduras]]. It was founded in 1847 and has many campuses throughout the country. It is the biggest and main university in Honduras.

== Autonomy ==
On October 15, 1957 the autonomy of UNAH was passed by decree and since then UNAH has received 6% of the government's educational budget.{{fact|date=July 2016}}

== Campuses ==

=== University city ===
{{Main|UNAH university city}}

The main campus is located in the country's capital of [[Tegucigalpa]] and is home to the university's [[Medical School]] hospital and campus. We can also find the ''Observatorio Astronómico Centroamericano de Suyapa de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras (OACS/UNAH)'', (Suyapa Central American Astronomical Observatory), which uses a 42&amp;nbsp;cm Meade telescope. 

=== Sports arena === 
UNAH University City is also home of the multi-sport arena the ''Palacio Universitario de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras'' ([[:es:Palacio Universitario de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras|es]]) one of the most modern sports multi-use buildings in Latin America, with a capacity of 12,000 people.

=== Other campuses ===
Apart from the main campus, there are eight Distance Education Centers, four Telecenters and eight Regional Centers. Among this Regional Center we can find the ''UNAH-VS'' (UNAH Valle de Sula) located at [[San Pedro Sula]], the ''Centro Universitario Regional del Litoral Atlantico'' (CURLA) located at [[La Ceiba]], and the ''Centro Universitario Regional del Centro'' (CURC) located at [[Comayagua]] Campus. It is currently Honduras' largest university in terms of student enrollment and one of the largest university systems in [[Central America]].

== Budget ==

UNAH's budget is 6% of Honduras budget, in 2016 it is 5,000,000,000 L (250 millions US $).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laprensa.hn/economia/883445-410/83000-millones-de-lempiras-son-para-las-descentralizadas&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNAH position on Latin American Universities Ranking by QS ==
{{Further|QS World University Rankings}}
Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras hold position 171 on best Latin America universities by [[Quacquarelli Symonds]], and 701+ position on [[QS World University Rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universidad-nacional-aut%C3%B3noma-de-honduras-unah#322891&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNAH Library ==
{{Main|UNAH Library}}
UNAH Library system was founded in the late 1960s; the first principal was English librarian Mary Hallam (from 1968 to 1972). This library has more than 16,000 volumes. It has a [[website]] and some [[e-book]]s.

Every campus of UNAH has its own library.

[[File:Mohamedeagle.jpg|thumb|Zoomorphic text]]
The word ''zoomorphism'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ζωον (''zōon''), meaning "[[animal]]", and μορφη (''morphē''), meaning "shape" or "form". It can mean:
* Art that [[anthropomorphism|imagines humans as non-human animals]]&lt;ref&gt;Hope B. Werness, ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of Animal Symbolism in Art'',
Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004, px. {{ISBN|0-8264-1525-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Art that portrays one species of animal like another species of animal
* Art that creates patterns using animal imagery, or [[animal style]]
* Deities depicted in animal form, such as exist in [[ancient Egyptian religion]]&lt;ref&gt;Simson R Najovits, ''Egypt, Trunk of the Tree: A Modern Survey of
an Ancient Land'', Algora Publishing, 2004, p 279. {{ISBN|0-87586-201-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Therianthropy]]: the ability to [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into animal form&lt;ref&gt;Gerina Dunwich, ''Wicca A to Z: A Modern Witch's Encyclopedia'', Kensington Pub Corp, 1998, p 155. {{ISBN|0-8065-1930-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Attributing animal form or other animal characteristics to anything other than an animal; similar to but broader than [[anthropomorphism]]
* The tendency of viewing human behaviour in terms of the behaviour of animals, contrary to [[anthropomorphism]], which views animal or non-animal behaviour in human terms

==Examples==

===Zoomorphic representation in religion===
*The appearance of the [[Holy Spirit]] like a [[dove]] in the [[New Testament]] (The Gospel According to Luke 3: 22), "and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove..."  
*[[Mark the Evangelist]] as a [[lion]] in later Christian [[iconography]]. 
* The [[netjer|Egyptian gods]] were often depicted as zoomorphic or as [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]]
* The names of the two most prominent Hebrew Bible female prophets - Deborah and Huldah - were in the Babylonian Talmud interpreted in zoomorphic terms as "wasp" and "weasel."&lt;ref&gt;Blaženka Scheuer;  Animal Names for Hebrew Bible Female Prophets, ''Literature and Theology'', Volume 31, Issue 4, 1 December 2017, Pages 455–471, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1093/litthe/frx032&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoomorphic language for things, ideas===
*A literary phrase such as "The roar of the ocean".
*[[Christian views of sin|Sin]] lurking like a beast waiting to devour [[Cain]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Synthesis: bulletin du Comité national de littérature comparée / Comitetul Național pentru Literatură Comparată, Institutul de Istorie și Teorie Literară "G. Călinescu." - 2002 "Sin is personified as (an animal?) which "crouches" at the door of Cain (Gen 4:7). As [[Gerhard von Rad]] (Genesis, 105) remarks, 'The comparison of sin with a beast of prey lying before the door is strange, as is the purely decorative use "&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanity portrayed in evolutionary context===

[[Desmond Morris]] in [[The Naked Ape]] and [[The Human Zoo (book)|The Human Zoo]], [[Robert Ardrey]] in [[African Genesis]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] in [[On Aggression]] all wrote from a [[sociobiological]] perspective. They viewed the human species as an animal, subject to the evolutionary law of [[Survival of the fittest]] through adaptation to the [[biophysical environment]].&lt;ref&gt; [[William Ickes]], ''Compatible and Incompatible Relationships'', Springer Verlag, 1985, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
*[[Fenrisulfr]], a wolf in Norse mythology
*[[Airavata]], the king god of elephants in Indian mythology.
* [[Paw feet]] [[bathtub]], with feet in the shape of a lion's paws
* The [[sphinx]] from the "[[Oedipus Rex]]" by [[Sophocles]]
* [[Elephantine Colossus]], a hotel
* In ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[Night at the Museum]]'', the [[dinosaur]]s [[Dino Flintstone|Dino]] and "Rexy" behave and vocalize like [[dog]]s.
* [[Aslan]] in [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]] is a lion that is the king of Narnia
* Robotic pets, like [[AIBO]], modeled on dogs or other animals
* In 2010 [[city planner]]s from [[Southern Sudan]], which would become independent a year later, unveiled plans for the city center of its capital, [[Juba]], to be built in the shape of a [[rhinoceros]]. The city of [[Wau, South Sudan|Wau]] was to be transformed in the shape of a [[giraffe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howden |first=Daniel |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/turn-left-at-the-horn-rhino-city-revealed-2056321.html |title=Turn left at the horn: 'Rhino City' revealed - Daniel Howden, '&amp;#39;9 August 2010'&amp;#39;.
