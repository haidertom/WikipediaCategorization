      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30851">The '''Akaike information criterion''' ('''AIC''') is an [[estimator]] of the relative quality of [[statistical model]]s for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for [[model selection]].

AIC is founded on [[information theory]]. When a statistical model is used to represent the process that generated the data, the model will almost never be exact; so some information will be lost by using the model to represent the process. AIC estimates the relative information lost by a given model: the less information a model loses, the higher the quality of that model. (In making an estimate of the information lost, AIC deals with the trade-off between the [[goodness of fit]] of the model and the simplicity of the model.)

The Akaike information criterion  is named after the statistician [[Hirotugu Akaike]], who formulated it. It now forms the basis of a paradigm for the [[foundations of statistics]]; as well, it is widely used for [[statistical inference]].

==Definition==
Suppose that we have a [[statistical model]] of some data. Let {{math|''k''}} be the number of estimated [[Statistical parameter|parameters]] in the model. Let &lt;math&gt;\hat L&lt;/math&gt; be the maximum value of the [[likelihood function]] for the model. Then the AIC value of the model is the following.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Akaiki1974" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AIC} \, = \, 2k - 2\ln(\hat L)&lt;/math&gt;

Given a set of candidate models for the data, the preferred model is the one with the minimum AIC value. Thus, AIC rewards [[goodness of fit]] (as assessed by the likelihood function), but it also includes a penalty that is an increasing function of the number of estimated parameters. The penalty discourages [[overfitting]], because increasing the number of parameters in the model almost always improves the goodness of the fit.

AIC is founded in [[information theory]]. Suppose that the data is generated by some unknown process ''f''. We consider two candidate models to represent ''f'': ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If we knew ''f'', then we could find the information lost from using ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to represent ''f'' by calculating the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]], {{Nowrap|''D''&lt;sub&gt;KL&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''&amp;thinsp;‖&amp;thinsp;''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}; similarly, the information lost from using ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to represent ''f'' could be found by calculating {{Nowrap|''D''&lt;sub&gt;KL&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''&amp;thinsp;‖&amp;thinsp;''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. We would then choose the candidate model that minimized the information loss.

We cannot choose with certainty, because we do not know ''f''. {{Harvtxt|Akaike|1974}} showed, however, that we can estimate, via AIC, how much more (or less) information is lost by ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; than by ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The estimate, though, is only valid [[Asymptotic theory (statistics)|asymptotically]]; if the number of data points is small, then some correction is often necessary (see AICc, below).

Note that AIC does not provide a test of a model in the sense of testing a [[null hypothesis]]. It tells nothing about the absolute quality of a model, only the quality relative to other models. Thus, if all the candidate models fit poorly, AIC will not give any warning of that.

==How to apply AIC in practice==
To apply AIC in practice, we start with a set of candidate models, and then find the models' corresponding AIC values. There will almost always be information lost due to using a candidate model to represent the "true model" (i.e. the process that generated the data). We wish to select, from among the candidate models, the model that minimizes the information loss. We cannot choose with certainty, but we can minimize the estimated information loss.

Suppose that there are ''R'' candidate models. Denote the AIC values of those models by AIC&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, AIC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, AIC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, …, AIC&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let AIC&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; be the minimum of those values. Then the quantity exp((AIC&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#8239;−&amp;thinsp;AIC&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)/2) can be interpreted  as being proportional to the probability that the ''i''th model minimizes the (estimated) information loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§2.9.1, §6.4.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, suppose that there are three candidate models, whose AIC values are 100, 102, and 110. Then the second model is exp((100&amp;#8239;−&amp;thinsp;102)/2) = 0.368 times as probable as the first model to minimize the information loss. Similarly, the third model is exp((100&amp;#8239;−&amp;thinsp;110)/2) = 0.007 times as probable as the first model to minimize the information loss.

In this example, we would omit the third model from further consideration. We then have three options: (1) gather more data, in the hope that this will allow clearly distinguishing between the first two models; (2) simply conclude that the data is insufficient to support selecting one model from among the first two; (3) take a weighted average of the first two models, with weights proportional to 1 and 0.368, respectively, and then do [[statistical inference]] based on the weighted multimodel.&lt;ref name="Burnham 2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantity exp((AIC&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#8239;−&amp;thinsp;AIC&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)/2) is known as the ''[[Likelihood function#Relative likelihood|relative likelihood]]'' of model ''i''. It is closely related to the likelihood ratio used in the [[likelihood-ratio test]]. Indeed, if all the models in the candidate set have the same number of parameters, then using AIC might at first appear to be very similar to using the likelihood-ratio test. There are, however, important distinctions. In particular, the likelihood-ratio test is valid only for [[Statistical model#Nested models|nested models]], whereas AIC (and AICc) has no such restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§2.12.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Murtaugh|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AICc==
When the [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] size is small, there is a substantial probability that AIC will select models that have too many parameters, i.e. that AIC will overfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McQuarrie|Tsai|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Claeskens|Hjort|2008|loc= §8.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Giraud|2015|loc= §2.9.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address such potential overfitting, AICc was developed: AICc is AIC with a correction for small sample sizes.

The formula for AICc depends upon the statistical model. Assuming that the model is [[univariate]], is linear in its parameters, and has normally-distributed [[Errors and residuals|residuals]] (conditional upon regressors), then the formula for AICc is as follows.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh"&gt;{{harvnb|Cavanaugh|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= §2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AICc} \, = \, \mathrm{AIC} + \frac{2k^2 + 2k}{n - k - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

—where {{math|''n''}} denotes the sample size and {{math|''k''}} denotes the number of parameters. Thus, AICc is essentially AIC with an extra penalty term for the number of parameters. Note that as {{math|''n'' → ∞}}, the extra penalty term converges to 0, and thus AICc converges to AIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the assumption that the model is univariate and linear with normal residuals does not hold, then the formula for AICc will generally be different from the formula above. For some models, the formula can be difficult to determine. For every model that has AICc available, though, the formula for AICc is given by AIC plus terms that includes both {{math|''k''}} and {{math|''k''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In comparison, the formula for AIC includes {{math|''k''}} but not {{math|''k''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, AIC is a [[First order approximation|first-order estimate]] (of the information loss), whereas AICc is a [[Second order approximation|second-order estimate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= §7.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further discussion of the formula, with examples of other assumptions, is given by {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= ch. 7}} and by {{Harvtxt|Konishi|Kitagawa|2008|loc= ch. 7–8}}. In particular, with other assumptions, [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap estimation]] of the formula is often feasible.

To summarize, AICc has the advantage of tending to be more accurate than AIC (especially for small samples), but AICc also has the disadvantage of sometimes being much more difficult to compute than AIC. Note that if all the candidate models have the same {{math|''k''}} and the same formula for AICc, then AICc and AIC will give identical (relative) valuations; hence, there will be no disadvantage in using AIC, instead of AICc. Furthermore, if {{math|''n''}} is many times larger than {{math|''k''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then the extra penalty term will be negligible; hence, the disadvantage in using AIC, instead of AICc, will be negligible.

==History==
[[File:Akaike.jpg|thumb|[[Hirotugu Akaike]]]]
The Akaike information criterion was formulated by the statistician [[Hirotugu Akaike]]; it was originally named "an information criterion". It was first announced by Akaike at a 1971 symposium, the proceedings of which were published in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akaike|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1973 publication, though, was only an informal presentation of the concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|deLeeuw|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first formal publication was a 1974 paper by Akaike.&lt;ref name="Akaiki1974"&gt;{{Harvnb|Akaike|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{as of|2014|October}}, the 1974 paper had received more than 14000 citations in the [[Web of Science]]: making it the 73rd most-cited research paper of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Van Noordon R., Maher B., Nuzzo R. (2014), "[http://www.nature.com/top100 The top 100 papers]", ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, AIC has become common enough that it is often used without citing Akaike's 1974 paper. Indeed, there are over 150,000 scholarly articles/books that use AIC (as assessed by [[Google Scholar]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_vis=0&amp;q=Akaike+AIC&amp;as_sdt=1,5 Sources containing both "Akaike" and "AIC"]—at [[Google Scholar]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial derivation of AIC relied upon some strong assumptions. {{Harvtxt|Takeuchi|1976}} showed that the assumptions could be made much weaker. Takeuchi's work, however, was in Japanese and was not widely known outside Japan for many years.

AICc was originally proposed for [[linear regression]] (only) by {{Harvtxt|Sugiura|1978}}. That instigated the work of {{Harvtxt|Hurvich|Tsai|1989}}, and several further papers by the same authors, which extended the situations in which AICc could be applied.

The first general exposition of the information-theoretic approach was the volume by {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002}}. It includes an English presentation of the work of Takeuchi. The volume led to far greater use of AIC, and it now has more than 42000 citations on [[Google Scholar]].

Akaike called his approach an "entropy maximization principle", because the approach is founded on the concept of [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy in information theory]]. Indeed, minimizing AIC in a statistical model is effectively equivalent to maximizing entropy in a thermodynamic system; in other words, the information-theoretic approach in statistics is essentially applying the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]. As such, AIC has roots in the work of  [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] on [[entropy]]. For more on these issues, see {{Harvtxt|Akaike|1985}} and {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;2}}.

==Usage tips==

===Counting parameters===
A [[statistical model]] must fit all the data points. Thus, a straight line, on its own, is not a model of the data, unless all the data points lie exactly on the line. We can, however, choose a model that is "a straight line plus noise"; such a model might be formally described thus:
''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Here, the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] from the straight line fit. If the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are assumed to be [[i.i.d.]] [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] (with zero mean), then the model has three parameters:
''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the variance of the Gaussian distributions.
Thus, when calculating the AIC value of this model, we should use ''k''=3. More generally, for any [[least squares]] model with i.i.d. Gaussian residuals, the variance of the residuals' distributions should be counted as one of the parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= p. 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As another example, consider a first-order [[autoregressive model]], defined by
''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''c''&amp;nbsp;+ ''φx''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, with the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; being i.i.d. Gaussian (with zero mean). For this model, there are three parameters: ''c'', ''φ'', and the variance of the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. More generally, a ''p''th-order autoregressive model has ''p''&amp;#8239;+&amp;thinsp;2 parameters. (If, however, ''c'' is not estimated from the data, but instead given in advance, then there are only ''p''&amp;#8239;+&amp;thinsp;1 parameters.)

===Transforming data===
The AIC values of the candidate models must all be computed with the same data set. Sometimes, though, we might want to compare a model of the [[Dependent and independent variables|response variable]], {{math|''y''}}, with a model of the logarithm of the response variable, {{math|log(''y'')}}. More generally, we might want to compare a model of the data with a model of transformed data. Following is an illustration of how to deal with data transforms (adapted from {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= §2.11.3}}: "Investigators should be sure that all hypotheses are modeled using the same response variable").

Suppose that we want to compare two models: one with a [[normal distribution]] of {{math|''y''}} and one with a normal distribution of {{math|log(''y'')}}. We should ''not'' directly compare the AIC values of the two models. Instead, we should transform the normal [[cumulative distribution function]] to first take the logarithm of {{math|''y''}}. To do that, we need to perform the relevant [[integration by substitution]]: thus, we need to multiply by the derivative of the [[Natural logarithm|(natural) logarithm]] function, which is {{math|1/''y''}}. Hence, the transformed distribution has the following [[probability density function]]:
: &lt;math&gt;y \mapsto \, \frac{1}{y} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\,\exp \left(-\frac{\left(\ln y-\mu\right)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
—which is the probability density function for the [[log-normal distribution]]. We then compare the AIC value of the normal model against the AIC value of the log-normal model.

===Software unreliability===
Some statistical software will report the value of AIC or the maximum value of the log-likelihood function, but the reported values are not always correct.
Typically, any incorrectness is due to a constant in the log-likelihood function being omitted. For example,
the log-likelihood function for {{math|''n''}} [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] identical [[normal distribution]]s is
: &lt;math&gt;
   \ln\mathcal{L}(\mu,\sigma^2)
    \, = \, -\frac{n}{2}\ln(2\pi) - \frac{n}{2}\ln\sigma^2 - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\mu)^2
  &lt;/math&gt;
—this is the function that is maximized, when obtaining the value of AIC. Some software, however, omits the constant term {{math|(''n''/2){{resize|20%|&amp;thinsp;}}ln(2''π'')}}, and so reports erroneous values for the log-likelihood maximum—and thus for AIC. Such errors do not matter for AIC-based comparisons, ''if'' all the models have their [[Errors and residuals|residuals]] as normally-distributed: because then the errors cancel out. In general, however, the constant term needs to be included in the log-likelihood function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= p. 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, before using software to calculate AIC, it is generally good practice to run some simple tests on the software, to ensure that the function values are correct.

==Comparisons with other model selection methods==

===Comparison with BIC===

The formula for the [[Bayesian information criterion]] (BIC) is similar to the formula for AIC, but with a different penalty for the number of parameters. With AIC the penalty is {{math|2''k''}}, whereas with BIC the penalty is {{math|ln(''n''){{resize|33%|&amp;thinsp;}}''k''}}.

A comparison of AIC/AICc and BIC is given by {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§6.3-6.4}}, with follow-up remarks by {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2004}}. The authors show that AIC/AICc can be derived in the same Bayesian framework as BIC, just by using different [[Prior probability|prior probabilities]]. In the Bayesian derivation of BIC, though, each candidate model has a prior probability of 1/''R'' (where ''R'' is the number of candidate models); such a derivation is "not sensible", because the prior should be a decreasing function of {{math|''k''}}. Additionally, the authors present a few simulation studies that suggest AICc tends to have practical/performance advantages over BIC.

A point made by several researchers is that AIC and BIC are appropriate for different tasks. In particular, BIC is argued to be appropriate for selecting the "true model" (i.e. the process that generated the data) from the set of candidate models, whereas AIC is not appropriate. To be specific, if the "true model" is in the set of candidates, then BIC will select the "true model" with probability 1, as {{math|''n'' → ∞}}; in contrast, when selection is done via AIC, the probability can be less than 1.&lt;ref name="BA6364"&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§6.3-6.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vrieze"&gt;{{Harvnb| Vrieze|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahoetal"&gt;{{Harvnb| Aho| Derryberry |Peterson| |2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of AIC argue that this issue is negligible, because the "true model" is virtually never in the candidate set. Indeed, it is a common aphorism in statistics that "[[all models are wrong]]"; hence the "true model" (i.e. reality) cannot be in the candidate set.

Another comparison of AIC and BIC is given by {{Harvtxt| Vrieze|2012}}. Vrieze presents a simulation study—which allows the "true model" to be in the candidate set (unlike with virtually all real data). The simulation study demonstrates, in particular, that AIC sometimes selects a much better model than BIC even when the "true model" is in the candidate set. The reason is that, for finite {{math|''n''}}, BIC can have a substantial risk of selecting a very bad model from the candidate set. This reason can arise even when {{math|''n''}} is much larger than {{math|''k''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. With AIC, the risk of selecting a very bad model is minimized.

If the "true model" is not in the candidate set, then the most that we can hope to do is select the model that best approximates the "true model". AIC is appropriate for finding the best approximating model, under certain assumptions.&lt;ref name="BA6364" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vrieze" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahoetal" /&gt;  (Those assumptions include, in particular, that the approximating is done with regard to information loss.)

Comparison of AIC and BIC in the context of [[regression analysis|regression]] is given by {{Harvtxt|Yang|2005}}. In regression, AIC is asymptotically optimal for selecting the model with the least [[mean squared error]], under the assumption that the "true model" is not in the candidate set. BIC is not asymptotically optimal under the assumption. Yang additionally shows that the rate at which AIC converges to the optimum is, in a certain sense, the best possible.

===Comparison with cross-validation===
Leave-one-out [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] is asymptotically equivalent to AIC, for ordinary linear regression models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asymptotic equivalence to AIC also holds for [[Mixed model|mixed-effects models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fang|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with least squares===

Sometimes, each candidate model assumes that the residuals are distributed according to independent identical normal distributions (with zero mean). That gives rise to [[least squares]] model fitting.

With least squares fitting, the [[Maximum likelihood estimation|maximum likelihood estimate]] for the variance of a model's residuals distributions is &lt;math&gt;\hat\sigma^2 = \mathrm{RSS}/n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RSS}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[residual sum of squares]]: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathrm{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-f(x_i;\hat{\theta}))^2&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the maximum value of a model's log-likelihood function is 
: &lt;math&gt;
 -\frac{n}{2}\ln(2\pi) - \frac{n}{2}\ln(\hat\sigma^2) - \frac{1}{2\hat\sigma^2}\mathrm{RSS}  
\, = \, - \frac{n}{2}\ln(\mathrm{RSS}/n) + C_1
  &lt;/math&gt;
—where {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a constant independent of the model, and dependent only on the particular data points, i.e. it does not change if the data does not change.

That gives AIC&amp;nbsp;= {{math|2''k''&amp;nbsp;+ ''n''{{resize|33%|&amp;thinsp;}}ln(RSS/''n'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus; 2''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}} 2''k''&amp;nbsp;+ ''n''{{resize|33%|&amp;thinsp;}}ln(RSS)&amp;nbsp;+ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=p. 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because only differences in AIC are meaningful, the constant {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be ignored, which allows us to conveniently take AIC&amp;nbsp;= {{math|2''k''&amp;nbsp;+ ''n''{{resize|33%|&amp;thinsp;}}ln(RSS)}} for model comparisons. Note that if all the models have the same {{math|''k''}}, then selecting the model with minimum AIC is equivalent to selecting the model with minimum {{math|RSS}}—which is the usual objective of model selection based on least squares.

'''''Arcadie''''' is an English [[webcomic]] created by Dutch artist Ties Wijnker. Described in its tagline as "Comics for people," ''Arcadie'' revolves around a broad range of subjects, often dealing with the conditions and experiences of individual characters within modern life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovelhasvoadoras.com.br/2016/09/retrato-homem-moderno.html|title= Essa tirinha é um retrato do "homem moderno"|date= September 2, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2016|work=Ovelhas Voadoras|publisher=www.ovelhasvoadoras.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurrent themes include [[irony]], [[technology]], [[entertainment]], [[boredom]], [[Social alienation|alienation]], and [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]]. Many of the comics contain absurd or [[surrealist]] characters and premises, and they often lack a clear plot or traditional punchline.

== Style and format ==

''Arcadie'' features self-contained comics, with characters and settings changing per comic. They are organized in a single-page format, with the amount of [[Panel (comics)|panels]] per comic ranging from three to several dozen. Every comic comes with an additional short text placed under it, elaborating on its ideas. The artwork consists of digital linework and coloring with little shading, producing a [[minimalist]] aesthetic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2836">The '''Arditi–Ginzburg equations''' describe [[ratio]] dependent [[Predation|predator–prey]] dynamics. Where ''N'' is the population of a prey species and ''P'' that of a predator, the population dynamics are described by the following two equations:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Coupling in predator-prey dynamics: Ratio-Dependence|url = http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022519389802115/1-s2.0-S0022519389802115-main.pdf?_tid=1565d0da-6588-11e5-a81d-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1443407265_75f5fff588be891df9d652f2e3d694ff|website = ac.els-cdn.com|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{dN}{dt} &amp; = f(N)\,N-g{\left(\!\tfrac N P \!\right)}P \\[4pt]
\frac{dP}{dt} &amp; = e \,g{\left(\!\tfrac N P\! \right)}P-uP
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''f''(''N'') captures any change in the prey population not due to predator activity including inherent [[Birth rate|birth]] and [[Mortality rate|death rates]]. The per capita effect of predators on the prey population (the harvest rate) is modeled by a function ''g'' which is a function of the [[ratio]] ''N''/''P'' of prey to predators. Predators receive a reproductive payoff, ''e,'' for consuming prey, and die at rate ''u''. Making predation pressure a function of the ratio of prey to predators contrasts with the prey dependent [[Lotka–Volterra equations]], where the effect of predators on the prey population is simply a function of the magnitude of the prey population ''g''(''N''). Because the number of prey harvested by each predator decreases as predators become more [[Population density|dense]], ratio dependent predation represents an example of a [[trophic function]]. Ratio dependent predation may account for [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]]  in large-scale natural systems in which predator efficiency decreases when prey is scarce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The merit of ratio dependent versus prey dependent models of predation has been the subject of much controversy, especially between the biologists [[Lev R. Ginzburg]] and Peter A. Abrams.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|title = The nature of predation: prey dependent, ratio dependent or neither?|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953470001908X||accessdate = 2015-09-28|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(00)01908-X|volume=15|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|pages=337–341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginzburg purports that ratio dependent models more accurately depict predator-prey interactions while Abrams maintains that these models make unwarranted complicating assumptions.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

[[Image:The cristal baschet.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The [[Cristal Baschet]]]]

The '''Baschet Brothers''' were two French artists named '''François Baschet''' (born 30 March 1920, in Paris; died 11 February 2014) and '''Bernard Baschet''' (born 24 August 1917, Paris; died 17 July 2015&lt;ref name=LeParisien /&gt;) who collaborated on creating [[sound sculpture]]s and inventing [[musical instrument]]s, such as the ''[[Cristal Baschet]]''. François Baschet was a sculptor and Bernard Baschet an engineer. The Baschet Brothers invented the [[inflatable guitar]], the aluminum piano and many other [[experimental musical instrument]]s. They created an "Baschet Educational Instrumentarium" for exposing young people to musical concepts. 
[[File:Cristal Baschet basse.png|thumb|Baschet bass cristal]] The Baschet's research started in the 1950s artistic turmoil, soon turning the two brothers into the pioneers of sound sculpture, in addition to making them highly requested by musicians, composers, experimental directors.

The quest for new sounds led the Baschet brothers to combine new materials of the time, usually through folding metal sheets into geometric shapes.
Their sculptures range from small folded sheet metal of a few centimeters up to structures several meters high with loud, impressive and complex sounds.
Their exhibitions were shown in prestigious museums throughout the world – the United States, Japan, Germany – as well as in small villages in France, always with the aim of making art accessible to all.

The work of the Baschet brothers of making sound art accessible to all continues through the official association, established in 1982: the Baschet Sound Structures Association (originally "Structures sonores et pédagogie", it changed its name in 2012). The association has the support of the Baschet family and has an exclusive licence for creating some of the Baschet reproductible works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baschet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Instruments

The [[Cristal baschet]] is a type of musical instrument designed by the Baschet brothers in the 1950s, the Cristal Baschet is played with wet fingers on glass rods.
Its continuous, enchanting sounds have inspired many artists and composers.
The current Cristal Baschet models produce a variety of sounds and can also be used in percussion. They can be fitted with numerous resonators including "moustaches" and different types of diffusers: cones and metal sheets.

The Rotating Whistler (“Le Sifflant Tournant”, created in 1962, produces the sharpest and longest sounds of all the Baschet Sound Structures. Turning the keyboard produces an unusual sound effect which does not need an amplifier cone.

Created in 1967, the Polytonal Percussion (“La Percussion Polytimbre”) includes large, straight rods that create deep, resonant sounds. The keyboard is organized with different percussive devices and cones diffuse the sound.

The Voice Leaf (“La Tôle à Voix”) was created in 1965 to mimic the Indian tempura, the metal sheets serve as resonators which transform the human voice when vibrated.

Public monuments

The Baschet brothers also created several public monuments such as clocks, fountains, bell towers and chimes – some ephemeral, some still in existence.
One of the first fountains created was made for the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130223043245/http://www.worldsfair68.info/ World's Fair], in San Antonio Texas in 1968.

They made others in the early 1970s, including in Cologne, New York, Mexico City, London and Barcelona.

Subsequently, they worked on bell towers and clocks. The Baschet "signal sonore"(or school bell) of the Blaise Pascal school is in the process of being restored in Saint-Michel-sur-Orge – the town where Bernard Baschet's studio has been since 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leparisien.fr/saint-michel-sur-orge-91240/saint-michel-la-legendaire-sculpture-sonore-va-de-nouveau-resonner-a-l-ecole-19-04-2017-6867987.php] Article in Le Parisien newspaper. Retrieved 20 April 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baschet Educational Instrumentarium

Invented in the 1980s, the Baschet Educational Instrumentarium consists of 14 sound structures which make a "sound palette" of around 100 different tones.
Its purpose is to initiate children, adults and people with disabilities in collective musical discovery through games and experimentation, and without any previous musical knowledge.

Based on the large, original Baschet sound structures, the Baschet Educational Instrumentarium creates a broad spectrum of sounds, including those not in the classical European repertoire, as well as some which resemble electroacoustic sounds.

Education in sound culture is stimulated through listening to sounds, to oneself and to others. The experience of sound is not only through listening, it is also through hands-on learning and musical improvisation.

This Instrumentarium is also used in concert by musicians. There are approximately 500 Baschet Educational Instrumentariums in existence, in France and around the world.

==Career==
François had wanted to be an artist, but his father warned him against pursuing the unstable life of an artist. He decided to study business in college, but felt no passion for it. After [[World War II]], which had interrupted his education, he decided to travel around the world. He brought with him on his trip a guitar to help him earn a living, but wanting something more portable he invented an inflatable guitar using a [[balloon]] and a collapsible wood neck. He continued to perform with this guitar upon his return to Paris. Soon he and his brother, who had studied engineering, began collaborating on sculptural musical instruments.

Beginning in 1952, the Baschets started research into all existing musical instruments and put this knowledge to work in creating dozens of ''structures sonores'' (i.e., 'sonorous sculptures'). Their visually striking instruments were crafted out of steel and aluminum and [[amplifier|amplified]] by large curved conical sheets of metal, and are most often easy to play and accessible to people with any level of experience. One example of this is the [[Hemisfair Musical Fountain]], which consists of an array of posts at the top of which are groups of conical sound diffusers, and above them circles of metal prongs. These are played by jets of water aimed by observers.

In 1954, the brothers met Jacques and Yvonne Lasry. Jacques was a pianist and composer and Yvonne was an organist. The four formed an association which they called "Lasry-Baschet Sound Structures." They held their first concerts in 1955. The group was successful and in 1960 were asked by [[Jean Cocteau]] to provide music for his film, ''[[Testament of Orpheus|Le Testament d'Orphée]]''. The group toured, appearing on television shows including [[The Ed Sullivan Show]]. In 1966 they were invited to hold an exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and director [[Alfred Barr]] purchased a sculpture for the museum's collection. Their tune Manège was also used as theme for the Granada TV program Picture Box, which ran in the United Kingdom from 1966 to 1990.

In the 1960s the Lasrys emigrated to [[Israel]]. In 1977 Bernard met Michel Deneuve, a musician, who joined them, starting a new association, and assisted in creating instruments. Deneuve was especially dedicated to working on their instrument called the "Cristal".&lt;ref&gt;♙♙[http://francois.baschet.free.fr/story.htm Baschet website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Behaviour therapy''' is a broad term referring to clinical [[psychotherapy]] that uses techniques derived from [[behaviourism]]. Those who practice behaviour therapy tend to look at specific, learned behaviours and how the environment influences those behaviours. Those who practice behaviour therapy are called behaviourists, or [[licensed behavior analyst|behaviour analysts]].&lt;ref name="O'Leary, K. Daniel 1975"&gt;O'Leary, K. Daniel, and G. Terence Wilson. Behaviour Therapy: Application and Outcome, 7-12. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to look for treatment outcomes that are objectively measurable.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, K. Daniel, and G. Terence Wilson. Behaviour Therapy: Application and Outcome, 12-14. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviour therapy does not involve one specific method but it has a wide range of techniques that can be used to treat a person's psychological problems.&lt;ref name="Antony, M.M. 2003 pp. 182-223"&gt;Antony, M.M., &amp; Roemer, E. (2003). Behaviour therapy. In A.S. Gurman &amp; S.B. Messer (Eds.), Essential psychotherapies (2nd ed., pp. 182-223). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Applied behaviour analysis]] (ABA) is the application of behaviour analysis that focuses on assessing how environmental variables influence learning principles, particularly [[respondent conditioning|respondent]] and [[operant conditioning]], to identify potential behaviour-change procedures, which are frequently used throughout [[Clinical behavior analysis|clinical therapy]]. [[Cognitive behavioural therapy|Cognitive-behavior therapy]] views cognition and emotions as preceding overt behavior with treatment plans in psychotherapy to lessen the issue. Hallmark techniques of behaviour therapies are overlapping components of [[cognitive psychology]], in addition to behaviour analytic principles of [[counterconditioning]], [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]], [[habituation]], and [[Functional analysis (psychology)|functional analysis]] (FA).

Methodological behaviourism, which does not acknowledge that behaviour can also be covert, is not entirely outdated in clinical practice. [[Exposure and response prevention]] (ERP), a subcategory of "[[Flooding (psychology)|Flooding]]" [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]] and derived from methodological behaviourism, for example, is typically used for clients with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD). Although not entirely behaviour analytic in theory, the behaviour therapist will first use functional behaviour assessments (FBAs) and behaviour intervention plans (BIPs) before implementing the intervention, and does rely on functional analysis in that respect.

==History==
{{see also|Behavior modification}}
Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of behaviour therapy have been identified in various ancient philosophical traditions, particularly [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name="RobertsonUS952010"&gt;{{Cite book |author= Robertson, D. |title=The Philosophy of Cognitive–Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy |year=2010 |publisher=Karnac |location=London |isbn=978-1-85575-756-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Joseph Wolpe|Wolpe]] and [[Arnold Lazarus|Lazarus]] wrote,
{{quote|While the modern behavior therapist deliberately applies principles of learning to this therapeutic operations, empirical behavior therapy is probably as old as civilization&amp;nbsp;– if we consider civilization as having started when man first did things to further the well-being of other men. From the time that this became a feature of human life there must have been occasions when a man complained of his ills to another who advised or persuaded him of a course of action. In a broad sense, this could be called behavior therapy whenever the behavior itself was conceived as the therapeutic agent. Ancient writings contain innumerable behavioral prescriptions that accord with this broad conception of behavior therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpe, J. &amp; Lazarus, A. (1966) ''Behavior Therapy Techniques: A Guide to the Treatment of Neuroses'', pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first use of the term behaviour modification appears to have been by [[Edward Thorndike]] in 1911. His article ''Provisional Laws of Acquired Behavior or Learning'' makes frequent use of the term "modifying behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Thorndike |first=E.L. |year=1911 |title=Provisional Laws of Acquired Behavior or Learning |journal=Animal Intelligence |publisher=The McMillian Company |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through early research in the 1940s and the 1950s the term was used by [[Joseph Wolpe]]'s research group.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpe (1958) ''Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition''&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental tradition in clinical psychology&lt;ref&gt;In A.J. Bachrach (Ed.), Experimental foundations of clinical psychology (pp. 3–25). New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; used it to refer to psycho-therapeutic techniques derived from empirical research. It has since come to refer mainly to techniques for increasing adaptive behaviour through reinforcement and decreasing maladaptive behaviour through extinction or punishment (with emphasis on the former). Two related terms are behaviour therapy and [[applied behaviour analysis]]. Since techniques derived from behavioural psychology tend to be the most effective in altering behaviour, most practitioners consider behaviour modification along with behaviour therapy and applied behaviour analysis to be founded in [[behaviourism]]. While behaviour modification and applied behaviour analysis typically uses interventions based on the same behavioural principles, many behaviour modifiers who are not applied behaviour analysts tend to use packages of interventions and do not conduct functional assessments before intervening.

Possibly the first occurrence of the term "behavior therapy" was in a 1953 research project by [[B.F. Skinner]], [[Ogden Lindsley]], Nathan H. Azrin and [[Harry C. Solomon]].&lt;ref name="lindsley et al."&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lindsley, O. |author2=Skinner, B.F. |author3=Solomon, H.C. |title=Studies in behavior therapy (Status Report I) |publisher=Walthama, MA.: Metropolitan State Hospital |year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper talked about operant conditioning and how it could be used to help improve the functioning of people who were diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia. Early pioneers in behaviour therapy include [[Joseph Wolpe]] and [[Hans Eysenck]].&lt;ref name="clarkUS95fairburn"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=David M. |author2=Christopher G. Fairburn |authorlink=David Clark (psychiatrist) |title=Science and Practice of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1997 |isbn=0-19-262726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, behaviour therapy is seen as having three distinct points of origin: South Africa (Wolpe's group), The United States (Skinner), and the United Kingdom (Rachman and Eysenck). Each had its own distinct approach to viewing behaviour problems. Eysenck in particular viewed behaviour problems as an interplay between personality characteristics, environment, and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, A.J.(1970). Behavior Therapy. New York Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's group in the United States took more of an [[operant conditioning]] focus. The operant focus created a functional approach to assessment and interventions focused on [[contingency management]] such as the [[token economy]] and [[behavioural activation]]. Skinner's student [[Ogden Lindsley]] is credited with forming a movement called [[precision teaching]], which developed a particular type of graphing program called the standard celeration chart to monitor the progress of clients. Skinner became interested in the individualising of programs for improved learning in those with or without disabilities and worked with [[Fred S. Keller]] to develop [[programmed instruction]]. Programmed instruction had some clinical success in aphasia rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfarb, R. (2006). Operant Conditioning and Programmed Instruction in Aphasia Rehabilitation. ''SLP-ABA'', 1(1), 56–65 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Patterson used programme instruction to develop his parenting text for children with conduct problems.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G.R. (1969). ''Families: A social learning approach to family life''.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Parent management training]].) With age, [[respondent conditioning]] appears to slow but [[operant conditioning]] remains relatively stable.&lt;ref&gt;Perlmutter, M. &amp; Hall, E. (1985). ''Adult development and aging''. New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; While the concept had its share of advocates and critics in the west, its introduction in the Asian setting, particularly in India in the early 1970s&lt;ref name="Introduction of Behavioural Therapy in Asia" references group="References"&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael.J.Stevens|first=Danny Vedding|title=Handbook of International Psychology|year=2004|publisher=Francis &amp; Taylor|isbn=978-0-415-94612-4|page=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_MS5H76EVyAC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and its grand success were testament to the famous Indian psychologist [[H. Narayan Murthy]]'s enduring commitment to the principles of behavioural therapy and biofeedback.

While many behaviour therapists remain staunchly committed to the basic [[operant]] and respondent paradigm, in the second half of the 20th century, many therapists coupled behaviour therapy with the [[cognitive therapy]], of [[Aaron Beck]] and [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]], to form [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behaviour therapy]]. In some areas the cognitive component had an additive effect (for example, evidence suggests that cognitive interventions improve the result of social phobia treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.74.3.568 |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=568–78 |last=Clark |first=David M. |title=Cognitive therapy versus exposure and applied relaxation in social phobia: A randomized controlled trial |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |date = June 2006|pmid=16822113 |last2=Ehlers |first2=A. |last3=Hackmann |first3=A. |last4=McManus |first4=F. |last5=Fennell |first5=M. |last6=Grey |first6=N. |last7=Waddington |first7=L. |last8=Wild |first8=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but in other areas it did not enhance the treatment, which led to the pursuit of third generation behaviour therapies. Third generation behaviour therapy uses basic principles of operant and respondent psychology but couples them with functional analysis and a [[clinical formulation]]/case conceptualisation of verbal behaviour more inline with view of the behaviour analysts. Some research supports these therapies as being more effective in some cases than cognitive therapy,&lt;ref&gt;Block, J.A. &amp; Wulfert, E. (2000) Acceptance or Change: Treating Socially Anxious College Students with ACT or CBGT. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 1(2), 3–10. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; but overall the question is still in need of answers.&lt;ref&gt;Öst, L.G. (2008). "Efficacy of the third wave of behavioral therapies: a systematic review and meta-analysis". ''Behaviour Research and Therapy'', 46(3), 296–321&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific basis==
The behavioural approach to therapy assumes that behaviour that is associated with psychological problems develops through the same processes of learning that affects the development of other behaviours. Therefore, behaviourists see personality problems in the way that personality was developed. They do not look at behaviour disorders as something a person has but that it reflects how learning has influenced certain people to behave in a certain way in certain situations.&lt;ref name="O'Leary, K. Daniel 1975"/&gt;

Behaviour therapy is based upon the principles of [[classical conditioning]] developed by [[Ivan Pavlov]] and [[operant conditioning]] developed by [[B.F. Skinner]]. Classical conditioning happens when a neutral stimulus comes right before another stimulus that triggers a reflexive response. The idea is that if the neutral stimulus and whatever other stimulus that triggers a response is paired together often enough that the neutral stimulus will produce the reflexive response.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Halmuth H., and Patrick L. Martin. Behavioral Therapy, 20. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Operant conditioning has to do with rewards and punishments and how they can either strengthen or weaken certain behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Halmuth H., and Patrick L. Martin. Behavioral Therapy, 20-24. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contingency management]] programs are a direct product of research from [[operant conditioning]]. These programs have been highly successful with those suffering from panic disorders, anxiety disorders, and phobias.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, G.L. &amp; Lentz, R.J. (1977). Psychosocial treatment of chronic mental patients: Milieu versus social learning programs. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Systematic desensitisation]] and [[exposure and response prevention]] both evolved from [[respondent conditioning]] and have also received considerable research.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Behavior avoidance test (BAT) is a behavioural procedure in which the therapist measures how long the client can tolerate an anxiety-inducing stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Grecory, R. J. (2007). Psychological Testing: history, principles and application. Pearson Education. p.613.&lt;/ref&gt; The BAT falls under the exposure-based methods of behaviour therapy.  Exposure-based methods of behavioural therapy are well suited to the treatment of phobias,{{mcn|date=September 2018}} which include intense and unreasonable fears (e.g., of spiders, blood, public speaking).  The therapist needs some type of behavioural assessment to record the continuing progress of a client undergoing an exposure-based treatment for phobia.  One simple assessment approach for this is the BAT. The BAT approach is predicted on the assumption that the client's fear is the main determinant of behaviour in the testing situation. BAT can be conducted visual, virtually, or physically, depending on the clients' maladaptive behaviour.  Its application is not limited to phobias, it is applied to various disorders such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD).&lt;ref&gt;Grecory, R. J. (2007). Psychological Testing: history, principles and application. Pearson Education. pp.421-422&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
Behaviour therapists complete a functional analysis or a functional assessment that looks at four important areas: stimulus, organism, response and consequences.&lt;ref name="Nelson, R.O. 1986 pp. 3-41"&gt;Nelson, R.O., &amp; Hayes, S.C. (1986). The nature of behavioural assessment. In R.O. Nelson &amp; S.C. Hayes (Eds.) Conceptual foundations of behavioural assessment (pp. 3-41). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; The stimulus is the condition or environmental trigger that causes behaviour.&lt;ref name="Wolpe, Joseph pp 13"&gt;Wolpe, Joseph. The Practice of Behavior Therapy. pp 13. 3rd ed. New York: Pergamon, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; An organism involves the internal responses of a person, like physiological responses, emotions and cognition.&lt;ref name="Nelson, R.O. 1986 pp. 3-41"/&gt; A response is the behaviour that a person exhibits and the consequences are the result of the behaviour. These four things are incorporated into an assessment done by the behaviour therapist.&lt;ref name="Wolpe, Joseph pp 13"/&gt;

Most behaviour therapists use objective assessment methods like structured interviews, objective psychological tests or different behavioural rating forms. These types of assessments are used so that the behaviour therapist can determine exactly what a client's problem may be and establish a baseline for any maladaptive responses that the client may have. By having this baseline, as therapy continues this same measure can be used to check a client's progress, which can help determine if the therapy is working. Behaviour therapists do not typically ask the why questions but tend to be more focused on the how, when, where and what questions. Tests such as the Rorschach inkblot test or personality tests like the MMPI ([[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]]) are not commonly used for behavioural assessment because they are based on personality trait theory assuming that a person's answer to these methods can predict behaviour. Behaviour assessment is more focused on the observations of a persons behaviour in their natural environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;O'Leary, K. Daniel, and G. Terence Wilson. Behaviour Therapy: Application and Outcome, 24-25. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioural assessment specifically attempts to find out what the environmental and self-imposed variables are.  These variables are the things that are allowing a person to maintain their maladaptive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. In a behavioural assessment "person variables" are also considered. These "person variables" come from a person's social learning history and they effect the way in which the environment affects that person's behaviour. An example of a person variable would be behavioural competence. Behavioural competence looks at whether a person has the appropriate skills and behaviours that are necessary when performing a specific response to a certain situation or stimuli.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

When making a behavioural assessment the behaviour therapist wants to answer two questions: (1) what are the different factors (environmental or psychological) that are maintaining the maladaptive behaviour and (2) what type of behaviour therapy or technique that can help the individual improve most effectively. The first question involves looking at all aspects of a person, which can be summed up by the acronym BASIC ID. This acronym stands for behaviour, affective responses, sensory reactions, imagery, cognitive processes, interpersonal relationships and drug use.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, K. Daniel, and G. Terence Wilson. Behavior Therapy: Application and Outcome, pp, 19. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical applications===
Behaviour therapy based its core interventions on functional analysis.

Functional analysis has even been applied to problems that therapists commonly encounter like client resistance, partially engaged clients and involuntary clients.&lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J.; Tillman, T.C.; Axelrod, S.; Dziewolska, H. &amp; Hineline, P. (2006). Resistance Is Not Futile: An experimental analogue of the effects of consultee "resistance" on the consultant's therapeutic behavior in the consultation process: A replication and extension. ''IJBCT'', 2(3), 362–76. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J.D.; Riley-Tillman, T.C.; Axelrod, S. &amp; Hineline, P. (2005). Current Behavioral Models of Client and Consultee Resistance: A Critical Review. ''IJBCT'', 1(2), 147–64 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Applications to these problems have left clinicians with considerable tools for enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. One way to enhance therapeutic effectiveness is to use positive reinforcement or operant conditioning. Although behaviour therapy is based on the general learning model, it can be applied in a lot of different treatment packages that can be specifically developed to deal with problematic behaviours. Some of the more well known types of treatments are: Relaxation training, systematic desensitization, virtual reality exposure, exposure and response prevention techniques, social skills training, modeling, behavioural rehearsal and [[Homework in psychotherapy|homework]], and [[aversion therapy]] and punishment.&lt;ref name="Antony, M.M. 2003 pp. 182-223"/&gt;

Relaxation training involves clients learning to lower arousal to reduce their stress by tensing and releasing certain muscle groups throughout their body.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, D.A.,  Borkovec, T.D., &amp; Hazlette-Stevens, H. (2000). Progressive relaxation training: A manual for the helping professions (2nd ed.). New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic desensitization is a treatment in which the client slowly substitutes a new learned response for a maladaptive response by moving up a [[Exposure hierarchy|hierarchy]] of situations involving fear.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpe, J. (1958). Psychotherapy by reciprocal inhibition. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic desensitization is based in part on counter conditioning. Counter conditioning is learning new ways to change one response for another and in the case of desensitization it is substituting that maladaptive behaviour for a more relaxing behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 43. New York: Academic, 1974. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure and response prevention techniques is also known as flooding and response prevention.&lt;ref name="Rimm, David C. pp. 348"&gt;Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 348. New York: Academic, 1974. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding and response prevention is the general technique in which you expose an individual to anxiety-provoking stimuli while keeping them from having any avoidance responses or keeping them from freaking out.&lt;ref name="Rimm, David C. pp. 348"/&gt;

Virtual reality therapy provides realistic, computer-based simulations of troublesome situations. The modeling process involves a person being subjected to watching other individuals who demonstrate behaviour that is considered adaptive and that should be adopted by the client. This exposure involves not only the cues of the "model person" as well as the situations of a certain behaviour that way the relationship can be seen between the appropriateness of a certain behaviour and situation in which that behaviour occurs is demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, 125-126. New York: Academic, 1974. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; With the behavioural rehearsal and homework treatment a client gets a desired behaviour during a therapy session and then they practice and record that behaviour between their sessions. [[Aversion therapy]] and punishment is a technique in which an aversive (painful or unpleasant) stimulus is used to decrease unwanted behaviours from occurring. It is concerned with two procedures: 1) the procedures are used to decrease the likelihood of the frequency of a certain behaviour and 2) procedures that will reduce the attractiveness of certain behaviours and the stimuli that elicit them.&lt;ref&gt;Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 353. New York: Academic, 1974. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment side of aversion therapy is when an aversive stimulus is presented at the same time that a negative stimulus and then they are stopped at the same time when a positive stimulus or response is presented.&lt;ref&gt;Bellack, Alan S., and Michel Hersen. Dictionary of Behavior Therapy Techniques, pp. 14. New York: Pergamon, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the type of negative stimulus or punishment that can be used is shock therapy treatments,&lt;ref&gt;Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 374. New York: Academic, 1974. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; aversive drug treatments &lt;ref&gt;Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 390. New York: Academic, 1974. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as response cost contingent punishment which involves taking away a reward.

Applied behaviour analysis is using behavioural methods to modify certain behaviours that are seen as being important socially or personally. There are four main characteristics of applied behaviour analysis. First behaviour analysis is focused mainly on overt behaviours in an applied setting. Treatments are developed as a way to alter the relationship between those overt behaviours and their consequences.&lt;ref name="Agras, W. Stewart 1979"&gt;Agras, W. Stewart., Alan E. Kazdin, and G. Terence Wilson. Behavior Therapy: Toward an Applied Clinical Science. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1979. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic of applied behaviour analysis is how it(behaviour analysis) goes about evaluating treatment effects. The individual subject is where the focus of study is on, the investigation is centered on the one individual being treated. A third characteristic is that it focuses on what the environment does to cause significant behaviour changes. Finally the last characteristic of applied behaviour analysis is the use of those techniques that stem from operant and classical conditioning such as providing reinforcement, punishment, stimulus control and any other learning principles that may apply.&lt;ref name="Agras, W. Stewart 1979"/&gt;

[[Social skills training]] teaches clients skills to access reinforcers and lessen life punishment. [[Operant conditioning]] procedures in [[meta-analysis]] had the largest effect size for training social skills, followed by [[modelling (psychology)|modelling]], coaching, and social cognitive techniques in that order.&lt;ref&gt;Schnieder, B.H. &amp; Bryne, B.M. (1985). Children's social skills training: A meta-analysis. In B.H. Schneider, K. Rubin, &amp; J.E. Ledingham (Eds.) ''Children's Peer relations: Issues in assessment and intervention'' (pp. 175–90). New York: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Social skills training has some empirical support particularly for schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, P.W. (1997). Behavior therapy empowers persons with severe mental illness. ''Behavior Modification'', 21, 45–61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, P.W. &amp; Holmes, E.P. (1994). Patient identification of "street skills" for a psychosocial training module. ''Hospital and Community Psychiatry'', 45, 273–6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with schizophrenia, behavioural programs have generally lost favor.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, S.E. (2006). Behavior Analysis of Psychotic Disorders: Scientific Dead End or Casualty of the Mental Health Political Economy? ''Behavior and Social Issues'', 15(2), 152–77 [http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/view/365]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other techniques that have been used in behaviour therapy are contingency contracting, response costs, token economies, biofeedback, and using shaping and grading task assignments.&lt;ref name="Kramer, Geoffrey P. 2009"&gt;Kramer, Geoffrey P., Douglas A. Bernstein, and Vicky Phares. "Behavioral and Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapies." Introduction to Clinical Psychology. 7th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009. 269-300. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaping and graded task assignments are used when behaviour that needs to be learned is complex. The complex behaviours that need to be learned are broken down into simpler steps where the person can achieve small things gradually building up to the more complex behaviour. Each step approximates the eventual goal and helps the person to expand their activities in a gradual way. This behaviour is used when a person feels that something in their lives can not be changed and life's tasks appear to be overwhelming.&lt;ref name="Freeman, Arthur 1989. Pg. 341"&gt;Freeman, Arthur. "Treatment of Suicidal Behavior." Comprehensive Handbook of Cognitive Therapy. New York: Plenum, 1989. Pg. 341. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique of behaviour therapy involves holding a client or patient accountable of their behaviours in an effort to change them.  This is called a contingency contract, which is a formal written contract between two or more people that defines the specific expected behaviours that you wish to change and the rewards and punishments that go along with that behaviour.&lt;ref name="Kramer, Geoffrey P. 2009"/&gt; In order for a contingency contract to be official it needs to have five elements. First it must state what each person will get if they successfully complete the desired behaviour. Secondly those people involved have to monitor the behaviours. Third, if the desired behaviour is not being performed in the way that was agreed upon in the contract the punishments that were defined in the contract must be done. Fourth if the persons involved are complying with the contract they must receive bonuses. The last element involves documenting the compliance and noncompliance while using this treatment in order to give the persons involved consistent feedback about the target behaviour and the provision of reinforcers.&lt;ref name="Stuart, Richard B. 1972"&gt;Stuart, Richard B., and Leroy A. Lott, Jr. "Behavior Contracting with Delinquents." Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry 3 (1972): 161-69. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

Token economies is a behaviour therapy technique where clients are reinforced with tokens that are considered a type of currency that can be used to purchase desired rewards, like being able to watch television or getting a snack that they want when they perform designated behaviours.&lt;ref name="Kramer, Geoffrey P. 2009"/&gt; Token economies are mainly used in institutional and therapeutic settings. In order for a token economy to be effective their must be consistency in administering the program by the entire staff. Procedures must be clearly defined so that there is no confusion among the clients. Instead of looking for ways to punish the patients or to deny them of rewards, the staff has to reinforce the positive behaviours so that the clients will increase the occurrence of the desired behaviour. Over time the tokens need to be replaced with less tangible rewards such as compliments so that the client will be prepared when they leave the institution and won't expect to get something every time they perform a desired behaviour.&lt;ref name="Boyle, Scott W 2006"&gt;Boyle, Scott W. "Knowledge and Skills for Intervention." Direct Practice in Social Work. Boston: Pearson/Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2006. 223-225. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related to token economies is a technique called response costs. This technique can either be used with or without token economies. Response costs is the punishment side of token economies where there is a loss of a reward or privilege after someone performs an undesirable behaviour.&lt;ref name="Boyle, Scott W 2006"/&gt; Like token economies this technique is used mainly in institutional and therapeutic settings.&lt;ref name="Kramer, Geoffrey P. 2009"/&gt;

Considerable policy implications have been inspired by behavioural views of various forms of psychopathology. One form of behaviour therapy, [[habit reversal training]], has been found to be highly effective for treating tics.

===Third generation===
The third-generation behaviour therapy movement has been called [[clinical behavior analysis]] because it represents a movement away from cognitivism and back toward [[radical behaviourism]] and other forms of [[behaviourism]], in particular functional analysis and behavioural models of [[verbal behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=3 |pages=248–53 |last=Kohlenberg |first=R.J. |author2=Bolling, M.Y. |author3=Kanter, J.W. |author4=Parker, C.R. |title=Clinical behavior analysis: Where it went wrong, how it was made good again, and why its future is so bright |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |year=2002 |issn=1539-4352 |url=https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/jkanter/www/pdf/publication/behavioranalysis.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1037/h0099988 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008194237/https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/jkanter/www/pdf/publication/behavioranalysis.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This area includes [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) (McCullough, 2000), [[behavioural activation]] (BA), [[functional analytic psychotherapy]] (FAP), [[integrative behavioural couples therapy]] and [[dialectical behavioural therapy]]. These approaches are squarely within the [[applied behaviour analysis]] tradition of behaviour therapy.

ACT may be the most well-researched of all the third-generation behaviour therapy models. It is based on [[relational frame theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackledge, J.T. (2003). An Introduction to Relational Frame Theory: Basics and Applications. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3(4), 421–42 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors object to the term "third generation" or "third wave" and incorporate many of the "third wave" therapeutic techniques under the general umbrella term of modern cognitive behavioral therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hofmann SG |title= An Introduction to Modern CBT. Psychological Solutions to Mental Health Problems. |url= https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-CBT-Psychological-Solutions/dp/0470971754/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpi_10 |year= 2011 |publisher=Chichester, UK: Wiley-Blackwell |ISBN= 0-470-97175-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Functional analytic psychotherapy]] is based on a functional analysis of the therapeutic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenberg, R.J. &amp; Tsai, M. (1991) ''Functional Analytic Psychotherapy''. New York: Plenum&lt;/ref&gt; It places a greater emphasis on the therapeutic context and returns to the use of in-session reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Wulfert (2002) Can Contextual Therapies Save Clinical Behavior Analysis? ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3(3), 254 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, 40 years of research supports the idea that in-session reinforcement of behaviour can lead to behavioural change.&lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J.T.; Riley-Tillman, C.; Axelrod S. &amp; Hineline, P. (2005). The Role of Verbal Conditioning in Third Generation Behavior Therapy. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 6(2), 138–57 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Behavioural activation]] emerged from a component analysis of cognitive behaviour therapy. This research found no additive effect for the cognitive component.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, N.S.; Martell, C.R. &amp; Dimidjian, S. (2001). Behavioral activation treatment for depression: Returning to contextual roots. ''Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice'', 8, 255–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioural activation is based on a matching model of reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, J.M.; Spates, C.R; Pagoto, S. &amp; Doran, N. (2006). Behavioral Activation Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder: A Pilot Investigation. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 7(1), 151–64.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review of the research, supports the notion that the use of behavioural activation is clinically important for the treatment of depression.&lt;ref&gt;Spates, C.R.; Pagoto, S. &amp; Kalata, A. (2006). A Qualitative And Quantitative Review of Behavioral Activation Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 7(4), 508–12 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Integrative behavioural couples therapy]] developed from dissatisfaction with traditional behavioural couples therapy. Integrative behavioural couples therapy looks to Skinner (1966) for the difference between contingency-shaped and rule-governed behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1969). ''Contingencies of Reinforcement: A Theoretical Analysis''. New York: Meredith Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; It couples this analysis with a thorough functional assessment of the couple's relationship. Recent efforts have used radical behavioural concepts to interpret a number of clinical phenomena including forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, J.; Cautilli, J.D.; Simon, C. &amp; Axelrod-sabag, R. (2006). Behavior Analysis of Forgiveness in Couples Therapy. ''IJBCT'', 2(2), 192–213 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===
Many organisations exist for behaviour therapists around the world. The [[Association for Behavior Analysis International]] provides accreditation for training programs in behaviour therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behavior Analysis Accreditation Board |url=https://baab.abainternational.org/welcome.aspx |publisher=Association for Behavior Analysis International |accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[American Psychological Association]]'s Division 25 is the division for [[behaviour analysis]]. The Association for Contextual Behavior Therapy is another professional organisation. ACBS is home to many clinicians with specific interest in third generation behaviour therapy. The [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]] (formerly the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy) is for those with a more cognitive orientation.

Shaping and graded task assignments has been used in dealing with suicide and depressed or inhibited individuals. This is used when a patient feel hopeless and they have no way of changing their lives. This hopelessness involves how the person reacts and responds to someone else and certain situations and their perceived powerlessness to change that situation that adds to the hopelessness. For a person with suicidal ideation, it is important to start with small steps. Because that person may perceive everything as being a big step, the smaller you start the easier it will be for the person to master each step.&lt;ref name="Freeman, Arthur 1989. Pg. 341"/&gt; This technique has also been applied to people dealing with agoraphobia, or fear of being in public places or doing something embarrassing.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Scott W.

===Treatment outcomes===
{{medical citations needed|section|date=September 2018}}
Systematic desensitization has been shown to successfully treat phobias about heights, driving, insects as well as any anxiety that a person may have. Anxiety can include social anxiety, anxiety about public speaking as well as test anxiety. It has been shown that the use of systematic desensitization is an effective technique that can be applied to a number of problems that a person may have.&lt;ref&gt;Bellack, Alan S., and Michel Hersen. Dictionary of Behavior Therapy Techniques, pp. 73. New York: Pergamon, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using modeling procedures this technique is often compared to another behavioural therapy technique. When compared to desensitization, the modeling technique does appear to be less effective.&lt;ref name="Bellack, Alan S. pp. 156"&gt;Bellack, Alan S., and Michel Hersen. Dictionary of Behavior Therapy Techniques, pp. 156. New York: Pergamon, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However it is clear that the greater the interaction between the patient and the subject he is modeling the greater the effectiveness of the treatment.&lt;ref name="Bellack, Alan S. pp. 156"/&gt;

While undergoing exposure therapy a person usually needs five sessions to see if the treatment is working. After five sessions exposure treatment is seen to benefit the patient and help with their problems. However even after five sessions it is recommended that the patient or client should still continue treatment.&lt;ref name="Bellack, Alan S. pp. 123"/&gt;

Virtual Reality treatment has shown to be effective for a fear of heights.&lt;ref name="Krijin, M. P.M"/&gt; It has also been shown to help with the treatment of a variety of anxiety disorders.&lt;ref name="Klein, R.A. 1999"/&gt; Virtual reality therapy can be very costly so therapists are still awaiting results of controlled trials for VR treatment to see which applications show the best results.&lt;ref&gt;Price, M., &amp; Anderson, P. (2007). The role of presence in virtual reality exposure therapy. Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 21, 724-751.&lt;/ref&gt;

For those with suicidal ideation treatment depends on how severe the person's depression and feeling of hopelessness is. If these things are severe the person's response to completing small steps will not be of importance to them because they don't consider it to be a big deal.&lt;ref name="Freeman, Arthur 1989. Pg. 341"/&gt; Generally those who aren't severely depressed or fearful, this technique has been successful because the completion of simpler activities build up their confidences and allows them to continue on to more complex situations.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Scott W. "Knowledge and Skills for Intervention." Direct Practice in Social Work. Boston: Pearson/Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2006. Pp.232 . Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contingency contracts have been seen to be effective in changing any undesired behaviours of individuals. It has been seen to be effective in treating behaviour problems in delinquents regardless of the specific characteristics of the contract.&lt;ref name="Stuart, Richard B. 1972"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2018}}

Token economies have been shown to be effective when treating patients in psychiatric wards who had chronic schizophrenia. The results showed that the contingent tokens were controlling the behaviour of the patients.&lt;ref name="LLyod, Kenneth E. 1968"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2018}}

Response costs has been shown to work in suppressing a variety of behaviours such as smoking, overeating or stuttering with a diverse group of clinical populations ranging from sociopaths to school children. These behaviours that have been suppressed using this technique often do not recover when the punishment contingency is withdrawn. Also undesirable side effects that are usually seen with punishment are not typically found when using the response cost technique.&lt;ref name="Kazdin, Alan E 1972"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2018}}

==Characteristics==
By nature, behavioural therapies are empirical (data-driven), contextual (focused on the environment and context), functional (interested in the effect or consequence a behaviour ultimately has), probabilistic (viewing behaviour as statistically predictable), [[monistic]] (rejecting mind–body [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and treating the person as a unit), and relational (analysing bidirectional interactions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sundberg |first=Norman |title=Clinical Psychology: Evolving Theory, Practice, and Research |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs |year=2001 |isbn=0-13-087119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioural therapy develops, adds and provides behavioural intervention strategies and programs for clients, and training to people who care to facilitate successful lives in the communities.

A '''black cube''' (or '''black box''') '''art museum''' is a term used by some scholars{{who|date=August 2010}} referring to the type of [[art museum]] that is architecturally designed or renovated with special consideration for the particular needs of modern [[digital art]], [[installation art]], and [[video art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servinghistory.com/topics/Black_Cube_Art_Museums |title=Black Cube Art Museums : Who, What, Where, When |publisher=Servinghistory.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the black box art museums originated from a need to accommodate these works in a better way than was previously possible in earlier art museums in the classic style (e.g., the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]] in [[Paris]]) or "[[white cube]]" style (e.g., the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City|New York]]). Although earlier examples exist,{{where|date=August 2010}} black cube museums have been most prevalent from the 1990s onwards.

[[File:Australian Centre for the Moving Image.jpg|thumb|[[ACMI]], [[Melbourne]], Australia.]]

==Development==
Architectural shifts in the design of art galleries have always followed shifts in art itself. Just as white cube museums embraced modernist artwork and perception, black cube museums originated to house and adopt the zeitgeist of avant-garde [[video art|video works]] and [[installation art|installations]]. Perhaps more importantly, there were also practical issues where the avant-garde works poorly functioned in white cube or classical museums. These issues could not be solved by anything less than an entirely new architectural thinking.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Problems with video art and installations===
When interactive [[video art]] was first considered for exhibitions in the respected public galleries, curators found the spaces in traditional galleries were incredibly unsuited to the new medium.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The traditional art galleries had static walls designed to display 2D artworks in a hierarchal manner or 3D sculpture where it could be viewed from all angles. Out of all the mediums through which art was expressed and displayed in a gallery, none demanded so much input from the viewer's themselves. When several artists began [[London Video Arts]] (LVA), their interactive art was arranged by [[Tate Gallery]] in ways which severely hampered the way they communicated with viewers. [[David Hall (video artist)|David Hall]]'s work reflected the movement of audiences themselves by showing images taken from a camera (facing the viewers) on a single monitor. The work was placed in a lecture room in the basement of the Tate's Education Department. The curators claimed this environment was the most appropriate since too much lighting would make it difficult to see the monitors so often used in video art.

Before moveable walls became commonly used in art museums, [[installation art|Installation]] artworks posed severe difficulties for curators. In 1960, the curators of MoMA were bewildered when [[Jean Tinguely]] and [[Billy Klüver]] created a machine that destroyed itself for the 27 minute ''Homage to New York exhibition''. Even today, traditional museums have to go to great and expensive lengths to exhibit what has become a well-respected medium. When the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Australia]] displayed [[Olafur Eliasson]]'s ''Take your time'', walls were cut, doorways made taller and rooms darkened for the exhibition. It was becoming clear to architects that considerations would need to be made for installations, [[video art]] and [[digital art|digital interactive art]] in future galleries.

===Solutions offered by black cube===
Many projected images or monitors are optimally viewed in low lighting. Therefore, the implementation of adjustable lighting systems was the most obvious consideration made by black cube museums. However many installations require the space itself to be controlled. The typical black cube museum would hence have movable walls in its interior. Some artists may even have preferences as to the temperature of the environment. The essential idea behind the black cube museums is that the museum should be malleable to the needs of any artwork. The [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou Centre]] is early architectural evidence of this way of thinking. However, in the Pompidou Centre, the hightech architecture form of the museum itself influences the way the artwork is viewed. The majority of black cube museums prefer to develop an environment in which artworks can be viewed objectively, an idea taken from modernist white cube museums.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==The future==

===Threats to the black cube===
New forms of art constantly develop and art museums must adapt alongside. Some black cube museums such as the [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] ([[ACMI]]) have a large focus on film works or interactive works that use a simple keyboard and mouse. There is an argument that these works can be equally viewed from home through the internet. Indeed, some developing avant-garde forms of artwork are designed primarily to be viewed online. Works such as ''Automated Beacon'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automatedbeacon.net/ automatedbeacon.net]&lt;/ref&gt; a feedback loop of the [[Google search engine]] designed by Thomas and Craighead in 2005, perform very efficiently the role of the avant-garde and make us question "what is art?"

===Black cube's future===
The [[Internet]] may be the modern [[Library of Alexandria]] but, from the perspective of art, it suffers the same flaw as classical museums. Just as the old halls of the Louvre force an artist unto two-dimensional work if he wishes to be displayed in the classical museum, so to does the Internet force all its content to conform unto the easily accessible web page. Black cube museums however, with their flexible and accommodating interiors, allow the artist total control of what we objectively experience. Able to house any form of mainstream artwork, it seems unlikely that modern black cube museums can be entirely made redundant by the Internet.

The '''buddy system''' is a [[procedure (term)|procedure]] in which two people, the "buddies", operate together as a single unit so that they are able to monitor and help each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the buddy system? |url=http://www.becomeascout.org/faq.aspx |work=FAQs |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=9 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905063021/http://www.becomeascout.org/faq.aspx |archivedate=5 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As per Merriam-Webster, the first known use of the phrase “buddy system” goes as far back as 1942. Webster goes on to define the buddy system as “an arrangement in which two individuals are paired (as for mutual safety in a hazardous situation).” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buddy%20system&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieci.org/newsroom-and-insights/working-in-pairs-the-buddy-system&lt;/ref&gt;
The buddy system is basically working together in pairs in a large group or alone. Both the individuals have to do the job. The job could be to ensure that the work is finished safely or the skill/learning is transferred effectively from one individual to the other.

==Advantages==
In adventurous or dangerous activities, where buddies are often required, the main benefit of the system is improved [[safety]]; each may be able to prevent the other becoming a casualty or rescue the other in a crisis.

When this system is used as part of training or the induction of newcomers to an organization, the less experienced buddy learns more quickly from close and frequent contact with the experienced buddy than when operating alone.

==Organizations==
The buddy system is used in the [[United States Armed Forces]], and referred to by various names in each branch ("[[Wingman|Wingmen]]" in the Air Force, "Battle Buddies" in the Army, "Shipmates" in the Navy), as well as the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]]&lt;ref name="scouts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/Buddy_System |title=Buddy System in Swimming, Boating, Rappelling and other activities.|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used by religious organisations like the LDS Church. Members on mission form a [[Missionary (LDS Church)#Companionships|companionship]] constituted by two or sometimes more missionaries, which are not allowed to be alone for a two-year time period: "Stay Together. Never be alone. It is extremely important that you stay with your companion at all times."&lt;ref name="ldshandbook"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lds.org/manual/missionary-handbook/missionary-conduct?lang=eng | title=LDS Missionary Handbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buddy system is used in new employee induction for assisting with the formalities in an organization. The period could be from a month to two months. The buddy helps in acclimatizing the new employee to the culture and day to day aspects of working, in a shorter period of time. The buddy helps the new employee to become knowledgeable about department practices and organizational culture in a shorter period. The purpose of assigning new employees with a buddy is to help welcome employees and reaffirms their decision to join the organization. It provides new employees with a reliable, motivated, single point-of-contact for their basic questions regarding their work experience. The buddy system is an effective method to provide support, monitor stress, and reinforce safety procedures.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/buddy-system.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The buddy system is also informally used by [[elementary school|school-aged]] children, especially on [[field trip]]s. Assigning each student a buddy provides an extra measure of safety and removes some of the burden of keeping an eye on a large number of children in an unfamiliar environment from the supervising adults.

The buddy system encourages open and effective dialogue among peers and tends to break down social barriers with their classmates. It helps create a collaborative learning environment in which peers feel less hesitant to raise questions. This enables students to develop social networks, cross-cultural experiences. It provides effective support for the students who are ‘at risk’ and to lower the attrition rate at the higher education level.

=== Benefits of a buddy system ===

A buddy system in a school is where a child gets paired with another child, usually one that is older and of higher abilities. A buddy system helps to promote friendship, better support of coursework, behavioral and social needs, and can foster a greater sense of belonging and a more inclusive school community.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008&gt;Hughes, C., &amp; Carter E.W. (2008). ''Peer Buddy Programs for Successful Secondary School Inclusion.'' Paul H. Brookes Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Students create friendships that enable both older and younger "buddies" to bond more closely with their school, increasing the likelihood of more positive school behavior and positive response towards learning for all students.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; The buddy system helps students starting at a new school have a welcoming experience from the very beginning. The older children learn to take on responsibility, while the younger children know that they have a fellow student they can confidently turn to for support.&lt;ref name=Anderson2015&gt;Anderson, M. K., Tenenbaum, L. S., Ramadorai, S. B., &amp; Yourick, D. L. (2015). "Near-peer mentor model: synergy within mentoring". ''Mentoring &amp; Tutoring: Partnership in Learning'', 23(2), 116–132.&lt;/ref&gt;
Buddy systems in schools can have numerous benefits such as promoting an inclusive environment for all,&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; better acceptance of differences, promoting better self-control, expansion of communicative interaction with peers,&lt;ref name=Quill1990&gt;Quill, K. A. (1990). "A model for integrating children with autism". ''Focus on Autistic Behavior'', 5(4), 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; decrease in behavioral problems,&lt;ref name=Fo1974&gt;Fo, W. S., &amp; O'Donnell, C. R. (1974). "The Buddy System: Relationship and contingency conditions in a community intervention program for youth with nonprofessionals as behavior change agents." ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology'', 42(2), 163–169.&lt;/ref&gt; and even personal maturation or growth in career aspirations.&lt;ref name=Anderson2015/&gt;
The buddy system positively affects the culture of the school and it greatly affects the troubled student as well as the older buddy.
The students learn and share from their peers and learn collaboratively. The students actively participate with each other and enjoy the informal setting and feel comfortable discussing with peers rather than a teacher. The opportunity for active participation, clearing doubts and discussions help students to continue with studies or activities with joy and creates a depth in the subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The buddy system helps to increase self-confidence for all involved in the system and in the process helps build trust and co-operation within individuals. It benefits the buddies, buddy learner, school/university and the parents as well. The buddies involved also learn leadership skills and in turn can take up the role of buddy leader.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; 
The buddy system helps in reducing the stress level of the learner. It reduces the levels of anxiety experienced by the students who struggle to engage with course material or with the school/university in general.{{citation needed|reason= citation provided hereafter does not apply to students but to rats|date=August 2016}} "When there's a companion available, the physiological measure of stress—cortisol levels in the blood—can be alleviated somewhat", explains Jim Winslow, PhD, a specialist in behavioral neuroscience and pharmacology and head of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Intramural Research Program, Non-Human Primate Core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andelson|first1=Rachel|title=Buddy system eases stress|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/sep04/buddy.aspx|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Teachers at progressive schools collaborate to improve their students' learning—and their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wagner|first1=Tony|title=The Buddy System|url=http://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/2005/01/01/04view.h16.html|website=www.edweek.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives independence to all students, and increases self-esteem and peer acceptance. Children become protectors of each other.
Christine Hogan states that the buddy system approach is highly appropriate for organizational behavior studies adding to the students' range of learning strategies. The technique not only works with peers of the same nation but has also proved to be of particular importance to foreign students.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hogan, (1992) "'You are not studying alone': Introducing experiential learning into the teaching of organizational behaviour", ''Education + Training'', 34(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pairing types ===

There are numerous pairings styles: newly admitted students paired with older students, low achieving elementary school students paired with high achieving elementary school students;&lt;ref&gt;Freyberg, J. T., (1967). "The effects of participating in an elementary school buddy system on the self concept, school attitudes and behaviors, and achievement of fifth grade Negro children." ''Graduate Research in Urban Education &amp; Related Disciplines'', 3(1), 3–29.&lt;/ref&gt; behaviorally challenged teenagers paired with adults;&lt;ref name=Fo1974/&gt; autistic children paired with neurotypical children;&lt;ref name=Quill1990/&gt; severely disabled children paired with neurotypical children;&lt;ref name=Carter2001&gt;Carter, E. W., Hughes, C., Copeland, S. R., &amp; Breen, C. (2001). "Differences between high school students who do and do not volunteer to participate in a peer interaction program." ''Journal of the Association for Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 26(4), 229–239.&lt;/ref&gt; and even college students paired with post-bachelor students.&lt;ref name=Anderson2015/&gt;

=== Metropolitan Nashville Peer Buddy Program ===

An example of a successful peer buddy system was in Nashville, Tennessee's McGavock High School. Teachers were concerned with having a more inclusive environment for special education students. Not only were the specialized students excluded academically but there was social exclusion as well. This adversely affects specialized students when there is a need for them to later assimilate when out of high school.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; Students with disabilities were eating with their buddies and their friends, which resulted in the expansion of their circle of friendship and thus allowed for the special needs students to feel more normal and included. The program was so successful it was later adopted in the other 11 high schools of that district.&lt;ref name=Anderson2015/&gt;

=== Buddy systems for mainstream students ===

There are more examples of buddy systems for developmentally challenged students than there are of students with normal development but with behavioral or academic needs.&lt;ref name=Fo1974/&gt; If a system can be implemented that can help autistic or behaviorally challenged children or children with intellectual disabilities, than similar buddy systems can be incorporated into mainstream classrooms to help aid students that have a hard time learning but who may not qualify for the special needs programs. Students with disabilities report feeling more included, able to start friendships and conversations,&lt;ref name=Carter2001/&gt; and these same benefits can be transferred over to students that have social problems but are not able to be in special needs programs. Similarly, a student who is struggling academically can be paired with someone more adept with certain subjects.

Peer buddy groups can benefit many people. More research is needed to understand the possible impact of buddy systems for the general student population. Students that qualify for special services receive a lot of attention but students struggling behaviorally and socially would highly benefit from such an inclusive service.

=== Implementation of buddy systems ===

Students that qualify for special needs services receive a lot of attention. For the students that do not qualify but might be struggling behaviorally and socially, then programs like these could potentially have similar benefits for them as well. Carolyn Hughes and Erik Carter&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; promote a more ubiquitous peer buddy system in their book by laying out different strategies and benefits if schools were to include these systems in their curriculum. Examples they provide are: administrators assisting  in the publication of the program, school counselors signing up students for a credit based buddy system course, general education teachers providing support for special needs students who might be in there classroom and having parents providing impetus and support for a program to begin. Carolyn Hughes and Erik Carter&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; suggest starting on a smaller scale, perhaps a classroom or two and then growing a base of support.

=== Peer-to-peer buddy systems for autistic students ===

A key element of education is to build empathy and understand other people in the society. This approach sees a small group of students in a class being made "buddies" for an autistic student. The students are made aware of particular challenge a student has and are asked to take special care to include them, to be on the lookout for any bullying or exclusion and to be supportive to the student if they get stressed out or upset at break time or in class.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The students who are selected would be chosen for their maturity and kindness. Parental consent would be sought from the parents of the students involved. While not every autistic student will instantly begin to socialise or make friends, this approach will at the very least ensure inclusion and also that there will be a friendly pair of eyes when teachers are not present or are out of ear-shot.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Everyone needs a buddy sometimes – maybe a student is having a bad day, is upset about something or just is not very good at starting conversations or making friends alone. Under this system, a class would explore difference as a whole and recognize that everyone in a class is different and so have different needs, strengths, abilities and oddities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} They would then either be paired up or each student would draw a name and become "buddy" to that person, perhaps without them even being made aware of it. Before the draw or pairing it could be discussed with the teacher, to ensure an autistic student gets an especially strong buddy.
The advantage of this system is that it does not single out the autistic student, especially if they are not comfortable with that, and instead includes everyone. Additionally, it gives the autistic person a role in being a buddy too, which can be used to teach social skills, expectations and etiquette.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Adam|title="Back to School": Buddy System|url=https://www.asiam.ie/back-school-buddy-system|website=asiam.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6914">[[File:A beach party.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bystander intervention aims to teach people to intervene at parties and dances when they see a person making sexual advances on an intoxicated person.]]
'''Bystander intervention''' is a type of training used in post-secondary education institutions to prevent [[sexual assault]] or [[rape]],  [[binge drinking]] and harassment and unwanted comments of a [[racism|racist]], [[homophobia|homophobic]], or [[transphobia|transphobic]] nature. A bystander is a person who is present at an event, party, or other setting who notices a problematic situation, such as a man making sexual advances on a drunk person. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sapac.umich.edu/article/bystander-intervention |title=Bystander Intervention |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=sapac.umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=A proactive bystander is an individual who accepts personal responsibility for a situation and intervenes to ensure the well-being and/or safety of others.}} &lt;/ref&gt; The bystander then takes on personal responsibility and takes action to intervene, with the goal of preventing the situation from escalating. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sapac.umich.edu/article/bystander-intervention |title=Bystander Intervention |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=sapac.umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The bystander who is intervening has several options, including distracting either of the people, getting help from others, checking in later, or directly intervening. There are risks to bystander intervention; it can lead to fights, it can ruin the mood for the people who were "intervened" into, and it can lead to confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sapac.umich.edu/article/bystander-intervention |title=Bystander Intervention |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=sapac.umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Bystander intervention may also be called "bystander education", because the model is based on a system of educating trainers and leaders who will then go on to train people from their community.
==Preventing sexual assault==
One bystander intervention researcher suggests that a potential sexual assault be stopped by pretending to spill a drink on a drunk man who is trying to make sexual moves on an intoxicated woman, to distract him and "...stop bad behavior before it crosses the line from drunken partying to sexual assault". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Advocates hope that bystander intervention programs can yield the same results on sexual assault that designated driver initiatives have had in reducing impaired driving; another similarity is that both programs do not discourage drinking itself, only the combination of drinking and law-breaking. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Some US universities are introducing bystander education initiatives to comply with [[Title IX]], which requires US universities which receive federal funding to not discriminate according to gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;
==Research==

A study on bystander intervention by the University of New Hampshire showed that 38 percent of the men who saw a bystander intervention campaign said they intervened to stop a sexual assault, versus only 12 percent of the control group (who did not see the campaign). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; An Ohio University study compared men who took a bystander intervention session with a group of men who did not have the training; 1.5 percent of the bystander intervention participants said they had committed sexual assault over the last four months, versus 6.7 percent from the untrained group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html |title=Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault |last=Winerip |first=Michael |date=7 February 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=18 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; One challenge with bystander education programs is that a study has shown that white female students are less likely to intervene in a hypothetical situation where they see an intoxicated black woman being led towards a bedroom at a party by a non-intoxicated male, as white students feel "less personal responsibility" to help women of colour and they feel that the black woman is deriving pleasure from the situation.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/qvdvpw/white-women-less-likely-to-help-sexual-assault-victim-if-shes-black |title=White Women Less Likely to Help Sexual Assault Victim If She's Black {{!}} Bystander intervention is seen as one of the most powerful tools in preventing on-campus sexual assaults—but a new study shows that white students feel "less personal responsibility" to help their black peers. |last= Bess|first=Gabby |date=13 March 2017 |website=broadly.vice.com |publisher=Broadly/Vice |access-date=14 July 2018 |quote="We found that although white students correctly perceived that black women were at risk in a pre-assault situation, they tended not to feel as personally involved in the situation," the researchers at SUNY Geneseo, Jennifer Katz and Christine Merrilees, said in an interview with PsyPost. In other words, "despite their shared status as women, white female bystanders in the current study may have felt that a Black woman's plight was not as personally relevant because race has a more powerful effect than gender on intent to intervene and feelings of responsibility to intervene," they write in the study.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cognitive psychology]], '''chunking''' is a process by which individual pieces of information are bound together into a meaningful whole (Neath &amp; Surprenant, 2003). A chunk is defined as a familiar collection of more elementary units that have been inter-associated and stored in memory repeatedly and act as a coherent, integrated group when retrieved (Tulving &amp; Craik, 2000).

It is believed that individuals create higher order cognitive representations of the items on the list that are more easily remembered as a group than as individual items themselves. Representations of these groupings are highly subjective, as they depend critically on the individual's perception of the features of the items and the individual's semantic network. The size of the chunks generally ranges anywhere from two to six items, but differs based on language and culture.

The phenomenon of chunking as a memory mechanism can be observed in the way individuals group numbers and information in the day-to-day life. For example, when recalling a number such as 12101946, if numbers are grouped as 12, 10 and 1946, a mnemonic is created for this number as a day, month and year. Similarly, another illustration of the limited capacity of working memory as suggested by George Miller can be seen from the following example: While recalling a mobile phone number such as 9849523450, we might break this into 98 495 234 50. Thus, instead of remembering 10 separate digits that is beyond the "seven plus-or-minus two" memory span, we are remembering four groups of numbers.

A modality effect is present in chunking. That is, the mechanism used to convey the list of items to the individual affects how much "chunking" occurs. Experimentally, it has been found that auditory presentation results in a larger amount of grouping in the responses of individuals, as compared to visual presentation. Previous literature, such as George Miller's [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information (1956)]] have shown that the probability of recall is greater when the "chunking" strategy is used. As stated above, the grouping of the responses occurs as individuals place them into categories according to their inter-relatedness based on semantic and perceptual properties. Lindley (1966) showed that the groups produced have meaning to the participant, therefore; this strategy makes it easier for an individual to recall and maintain information in memory during studies and testing. Therefore, when "chunking" is used as a strategy, one can expect a higher proportion of correct recalls.

Various kinds of memory training systems and [[mnemonics]] include training and drill in specially-designed recoding or chunking schemes. Such systems existed before Miller's paper, but there was no convenient term to describe the general strategy or substantive and reliable research. The term "chunking" is now often used in reference to these systems. As an illustration, patients with [[Alzheimer's disease]] typically experience working memory deficits; chunking is an effective method to improve patients' verbal working memory performance (Huntley, Bor, Hampshire, Owen, &amp; Howard, 2011). Another classic example of chunking is discussed in the "Expertise and skilled memory effects" section below.

=="Magic number seven"==
{{Main|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two}}

The word ''chunking'' comes from a famous 1956 paper by [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]], "[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information]]" (Neisser, 1967). At a time when [[information theory]] was beginning to be applied in psychology, Miller observed that some human cognitive tasks fit the model of a "channel capacity" characterized by a roughly constant capacity in bits, but short-term memory did not. A variety of studies could be summarized by saying that short-term memory had a capacity of about "seven plus-or-minus two" chunks. Miller (1956) wrote, "With binary items the span is about nine and, although it drops to about five with [[monosyllabic]] English words, the difference is far less than the hypothesis of constant information would require (see also, [[memory span]]). The span of immediate memory seems to be almost independent of the number of bits per chunk, at least over the range that has been examined to date." Miller acknowledged that "we are not very definite about what constitutes a chunk of information"

Miller (1956) noted that according to this theory, it should be possible to increase short-term memory for low-information-content items effectively by mentally recoding them into a smaller number of high-information-content items. "A man just beginning to learn [[morse code|radio-telegraphic code]] hears each dit and dah as a separate chunk. Soon he is able to organize these sounds into letters and then he can deal with the letters as chunks. Then the letters organize themselves as words, which are still larger chunks, and he begins to hear whole phrases." Thus, a telegrapher can effectively "remember" several dozen dits and dahs as a single phrase. Naive subjects can remember about only nine binary items, but Miller reports a 1954 experiment in which people were trained to listen to a string of binary digits and (in one case) mentally group them into groups of five, recode each group into a name (for example, "twenty-one" for 10101), and remember the names. With sufficient drill, people found it possible to remember as many as forty binary digits. Miller wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a little dramatic to watch a person get 40 binary digits in a row and then repeat them back without error. However, if you think of this merely as a mnemonic trick for extending the memory span, you will miss the more important point that is implicit in nearly all such mnemonic devices. The point is that recoding is an extremely powerful weapon for increasing the amount of information that we can deal with.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Expertise and skilled memory effects==
Studies have shown that people have better memories when they are trying to remember items with which they are familiar. Similarly, people tend to create chunks with which they are familiar. This familiarity allows them to remember more individual pieces of content, and also more chunks as a whole. One well-known chunking study was conducted by Chase and Ericsson, who worked with an undergraduate student, SF, over two years. Chase and Ericsson wanted to see if a person's digit span could be improved with practice. SF began the experiment with a normal span of 7 digits. SF was a long-distance runner, and chunking strings of digits into race times increased his digit span. By the end of the experiment his digit span had grown to 80 numbers. The book The Brain-Targeted Teaching Model for 21st Century Schools (2012) states that SF later expanded his strategy by incorporating ages and years, but his chunks were always familiar, and thus allowed him to recall the to-be-remembered chunks more easily. It is important to note that a person who does not have knowledge in the expert domain (e.g. being familiar with mile/marathon times) would have difficulty chunking with race times and ultimately be unable to memorize as many numbers using this method.

==Chunking in motor learning==
Chunking is a flexible way of learning. [[Karl Lashley]], in his classic paper on serial order (Lashley, 1951), argued that the sequential responses that appear to be organized in a linear and flat fashion concealed an underlying hierarchical structure. This was demonstrated in motor control by Rosenbaum et al. (1983). Thus sequences can consist of sub-sequences and these can in turn consist of sub-sub-sequences. Hierarchical representations of sequences have an edge over linear representations. They combine efficient local action at low hierarchical levels while maintaining the guidance of an overall structure. While the representation of a linear sequence is simple from storage point of view, there can be potential problems during retrieval. For instance, if there is a break in the sequence chain, subsequent elements will become inaccessible. On the other hand, a hierarchical representation would have multiple levels of representation. A break in the link between lower level nodes does not render any part of the sequence inaccessible, since the control nodes (chunk nodes) at the higher level would still be able to facilitate access to the lower level nodes. 
[[Image:HierarchicalChunking.jpg|600px|center|Schematic of a hierarchical sequential structure with three levels. The lowest level could be a linear representation, while intermediate levels denote chunk nodes. The highest level is the entire sequence.]]

Chunks in [[motor learning]] are identified by pauses between successive actions (Terrace, 2001). He also suggested that during the sequence performance stage (after learning), participants download list items as chunks during pauses. Terrace also argued for an operational definition of chunks suggesting a distinction between the notions of input and output chunks from the ideas of short-term and long-term memory. Input chunks reflect the limitation of working memory during the encoding of new information (how new information is stored in long-term memory), and how it is retrieved during subsequent recall. Output chunks reflect the organization of over-learned motor programs that are generated on-line in working memory. Sakai et al. (2003) showed that participants spontaneously organize a sequence into a number of chunks across few sets, and that these chunks were distinct among participants tested on the same sequence. Sakai et al. (2003) showed that performance of a shuffled sequence was poorer when the chunk patterns were disrupted than when the chunk patterns were preserved. Chunking patterns also seem to depend on the effectors used.

==Chunking as the learning of long-term memory structures==
This usage derives from Miller's (1956) idea of chunking as grouping, but the emphasis is now on [[long-term memory]] rather than only on [[short-term memory]]. A chunk can then be defined as "a collection of elements having strong associations with one another, but weak associations with elements within other chunks" (Gobet et al., 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;236). Chase and Simon (1973) and later Gobet, Retschitzki and de Voogt (2004) showed that chunking could explain several phenomena linked to [[expertise]] in chess. To be more specific, more skilled chess players have a larger chunk size. Several successful computational models of learning and expertise have been developed using this idea, such as [[EPAM]] (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) and [[CHREST (cognitive architecture)|CHREST]] (Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures). Chunking has also been used with models of [[Language acquisition#Chunking theories of language acquisition|language acquisition]] (Barnard, Lieven, &amp; Tomasello, 2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5443">The '''Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit''', variously called '''Citizens Armed Forces Geographical Unit''', '''Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit''' and commonly referred to by its [[acronym]] '''CAFGU''' (pronounced "kahf-goo") is an [[Irregular military|irregular]] [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary]] force of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].

==Creation==
The CAFGU was created on July 25, 1987 when [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon C. Aquino]] signed Executive Order No. 264 entitled "Providing for the Citizen Armed Force".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Executive Order No. 264 | url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/index10.php?doctype=Executive%20Orders&amp;docid=a45475a11ec72b843d74959b60fd7bd646ccc97c654f7#sam | accessdate = 2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the unit was based on the "clear, consolidate, hold and develop" strategy adopted by then-Defense Secretary [[Fidel V. Ramos]] in dealing with insurgent-infiltrated villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Ilagan | first =Aris R. | title =Over 1,000 shotguns sent to Mindanao for civilian volunteers | pages = | publisher =[[Manila Bulletin]] Online | date = 2008-08-21 |url =http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/08/21/MAIN20080821133036.html | accessdate = 2008-12-27}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAFGU units are components of the AFP Ready Reserve detailed to Military Auxiliary Service. Article X, Sec. 61, sub-paragraph 2 of Republic Act 7077&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =ADROTH Project: Republic Act 7077, Article X - Utilization of the Reserve Force | url=http://adroth.ph/reservist/law/7077/art10.htm | accessdate = 2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes this manner of service as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Military auxiliary service entails services rendered in meeting local insurgency threat. Reservists serving under this category will be organized into Ready Reserve units. They must be issued and allowed to carry firearms: Provided, That these reservists will be utilized only for the defense of their respective localities and will not be employed outside their localities. Elected/appointed local government officials are expected to perform their duties and responsibilities in their respective peace and order council levels or similar organizations efficiently and effectively to enhance a total integrated system approach against threats to national security. The Secretary of National Defense shall prescribe the rules and regulations to implement this section in coordination with the Secretary of the Interior and Local Government.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Organization==
CAFGU units are administered by, and under the operational control of, regular units of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]]. Philippine Army infantry battalions assigned to this function are also referred to as "Cadre Battalions". Deactivation of CAFGU units assigned to these battalions result in the return of their status as regular infantry battalions.

The CAFGU units are tasked to prevent the re-infiltration of insurgents into communities that have already been cleared of their influence by combat operations conducted by regular units of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

The CAFGU units are issued [[small arms]]; typically [[M1 Garand]], [[M14 rifle|M-14]], or [[M16 rifle|M-16]] rifles, and receive a monthly stipend of [[Philippine peso|Php]] 2,700.00 (about US$57).

==Criticism==
In 1993, the Philippine government considered deactivating the CAFGU units due to allegations of [[human rights]] abuses; 60 CAFGU units comprising 10,000 troops were disbanded. However, in 1996, the government halted its program to completely disband the CAFGU units. As of 2007, an estimated 60,000 CAFGU troopers are active in the country, taking part in military operations alongside regular soldiers of the AFP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Reyes | first =Danilo | title =Policies arming civilians a product of vigilantism | url =http://www.eia.rghr.net/archive/2008-ethics-in-action/vol.-2-no.-5-october-2008/policies-arming-civilians-a-product-of-vigilantism | accessdate =2008-12-27 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090313121806/http://www.eia.rghr.net/archive/2008-ethics-in-action/vol.-2-no.-5-october-2008/policies-arming-civilians-a-product-of-vigilantism | archivedate =2009-03-13 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]]' records show that as of 2000, 853 human rights abuse cases have been filed against 1,070 CAFGU members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =On the Revival of the Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Units | url=http://www.chr.gov.ph/MAIN%20PAGES/about%20hr/advisories/pdf_files/abthr009.pdf | accessdate = 2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], the '''dimension''' of a [[mathematical space]] (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of [[coordinates]] needed to specify any [[Point (geometry)|point]] within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=4 |title=Curious About Astronomy |publisher=Curious.astro.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111191053/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=4 |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dimension.html |title=MathWorld: Dimension |publisher=Mathworld.wolfram.com |date=2014-02-27 |accessdate=2014-03-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325220941/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dimension.html |archivedate=2014-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a [[Line (geometry)|line]] has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it{{spndash}}for example, the point at 5 on a number line. A [[Surface (topology)|surface]] such as a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] or the surface of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] or [[sphere]] has a [[two-dimensional space|dimension of two]] because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it{{spndash}}for example, both a [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. The inside of a [[cube]], a cylinder or a sphere is [[three-dimensional]] because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.

In [[classical mechanics]], [[space]] and [[time]] are different categories and refer to [[absolute space and time]]. That conception of the world is a [[four-dimensional space]] but not the one that was found necessary to describe [[electromagnetism]]. The four dimensions of [[spacetime]] consist of [[event (relativity)|event]]s that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally, but rather are known relative to the motion of an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]]. [[Minkowski space]] first approximates the universe without [[gravity]]; the [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s of [[general relativity]] describe spacetime with matter and gravity. Ten dimensions are used to describe [[string theory]], eleven dimensions can describe [[supergravity]] and [[M-theory]], and the state-space of [[quantum mechanics]] is an infinite-dimensional [[function space]].

The concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. '''{{vanchor|High-dimensional space|N-dimensional space|n dimensional space}}s''' frequently occur in mathematics and the sciences. They may be [[parameter space]]s or [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]]s such as in [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] or [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]; these are abstract [[space (mathematics)|space]]s, independent of the physical [[space]] we live in.

== In mathematics ==

In mathematics, the dimension of an object is, roughly speaking, the number of [[degrees of freedom]] of a point that moves on this object. In other words, the dimension is the number of independent [[parameter]]s or [[coordinates]] that are needed for defining the position of a point that is constrained to be on the object. For example, the dimension of a point is zero; the dimension of a [[line (geometry)|line]] is one, as a point can move on a line in only one direction (or its opposite); the dimension of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] is two, etc.

The dimension is an intrinsic property of an object, in the sense that it is independent of the dimension of the space in which the object is or can be embedded. For example, a [[curve]], such as a [[circle]] is of dimension one, because the position of a point on a curve is determined by its signed distance along the curve to a fixed point on the curve. This is independent from the fact that a curve cannot be embedded in a [[Euclidean space]] of dimension lower than two, unless if it is a line.

The dimension of [[Euclidean space|Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space]] {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }}is {{math|''n''}}. When trying to generalize to other types of spaces, one is faced with the question "what makes {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }} {{math|''n''}}-dimensional?" One answer is that to cover a fixed [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] in {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }} by small balls of radius {{math|''ε''}}, one needs on the order of {{math|''ε''&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} such small balls. This observation leads to the definition of the [[Minkowski dimension]] and its more sophisticated variant, the [[Hausdorff dimension]], but there are also other answers to that question. For example, the boundary of a ball in {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }} looks locally like {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt; }} and this leads to the notion of the [[inductive dimension]]. While these notions agree on {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, they turn out to be different when one looks at more general spaces.

A [[tesseract]] is an example of a four-dimensional object. Whereas outside mathematics the use of the term "dimension" is as in: "A tesseract ''has four dimensions''", mathematicians usually express this as: "The tesseract ''has dimension 4''", or: "The dimension of the tesseract ''is'' 4".

Although the notion of higher dimensions goes back to [[René Descartes]], substantial development of a higher-dimensional geometry only began in the 19th century, via the work of [[Arthur Cayley]], [[William Rowan Hamilton]], [[Ludwig Schläfli]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]]. Riemann's 1854 [[Habilitationsschrift]], Schläfli's 1852 ''Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität'', and Hamilton's discovery of the [[quaternion]]s and [[John T. Graves]]' discovery of the [[octonion]]s in 1843 marked the beginning of higher-dimensional geometry.

The rest of this section examines some of the more important mathematical definitions of dimension.

===Vector spaces===
{{main|Dimension (vector space)}}
The dimension of a [[vector space]] is the number of vectors in any [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the space, i.e. the number of coordinates necessary to specify any vector. This notion of dimension (the [[cardinality]] of a basis) is often referred to as the ''Hamel dimension'' or ''algebraic dimension'' to distinguish it from other notions of dimension.  

For the non-[[free module|free]] case, this generalizes to the notion of the [[length of a module]].

===Manifolds===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Ball (mathematics)]]--&gt;
The uniquely defined dimension of every [[Connectedness|connected]] topological [[manifold]] can be calculated. A connected topological manifold is [[Local property|locally]] [[homeomorphic]] to Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space, in which the number {{math|''n''}} is the manifold's dimension.

For connected [[differentiable manifold]]s, the dimension is also the dimension of the [[Tangent space|tangent vector space]] at any point.

In [[geometric topology]], the theory of manifolds is characterized by the way dimensions 1 and 2 are relatively elementary, the '''high-dimensional''' cases {{nowrap|{{math|''n'' &gt; 4}}}} are simplified by having extra space in which to "work"; and the cases {{math|''n'' &amp;#61; 3}} and {{math|4}} are in some senses the most difficult. This state of affairs was highly marked in the various cases of the [[Poincaré conjecture]], where four different proof methods are applied.

====Complex dimension====

The dimension of a manifold depends on the base field with respect to which Euclidean space is defined.  While analysis usually assumes a manifold to be over the [[real numbers]], it is sometimes useful in the study of [[complex manifold]]s and [[dimension of an algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] to work over the [[complex numbers]] instead. A complex number (''x'' + ''iy'') has a [[real part]] ''x'' and an [[imaginary part]] ''y'', where x and y are both real numbers; hence, the complex dimension is half the real dimension.  

Conversely, in algebraically unconstrained contexts, a single complex coordinate system may be applied to an object having two real dimensions.  For example, an ordinary two-dimensional [[sphere|spherical surface]], when given a complex metric, becomes a [[Riemann sphere]] of one complex dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Yau, S-T and Nadis, S.; ''The Shape of Inner Space'', Basic Books, 2010, Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varieties===
{{main|Dimension of an algebraic variety}}
The dimension of an [[algebraic variety]] may be defined in various equivalent ways. The most intuitive way is probably the dimension of the [[tangent space]] at any [[Regular point of an algebraic variety]]. Another intuitive way is to define the dimension as the number of [[hyperplane]]s that are needed in order to have an intersection with the variety that is reduced to a finite number of points (dimension zero). This definition is based on the fact that the intersection of a variety with a hyperplane reduces the dimension by one unless if the hyperplane contains the variety.

An [[algebraic set]] being a finite union of algebraic varieties, its dimension is the maximum of the dimensions of its components. It is equal to the maximal length of the chains &lt;math&gt;V_0\subsetneq V_1\subsetneq \ldots \subsetneq V_d&lt;/math&gt; of sub-varieties of the given algebraic set (the length of such a chain is the number of "&lt;math&gt;\subsetneq&lt;/math&gt;").

Each variety can be considered as an [[stack (mathematics)|algebraic stack]], and its dimension as variety agrees with its dimension as stack. There are however many stacks which do not correspond to varieties, and some of these have negative dimension. Specifically, if ''V'' is a variety of dimension ''m'' and ''G'' is an [[algebraic group]] of dimension ''n'' [[group action|acting on ''V'']], then the [[quotient stack]] [''V''/''G''] has dimension ''m''&amp;minus;''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fantechi|first=Barbara|chapter=Stacks for everybody|title=European Congress of Mathematics Volume I|volume=201|pages=349–359|series=Progr. Math.|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2001|chapter-url=http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rehmann/ECM/cdrom/3ecm/pdfs/pant3/fantechi.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117052957/http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rehmann/ECM/cdrom/3ecm/pdfs/pant3/fantechi.pdf|archivedate=2006-01-17|df=}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Krull dimension===
The [[Krull dimension]] of a [[commutative ring]] is the maximal length of chains of [[prime ideal]]s in it, a chain of length ''n'' being a sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0\subsetneq \mathcal{P}_1\subsetneq \ldots \subsetneq\mathcal{P}_n &lt;/math&gt; of prime ideals related by inclusion. It is strongly related to the dimension of an algebraic variety, because of the natural correspondence between sub-varieties and prime ideals of the ring of the polynomials on the variety.

For an [[algebra over a field]], the dimension as [[vector space]] is finite if and only if its Krull dimension is 0.

===Topological spaces===

For any [[normal topological space]] {{math|''X''}}, the [[Lebesgue covering dimension]] of {{math|''X''}} is defined to be ''n'' if ''n'' is the smallest [[integer]] for which the following holds: any [[open cover]] has an open refinement (a second open cover where each element is a subset of an element in the first cover) such that no point is included in more than {{math|''n'' + 1}} elements. In this case dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''n''}}. For {{math|''X''}} a manifold, this coincides with the dimension mentioned above. If no such integer {{math|''n''}} exists, then the dimension of {{math|''X''}} is said to be infinite, and one writes dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} ∞}}. Moreover, {{math|''X''}} has dimension −1, i.e. dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} −1}} if and only if {{math|''X''}} is empty. This definition of covering dimension can be extended from the class of normal spaces to all [[Tychonoff space]]s merely by replacing the term "open" in the definition by the term "'''functionally open'''".

An [[inductive dimension]] may be defined [[Mathematical induction|inductively]] as follows. Consider a [[Isolated point|discrete set]] of points (such as a finite collection of points) to be 0-dimensional. By dragging a 0-dimensional object in some direction, one obtains a 1-dimensional object. By dragging a 1-dimensional object in a ''new direction'', one obtains a 2-dimensional object. In general one obtains an ({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional object by dragging an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional object in a ''new'' direction.  The inductive dimension of a topological space may refer to the ''small inductive dimension'' or the ''large inductive dimension'', and is based on the analogy that {{nowrap|({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional}} balls have {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]], permitting an inductive definition based on the dimension of the boundaries of open sets.

Similarly, for the class of [[CW complexes]], the dimension of an object is the largest {{mvar|n}} for which the [[n-skeleton|{{mvar|n}}-skeleton]] is nontrivial.  Intuitively, this can be described as follows: if the original space can be [[homotopy|continuously deformed]] into a collection of [[simplex|higher-dimensional triangles]] joined at their faces with a complicated surface, then the dimension of the object is the dimension of those triangles.{{cite needed|date=June 2018}}

===Hausdorff dimension===
The [[Hausdorff dimension]] is useful for studying structurally complicated sets, especially [[fractal]]s. The Hausdorff dimension is defined for all [[metric space]]s and, unlike the dimensions considered above, can also have non-integer real values.&lt;ref name="Hausdorff dimension"&gt;[http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/chaos-game/node6.html Fractal Dimension] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027003440/http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/chaos-game/node6.html |date=2006-10-27 }}, Boston University Department of Mathematics and Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; The [[box-counting dimension|box dimension]] or [[Minkowski dimension]] is a variant of the same idea. In general, there exist more definitions of [[fractal dimension]]s that work for highly irregular sets and attain non-integer positive real values. Fractals have been found useful to describe many natural objects and phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor2-first=Shlomo |editor2-last=Havlin |editor1-first=Armin |editor1-last=Bunde |editor2-link=Shlomo Havlin |title=Fractals and Disordered Systems |year=1991 |publisher=Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor2-first=Shlomo |editor2-last=Havlin |editor1-first=Armin |editor1-last=Bunde |editor2-link=Shlomo Havlin |title= Fractals in Science |year=1994 |publisher=Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

===Hilbert spaces===
Every [[Hilbert space]] admits an [[orthonormal basis]], and any two such bases for a particular space have the same [[cardinality]]. This cardinality is called the dimension of the Hilbert space. This dimension is finite if and only if the space's [[Hamel dimension]] is finite, and in this case the two dimensions coincide.

== In physics ==

===Spatial dimensions===
Classical physics theories describe three [[physical dimension]]s: from a particular point in [[space]], the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three. Moving down is the same as moving up a negative distance. Moving diagonally upward and forward is just as the name of the direction implies; ''i.e.'', moving in a [[linear combination]] of up and forward. In its simplest form: a line describes one dimension, a plane describes two dimensions, and a cube describes three dimensions. (See [[Space]] and [[Cartesian coordinate system]].)

===Time&lt;!--'Temporal dimension' and 'Temporal dimensions' redirect here--&gt;===
A '''temporal dimension'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a dimension of time. Time is often referred to as the "[[Spacetime|fourth dimension]]" for this reason, but that is not to imply that it is a spatial dimension. A temporal dimension is one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that we cannot move freely in time but subjectively move [[Arrow of time|in one direction]].

The equations used in physics to model reality do not treat time in the same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of [[classical mechanics]] are [[T-symmetry|symmetric with respect to time]], and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if both time and other quantities (such as [[C-symmetry|charge]] and [[Parity (physics)|parity]]) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time flowing in one direction is an artifact of the [[laws of thermodynamics]] (we perceive time as flowing in the direction of increasing [[entropy]]).

The best-known treatment of time as a dimension is [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]] (and extended to [[general relativity]]), which treats perceived space and time as components of a four-dimensional [[manifold]], known as [[spacetime]], and in the special, flat case as [[Minkowski space]].

===Additional dimensions===

In physics, three dimensions of space and one of time is the accepted norm. However, there are theories that attempt to unify the four [[fundamental forces]] by introducing [[extra dimensions]]. Most notably, [[superstring theory]] requires [[10 spacetime dimensions]], and originates from a more fundamental [[M-theory|11-dimensional]] theory tentatively called [[M-theory]] which subsumes five previously distinct superstring theories. To date, no experimental or observational evidence is available to support the existence of these extra dimensions. If extra dimensions exist, they must be hidden from us by some physical mechanism. One well-studied possibility is that the extra dimensions may be "curled up" at such tiny scales as to be effectively invisible to current experiments. Limits on the size and other properties of extra dimensions are set by particle experiments{{clarify|date=October 2014}} such as those at the [[Large Hadron Collider]].&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;CMS Collaboration, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375 "Search for Microscopic Black Hole Signatures at the Large Hadron Collider"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810063016/https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375 |date=2017-08-10 }} (arxiv.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the level of [[quantum field theory]], [[Kaluza–Klein theory]] unifies [[gravity]] with [[Gauge theory|gauge]] interactions, based on the realization that gravity propagating in small, compact extra dimensions is equivalent to gauge interactions at long distances. In particular when the geometry of the extra dimensions is trivial, it reproduces [[electromagnetism]]. However at sufficiently high energies or short distances, this setup still suffers from the same pathologies that famously obstruct direct attempts to describe [[quantum gravity]]. Therefore, these models still require a [[UV completion]], of the kind that string theory is intended to provide. In particular, superstring theory requires six compact dimensions forming a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]. Thus Kaluza-Klein theory may be considered either as an incomplete description on its own, or as a subset of string theory model building.
 
In addition to small and curled up extra dimensions, there may be extra dimensions that instead aren't apparent because the matter associated with our visible universe is localized on a {{nowrap|(3 + 1)-dimensional}} subspace. Thus the extra dimensions need not be small and compact but may be [[large extra dimensions]]. [[D-brane]]s are dynamical extended objects of various dimensionalities predicted by string theory that could play this role. They have the property that open string excitations, which are associated with gauge interactions, are confined to the [[brane]] by their endpoints, whereas the closed strings that mediate the gravitational interaction are free to propagate into the whole spacetime, or "the bulk". This could be related to why gravity is exponentially weaker than the other forces, as it effectively dilutes itself as it propagates into a higher-dimensional volume.

Some aspects of brane physics have been applied to [[Brane cosmology|cosmology]]. For example, brane gas cosmology&lt;ref&gt;Brandenberger, R., Vafa, C., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989NuPhB.316..391B Superstrings in the early universe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Watson, [http://www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Conferences/cosmo02/poster/watson.pdf Brane Gas Cosmology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027144123/http://www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Conferences/cosmo02/poster/watson.pdf |date=2014-10-27 }} (pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be because three is the largest number of spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially there are lots of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.

Extra dimensions are said to be [[Universal extra dimension|universal]] if all fields are equally free to propagate within them.

== Networks and dimension ==

Some complex [[Network science|network]]s are characterized by [[fractal dimension]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Song |first=Chaoming|  author2link=Shlomo Havlin  |title=Self-similarity of complex networks |journal=Nature |year=2005 |volume=433  |doi=10.1038/nature03248 |pmid=15674285|arxiv=cond-mat/0503078v1 |bibcode=2005Natur.433..392S |last2=Havlin |first2=Shlomo |last3=Makse |first3=Hernán A. |issue=7024|pages=392-395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of dimension can be generalized to include networks embedded in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dimension of spatially embedded networks |journal=Nature Physics |year=2011 |bibcode=2011NatPh...7..481D|doi=10.1038/nphys1932 |last=Daqing |first=Li |last2=Kosmidis |first2=Kosmas |last3=Bunde |first3=Armin |last4=Havlin |first4=Shlomo |author4link=Shlomo Havlin|volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dimension characterize their spatial constraints.

== In literature ==
{{main|Fourth dimension in literature}}

[[Science fiction]] texts often mention the concept of "dimension" when referring to [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel or alternate universe]]s or other imagined [[Plane (esotericism)|planes of existence]]. This usage is derived from the idea that to travel to parallel/alternate universes/planes of existence one must travel in a direction/dimension besides the standard ones. In effect, the other universes/planes are just a small distance away from our own, but the distance is in a fourth (or higher) spatial (or non-spatial) dimension, not the standard ones.

One of the most heralded science fiction stories regarding true geometric dimensionality, and often recommended as a starting point for those just starting to investigate such matters, is the 1884 novella ''[[Flatland]]'' by Edwin A. Abbott. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described ''Flatland'' as "The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions."

The idea of other dimensions was incorporated into many early science fiction stories, appearing prominently, for example, in [[Miles J. Breuer]]'s ''The Appendix and the Spectacles'' (1928) and [[Murray Leinster]]'s ''The Fifth-Dimension Catapult'' (1931); and appeared irregularly in science fiction by the 1940s.  Classic stories involving other dimensions include [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[—And He Built a Crooked House]]'' (1941), in which a California architect designs a house based on a three-dimensional projection of a tesseract; and [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s ''Tiger by the Tail'' and ''The Universe Between'' (both 1951). Another reference is [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s novel ''[[A Wrinkle In Time]]'' (1962), which uses the fifth dimension as a way for "tesseracting the universe" or "folding" space in order to move across it quickly. The fourth and fifth dimensions were also a key component of the book ''[[The Boy Who Reversed Himself]]'' by [[William Sleator]].

== In philosophy ==

[[Immanuel Kant]], in 1783, wrote: "That everywhere space (which is not itself the boundary of another space) has three dimensions and that space in general cannot have more dimensions is based on the proposition that not more than three lines can intersect at right angles in one point. This proposition cannot at all be shown from concepts, but rests immediately on intuition and indeed on pure intuition ''a priori'' because it is apodictically (demonstrably) certain."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science|Prolegomena]]'', § 12&lt;/ref&gt;

"Space has Four Dimensions" is a short story published in 1846 by German philosopher and [[Experimental psychology|experimental psychologist]] [[Gustav Fechner]] under the [[pseudonym]] "Dr. Mises". The protagonist in the tale is a shadow who is aware of and able to communicate with other shadows, but who is trapped on a two-dimensional surface. According to Fechner, this "shadow-man" would conceive of the third dimension as being one of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Banchoff |first=Thomas F. |journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews |title=From Flatland to Hypergraphics: Interacting with Higher Dimensions |year=1990 |url=http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/ISR/ISR.html |doi=10.1179/030801890789797239 |volume=15 |issue=4 |page=364 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414023125/http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/ISR/ISR.html |archivedate=2013-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story bears a strong similarity to the "[[Allegory of the Cave]]" presented in [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' ([[Circa|c.]] 380&amp;nbsp;BC).

Simon Newcomb wrote an article for the ''Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society'' in 1898 entitled "The Philosophy of Hyperspace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Newcomb |first=Simon |year=1898 |url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_42903 |title=The Philosophy of Hyperspace |journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1898-00478-0 |volume=4 |issue=5 |page=187|bibcode=1994BAMaS..30..205W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Dalrymple Henderson coined the term "hyperspace philosophy", used to describe writing that uses higher dimensions to explore [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, in her 1983 thesis about the fourth dimension in early-twentieth-century art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kruger |first=Runette |journal=Spaces of Utopia: An Electronic Journal |issue=5 |year=2007 |title=Art in the Fourth Dimension: Giving Form to Form – The Abstract Paintings of Piet Mondrian |page=11 |url=http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/4351.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929071218/http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/4351.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of "hyperspace philosophers" include [[Charles Howard Hinton]], the first writer, in 1888, to use the word "tesseract";&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics |first=Clifford A. |last=Pickover |authorlink=Clifford Pickover |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |year=2009 |isbn=9781402757969 |contribution=Tesseract |page=282 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrslMKTgSZwC&amp;pg=PA282 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330181025/https://books.google.com/books?id=JrslMKTgSZwC&amp;pg=PA282 |archivedate=2017-03-30 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Russian [[Esotericism|esotericist]] [[P.

'''Economic citizenship''' can be used to represent both the economic contributions requisite to become a citizen as well as the role in which one's economic standing can influence his or her rights as a citizen. The relationship between economic participation and citizenship can be considered a contributing factor to increasing inequalities and unequal representation of different socioeconomic classes within a country.

== Republican notions of citizenship ==
The republican model of citizenship emphasizes one’s active participation in civil society as a means of defining his or her citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/citizenship/ "Citizenship (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)." Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 13 Oct. 2006. Web. 23 Nov. 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially used to describe citizenship in ancient Greece, the republican notion focuses on how political participation is linked with one’s indent as a citizen, stemming from Aristotle’s definition of citizenship as the ability to rule and be ruled.

In relation to economic citizenship, the civil participation discussed by [[Aristotle]] can be described as economic participation so critical to the capitalist system. Defining one’s ability to be a full citizenship by his or her economic participation will establish a variegated system of citizenship in which those who can contribute most to the economy will be better represented and have a broader range of rights than those who cannot contribute as much. Variegated citizenship represents the concept that those within a different regime or status receive different levels of rights and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, Aihwa. Flexibile Citizenship: The Cultural Logics of Transnationality. Durham: Duke University Press, 1999. 217. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic citizenship in theory ==
[[T. H. Marshall]] acknowledges this concept in his discussion on the relationships between social class, capitalism and citizenship. He argues that capitalism is reliant upon social classes which directly relates to differentiated concepts of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, T. H. "Citizenship and Social Class." The Citizenship Debates: a Reader. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 1998. 93–111. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Alice Kessler-Harris]] discusses the relationship between one’s ability to labor, and his or her right to equal wages as a component of citizenship. Her central argument addresses how denying a woman the right to labor and equal wages limits her identity as a citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. "In Pursuit of Economic Citizenship," Social Politics, vol. 10, no. 2 (summer 2003): 157–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arguments by both of these theorists contribute to the notion of economic citizenship because they highlight both how economic standing and participation can be linked to one’s identity and privileges as a citizen.

== Citizenship by investment ==
{{main|Immigrant investor programs}}
Citizenship-by-investment enables individuals to acquire an additional [[citizenship]] by making an exceptional economic contribution to another country. This can be done by successfully completing a citizenship-by-investment program (also referred to as [[immigrant investor programs]]). Most of these programs are structured to ensure that the investment contributes to the welfare, advancement and economic development of the country in which they wish to reside or belong to. It is more often more about making an economic contribution than just an investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biznews.com/undictated/2016/06/30/how-to-get-a-second-passport-citizenship-by-investment-is-booming/|title=How to get a second passport: "Citizenship by investment" is booming - BizNews.com|date=2016-06-30|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs must be run in a manner which is legal and transparent, and in keeping with the [[constitution]] of the nation offering citizenship. This ideally should prevent corruption at the same time as giving the individual obtaining citizenship a sound legal right to their new citizenship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Residence and Citizenship Handbook, 5th Edition|last=Kalin|first=Christian H.|publisher=Ideos Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0992781859|location=|pages=xxii-xxiv|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries are currently able to offer investors citizenship or residence in return for an economic investment. This is usually in the form of requiring a substantial investment, coupled with compliance, residence and language requirements, among others. These countries are very selective in the type of individual they will allow to gain citizenship, however these individuals are more often than not motivated by more than just capital gains, and are looking to invest in a country more substantially from a family, social or cultural perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifcreview.com/restricted.aspx?articleId=9238&amp;areaId=64|title=IFC Review - The Global Citizen|website=www.ifcreview.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals who bring their family with them as dependents commonly contribute to the economy in a variety of ways, including paying for private schooling, purchasing real estate, extending their business and creating employment. Previously, the majority of countries with citizenship-by-investment programs were located in the [[Caribbean]], for example [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] and [[Dominica]]. More recently in the [[European Union]], [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]] have both developed successful programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2016-02-01/local-news/120-million-generated-through-IIP-scheme-income-for-2016-estimated-at-80-million-6736152648|title=€120 million generated through IIP scheme, income for 2016 estimated at €80 million  - The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/cyprus/x/507782/Investment+Immigration/CySECs+Consultation+Report+For+Application+And+Adherence+Of+Articles+61+62+Of+The+Prevention+Suppression+Of+Money+Laundering|title=Cyprus Citizenship By Investment Remains Preferred Citizenship In Europe - Immigration - Cyprus|website=www.mondaq.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that each year, hundreds of wealthy people spend a collective USD 2 billion to add a second or third passport to their collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27674135|title=Where is the cheapest place to buy citizenship? - BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, countries may offer certain options to secure a [[permanent residency|permanent residence]]. Examples of countries offering such residence programs are the [[United Kingdom]], [[Switzerland]], [[Portugal]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://best-citizenships.com/countries.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible advantages of citizenship-by-investment ==
* Better quality of life — Citizenship-by-investment programs often provide individuals with the ability to relocate permanently to another country to improve many aspects of lifestyle
* Mobility — A second, or even third, passport from a country with a high level of [[Henley &amp; Partners Visa Restrictions Index|visa-free access]] gives an individual the ability to travel widely without time-consuming visa application processes
* Security — Securing the option to [[permanent residency|permanently reside]] or retire in a safe country. This alternative passport, most likely from a peaceful country, is critical when travelling and in times of political unrest, civil war, terrorism and other situations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/passport-king-christian-kalin-helps-nations-sell-citizenship|title=The Passport King|last=Clenfield|first=Jason|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Education — Provide your children with the ability to live, work, and study in multiple countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://next.ft.com/content/155936ec-2728-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89|title=Citizenship for sale to the wealthy|last=Houlder|first=Vanessa|date=|website=Financial Times|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Financial planning — An [[Multiple citizenship|alternative citizenship]] offers more privacy and economic security across banking and investment portfolios. Investors also enjoy tax breaks and the possibility of improved personal and corporate tax exposure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneymarketing.co.za/top-benefits-of-citizenship-by-investment-programmes/|title=Top benefits of citizenship by investment programmes|date=2015-12-04|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible disadvantages of citizenship-by-investment ==
* The time it takes to complete the process differs between countries and programs, and this can also be delayed by the time it takes the applicant to submit all the necessary documentation. For example, the time to citizenship for Cyprus is as little as 90 days, while Malta and Antigua and Barbuda take between three and six months. To qualify for citizenship in Canada, the applicant has to be physically present for four years in a six-year period&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The level of investment required also varies between countries and programs. For example, Caribbean citizenship-by-investment programs require less of an investment than those programs in the EU. In Dominica the minimum investment required is USD 200,000, Antigua and Barbuda, and St. Kitts and Nevis the minimum investment required is USD 400,000 in real estate, while Malta requires USD 870,000 and Cyprus USD 2,875,000&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Governments may change their policies or requirements at any time, or increase the investment amount without much notice. Applicants who have already submitted their documents may have to make the necessary changes to still qualify for the programs
* Generally, citizenship-by-investment programs have come under much scrutiny over the years, over concerns over a lack of transparency and accountability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nearshoreamericas.com/citizenship-investment-programs-caribbean-fdi/|title=The High Price of 'Citizenship by Investment' in the Caribbean - Nearshore Americas: Premium Intelligence and Better Outcomes in Latin America Outsourcing|date=2014-09-09|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Certain governments may limit or prohibit the use of [[dual-citizenship]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8503">'''Emotions in virtual communication''' differ in a variety of ways from those in face-to-face interactions due to the characteristics of [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC).  CMC may lack many of the auditory and visual cues normally associated with the emotional aspects of interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J. R. and Barsade, S.G. (2001). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sigal_Barsade/publication/222829420_Mood_and_Emotions_in_Small_Groups_and_Work_Teams/links/0fcfd50ed6e8ba6374000000.pdf "Mood and Emotions in Small Groups and Work Teams"]. Organizational behavior and human decision processes 86(1): 99-130.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research in this area has investigated how and when individuals display and interpret various [[emotion]]s in virtual settings.

==Expression==
[[File:Emoticon.svg|thumb|100px|A smiley face might reassure the recipient of a message—or be interpreted as sarcasm.]]
While text-based communication eliminates audio and visual cues, there are other methods for adding [[emotion]].  [[Emoticon]]s, or emotional icons, can be used to display various types of emotions.  Similar to emotional displays in face-to-face communication, it was found that females tend to use more emoticons than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, A. (2000). "Emotional expression online: Gender differences in emoticon use." CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior 3(5): 827-833.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond simply using emoticons, in virtual communication platforms, people tend to capitalize letters or words to add emphasis to speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Kiesler, S. and Sproull, L. (1992). "Group decision making and communication technology." Organizational behavior and human decision processes 52(1): 96-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of characteristics of virtual communication that result in an increase in the amount of emotion displayed.  The lack of social cues in CMC has been found to have a depersonalizing effect.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, J., Dubrovsky, V., Kiesler, S., and McGuire, T. (1986). "Group processes in computer-mediated communication." Organizational behavior and human decision processes 37(2): 157-187.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, there can be greater anonymity or perceptions of anonymity in virtual communication.  This combination of anonymous and social detached communication has been shown to increase the likelihood of [[flaming (Internet)|flaming]], or angry and hostile language as a result of uninhibited behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Alonzo, M. and Aiken, M. (2004). "Flaming in electronic communication." Decision Support Systems 36(3): 205-213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moor, P. J., Heuvelman A., and Verleur, R. (2010). [http://scholar.petermoor.nl/youtube.pdf "Flaming on youtube"]. Computers in Human Behavior 26(6): 1536-1546.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it has been shown that virtual communication can reduce normative social pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Bordia, P. (1997). [https://elearn.jku.at/wiki/images/5/55/Bordia.pdf "Face-to-face versus computer-mediated communication: A synthesis of the experimental literature"]. Journal of Business Communication 34(1): 99.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of decreased social pressures, individuals may feel more comfortable disclosing either positive or negative [[affect (psychology)|affect]], which may not be considered appropriate in normal face-to-face interactions.  For example, in a large part due to decreased social hierarchies, Gilmore and Warren (2007) found many instances of feelings of intimacy, playfulness, and pride in a virtual teaching environment.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, S. and Warren, S. (2007). "Themed article: Emotion online: Experiences of teaching in a virtual learning environment." Human Relations 60(4): 581.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
The lack of social and emotional cues over virtual communication platforms can result in increased instances of misinterpreting emotion and intentions.  Kruger, Epley, Parker, and Ng (2005) found that individuals overestimate both their ability to clearly relay and interpret emotions via email.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, J., Epley, N., Parker, J. and Ng, Z. W. (2005). [http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/nicholas.epley/krugeretal05.pdf "Egocentrism over e-mail: can we communicate as well as we think?"] Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 89(6): 925&lt;/ref&gt; They attribute this inability to relay emotions effectively to others over CMC to a combination of [[egocentrism]] and a lack of paralinguistic cues including [[gesture]]s, emphasis, and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonations]].

One of the reasons that emails that are intended to be positive may come across as more neutral is that the process of email itself tends to be less stimulating than face-to-face communication.&lt;ref&gt;Kock, N. (2005). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ned_Kock/publication/3230378_Media_richness_or_media_naturalness_The_evolution_of_our_biological_communication_apparatus_and_its_influence_on_our_behavior_toward_E-communication_tools/links/0f317538725c5a868a000000.pdf "Media richness or media naturalness? The evolution of our biological communication apparatus and its influence on our behavior toward e-communication tools"]. Professional Communication, IEEE Transactions on 48(2): 117-130.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since many people tend to associate emails with work-related matters, they come to expect less positive affect to be displayed in emails.&lt;ref&gt;Lea, M. and Spears, R. (1991). "Computer-mediated communication, de-individuation and group decision-making." International Journal of Man-Machine Studies 34(2): 283-301.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the emotional ambiguity of email messages may actually lead to them to be interpreted as more negatively than they were intended.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Byron, K. (2008). [http://www.imbs.uci.edu/ssarc/internship/webdocs/session03/02-ByronArticle.pdf "Carrying too heavy a load? The communication and miscommunication of emotion by email"]. Academy of Management Review 33(2): 309.&lt;/ref&gt; Byron (2008) notes that emails from senders higher in status will be more likely be perceived as negative than emails received from people who are lower in status.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Given the permanent and potentially public nature of virtual communication, it is much more likely that unintended parties will view and interpret messages as opposed face-to-face communication, which is fleeting.  It has been found that when third parties view virtual communications, the third parties may interpret interactions as contentious disputes, when in fact there may not have actually been any conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, P. (2007). "Themed article: Sexed up intelligence or irresponsible reporting? The interplay of virtual communication and emotion in dispute sensemaking." Human Relations 60(4): 609-636.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==

Due to the excess disclosure of and the potential to misinterpret emotions, conflicts can arise in virtual communication.  Communication mediums that have the greatest amount of emotional cues and immediacy of feedback will be best to reduce conflict.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Maruping, L. M. and Agarwal, R. (2004). "Managing team interpersonal processes through technology: a task-technology fit perspective." Journal of Applied Psychology 89(6): 975.&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased emotional cues allow for better detection of negative affect, and greater displays of positive affect to counter any negative emotions.  Immediacy of feedback relates to how quickly messages are transmitted via a particular communication medium, and the expectation for which they will be responded.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, A. R. and Valacich, J. S. (1999). Rethinking media richness: Towards a theory of media synchronicity. System Sciences, 1999. HICSS-32. Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Hawaii International Conference on, IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, instant messaging has a higher degree of immediacy of feedback than email because instant messaging tends to result in much more synchronous communication than email.  Immediacy of feedback allows individuals to detect and address frustration and other negative emotions more quickly.  Furthermore, communication mediums that are more synchronous better allow for spontaneous comments, such as jokes, which are necessary for positive affect.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;  Increased positive affect helps to create positive interactions which reduce the likelihood of conflict.

An '''excursus''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''excurrere'', "to run out of") is a short episode or anecdote in a work of literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/excursus |title=excursus - definition of excursus |work=the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often excursuses have nothing to do with the matter being discussed by the work, and are used to lighten the atmosphere in a tragic story, a similar function to that of [[satyr play]]s in Greek theatre. Sometimes they are used to provide [[backstory]] to the matter being discussed at hand, as in [[Pseudo-Apollodorus]]' ''[[Bibliotheke]]''. In the Middle Ages, the excursus is a favourite rhetorical devise to allow the narrator to comment or to suspend the action for reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1018284482|title=Exkurse im höfischen Roman|last=Linden|first=Sandra|publisher=Reichert|year=2017|isbn=9783954902330|location=Wiesbaden|pages=1|oclc=1018284482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an excursus is often applied to a piece of academic writing to provide digressive information, which does not contribute directly to the line of argument, but can still be linked with the overall topic of the text.

== Etymologies as excursuses ==
Sometimes detailed or fanciful [[Etymology|etymologies]] are used as excursuses. This was used as early as the 5th Century BC by the poet [[Pindar]]. The most famous case of etymologies being used as excursuses is in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' (''ca.'' 1260) of [[Jacobus de Voragine]], in which the life of each saint is proceeded by an etymology about the origin of the saint's name.

A '''gay–straight alliance''' ('''GSA''') is a student-led or community-based organization, found in [[Middle school#United States|middle school]]s and [[High school (North America)|high school]]s as well as [[College#United States|college]]s and [[university|universities]], primarily in the United States and Canada, that is intended to provide a safe and supportive environment for [[LGBT]] youth (or those who are perceived as such) and their [[straight ally|cisgender heterosexual allies]].{{sfn|GLBTQ|2004}} A GSA may also be known by another name such as ''gender-sexuality alliance'' or ''genders &amp; sexualities alliance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Approach: Genders &amp; Sexualities Alliance Network |url=https://gsanetwork.org/about-us |website=[[GSA Network]] |accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In middle schools and high schools, GSAs are overseen by a responsible teacher. The first GSAs were established in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="GSA-ACLU"&gt;{{cite web |title=GSA court victories |url=https://www.aclu.org/other/gsa-court-victories-guide-lgbt-high-school-students |website=[[ACLU]] |accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the right of students to establish a GSA at school is guaranteed by both the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (with regard to every level of schooling) and the federal [[Equal Access Act]] (with regard to secondary schools where other student clubs are allowed, with the definition of secondary school for purposes of the federal law including middle schools and high schools). Since 1998, there have been at least 17 federal court cases in which high school and middle school students have conclusively prevailed in defending the free exercise of their civil rights on this issue, with federal courts consistently ruling that students have both a right to establish a GSA at school and to use the name ''Gay-Straight Alliance'' instead of an alternative name.&lt;ref name="GSA-ACLU" /&gt; In 2000, the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] ruled in favor of high school students whose attempt to form a GSA had been blocked by the school board, in the case of ''Colin v. Orange Unified School District''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ACLU: Appeals court ruling allows gay-straight-alliance clubs |url=https://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/colin-v-orange-unified-school-district |website=[[Lambda Legal]] |date=February 4, 2010 |accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida]] ruled in favor of high school students whose attempt to form a GSA had been blocked by the school board, in the case of ''Gay-Straight Alliance of Yulee High School v. School Board of Nassau County'', with the federal court also ruling that the school must allow the students to use the name ''Gay-Straight Alliance'' instead of an alternative name that excludes the term ''Gay''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ACLU settles Yulee High School Gay-Straight Alliance lawsuit |url=https://www.aclufl.org/en/press-releases/aclu-settles-yulee-high-school-gay-straight-alliance-lawsuit-students-meet-campus |website=[[ACLU]] |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] unanimously ruled in favor of middle school students whose attempt to form a GSA had been blocked by the school board, in the case of ''Carver Middle School Gay-Straight Alliance v.

== History of the GSA Network ==
The [[GSA Network]] is an LGBT rights organization was founded in 1998 by Carolyn Laub to empower youth activists to start GSA clubs in their respective schools to motivate and inspire fellow students to fight against [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]]. Laub initially started working with this movement in 40 GSA clubs in the [[San Francisco]] Bay area during 1988–99 and then gradually expanded to other cities and states. By 2001, The GSA Network became a statewide organization having branches in other schools in different parts of the state.  In the year 2005, it began operating programs nationally. The year 2008 saw the GSA network become incorporated as its own independent 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Prior to that, it was a fiscally sponsored project of [[The Tides Center]].  In 2015, the network hired two long time staff to serve as Co-Executive Directors to replace outgoing founder and Executive Director Carolyn Laub.  In 2016, the ''Gay-Straight Alliance Network'' formally changed its name to ''Genders &amp; Sexualities Alliance Network'' and continues to network organizations representing over 4000 GSA clubs across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gsanetwork.org/about-us/history |title=History of GSA Network|}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The GSA Network organization is based in [[San Francisco]] and has regional offices in [[Fresno]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[New Orleans]].

== Goal ==
The goal of most gay–straight alliances is to make their school community safe, facilitate activism on campus, and create a welcoming environment for [[LGBT]] students. They are part of the [[LGBT student movement]] and participate in national campaigns to raise awareness, such as the ''[[Day of Silence]]'', ''[[National Coming Out Day]]'', ''No Name Calling Week'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nonamecallingweek.org/cgi-bin/iowa/home.html No Name Calling Week] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115171355/http://www.nonamecallingweek.org/cgi-bin/iowa/home.html |date=2015-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Transgender Day of Remembrance]]'', ''[[Harvey Milk Day]]'', ''GSA day''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsaday.org/ |title=GSA Day for Racial Justice – Feb. 20th, 2015 |work=gsaday.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or locally organized campaigns, such as ''Take It Back: Anti-Slur Campaign'', ''Beyond the Binary'', ''LGBTQ-Inclusive Curriculum'' and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Change Your School |url=http://gsanetwork.org/get-involved/change-your-school |website=gsanetwork.org |publisher=gsanetwork |accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many GSAs work with local chapters of the ''[[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]]'' (GLSEN) or ''Gay–Straight Alliance Network'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsanetwork.org |title=Home – Gay-Straight Alliance Network |work=gsanetwork.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a national organization supporting youth leadership. The registered number of GSAs with GLSEN is over 4000, as of 2008.&lt;ref name="glsen5q" /&gt; In California, there are over 900 GSAs registered with ''GSA Network'',&lt;ref name="GSA FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions about GSA Network |url=http://www.gsanetwork.org/about-us/faq |website=gsanetwork.org |publisher=gsanetwork |accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing over half of California's high schools.&lt;ref name="GSA FAQ" /&gt; Over half the states in the United States have one or more statewide groups that work with GSAs.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Many of these state based groups and local chapters of GLSEN participate in the ''[[National Association of GSA Networks]]''. GSA Networks have been formed to help local area students to network and connect to local resources, provide training for youth leaders, and sponsor local GSA efforts.

The inclusion of [[heterosexual]] "straight allies" in the missions of these groups "is an important distinguishing factor from early support groups for LGBT teens, and recognizes the need for a comprehensive approach to youth safety," and attempts to build a network of support for [[non-heterosexual]] and [[transgender]] teens, as well as raising awareness of [[homophobia]] and [[heterosexism]].{{sfn|GLBTQ|2004}}

== Impact ==

=== Outcomes ===

==== Social ====
LGBT students routinely experience harassment in their schools however, GSAs and other support clubs have been found to provide social support for LGBT students.  Students have reported hearing homophobic remarks from both students and instructors in their schools.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[null Kosciw, J. G., Greytak, E. A., Bartkiewicz, M. J., Boesen, M. J., &amp; Palmer, N. A. (2011). The 2011 National School Climate Survey: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth in our nation's schools. New York: Gay, Lesbian, &amp; Straight Education Network.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the more harassment students reported, the more likely the student also reported higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, LGBT students attending a school with an active support club reported hearing less homophobic expressions and experienced less victimization than LGBT students attending a school without a GSA or support club.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Goodenow, C. , Szalacha, L. , &amp; Westheimer, K. (2006). School support groups, other school factors, and the safety of sexual minority adolescents. Psychology in the Schools, 43(5), 573-589&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, LGBT students with a GSA in their high school reported more positive outcomes when it came to high school belonging and school victimization.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Heck, N. C., Flentje, A., &amp; Cochran, B. N. (2013). Offsetting risks: High school gay-straight alliances and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth. Psychology Of Sexual Orientation And Gender Diversity, 1(S), 81-90. doi:10.1037/2329-0382&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the mere presence of a GSA on campus, level of participation in a GSA has also been linked to the amount of social support reported by LGBT students.  A 2011 study by Toomey, Ryan, Diaz and Russell (2011)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Toomey, R., Ryan, C., Diaz, R., &amp; Russell, S. T. (2011). High school gay-straight alliances (GSAs) and young adult well-being: An examination of GSA presence, participation, and perceived effectiveness. Applied Developmental Science, 15(4), 175–185.&lt;/ref&gt; found that the presence of a GSA, participation in a GSA, and perceived effectiveness of a GSA were each individually associated with youth's well being.  In certain cases, research showed these three factors protected youth's well being against victimization.  Furthermore, youths who participated in a GSA reported lower levels of depression and higher self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

GSAs are important not only at the individual level, but also to promote the education of LGBT issues to school populations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Stonefish, T., &amp; Lafreniere, K. D. (2015). Embracing Diversity: The Dual Role of Gay-Straight Alliances. Canadian Journal of Education, 38(4).&lt;/ref&gt;  GSA's have been found to promote social activism.  Researchers have argued that GSAs are a grassroots student initiated form of activism.  The same researchers claimed that GSAs are important to challenge the status Quo, confront discrimination, and reconceptualize gender.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Academic ====
LGBT youths in schools across the U.S. are subject to serious obstacles that may impact their ability to perform in school.  A 2011 study found that two thirds of LGBT students reported feeling unsafe at school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some students felt so unsafe that they reported missing school due to safety concerns.  The same study found that the GPA of LGBT children was, on average, half a grade lower than straight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This may be an indicator that LGBT youth face different barriers to education than straight youth.

LGBT youth's school experience may impact their life decisions.  LGBT youth in high school were less likely to report that they wanted to pursue further education than straight youth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These findings suggest that LGBT youths' negative experiences in primary education relate to their decision not to continue on in the education system.  This then robs LGBT youth of all of the opportunities that advanced education offers.

However, an active GSA on a high school campus has been associated with better academic outcomes for LGBT students.  LGBT youth attending schools with an active GSA were less likely to report feeling unsafe at school and were less likely to miss school due to a threat to their safety.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Additionally, LGBT youths who had an active GSA at their high school reported higher educational attainment than LGBT youth who did not have a GSA on their high school campus.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Health ====
GSAs are associated with better mental health outcomes for LGBT students.  LGBT students with a GSA in their high school reported less depression less general psychological distress and higher self-esteem than students without a GSA at their high school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Students in schools that had an active GSA also reported less truancy&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;. Gay-straight alliances are associated with student health: A multi school comparison of LGBTQ and heterosexual youth. Journal of Research on Adolescence, 23, 319–330.&lt;/ref&gt;).  LGBT students with a support club in their school also reported lower levels of victimization and suicide attempts in comparison to schools without a support group&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;).

GSAs have also been associated with other reduced health risk factors.  LGBT students with a GSA in their high school reported more positive outcomes when it came to alcohol use and problems related to alcohol use.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  LGBT students with support groups in their schools reported half as much dating violence and less casual sex.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Students with an active GSA in their high school were also less likely to be threatened or injured at school in comparison to students without an active GSA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Impact on students ===
GSAs are associated with benefits for LGBT students while they are attending school and beyond.  The next important step is to understand why GSAs are associated with these benefits.  One qualitative study found that the most beneficial aspect of a GSA was that it provides direct support to LGBTQ members and helps create a support network for LGBT students by connecting them.&lt;ref&gt;St. John, A., Travers, R., Munro, L., Liboro, R., Schneider, M., &amp; Greig, C. L. (2014). The Success of Gay-Straight Alliances in Waterloo Region, Ontario: A Confluence of Political and Social Factors. Journal of LGBT Youth, 11(2), 150-170.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another qualitative study found that GSAs were beneficial to LGBTQ students because they act as a protective factor for LGBT students' educational and social experience in school.  The study further explained that GSAs provided LGBT students with a sense of identity within their school, improved their self-esteem, and even provided students with courage and support to come out to their families and peers.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, A., Schmidt, K., &amp; Clifton, E. (2015). Gay–straight alliances: Understanding their impact on the academic and social experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning high school students. Children &amp; Schools, 37(2), 71-77. doi:10.1093/cs/cdu028&lt;/ref&gt;

One study investigated some of the possible factors within GSAs to discover which specific components of GSAs were associated with which beneficial outcomes.  This study found that when GSA advisors served for longer periods of time, students had better health outcomes.  In addition, LGBT students who perceived they had more control over their GSA experience and LGBT students who perceived their school to be more supportive had healthier outcomes.  In addition, this study reported that "students level of GSA advocacy also predicted students' sense of life purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Poteat, V. P., Yoshikawa, H., Calzo, J. P., Gray, M. L., DiGiovanni, C. D., Lipkin, A., &amp; Shaw, M. P. {{cite journal |title=Contextualizing Gay-Straight Alliances: Student, Advisor, and Structural Factors Related to Positive Youth Development Among Members |date=1 January 2015 |publisher= |journal=Child Development |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=176–193 |doi=10.1111/cdev.12289 |pmid=25176579 |pmc=4331256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact after high school ===
The relationship between having a GSA in a high school and attitudes towards LGBT individuals does not end after high school.  The mere presence of a GSA, whether or not students participated in said GSA, is related to students' attitudes toward LGBT people beyond their time in their high school.  University students who reported having a GSA in their high school were more likely to report positive attitudes towards LGBT individuals while attending their university.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, M. F. (2014). The interactive impacts of high school gay-straight alliances (GSAs) on college student attitudes toward LGBT individuals: An investigation of high school characteristics. Journal of Homosexuality, 61(2), 217-250. doi:10.1080/00918369.2013.839906.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was true for all students except students whom were raised in the southern U.S. where having a GSA in one's high school actually correlated with less positive attitudes toward LGBT individuals.

=== Impact summary ===
GSAs are associated with positive social academic and health outcomes for LGBT students.  The relationship between having a GSA in one's high school and certain positive social outcomes is known to last beyond high school, however little beyond that is known about the long lasting associations with high school GSAs.  Further research should be conducted on the lasting effects if GSAs for LGBT individuals.  Researchers have also claimed that GSAs are important not only to LGBT students, but also to change the school climate as a whole to be more informed and respectful of LGBT issues.  It has also been claimed that GSAs are important to get students involved in social activism.  Researchers should investigate the relationship between having a GSA in a high school the school's social climate. Due to the positive associations between GSAs and student outcomes, school faculty including school psychologists and counselors should become social justice advocates for LGBTQ students by supporting GSAs on their campuses.&lt;ref&gt;Bidell, M. P. (2011). School Counselors and Social Justice Advocacy for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Students. Journal of School Counseling, 9(10).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accomplishments ===
The various accomplishments since the founding of the GSAs include:
* GSAs have played a great leadership role in the grassroots by organizing the passage of many ground-breaking, statewide legislations, like the AB 537: The California Student Safety and Violence Prevention Act of 2000 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
* It has achieved a critical victory as the plaintiff in the first lawsuit filed under AB 537; which was a three-year settlement agreement which required the Visalia schools to enact sweeping reforms including mandatory teacher and student trainings that would be supportive to LGBT students.
* It also helped to pass 11 key laws to protect LGBT youth and create safer school environment.
* They also launched the [[National Association of GSA Networks]] in 2005 to unite statewide organizations to support GSAs and to accelerate the growth and impact of the GSA movement nationwide.  To date, there are 40 states which have joined the National Association in the United States of America alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gsanetwork.org/about-us/history |title=Accomplishments of the GSA Network|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History in the United States ==
Described as "perhaps the most important precursor of the GSA movement," Los Angeles' ''Project 10'' is seen as the start of the GSA movement. Founded in 1984, ''Project 10'' was widely recognised as the first organised effort to provide support for LGBTQ youth in schools across the United States. The majority of its facilitators were heterosexual, and was named after the commonly-held statistic that 10% of the adult male population is "exclusively homosexual". ''Project 10'' focused on issues such as [[drug abuse]], [[alcohol abuse]], and discussing issues of high-risk sexual behavior.{{sfn|GLBTQ|2004}}

The first GSA was started in 1988, in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] at [[Concord Academy]] by [[Kevin Jennings]], the founder and head of the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network [[GLSEN]]. The first public school gay–straight alliance was started at [[Newton South High School]] (Newton Centre, Massachusetts) by teacher Robert Parlin.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Kevin: ''Mama's Boy, Preacher's Son: A Memoir'', page 196. Beacon Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; GSAs made headlines in 1999 with the Federal Court ruling in ''Utah–East High Gay/Straight Alliance v. Board of Education of Salt Lake City School District''.&lt;ref&gt;(81 F. Supp.2d 1166, 1197 (D. Utah 1999))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Jennifer Toomer-Cook |author2=Marjorie Cortez |title=3 groups sue S.L. board over club |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/619419/3-groups-sue-SL-board-over-clubs.html |website=deseretnews.com |publisher=Deseret News |accessdate=20 January 2015 |date=19 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling found that denying access to a school-based gay–straight alliance was a violation of the Federal [[Equal Access Act]] giving students the right to use facilities for extra curricular activities at any school that receives public funding—regardless of private standing or religious affiliation.

On January 24, 2012, Secretary of Education, [[Arne Duncan]], released a video on [[YouTube]] commemorating ''GSA Day'' and endorsing GSA clubs in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94NNqjxh58A |title=National Gay-Straight Alliance Day message from Secretary Arne Duncan |date=24 January 2012 |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inclusivity ===
Approximately 28% of participants at GSA Network identify as [[heterosexual]].&lt;ref name="GSA FAQ" /&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Some students face opposition from school administrations, elected school boards, or local communities in starting a school GSA.

In 2015, students at Brandon High School in [[Rankin County, Mississippi]], attempted to start a GSA, but the school board met and publicly stated they wanted to prevent the formation of "gay clubs" in the school district. They then created a policy requiring parents to provide written permission before a student can join any club. Students then protested with support from the [[ACLU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proposed LGBT club prompts new Rankin school policy |url=http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2015/01/14/rankin-schools-gay-club-policy/21745481/ |website=The Clarion Ledger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students at [[West Carteret High School]] in [[Morehead City, North Carolina]] tried to start a GSA but the Carteret County Board of Education turned it down.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} In 1999, the [[Orange Unified School District]] in [[Orange County, California]] moved to prohibit the formation of a GSA at [[El Modena High School]]. The students then sued the school board, claiming that their rights under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and the 1984 [[Equal Access Act]] had been violated. In the first-ever ruling of its kind, Judge [[David O. Carter]] of the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] issued a preliminary injunction ordering the school to allow the GSA to meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Colin ex rel. Colin v. Orange Unified School District |vol=83 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=1135 |court=C.D. Cal. |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right of students to establish a GSA at school is guaranteed by both the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (with regard to every level of schooling) and the federal [[Equal Access Act]] (with regard to secondary schools as long as other student clubs are allowed, with the definition of secondary school for purposes of the federal law including middle schools and high schools).
{{quote|author=[[GSA Network]]|text=''GSAs cannot be banned if other non-curricular student clubs are allowed to exist at the school. The Federal Equal Access Act and the First Amendment of the US Constitution establish the requirement of equal treatment for all non-curriculum related clubs regardless of the content of speech at the club meetings.''&lt;ref name="GSA FAQ" /&gt;}}

== History outside the United States ==

=== United Kingdom ===
Worldwide, gay–straight alliances are not as popular as they are in the United States but are beginning to take-off slowly. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], there has always been more of an emphasis on stand alone lesbian and gay youth groups that take place outside of the school setting, often funded by the local health authority or education service. The first GSA in the UK was founded in 2000 by [[CN Lester]] at [[Putney High School]] GDST, and led in part to the formation of Queer Youth Network. The second GSA in the UK was started in 2010 at [[Shimna Integrated College]] in Northern Ireland. Another GSA started in 2012 by Copland Community school in Wembley.&lt;ref name=GraunGSA&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vasagar |first1=Jeevan |title=Gay-Straight Alliance club confronts homophobia at north London school |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/02/gay-straight-alliance-homophobia-school |accessdate=16 August 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setting up of the club has subsequently resulted in the school being known for "tackling homophobic prejudice".&lt;ref name=GraunGSA /&gt; Acland Burghley school in Camden set up a gay–straight alliance in 2012 called ''Connected''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/ConnectedLGBT |title=Connected: LGBTQ-Straight Alliance |work=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
The first GSA in Mexico was begun by a group of students in 2004 at the [[American School Foundation]], a private American school in Mexico City. The GSA was initially opposed by several school board members and a small group of religious conservative parents. But the students eventually won and formed the student club. The GSA's co-advisor, Ian K. Macgillivray, wrote  several articles detailing his students' experiences, as well as the book, ''Gay-Straight Alliances: A Handbook for Students, Educators, and Parents'' (2007, Harrington Park Press).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Macgillivray |first=Ian |title=Shaping Democratic Identities and Building Citizenship Skills Through Student Activism: Mexico's First Gay-Straight Alliance |journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education |year=2005 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=320–330 |doi=10.1080/10665680500299783}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Macgillivray |first=Ian |title=The Struggle for Mexico's First Gay-Straight Alliance: Como una Novela Real |journal=Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Issues in Education |year=2006 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=33–46 |doi=10.1300/J367v04n01_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Beyond a school group the [[Toronto District School Board]] has been committed to an unwritten alliance with their students, funding the [[Triangle Program]] at OASIS Alternative School, designed for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students who are at risk of dropping out or committing [[self-harm]] because of harassment in regular schools.

The first GSA in Canada was started at [[Pinetree Secondary School]] in Coquitlam, British Columbia in 1998. The start of the Pinetree GSA garnered national media attention, and its members continued to play a role in public affairs by meeting with successive provincial Ministers of Education, testifying before the B.C. Safe Schools Task Force on anti-bullying, and delivering workshops to students and educators about LGBT-sensitive inclusive language and how to start GSAs. In early 2002, the Pinetree GSA held the first Pride Day at a high school in Canada. The Pride Day included an information fair with booths from various local LGBT organizations, PrideTalk workshops delivered in numerous classes, and an assembly with a talk on transgender rights and a performance by G.L.A.S.S., a local LGBT youth choir.

In [[Saskatchewan]], Carlton Comprehensive High School houses one of the first GSA movements in the city of [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]]. The first GSA in the city of [[Saskatoon]] first met on March 18, 2003 at [[Mount Royal Collegiate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library2.usask.ca/srsd/chronology/?year=2003 |title=Celebrating a History of Diversity: Lesbian and Gay Life in Saskatchewan, 1971–2006 |publisher=Library2.usask.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, GSAs have been established at Nutana, [[Walter Murray Collegiate Institute|Walter Murray]], [[Evan Hardy Collegiate|Evan Hardy]], [[Marion M. Graham Collegiate|Marion Graham]], [[Bedford Road Collegiate|Bedford Road]] and [[Aden Bowman Collegiate|Aden Bowman]] Collegiates. The city of North Battleford Saskatchewan, had their first GSA in 2004 at Sakewew High School, a [[First Nations]] school.

Parkside High School (Dundas, Ontario) held the first Gay–Straight-Alliance assembly in Canada, in 2011.

In [[Ontario]], Arnprior District High school, a small rural [[Ottawa Valley]] town started a GSA created by the students in 2009. This GSA  won one of three [[Jer's Vision]] "Youth Role Model of The Year" awards in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jersvision.blogspot.com/2010/03/jers-vision-5th-anniversary-gala-april.html |title=Jer's Vision 5th Anniversary Gala (April 14th, 2010) |publisher=Jersvision.blogspot.com |date=2010-03-10 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year a GSA was founded by students in 2010 at Renfrew Collegiate Institute in the town of [[Renfrew, Ontario|Renfrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rcigsa.wikispaces.com/Constitution/ |title=Constitution: Renfrew Collegiate Institute Gay/Straight Alliance |publisher=Rcigsa.wikispaces.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of June 5, 2012, as part of the "Safe and Accepting Schools" policy, and Bill 13, "Accepting Schools Act"(2012) of the Ontario Legislative Assembly, all Ontario school boards are required to provide support and assistance for GSA or similar programs.

In May 2010 [[Egale Canada]] launched MyGSA.ca, a website focused on GSAs and their role in making Canadian schools safer and more LGBTQ inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mygsa.ca |title=MyGSA |work=mygsa.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of MyGSA.ca's mission the site maintains an online directory of Canadian GSAs and provided resources and information to students who wish to start a GSA in their school and for teachers who wish to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mygsa.ca/GSADirectory/ |title=GSA Directory |publisher= |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524015047/http://mygsa.ca/GSADirectory |archivedate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2011, the government of the most populous Canadian province, Ontario, announced it would bring a legislation making it mandatory for all publicly funded schools to support the formation of "tolerance clubs" and student associations. Gay–straight clubs were to be specifically mentioned in that act. The main focus of that legislation would be to counterattack bullying of students, particularly those of a racial or sexual minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/12/12/dalton-mcguinty-catholic-ontario-bullying-law_n_1143920.html?ref=canada-politics |title=Huffington Post; Dec.15,2011 |publisher=Huffingtonpost.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]], Students and teachers at [[Superior Middle School]] started their own GSA and it continues to run. It is a safe haven for many LGBT+ Students in the school.

=== Netherlands ===
The first GSAs in the Netherlands were started in 2009. At the beginning of 2011, a nationwide campaign was started on television to promote GSAs in Dutch schools, featuring several well-known young actors and singers. A number of GSAs already exist in a wide variety of Dutch schools throughout the country, most of them at the university level, but increasingly popular on secondary school level.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the group Safe Schools Coalition Victoria piloted a system of reducing homophobia though teacher training and student groups that promote inclusion of LGBT young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safeschoolscoalition.org.au/who-we-are |title=Who we are |work=Safe Schools Coalition Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Started by [[The Foundation for Young Australians]] and Gay and Lesbian Health Victoria, along with La Trobe University, the program was expanded to run Australia wide. The program is supported by [[Beyondblue]], [[Headspace (organisation)|Headspace]], the [[University of Canberra]], [[Macquarie University]], [[University of Western Sydney]], [[Curtin University]], various family planning and HIV prevention groups, government bodies and Uniting Church organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safeschoolscoalition.org.au/our-supporters/organisations |title=Supporter Organisations |work=Safe Schools Coalition Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
In 2008, students at [[The University of Hong Kong]] founded Queer Straight Alliance (QSA), a registered society under Hong Kong laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://queerstraightalliance.wordpress.com |title=Queer Straight Alliance (QSA) |work=Queer Straight Alliance (QSA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years it was the only GSA in the city, and it serves students in all campuses through social activities, career support and advocacy. In more recent years, university students in the city have formed other student LGBT groups. However, GSA efforts in secondary schools remain limited, if any.

=== Bulgaria ===
In 2016, [[Bulgaria]] became the first country in the [[Balkans]] to open a gay–straight alliance in [[American College of Sofia|Sofia American College]].

=== India ===
The first GSA in [[India]] was started in [[Tagore International School]] in New Delhi in 2014 by a group of students and their mentor Shivanee Sen who had formed a pro-LGBT group initiative known as 'Breaking Barriers' which was the first student-led campaign in India to address LGBTQI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex) issues. This group was first inspired to care and focus on the lives of oppressed students and hijras, a community of transgender women, intersex individuals, and [[eunuchs]] in India who are marginalized both socially and economically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thebetterindia.com/86407/meet-co-founder-thrive-magazine-platform-lgbt-youth |title=Breaking Barriers, First GSA in India|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At [[Presidency University, Kolkata]], around 100 students have formed a GSA group called Ardhek Akash, which also produces a magazine of the same name. In recent months the group has formed new chapters at [[Jadavpur University]] and [[St. Xavier's College]]—also in Calcutta—and is looking to expand further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gsanetwork.org/about-us/history |title=Ardhek Akash, GSA|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gloom''' is a low level of light which is so dim that there are physiological and psychological effects.  Human vision at this level becomes [[monochrome]] and has lessened clarity, making any environment more unpleasant to be in.

==Optical and psychological effects==
Light conditions are considered to be gloomy when the level of light in an environment is too low for the proper function of cone cells occurs, and [[colour vision]] is lost&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Susan E. Rothwell |author2=Fergus W. Campbell |title=The physiological basis for the sensation of gloom |journal=Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics |volume=7 |number=2 |pages=161–163 |year=1987 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-1313.1987.tb01014.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120021278/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; In a study by Rothwell and Campbell, light levels described as "gloomy" fell between 28 and 3.6&amp;nbsp;cd/m^-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiiler|first=D|last2=Veltch|first2=J|date=1995|title=Perceived room brightness: Pilot Study on the effect of luminance distribution|url=http://www.engr.psu.edu/ae/thesis/portfolios/2003/abb145/luminance%20distribution.pdf|journal=Lighting Research &amp; Technology|volume=27|pages=93–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low light and lack of color of this sort is associated with [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[lethargy]].  This association was made as far back as the 2nd century by the ancient Greek physician, [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]], who said, "Lethargics are to be laid in the light and exposed to the rays of the sun, for the disease is gloom."&lt;ref name="BJP" /&gt; Also, weaker electrical activity is found in the [[retina]]s of depressed people, which gives them poor [[Contrast (vision)|visual contrast]] so that they see the world in gray, depressing hues.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.herald.ie/national-news/the-world-truly-a-grey-place-for-the-depressed-2266475.html |title=The world truly a grey place for the depressed |author=Hannah Devlin |date=July 21, 2010 |journal=Evening Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/bps/article/S0006-3223(10)00129-0/abstract |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=205–208 |date=15 July 2010 |title=Seeing Gray When Feeling Blue?

Eagles |title=Seasonal affective disorder |doi=10.1192/bjp.182.2.174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture and ergonomics==
Where [[artificial lighting]] is used, this has to be sufficient to not only illuminate the task area, but also provide sufficient background lighting to avoid a sensation of gloominess which has a negative effect on efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://lrt.sagepub.com/content/21/3/89.abstract |title=Gloom as a psychophysical phenomenon |doi=10.1177/096032718902100301 |journal=Lighting Research and Technology |year=1989 |volume=21 |number=3 |pages=89–97 |author1=AJ Shepherd |author2=WG Julian |author3=AT Purcell }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Sight, light, and efficiency |author=Hubert Claude Weston |year=1949 |publisher=H.

Campbell |author2=Susan E. Rothwell |author3=Michael J. Perry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In architecture, the level of lighting affects whether a building is considered to be unappealing.  If there is little or no sunlight or view of the outdoor surroundings from within, then this will tend to make the building seem "gloomy".  As seen from the exterior, an interior which is brighter than the surrounding light level may cause the overall building to seem gloomy because the normal cues and contrasts have been upset.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pages=24, 54 |title=Perception and lighting as formgivers for architecture |author1=W. M. C. Lam |author2=C. H. Ripman |year=1992 | publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |isbn=978-0-442-01117-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic effect==
In the arts, a gloomy landscape or setting may be used to illustrate themes such as [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] or [[poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The "Dreary Landscape" as a Background for Scenes of Rural Poverty in Victorian Paintings |author=HD Rodee |journal=Art Journal |year=1977 |volume=36 |number=4 |pages=307–313 |jstor=776087}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Horace Walpole]] coined the term ''gloomth'' to describe the ambiance of great ancient buildings which he recreated in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] of his house, [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry Hill]], and novel, ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CUbQULHA89kC&amp;pg=PA19 |title=The Old Ladies |author=Hugh Walpole}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Characters which exemplify a gloomy outlook include [[Eeyore]], [[Marvin the Paranoid Android|Marvin]] and [[Zozobra|Old Man Gloom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Oxford dictionary of allusions |year=2001 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3YYAAAAIAAJ |page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=British fantasy and science-fiction writers since 1960 |author=Darren Harris-Fain |year=2002 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nssUAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmd8BU0FdogC |title=Zozobra!: The Story of Old Man Gloom |author1=Jennifer Dewey |author2=Jeanie Puleston Fleming }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The catchphrase "doom and gloom", which is commonly used to express extreme [[pessimism]], was popularised by the movie ''[[Finian's Rainbow (film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'' in which the [[leprechaun]] Og ([[Tommy Steele]]) uses it repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A dictionary of catch phrases |page=115 |author1=Eric Partridge |author2=Paul Beale |year=1986 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nm3jbg0JalMC&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''God's Debris: A Thought Experiment''''' is a 2001 novella by ''[[Dilbert]]'' creator [[Scott Adams]].

''God's Debris'' espouses a [[philosophy]] based on the idea that the simplest explanation tends to be the best. It proposes a form of [[pandeism]] and [[monism]], postulating that an [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] god annihilated himself in the [[Big Bang]], because an [[omniscience|omniscient]] entity would already know everything possible except his own lack of existence, and exists now as the smallest units of [[matter]] and the law of [[probability]], or "God's debris".

The introduction disclaims any personal views held by the author, "The opinions and philosophies expressed by the characters are not my own, except by coincidence in a few spots not worth mentioning".&lt;ref&gt;''God's Debris'', page X&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The central character, according to the introduction, knows "everything. Literally everything." Adams, whose knowledge is as incomplete as the next person, got around this by using the aforementioned "simplest explanation" for each concept raised in the book because, while "in this complicated world the simplest explanation is usually dead wrong", a more simple explanation often sounds more right and more convincing than anything complex.

This character, the Avatar, defines God as primordial matter (like [[quarks]] and [[lepton]]s) and the law of [[probability]]. He offers recommendations on everything from an alternative theory for [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|planetary motion]] to successful recipes for [[personal relationship|relationships]] under his system. He proposes that God is currently reassembling himself through the continuing formation of a [[collective intelligence]] in the form of the [[human race]], modern examples of which include the development of the internet; this is related to the idea of the [[Omega Point]].

However, in the introduction, Adams describes ''God's Debris'' as a [[thought experiment]], challenging readers to differentiate its scientifically accepted theories from "creative baloney designed to sound true," and to "Try to figure out what's wrong with the simplest explanation."&lt;ref&gt;''God's Debris'', page XI&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Levels of consciousness ===
The chapter "Fifth Level" (p.&amp;nbsp;124) describes five levels of human awareness, or consciousness.
* Level 1: [[Consciousness]] at birth: pure [[innocence]], [[self-awareness]].
* Level 2: Awareness of others, and acceptance of authority (a [[belief system]]).
* Level 3: Awareness that some beliefs may be wrong, but not sure which ones.
* Level 4: [[Skepticism]] and adoption of the [[scientific method]].
* Level 5: Avatar level, understanding that the human mind is a [[Maya (illusion)|delusion]]-generating machine, and that science is another belief system, albeit a useful one.

== Philosophical roots ==
The book subscribes to the [[George Lakoff|Lakoffian]] point of view, in that the mind is viewed as a "delusion generator" rather than a window to true understanding. As [[George Lakoff]] said: "Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature."

The particular philosophy espoused has been identified as a form of [[pandeism]], the concept that a god created the universe by becoming the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Knujon Mapson, ''Pandeism: An Anthology'' (2017), p. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==
Given Adams' fame as the author of the ''Dilbert'' comics, publishers were wary of publishing any book by Adams without ''Dilbert'' content. The book was therefore released initially as an [[e-book]] (with comparatively small "publishing" costs). Based on its rapid success, however, it was also quickly released in hard-cover format. The book can be found on-line (see external links below).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3230">'''Hypostatic abstraction''' in [[mathematical logic]], also known as '''hypostasis''' or '''subjectal abstraction''', is a [[formal calculation|formal operation]] that transforms a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] into a [[Relation (philosophy)|relation]]; for example "Honey ''is'' sweet" is transformed into "Honey ''has'' sweetness". The relation is created between the original subject and a new term that represents the [[Property (philosophy)|property]] expressed by the original predicate.

Hypostasis changes a [[propositional formula]] of the form ''X is Y'' to another one of the form ''X has the property of being Y'' or ''X has Y-ness''. The logical functioning of the second object ''Y-ness'' consists solely in the truth-values of those propositions that have the corresponding abstract property ''Y'' as the predicate.  The object of thought introduced in this way may be called a ''hypostatic object'' and in some senses an ''[[abstract object]]'' and a ''formal object''.

The above definition is adapted from the one given by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (CP 4.235, "The Simplest Mathematics" (1902), in ''Collected Papers'', CP 4.227–323). As Peirce describes it, the main point about the formal operation of hypostatic abstraction, insofar as it operates on formal linguistic expressions, is that it converts an adjective or predicate into an extra subject, thus increasing by one the number of "subject" slots—called the ''[[arity]]'' or ''adicity''—of the main predicate.

The transformation of "honey is sweet" into "honey possesses sweetness" can be viewed in several ways:

[[Image:Hypostasis-diagram.png|400px]]

The grammatical trace of this hypostatic transformation is a process that extracts the adjective "sweet" from the predicate "is sweet", replacing it by a new, increased-arity predicate "possesses", and as a by-product of the reaction, as it were, precipitating out the substantive "sweetness" as a second subject of the new predicate.

The abstraction of hypostasis takes the concrete physical sense of "taste" found in "honey is sweet" and gives it formal [[metaphysical]] characteristics in "honey has sweetness".

'''Ikshana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''īkṣaṇa'') is a noun which means sight, care and superintendence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Theodor Benfey|publisher=Asian Educational Services|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYoxtJZvg4EC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bBzjUta3MtOO7Qago4H4Dw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also refers to eye, sight, look, seeing, viewing, aspect, caring for, looking after, regarding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+Ikshana&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', [[Brahma]] is said to have become the Ikshana (eye), in the form of this mobile and immobile universe, of all entities that took birth; in the phrase ''Vrishbhekshana'', ''Virishbha'' implies the ''[[Vedas]]'' and ikshana, the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa|publisher=Bharata Press|pages=228, 277|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YbZZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uR3jUtPnE4zB7Ab0hYHIDw&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kalidasa]], in the phrase मदिरेक्षणे appearing in passage II.72 of his [[Shakuntala|Abhigyanashakuntalam]], has also used the word Ikshana to mean the eye, which phrase Sankara explains is – ''madira'' ('wine') as applied to the eye (ikshana), - eye as equivalent to 'beautiful', ''madirekhshane'' means the one whose eyes intoxicate like wine or is the wine-eyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sakuntala|author=Kalidasa|pages=123–124|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zXk-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nhvjUoD9IYnR7Ab8i4GwDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ikshana is a technical term used in [[Vedanta]] to show how creation took place by the beholding of Para-brahman as an intelligent and a personal act of the creator; it means revelation of the created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Hindu-catholic|publisher=Asian Trading Corporation|page=183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7lPAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Ikshana+vedanta&amp;dq=Ikshana+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jyDjUouKDcnR7Aa80YG4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parabrahman is essentially ''citta'' who produces his self as [[Shabda Brahman]] (Logos) by ''ikshana'' ('beholding').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gregorianum Vol.87 Issue 4|author=Bryon Lobo|publisher=Gregorian Biblical Bookshop|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qL4iy-iOCm4C&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Am3jUpiCIsKv7Ab-8IHQAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Badarayana]] states:-

:इक्षतिकर्मव्यपदेशात् सः| ([[Brahma Sutras|Brahma Sutra]]) I.iii.13

:"From the mention as the object of the act of seeing, it follows that the supreme Self is meant."

[[Adi Shankara]], in his commentary on this ''sutra'', states that the object of ''ikshana'' ('seeing') is the supreme Self, [[Brahman]], and not [[Hiranyagarbha]], the inferior Brahman. He says that the term ''ikshati-karma'' means the object covered by the act of seeing. The all-pervading entity (Purusa) that is to be seen can be seen to be "higher than the high one" meditated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|author=Swami Gambhirananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=177–180|url= https://www.amazon.com/Brahma-Sutra-Bhasya-Sankaracarya/dp/8175051051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pippalada]] tells Satyakama, son of Sibi, that he by the ''Sama'' hymns is elevated to the ''Brahmaloka'', he from this ''jivanghata'' ('the Macrocosmic Soul') beholds the supreme Being – एतस्माज्जीवघ्नात्परात्परं पुरिशयं पुरुषुमीक्षति - [[Prashna Upanishad]] V.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prasna Upanishad|publisher=The Ramakrishna Math|page=63|url=http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Prashna%20Upanishad%20-%20Swami%20Sarvanand%20[Sanskrit-English].pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement – ''uho nama vi-tarkoktih pra-vicharekshanatmakah'', the terms ''Vitarka'' and ''Tarka'' are used interchangeably, ''tarka'' occurs after speech, mind and prana have been restrained immediately before Samadhi, vitarka consists of advanced thought and observation (ikshana); it is through discernment (''uha'') that one leaves the lower plane of ''savikalpa'' and gets uplifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga-sutras of Patanjali|author=Patanjali|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=663–665|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2G3KR32j-T4C&amp;pg=PA664&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bBzjUta3MtOO7Qago4H4Dw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vedic concept of [[tapas]] and the Upanishadic concept of ikshana to the effect that consciousness and force are ultimately the same and every will has an aspect of force, helped [[Aurobindo|Sri Aurobindo]] to conclude that the fact is only a partial reflection of the Idea which has created it and that it is the idea which expresses itself in matter and takes to itself bodies, and formulate the 'Theory of ideas as forces'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Political Philosophy of Aurobindo|author=V.P.Verma|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=106–108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLrp0c0hizAC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Ikshana+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jyDjUouKDcnR7Aa80YG4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was through ''ekacittekshana-samyukta-prajna'' the supreme perfect knowledge was realized (''abhisambodha'') by [[Gautama Buddha]], that converted ''Boddhisattva'' to ''Buddha''; ''ekacittekshana'' refers to ''[[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajna]]'' exercised in unison with 'one-thought-viewing' when there is no separation between 'knower' and the 'known', all are viewed in one thought and enlightenment is the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essays in Zen Buddhism|author=Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki|publisher=Grove Press|pages=124–125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2d7wV4Ttx4C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uR3jUtPnE4zB7Ab0hYHIDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''illusion of asymmetric insight''' is a [[cognitive bias]] whereby people perceive their knowledge of others to surpass other people's knowledge of them.&lt;ref name=singleref&gt;{{harvnb|Pronin et al.|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This bias "has been traced to people's tendency to view their own spontaneous or off-the-cuff responses to others' questions as relatively unrevealing even though they view others' similar responses as meaningful".{{sfn|Pronin et al.|2008}}

==Study==
A study finds that people seem to believe that they know themselves better than their peers know themselves and that their social group knows and understands other social groups better than other social groups know them.&lt;ref name=singleref/&gt; For example: Person A knows Person A better than Person B knows Person B or Person A. This bias may be sustained by a few cognitive beliefs, including:
*The personal conviction that observed behaviors are more revealing of other people than of the self, while private thoughts and feelings are more revealing of the self.
*The more an individual perceives negative traits ascribed to someone else, the more doubt individuals express about this person's self-knowledge. But, this doubt does not exist for our own self-knowledge. (For example: if Person A believes Person B has some great character flaw, Person A will distrust Person B's self-knowledge, while sustaining that they do not hold that same flaw in self-knowledge.)

A group of studies, performed by Pronin, Kruger, Savitsky, &amp; Ross (2001), points to several different manifestations of the illusion of asymmetric insight:&lt;ref name=singleref/&gt;
* Study 1: Close friends' assessments of interpersonal knowledge: We know our close friends better than they know us. We understand them better, too.
* Study 2: Roommates' assessments of interpersonal and intrapersonal knowledge: We believe we know our roommates better than they know us. We know ourselves better than our roommates know themselves. And, we think the discrepancy between our self-knowledge and our roommate's knowledge of us is bigger than the discrepancy between how well we know our roommates and how well they know themselves.
* Study 3: Beliefs about the observability of one's own versus others' "true self": We believe we are less knowable than our friends—i.e., it is easier to get to know our friends than it is to get to know us.
* Study 4: Assessments of interpersonal knowledge after face-to-face interactions: In interpersonal interactions, we believe we find out more about other people than other people find out about us.
* Study 5: Perceived diagnosticity of our own versus others' responses to a [[projective test]]: Projective tests are better able to be diagnostic about other people, but not about ourselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3202">The doctrine of '''implied repeal''' is a [[concept]] in [[constitutional theory]] which states that where an [[Act of Parliament]] or an [[Act of Congress]] (or of some other legislature) conflicts with an earlier one, the later Act takes precedence and the conflicting parts of the earlier Act becomes legally inoperable. This doctrine is expressed in the Latin phrase ''"leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant"''.

Implied repeal is to be contrasted with the express repeal of legislation by the legislative body.

Under [[United States]] law, "implied repeal" is a disfavored doctrine.  That is, if a court can reconcile the two statutes with any reasonable interpretation, that interpretation is preferred to one that treats the earlier statute as invalidated by the later one.&lt;ref&gt;See Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 950 P.2d 1086, 1096 (Cal. 1998) (recalling that to overcome the strong presumption against implicit repeal the two provisions must be so inconsistent that they cannot have concurrent operation).&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Canada ==
{{see|Quasi-constitutionality}}
In Canadian law, it is possible for a law to be protected from implied repeal by way of a "primacy clause" which state that the act in question supersedes all other statutes until it is specifically repealed.  Acts with such primacy clauses are called quasi-constitutional.

== In the United Kingdom ==
In the 2002 English case ''[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]]'' (the so-called "[[Metric Martyrs]]" case), [[Lord Justice Laws]] held that some [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutionally significant statutes]] hold a higher status in UK law and are not be subject to the doctrine of implied repeal. The case specifically dealt with s.2(2) of the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act]], but in his judgment Lord Justice Laws also held the view that the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949|Parliament Acts]] and the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] are "constitutional statutes" and in his opinion may not be subject to the doctrine of implied repeal. 

A decade later in 2012, in a case before the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Supreme Court]], ''BH v The Lord Advocate (Scotland)'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/24.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;2012&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; UKSC 24]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope]] held (in Paragraph 30 of the judgment) that "the [[Scotland Act 1998|Scotland Act]] can only be expressly repealed; it cannot be impliedly repealed; that is because of its 'fundamental constitutional nature'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6RL17oiC0?url=http://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2013/11/26/adam-perry-and-farrah-ahmed-are-constitutional-statutes-quasi-entrenched/ Adam Perry and Farrah Ahmed: Are Constitutional Statutes 'Quasi-Entrenched'?

'''Infinitum AS''', former Norsk Resirk AS, is a corporation that operates the national paid recycling scheme for bottles and cans marked with the official "recyclable" or "[[Container deposit legislation|deposit]]" (Pant in Norwegian) logo in Norway. The beverages containers included in the program are the ones made of aluminum, steel and plastic (PET) produced in or imported to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infinitum - Geelmuyden Kiese|url=http://gknordic.com/case/infinitum/|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposit scheme for certain one-way containers is mandatory in Norway by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulations relating to the recycling of waste in Norway (English-translated title)|url=https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2004-06-01-930|website=lovdata.no|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was established in 1999 and is owned by companies and organizations in beverage industry and food trading (giant chain stores). The company aims to ensure the highest possible return in deposit recycling packaging for beverages at the lowest cost and environmental impact, for the time being, Infinitum managed to reach 95% return rate for one-way containers in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More empty bottles and cans are being recycled (English-translated title)|url=http://www.miljodirektoratet.no/no/Nyheter/Nyheter/Old-klif/2013/juni-2013/Flere-tomflasker-og-bokser-gjenvinnes/|website=www.miljodirektoratet.no|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information bias''' is a [[cognitive bias]] to seek information when it does not affect action. People can often make better predictions or choices with less information: more information is not always better.  An example of information bias is believing that the more information that can be acquired to make a decision, the better, even if that extra information is irrelevant for the decision.&lt;ref name="Vaughan2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Michael|title=The Thinking Effect: Rethinking Thinking to Create Great Leaders and the New Value Worker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mc95AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP29|year=2013|publisher=Nicholas Brealey Publishing|isbn=978-1-85788-933-8|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==

In an experiment {{harv|Baron|Beattie|Hershey|1988}}, subjects considered this diagnostic problem involving fictitious diseases:&lt;ref name="Baron2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baron|first=Jonathan|title=Thinking and Deciding|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fc5fQgAACAAJ|edition=4th|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-68043-1|page=177|chapter=Information bias and the value of information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A female patient is presenting symptoms and a history which both suggest a diagnosis of globoma, with about 80% probability. If it isn't globoma, it's either popitis or flapemia. Each disease has its own treatment which is ineffective against the other two diseases. A test called the ET scan would certainly yield a positive result if the patient had popitis, and a negative result if she has flapemia. If the patient has globoma, a positive and negative result are equally likely. If the ET scan was the only test you could do, should you do it? Why or why not?

Many subjects answered that they would conduct the ET scan even if it were costly, and even if it were the only test that could be done. However, the test in question does not affect the course of action as to what treatment should be done. Because the probability of globoma is so high with a probability of 80%, the patient would be treated for globoma no matter what the test says. Globoma is the most probable disease before or after the ET scan.

In this example, we can calculate the value of the ET scan. Out of 100 patients, a total of 80 people will have globoma regardless of whether the ET scan is positive or negative. Since it is equally likely for a patient with globoma to have a positive or negative ET scan result, 40 people will have a positive ET scan and 40 people will have a negative ET scan, which totals to 80 people having globoma. This means that a total of 20 people will have either popitis or flapemia regardless of the result of the ET scan. The number of patients with globoma will always be greater than the number of patients with popitis or flapemia in either case of a positive or negative ET scan so the ET scan is useless in determining what disease to treat. The ET scan will indicate that globoma should be treated regardless of the result.

[[Image:Ye principal clovris of ye clanne Stewart tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|thumb|"Ancient" Scottish [[clan tartan]]s are an example of an invented tradition created in the 19th century.]]
The '''invention of tradition''' is a concept made prominent in the eponymous 1983 book edited by British [[Marxist]] intellectual [[E. J. Hobsbawm]] and [[Terrence Ranger|T. O. Ranger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Invention of Tradition | editor = Eric Hobsbawm &amp; Terence Ranger | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0521246453}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their Introduction the editors argue that many "[[tradition]]s" which "appear or claim to be old are often quite recent in origin and sometimes invented."&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm &amp; Ranger (1983), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; They distinguish the "invention" of traditions in this sense from "starting" or "initiating" a tradition which does not then claim to be old. The phenomenon is particularly clear in the modern development of the [[nation]] and of [[nationalism]], creating a national identity promoting national unity, and legitimising certain institutions or cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;The articles in the volume include Hugh Trevor-Roper's "The invention of tradition: the Highland tradition of Scotland," Prys Morgan's "From a death to a view: the hunt for the Welsh past in the romantic period," David Cannadine's "The context, performance and meaning of ritual: the British monarchy and the 'invention of tradition', c. 1820-1977," Bernard S. Cohen's "Representing authority in Victorian India," Terence Ranger's "The invention of tradition in colonial Africa," and Eric Hobsbawm's "Mass-producing traditions: Europe, 1870-1914."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of the term and paradox==
The concept and the term have been widely applied to cultural phenomena such as the Bible and Zionism,&lt;ref&gt;Nur Masalha, ''The Bible and Zionism: Invented Traditions, Archaeology and Post-Colonialism in Palestine-Israel''(London; New York: Zed Books 2007). {{LCCN|2006031826}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84277-761-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; the [[martial arts of Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Vlastos, ed.,  ''Mirror of Modernity: Invented Traditions of Modern Japan'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[Tartanry|highland myth]]" in Scotland,&lt;ref name="Sievers2007"&gt;M. Sievers, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_U-5sq5MDBQC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=tartan+highland+romantic&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=JqATTq_bD5Gy8QOpk7H8Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEIQ6wEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=tartan%20highland%20romantic&amp;f=false ''The Highland Myth as an Invented Tradition of 18th and 19th Century and Its Significance for the Image of Scotland''] (GRIN Verlag, 2007), {{ISBN|3-638-81651-6}}, pp. 22-5.&lt;/ref&gt; and the traditions of [[Major religious groups|major religions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tomoko |last=Masuzawa |title=The Invention of World Religions|location=Chicago [[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-226-50989-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mention only a few. The concept was influential on the use of related concepts, such as [[Benedict Anderson]]'s [[imagined communities]] and the [[pizza effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderion, Benedict. "The origins of national consciousness." Nationalism: Critical Concepts in Political Science 1 (2000): 316, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

One implication of the term is that the sharp distinction between "tradition" and "[[modernity]]" is often itself invented. The concept is "highly relevant to that comparatively recent historical innovation, the 'nation,' with its associated phenomena: nationalism, the nation-state, national symbols, histories, and the rest." Hobsbawm and Ranger remark on the "curious but understandable paradox: modern nations and all their impedimenta generally claim to be the opposite of novel, namely rooted in remotest antiquity, and the opposite of constructed, namely human communities so 'natural' as to require no definition other than self-assertion."&lt;ref&gt;Masuzawa (2005), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Another implication is that the concept of "[[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]" is also to be questioned.

==Criticism==
One reviewer noted that the "'invention of tradition' is a splendidly subversive phrase," but it "hides serious ambiguities."  Hobsbawm "contrasts invented traditions with what he calls 'the strength and adaptability of genuine traditions.' But where does his 'adaptability', or his colleague Ranger's 'flexibility' end, and invention begin? Given that all traditions change, is it possible or useful to attempt to discriminate the 'genuine' antiques from the fakes?"&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/571469 "Review"], ''The English Historical Review'' 101.398 (1986): 316-317.&lt;/ref&gt; Another also praised the high quality of the articles but had qualifications. "Such distinctions" (between invented and authentic traditions) "resolve themselves ultimately into one between the genuine and the spurious, a distinction that may be untenable because all traditions (like all symbolic phenomena) are humanly created ("spurious") rather than naturally given ("genuine")."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Handler, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/679222 "Review"], ''American Anthropologist'' 86.4  (1984): 1025-1026.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1646">'''Kleśa''' ([[sanskrit]] क्लेश, also ''klesha'' ) is a term from Indian philosophy and [[yoga]], meaning a "poison". The third ''[[śloka]]'' of the second chapter of [[Patanjali|Patañjali]]'s ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yogasūtra]]'' explicitly identifies Five Poisons (Sanskrit: ''pañcakleśā''):

'''Laser cutting''' is a technology that uses a [[laser]] to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser [[cutting]] works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The [[laser optics]] and [[CNC]] (computer numerical control) are used  to direct the material or the laser beam generated. A typical commercial laser for cutting materials involved a motion control system to follow a CNC or [[G-code]] of the pattern to be cut onto the material. The focused laser beam is directed at the  material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas,&lt;ref&gt;Oberg, p. 1447.&lt;/ref&gt; leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish. Industrial laser cutters are used to cut flat-sheet material as well as structural and piping materials.

== History ==
In 1965, the first production laser cutting machine was used to [[drilling|drill]] holes in [[diamond]] [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]]. This machine was made by the [[Western Electric Engineering Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bromberg|1991|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, the British pioneered laser-assisted oxygen jet cutting for metals.&lt;ref&gt;The early days of laser cutting, par P. A. Hilton, 11th Nordic Conference in Laser Processing of Materials, Lappeenranta, Finland, August 20–22, 2007, http://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/published-papers/the-early-days-of-laser-cutting-august-2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, this technology was put into production to cut titanium for aerospace applications. At the same time {{CO2}} lasers were adapted to cut non-metals, such as [[textiles]], because, at the time, {{CO2}} lasers were not powerful enough to overcome the [[thermal conductivity]] of metals.&lt;ref&gt;CHEO, P. K. "Chapter 2: {{CO2}} Lasers." UC Berkeley. UC Berkeley, n.d. Web. 14 Jan. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
[[File:Laser-and-CNC-Control.jpg|thumb|Industrial laser cutting of steel with cutting instructions programmed through the CNC interface]]

Generation of the [[laser]] beam involves stimulating a lasing material by electrical discharges or lamps within a closed container. As the lasing material is stimulated, the beam is reflected internally by means of a partial mirror, until it achieves sufficient energy to escape as a stream of monochromatic coherent light. Mirrors or fiber optics are typically used to direct the [[coherent light]] to a lens, which focuses the light at the work zone. The narrowest part of the focused beam is generally less than {{convert|0.0125|in}}. in diameter. Depending upon material thickness, [[wikt:kerf|kerf]] widths as small as {{convert|0.004|in}} are possible.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to be able to start cutting from somewhere other than the edge, a pierce is done before every cut. Piercing usually involves a high-power pulsed laser beam which slowly makes a hole in the material, taking around 5–15 seconds for {{convert|0.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} [[stainless steel]], for example.

The parallel rays of coherent light from the laser source often fall in the range between {{convert|0.06|-|0.08|in}} in diameter. This beam is normally focused and intensified by a lens or a mirror to a very small spot of about {{convert|0.001|in}} to create a very intense laser beam. In order to achieve the smoothest possible finish during contour cutting, the direction of beam [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] must be rotated as it goes around the periphery of a contoured workpiece. For sheet metal cutting, the focal length is usually {{convert|1.5|-|3|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of laser cutting over [[mechanical cutting]] include easier workholding and reduced contamination of workpiece (since there is no cutting edge which can become contaminated by the material or contaminate the material). Precision may be better, since the laser beam does not wear during the process. There is also a reduced chance of warping the material that is being cut, as laser systems have a small [[heat-affected zone]]. Some materials are also very difficult or impossible to cut by more traditional means.

Laser cutting for metals has the advantages over [[plasma cutting]] of being more precise and using less energy when cutting sheet metal; however, most industrial lasers cannot cut through the greater metal thickness that plasma can. Newer laser machines operating at higher power (6000 watts, as contrasted with early laser cutting machines' 1500 watt ratings) are approaching plasma machines in their ability to cut through thick materials, but the capital cost of such machines is much higher than that of plasma cutting machines capable of cutting thick materials like steel plate.

== Types ==
[[File:HACO fiber laser cutting machine.jpg|alt=HACO fiber laser cutting machine|thumb|HACO fiber laser cutting machine with an integrated loading and unloading system.]]
[[File:CNC Laser Cutting Machine.jpg|thumb|4000&amp;nbsp;watt {{CO2}} laser cutter]]

There are three main types of lasers used in laser cutting. The [[CO2 laser|{{CO2}} laser]] is suited for cutting, boring, and engraving. The [[neodymium]] (Nd) and neodymium [[yttrium-aluminium-garnet]] ([[Nd:YAG laser|Nd:YAG]]) lasers are identical in style and differ only in application. Nd is used for boring and where high energy but low repetition are required. The Nd:YAG laser is used where very high power is needed and for boring and engraving. Both {{CO2}} and Nd/Nd:YAG lasers can be used for [[welding]].&lt;ref name="Todd, p. 186"&gt;Todd, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{CO2}} lasers are commonly "pumped" by passing a current through the gas mix (DC-excited) or using radio frequency energy (RF-excited). The [[Dielectric heating|RF method]] is newer and has become more popular. Since DC designs require electrodes inside the cavity, they can encounter electrode erosion and plating of electrode material on [[glass]]ware and [[optics]]. Since RF resonators have external electrodes they are not prone to those problems.
{{CO2}} lasers are used for industrial cutting of many materials including titanium, stainless steel, mild steel, aluminium, plastic, wood, engineered wood, wax, fabrics, and paper. YAG lasers are primarily used for cutting and scribing metals and ceramics.

In addition to the power source, the type of gas flow can affect performance as well. Common variants of {{CO2}} lasers include fast axial flow, slow axial flow, transverse flow, and slab. In a fast axial flow resonator, the mixture of carbon dioxide, helium and nitrogen is circulated at high velocity by a turbine or blower. Transverse flow lasers circulate the gas mix at a lower velocity, requiring a simpler blower. Slab or diffusion cooled resonators have a static gas field that requires no pressurization or glassware, leading to savings on replacement turbines and glassware.

The laser generator and external optics (including the focus lens) require cooling. Depending on system size and configuration, waste heat may be transferred by a coolant or directly to air. Water is a commonly used coolant, usually circulated through a chiller or heat transfer system.

A ''laser microjet'' is a water-jet guided [[laser]] in which a pulsed laser beam is coupled into a low-pressure water jet. This is used to perform laser cutting functions while using the water jet to guide the laser beam, much like an optical fiber, through total internal reflection. The advantages of this are that the water also removes debris and cools the material. Additional advantages over traditional "dry" laser cutting are high dicing speeds, parallel [[wikt:kerf|kerf]], and omnidirectional cutting.&lt;ref name="SPIE"&gt;Perrottet, D et al.,"Heat damage-free Laser-Microjet cutting achieves highest die fracture strength", ''Photon Processing in Microelectronics and Photonics IV'', edited by J. Fieret, et al., Proc. SPIE Vol. 5713 (SPIE, Bellingham, WA, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiber lasers are a type of solid state laser that is rapidly growing within the metal cutting industry. Unlike {{CO2}}, Fiber technology utilizes a solid gain medium, as opposed to a gas or liquid. The “seed laser” produces the laser beam and is then amplified within a glass fiber. With a wavelength of only 1.064 micrometers fiber lasers produce an extremely small spot size (up to 100 times smaller compared to the {{CO2}}) making it ideal for cutting reflective metal material. This is one of the main advantages of Fiber compared to {{CO2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bosslaser.com/blog/how-fiber-laser-technology-compares-to-co2/|title=How Fiber Laser Technology Compares to {{CO2}} - Boss Laser Blog|date=2017-05-22|work=Boss Laser Blog|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
There are many different methods in cutting using lasers, with different types used to cut different material. Some of the methods are vaporization, melt and blow, melt blow and burn, thermal stress cracking, scribing, cold cutting and burning stabilized laser cutting.

===Vaporization cutting===
In vaporization cutting the focused beam heats the surface of the material to boiling point and generates a keyhole. The keyhole leads to a sudden increase in [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorptivity]] quickly deepening the hole. As the hole deepens and the material boils, vapor generated erodes the molten walls blowing ejecta out and further enlarging the hole. Non melting material such as wood, carbon and thermoset plastics are usually cut by this method.

===Melt and blow===
Melt and blow or fusion cutting uses high-pressure gas to blow molten material from the cutting area, greatly decreasing the power requirement. First the material is heated to melting point then a gas jet blows the molten material out of the kerf avoiding the need to raise the temperature of the material any further. Materials cut with this process are usually metals.

===Thermal stress cracking===
Brittle materials are particularly sensitive to thermal fracture, a feature exploited in thermal stress cracking. A beam is focused on the surface causing localized heating and thermal expansion. This results in a crack that can then be guided by moving the beam. The crack can be moved in order of m/s. It is usually used in cutting of glass.

===Stealth dicing of silicon wafers===
{{further|Wafer dicing}}
The separation of [[microelectronic]] chips as prepared in [[semiconductor device fabrication]] from [[wafer (electronics)|silicon wafers]] may be performed by the so-called stealth dicing process, which operates with a pulsed [[Nd:YAG laser]], the wavelength of which (1064&amp;nbsp;nm) is well adopted to the electronic [[band gap]] of [[silicon]] (1.11 [[Electronvolt|eV]] or 1117&amp;nbsp;nm). 

===Reactive cutting===
Also called "burning stabilized laser gas cutting", "flame cutting". Reactive cutting is like oxygen torch cutting but with a laser beam as the ignition source. Mostly used for cutting carbon steel in thicknesses over 1&amp;nbsp;mm. This process can be used to cut very thick steel plates with relatively little laser power.

== Tolerances and surface finish ==
Laser cutters have positioning accuracy of 10 micrometers and repeatability of 5 micrometers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Standard [[Surface roughness|roughness]] Rz increases with the sheet thickness, but decreases with laser power and [[cutting speed]]. When cutting low carbon steel with laser power of 800 W, standard roughness Rz is 10&amp;nbsp;μm for sheet thickness of 1&amp;nbsp;mm, 20&amp;nbsp;μm for 3&amp;nbsp;mm, and 25&amp;nbsp;μm for 6&amp;nbsp;mm. 

&lt;math display="block"&gt;Rz = \frac{ 12.528 \cdot S^{0.542} }{ P^{0.528} \cdot V^{0.322} }&lt;/math&gt;

Where: &lt;math&gt;S =&lt;/math&gt; steel sheet thickness in mm; &lt;math&gt;P =&lt;/math&gt; laser power in kW (some new laser cutters have laser power of 4&amp;nbsp;kW); &lt;math&gt;V =&lt;/math&gt; cutting speed in meters per minute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.om.ugal.ro/AnnalsFasc8Tribology/pdf/2006/13-Annals2006-Radovanovic.pdf|title=Research on surface roughness by laser cut by Miroslav Radovanovic and Predrag Dašić|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This process is capable of holding quite close [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]], often to within 0.001&amp;nbsp;inch (0.025&amp;nbsp;mm). Part geometry and the mechanical soundness of the machine have much to do with tolerance capabilities. The typical surface finish resulting from laser beam cutting may range from 125 to 250 micro-inches (0.003&amp;nbsp;mm to 0.006&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref name="Todd, p. 186"/&gt;

== Machine configurations ==
[[File:Dual Pallet Flying Optics Laser.jpg|thumb|Dual-pallet flying optics laser]]
[[File:Industrial 4kW laser with flying optics system.jpg|thumb|Flying optics laser head]]

There are generally three different configurations of industrial laser cutting machines: moving material, hybrid, and flying optics systems. These refer to the way that the laser beam is moved over the material to be cut or processed. For all of these, the axes of motion are typically designated X and Y [[Coordinate axis|axis]]. If the cutting head may be controlled, it is designated as the Z-axis.

Moving material lasers have a stationary cutting head and move the material under it. This method provides a constant distance from the laser generator to the workpiece and a single point from which to remove cutting effluent. It requires fewer optics, but requires moving the workpiece. This style machine tends to have the fewest beam delivery optics, but also tends to be the slowest.

Hybrid lasers provide a table which moves in one axis (usually the X-axis) and move the head along the shorter (Y) axis. This results in a more constant beam delivery path length than a flying optic machine and may permit a simpler beam delivery system. This can result in reduced power loss in the delivery system and more capacity per watt than flying optics machines.

Flying optics lasers feature a stationary table and a cutting head (with laser beam) that moves over the workpiece in both of the horizontal dimensions. Flying optics cutters keep the workpiece stationary during processing and often do not require material clamping. The moving mass is constant, so dynamics are not affected by varying size of the workpiece. Flying optics machines are the fastest type, which is advantageous when cutting thinner workpieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRah71xUxbMC&amp;pg=PA38|title=Laser Cutting Guide for Manufacturing|last=Caristan|first=Charles L.|date=2004|publisher=Society of Manufacturing Engineers|isbn=9780872636866|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flying optic machines must use some method to take into account the changing beam length from near field (close to resonator) cutting to far field (far away from resonator) cutting. Common methods for controlling this include collimation, adaptive optics or the use of a constant beam length axis.

[[Multiaxis machining|five and six-axis machines]] also permit cutting formed workpieces. In addition, there are various methods of orienting the laser beam to a shaped workpiece, maintaining a proper focus distance and nozzle standoff, etc.

=== Pulsing ===
[[Pulsed lasers]] which provide a high-power burst of energy for a short period are very effective in some laser cutting processes, particularly for piercing, or when very small holes or very low cutting speeds are required, since if a constant laser beam were used, the heat could reach the point of melting the whole piece being cut.

Most industrial lasers have the ability to pulse or cut CW (continuous wave) under NC ([[numerical control]]) program control.

Double pulse lasers use a series of pulse pairs to improve material removal rate and hole quality. Essentially, the first pulse removes material from the surface and the second prevents the ejecta from adhering to the side of the hole or cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |author= Forsman, A|url= //fusion.gat.com/pubs-ext/miscpubs/A25867.pdf | title = Superpulse A nanosecond pulse format to improve laser drilling |publisher= Photonics Spectra |date= June 2007 |accessdate= June 16, 2014 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power consumption ==
The main disadvantage of laser cutting is the high power consumption. Industrial laser efficiency may range from 5% to 45%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laserline.de/tl_files/Laserline/downloads/broschueren/en/Laserline_Image_high_power_diode_laser.pdf - Page 4:"High electrical/optical efficiency of up to 45%"&lt;/ref&gt; The power consumption and efficiency of any particular laser will vary depending on output power and operating parameters. This will depend on type of laser and how well the laser is matched to the work at hand. The amount of laser cutting power required, known as ''heat input'', for a particular job depends on the material type, thickness, process (reactive/inert) used, and desired cutting rate.

== Production and cutting rates ==
The maximum cutting rate (production rate) is limited by a number of factors including laser power, material thickness, process type (reactive or inert), and material properties. Common industrial systems (≥1&amp;nbsp;kW) will cut carbon steel metal from {{nowrap|0.51 – 13 mm}} in thickness. For all intents and purposes, a laser can be up to thirty times faster than standard sawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laserage.com/laser-cutting/|title=Laser Cutting|last=|first=|date=|website=Laserage|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modular design''', or "[[modularity]] in design", is a design approach that subdivides a system into smaller parts called modules or [[modular process skid|skids]], that can be independently created and then used in different systems. A modular system can be characterized by functional partitioning into discrete scalable, reusable modules; rigorous use of well-defined modular interfaces; and making use of industry standards for interfaces.

Besides reduction in cost (due to less customization, and shorter learning time), and flexibility in design, modularity offers other benefits such as augmentation (adding new solution by merely plugging in a new module), and exclusion. Examples of modular systems are [[car]]s, [[computers]], [[Modular process skid|process systems]], [[solar panel]]s and [[wind turbine]]s, [[elevator]]s and modular buildings. Earlier examples include [[furniture]], [[loom]]s, [[railroad signal]]ing systems, [[telephone exchanges]], [[pipe organ]]s, [[Modular synthesizer|synthesizers]] and [[electric power distribution]] systems. Evolution also results in the modular design of species in that homologous modules sharing approximately the same form or function appear in different organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, M.A. (2002) Modularity in multiple disciplines. In Garud, R., Langlois, R., &amp; Kumaraswamy, A. (eds) Managing in the Modular Age: Architectures, Networks and Organizations. Oxford, England: Blackwell Publishers, pg. 203-214 {{ISBN|0631233164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computers use modularity to overcome changing customer demands and to make the manufacturing process more adaptive to change (see [[modular programming]]).&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin and Clark, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Modular design is an attempt to combine the advantages of [[standardization]] (high volume normally equals low manufacturing costs) with those of [[Personalization|customization]]. A downside to modularity (and this depends on the extent of modularity) is that low quality modular systems are not optimized for performance. This is usually due to the cost of putting up interfaces between modules.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich K (1995) The role of product architecture in the manufacturing firm.

[[File:2010-04-07 Unimog at Arthur Ibbetts machinery dealership.jpg|thumb|The modular design of the [[Unimog]] offers attachment capabilities for various different [[List of agricultural machinery|implements]].]]

Aspects of modular design can be seen in cars or other [[vehicles]] to the extent of there being certain parts to the car that can be added or removed without altering the rest of the car.

A simple example of modular design in cars is the fact that, while many cars come as a basic model, paying extra will allow for "snap in" upgrades such as a more powerful engine or seasonal tires; these do not require any change to other units of the car such as the chassis, steering, electric motor or battery systems.

==In machines and architecture==
{{main article|Modular building}}
Modular design can be seen in certain buildings. Modular buildings (and also modular homes) generally consist of universal parts (or modules) that are manufactured in a [[factory]] and then shipped to a build site where they are assembled into a variety of arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architecture.about.com/cs/buildyourhouse/g/modular.htm|title=Modular home definition|accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modular buildings can be added to or reduced in size by adding or removing certain components. This can be done without altering larger portions of the building. Modular buildings can also undergo changes in functionality using the same process of adding or removing components.

[[File:Flexible Workplace Variability.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Modular workstations]]

For example, an [[office]] building can be built using modular parts such as walls, frames, doors, ceilings, and windows. The interior can then be partitioned (or divided) with more walls and furnished with desks, computers, and whatever else is needed for a functioning workspace. If the office needs to be expanded or redivided to accommodate employees, modular components such as wall panels can be added or relocated to make the necessary changes without altering the whole building. Later, this same office can be broken down and rearranged to form a [[retail]] space, [[conference hall]] or another type of building, using the same modular components that originally formed the office building. The new building can then be refurnished with whatever items are needed to carry out its desired functions.

Other types of modular buildings that are offered from a company like Allied Modular include a [[guardhouse]], machine enclosure, [[press box]], [[conference room]], two-story building, [[clean room]] and many more applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliedmodular.com/products Allied Modular Products] Allied Modular. Retrieved March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Many misconceptions are held regarding modular buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icon-construction.com/2014/08/top-5-myths-modular-construction/|title=modular building|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140917142328/http://icon-construction.com/2014/08/top-5-myths-modular-construction/|archivedate=2014-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality modular construction is a viable method of construction for quick turnaround and fast growing companies. Industries that would benefit from this include healthcare, commercial, retail, military, and multi-family/student housing.

==In televisions==

In 1963 [[Motorola]] introduced the first rectangular color picture tube, and in 1967 introduced the modular [[Quasar (brand)|Quasar]] brand. In 1964 it opened its first research and development branch outside of the United States, in Israel under the management of Moses Basin. In 1974 Motorola sold its television business to the Japan-based Matsushita, the parent company of Panasonic.

==In computer hardware==
[[File:Xi3 modular computer 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Modular computer design]] 
Modular design in computer hardware is the same as in other things (e.g. cars, refrigerators, and furniture). The idea is to build computers with easily replaceable parts that use standardized interfaces. This technique allows a user to upgrade certain aspects of the computer easily without having to buy another computer altogether. This idea was also being implemented in [[Project Ara]], which provided a platform for manufactures to create modules for a smartphone which could then be customised by the end user.

A computer is one of the best examples of modular design. Typical modules include [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supply units]], [[Central processing unit|processors]], [[mainboard]]s, [[graphics card]]s, [[hard drive]]s, and [[optical drive]]s. All of these parts should be easily interchangeable as long as the user uses parts that support the same standard interface. Similar to the computer's modularity, other tools have been developed to leverage modular design, such as [[LittleBits|littleBits Electronics]], which snap together with interoperable modules to create circuits.&lt;ref name="PSFK 5.15"&gt;{{cite web|title=How One Entrepreneur Is Bringing Fringe Maker Knowledge Mainstream|url=http://www.psfk.com/2014/08/one-entrepreneur-bringing-fringe-maker-knowledge-mainstream.html|website=PSFK|publisher=PSFK|accessdate=27 May 2015|ref=PSFK|date=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modular Design, Digital Twin, and Industry 4.0 directions==
During the presentation of the [[Product lifecycle management|PLM]] centre of University of Michigan, Grieves&lt;ref&gt;Grieves, M. (2005). “Product Lifecycle Management: the new paradigm for enterprises.” Int. J. Product development 2, 71-84 &lt;/ref&gt; launched inside the modular design contest the initial idea of "Conceptual ideal for PLM", that introduces: real space, virtual space, the link for data flow from real space to virtual space, the link for information flow from virtual space to real space and virtual sub-spaces.
Egan &lt;ref&gt;Egan, M. (2004). “Implementing A Successful Modular Design-PTC´s Approach.” In Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Product Structuring - Product Platform Development, Chalmers University, Göteborg, Sweden, 24.-25.03. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;([[PTC Inc]]) disclosed the strategy for an implementation of modular design in a PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) contest through a process that starts with a cross-functional input to the definition of the product architecture, and includes an architecture development program that keeps the integrity of the product during its lifecycle.  
Grieves &lt;ref&gt;Grieves, M. (2006), “[[Product Lifecycle Management]], Driving the Next Generation of Lean Thinking”, New York, McGraw-Hill &lt;/ref&gt;has produced an effective definition of [[digital twin]]: “A strategic business approach that applies a consistent set of business solutions in support of the collaborative creation, management, dissemination, and use of product definition information across the extended enterprise from concept to end of life –integrating people, processes, business systems, and information”.

==Integrating Lifecycle and Energy assessments into modular design ==
Some authors observe that modular design has generated in the vehicle industry a constant increase of weight over time. Trancossi &lt;ref&gt;Trancossi, M. A response to industrial maturity and energetic issues: a possible solution based on constructal law. Eur. Transp. Res. Rev. (2015) 7: 2. doi:10.1007/s12544-014-0150-4&lt;/ref&gt; advanced the hypothesis that modular design can be coupled by some optimization criteria derived from the [[constructal law]]. In fact, the constructal law is modular for his nature and can apply with interesting results in engineering simple systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bejan A., and Lorente S., “Constructal theory of generation of configuration in nature and engineering”, J. Appl. Phys., 100, 2006, doi:10.1063/1.2221896&lt;/ref&gt; It applies with a typical bottom-up optimization schema: 
* a system can be divided into subsystems (elemental parts) using tree models;
* any complex system can be represented in a modular way and it is possible to describe how different physical magnitudes flow through the system; 
* analysing the different flowpaths it is possible to identify the critical components that affect the performance of the system; 
* by optimizing those components and substituting them with more performing ones, it is possible to improve the performances of the system. 
A better formulation has been produced during the MAAT EU FP7 Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/99650_en.html | title=Multibody Advanced Airship for Transport &amp;#124; Projects &amp;#124; FP7-TRANSPORT}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new design method that couples the above bottom-up optimization with a preliminary system level top-down design has been formulated.&lt;ref&gt;Dumas A, Madonia M, Trancossi M, Vucinic D (2013) Propulsion of photovoltaic cruiser-feeder airships dimensioning by constructal design for efficiency method.

A theoretical formulation has been provided in a recent paper,&lt;ref&gt;Trancossi, M. Eur. Transp. Res. Rev. (2015) 7: 2. doi:10.1007/s12544-014-0150-4 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12544-014-0150-4&lt;/ref&gt; and applied with success to the design of a small aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;Trancossi, M., Bingham, C., Capuani, A., Das, S. et al., "Multifunctional Unmanned Reconnaissance Aircraft for Low-Speed and STOL Operations," SAE Technical Paper 2015-01-2465, 2015, doi:10.4271/2015-01-2465. https://www.academia.edu/download/39296132/2015-01-2465.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the conceptual design of innovative commuter aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;Trancossi, M., Madonia, M., Dumas, A. et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9132">The '''moralistic fallacy''' is the [[informal fallacy]] of assuming that an aspect of nature which has socially unpleasant consequences cannot exist. Its typical form is "if ''X'' were true, then it would happen that ''Z''!", where ''Z'' is a morally, socially or politically undesirable thing. What should be moral is assumed ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' to also be naturally occurring. The moralistic fallacy is sometimes presented as the inverse of the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. However, it could be seen as a variation of the very same naturalistic fallacy; the difference between them could be considered [[Pragmatics|pragmatical]], depending on the intentions of that who uses it: naturalistic fallacy if the user wants to justify existing social practices with the argument that they are natural; moralistic fallacy if the user wants to combat existing social practices with the argument of denying that they are natural.

==Examples==
[[Steven Pinker]] writes that "[t]he naturalistic fallacy is the idea that what is found in nature is good. It was the basis for [[social Darwinism]], the belief that helping the poor and sick would get in the way of evolution, which depends on the survival of the fittest. Today, biologists denounce the naturalistic fallacy because they want to describe the natural world honestly, without people deriving morals about how we ought to behave (as in: If birds and beasts engage in adultery, infanticide, cannibalism, it must be OK)." Pinker goes on to explain that "[t]he moralistic fallacy is that what is good is found in nature. It lies behind the bad science in nature-documentary voiceovers: lions are mercy-killers of the weak and sick, mice feel no pain when cats eat them, dung beetles recycle dung to benefit the ecosystem and so on. It also lies behind the romantic belief that humans cannot harbor desires to kill, rape, lie, or steal because that would be too depressing or reactionary."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Q&amp;A: Steven Pinker of 'Blank Slate'|url = http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2002/10/30/QA-Steven-Pinker-of-Blank-Slate/26021035991232/|website = [[UPI]]|accessdate = December 5, 2015|date = October 30, 2002|last = Sailer|first = Steve|archivedate = December 5, 2015|dead-url = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151205074319/http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2002/10/30/QA-Steven-Pinker-of-Blank-Slate/26021035991232/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moralistic fallacy:'''
*''Warfare is destructive and tragic, and so it is not of human nature.''
*''Eating meat harms animals and the environment, and so no one has physiological use for it.''

==Effects on science and society ==

Sometimes [[basic science|basic scientific]] findings or interpretations are rejected, or their discovery or development or acknowledgement is opposed or restricted, through assertions of potential misuse or harmfulness.

In the late 1970s, [[Bernard Davis (biologist)|Bernard Davis]], in response to growing political and public calls to restrict [[basic research]] (versus [[applied research]]), amid criticisms of dangerous knowledge (versus dangerous applications), applied the term ''moralistic fallacy'' toward its present use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davis BD |title=The moralistic fallacy |journal=Nature |volume=272 |issue=5652 |page=390 |year=1978 |pmid=11643452 |doi=10.1038/272390a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(The term was used as early as 1957 to at least some if differing import.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moore EC |title=The Moralistic Fallacy |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=29–42 |year=1957 |jstor=2022356 |doi=10.2307/2022356}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In [[natural science]], the moralistic fallacy can result in rejection or suppression of [[basic science]], whose goal is understanding the natural world, on account of its potential misuse in [[applied science]], whose goal is the development of technology or technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davis BD |title=The scientist's world |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev |year=2000 |pmid=10704471 |pmc=98983 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.64.1.1-12.2000 |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This blurs ''scientific assessment'', discussed in natural sciences (like [[physics]] or [[biology]]), versus ''significance assessment'', weighed in [[social sciences]] (like [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[political science]]), or in [[behavioral sciences]] (like [[psychology]]).

Davis asserted that in basic science, the descriptive, explanatory, and thus predictive ability of information is primary, not its origin or its applications, since knowledge cannot be ensured against misuse, and misuse cannot [[falsify]] knowledge.  Both misuse of scientific work and suppression of scientific knowledge can have undesired or even undesirable effects. In the early 20th century, the development of [[quantum physics]] made possible the [[atomic bomb]] in the mid 20th century.  Without quantum physics, however, much of the technology of [[communications]] and [[Medical imaging|imaging]] might have been impossible.

Scientific theories with abundant research support can be discarded in public debates, where general agreement is central but can be utterly false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kreutzberg GW |title=Scientists and the marketplace of opinions |journal=EMBO Rep |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=393–96 |year=2005 |pmid=15864285 |pmc=1299311 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The obligation of basic scientists to inform the public, however, can be stymied by contrasting claims from others both rousing alarm and touting assurances of protecting the public.&lt;ref name=technology&gt;Davis BD (2000), section [http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/64/1/1#SEC2 "Technology"].&lt;/ref&gt;  Davis had indicated that greater and clearer familiarization with the uses and limitations of science can more effectively prevent knowledge misuse or harm.&lt;ref name=limited&gt;Davis BD (2000), section [http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/64/1/1#SEC4 "Limited scope of science"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural science can help humans understand the natural world, but it cannot make policy, moral, or behavioral decisions.&lt;ref name=limited/&gt;  Questions involving ''values''—what people should do—are more effectively addressed through discourse in social sciences, not by restriction of basic science.&lt;ref name=limited/&gt;  Misunderstanding of the potential of science, and misplaced expectations, have resulted in moral and decisionmaking impediments, but suppressing science is unlikely to resolve these dilemmas.&lt;ref name=limited/&gt;

==Seville Statement on Violence==
The [[Seville Statement on Violence]] was adopted,  in [[Seville]], Spain, on 16 May 1986, by an international meeting of scientists convened by the Spanish National Commission for [[UNESCO]].  UNESCO adopted the statement, on 16 November 1989, at the twenty-fifth session of its General Conference.  The statement purported to refute "the notion that organized human violence is biologically determined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Suter |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Suter |title=50 Things You Want to Know About World Issues...

Some, including Steven Pinker,&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven. ''How the Mind Works''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1997, pp. 44, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  have criticized the Seville Statement as an example of the moralistic fallacy.  Research in the areas of [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[neuropsychology]] suggest that human violence has biological roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones D |title=Human behaviour: Killer instincts |journal=Nature |volume=451 |issue=7178 |pages=512–15 |year=2008 |pmid=18235473 |doi=10.1038/451512a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=May ME &amp; Kennedy CH |title=Aggression as positive reinforcement in mice under various ratio- and time-based reinforcement schedules |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=185–96 |year=2009 |pmid=19794833 |pmc=2648522 |doi=10.1901/jeab.2009.91-185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46455">'''Native American civil rights''' are the [[civil rights]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the United States.  Native Americans are citizens of their [[federally recognized tribes|clanic nations]] as well as the United States and those clanic nations are characterized under U.S.&amp;nbsp;law as "domestic dependent nations", a special relationship that creates a particular tension between rights retained via [[tribal sovereignty]] and rights that individual Natives obtained as [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizen]]s. This status creates tension today, but was far more extreme before Native people were uniformly granted U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizenship in 1924. Assorted laws and policies of the United States government, some tracing to the pre-Revolutionary [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial period]], denied basic [[human rights]]—particularly in the areas of cultural expression and travel—to indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanindiantah.com/history/cron_1871_1934.html|title=American Indian Civics Project: 1871 to 1924- Allotment and Assimilation|work=americanindiantah.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716021641/http://americanindiantah.com/history/cron_1871_1934.html|archivedate=2011-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is difficult to summarize the [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|many tribes and peoples]] Native to the land that is now owned by the US, there are some rights that nearly all Native Americans are still actively pursuing. These include the protection of rights to voting and the resistance of assimilation to European American practices and beliefs. Many tribes that live on reservations are currently facing the destruction of surrounding environments and water sources, depressed economies, [[violence against women]], and drug and alcohol addiction crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/13-native-american-issues_us_55b7d801e4b0074ba5a6869c|title=13 Issues Facing Native People Beyond Mascots And Casinos|last=NoiseCat|first=Julian Brave|date=2015-07-30|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-contact with Europeans ==
Before colonization, millions of Native people lived in what is now considered North and South America. Indigenous peoples cultures, origins, religions, and languages are vastly diverse. The [[Oral history|histories]] of the tribes who have survived the [[Genocide of indigenous peoples#Colonialism and genocide in the Americas|genocide of Native Americans]] have mostly survived through [[Oral storytelling|oral story telling]] traditions.

Religious practices among Natives, pre-colonialism range from individual prayers, rituals, and offerings to large intertribal ceremonies. [[Pre-Columbian era|Precontact]] religion was often closely tied to the land, the environment.&lt;ref name="JUtter"&gt;Utter, Jack. ''American Indians: Answers to Today's Questions''. 2nd edition. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2001. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns include the omnipresent, invisible universal force, and "the three 'life crises' of birth, puberty, and death," spiritual beings, revelations, human intercessors into the spirit world, and ceremonies that renew communities.&lt;ref name="JUtter" /&gt;

== 1585-1786: Initial meetings ==
In [[1585]], a tribe on the eastern coast of North America interacted with the first English person to travel to the continent, [[Richard Grenville]]. The Native people were hospitable and receptive to Grenville. Yet, when one Native stole a small silver cup from him, Grenville sacked and burned down the entire village in revenge.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People's History of the united States|last=Zinn|first=Howard|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2003|isbn=9780061965586|location=New York City|pages=12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1607, decades after this initial interaction, the English established [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the first permanent English settlement on North America, in the middle of the [[Powhatan Confederacy|Powhatan confederacy]] in what is now [[Virginia]]. [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Powhatan]], the leader, did not attack the English as they settled, though the English attacked the Powhatans upon meeting them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In the winter of 1609 through 1610, Jamestown residents had little food or effective shelter as they experienced the [[Starving Time]]. The Powhatan people integrated and cared for the English who left Jamestown to live with them, as they were much more prepared for the harsh winter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the summer, when the governor of Jamestown requested that Powhatan return the runaways, he offered vague comments that the English considered rude, but showed no intention to bring them back. In response, the English terrorized a local village, killing about 15 Powhatan, burning the houses down, cutting the corn supply, and kidnapping and murdering the queen and her children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Powhatans had never seen this magnitude of hatred before Jamestown's establishment; as the chief roughly said in a letter to [[Captain John Smith]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;I have seen two generations of my people die...I know the difference between peace and war better than any man in my country... Why will you take by force what you may have quietly by love? Why will you destroy us who supply you with food? What can you get by war? We can hide our provisions and run into the woods; then you will starve for wronging your friends. Why are you jealous of us? We are unarmed, and willing to give you what you ask, if you come in a friendly manner, and not so simple as not to know that is it much better to eat good meat, sleep comfortably, live quietly with my wives and children, laugh and be merry with the English, and trade for their copper and hatchets, than to run away from them, and to lie cold in the wood, feed on acorns, roots and such trash, and be so hunted that I can neither eat nor sleep... Take away your guns and swords, the cause of all our jealousy, or you my all die in the same manner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Christianization and assimiliation===
English Europeans believed that their god was the only god to exist or that people were allowed to believe in. Many of them belived that it was their sacred duty to convert Native Americans as a religious practice to save their souls. The Christian Europeans who made the journey to the Americas believed it to be their duty to Christianize the Native people.&lt;ref&gt;Sale 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, Leslie C. and Plive Patricia Dickason. ''The Law of Nations and the New World.'' pg. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  They felt it was their calling by God. Spaniards practiced Christianization in the New World using [[Pope Alexander VI]]'s papal bull, ''[[Inter caetera]]''. allowed rulers to "bring under their sway [non-Christian] 'countries and islands' discovered by Columbus, along with 'their residents and inhabitants, and to bring them to the Catholic faith.'"

The missionaries developed "praying towns" to create "orderly Christian communities filled with model converts who were living and working under the watchful eye of a priest or pastor".&lt;ref&gt;Ronda, James P. and Axtell, James. Indian Missions. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1978. p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Within these communities converts to the Christian faith would be placed in a separate area from the remainder of the tribe in order to prevent regression back to their Native beliefs. Missionaries such as [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], a puritan, and [[Isaac McCoy]], a Baptist, led the way in the spread of their beliefs within these types of towns and amongst the Natives. These towns led the way to the future separation of the Natives from the remainder of society in [[Indian reservation|Native reservations]].

== 1787-1899:Creating the Constitution ==

==1900-1945==
=== Criticizing colonialism ===
Native peoples have been active in educating nonnatives on the cultures, histories, and experiences of their tribes since the beginning of colonization. Chief [[Plenty Coups]] of the [[Crow Nation|Crow Nation in Montana]] and [[Alfred Kiyana]] of the [[Mesquakie Settlement]] in Iowa spoke to historians, [[anthropologist]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and journalists through translators to criticize the idea of "American progress" and to express pride and faith in the identities of their own cultures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Native North American Almanac|last=Champagne|first=Duane|publisher=Gale Group|year=2001|isbn=0787616559|location=Farmington Hills, MI|pages=597-618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Eastman]], a Mdewakanton and Wahpeton Sioux and physician, published books and articles in [[English language|English]] for American people to show that it is not savage that Native people celebrate what [[Mourning dove|Mourning Dove]] called the "ancient way". In 1902, [[Gertrude Bonnin]] told the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' that the traditions of her tribe, the [[Yankton Dakota]] Sioux, were not only equal to European Americans, but that their values were superior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Involvement with US politics ===
In 1903, [[Charles Eastman]], a [[Santee Dakota|Santee Dakotan]] and Native representative, was requested by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to help Sioux people choose [[English name|English names]] in order to protect their lands from being taken. Lands registered with the birth and natural names of Natives were often lost due to confusion the United States government employees had with filling paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3898.html|title=Ohiyesa, or Charles A. Eastman|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States government]] has a strong history making deals with Native Americans and not keeping them.Thomas Bishop, a [[Snohomish people|Snohomish]] man, recorded his elders' memories of U.S. promises and compared them to the actual texts in [[Native American treaties|treaties]]. He published a piece based on these discrepancies in 1915 titled "An Appeal to the Government to Fulfill Sacred Promises Made 61 Years Ago." Following this, he and other citizens of [[Pacific Northwest tribes]] organized all the [[Tulalip]] agency [[Indian reservation|reservations]] and several off-reservation communities into the [[Northwestern Federation of American Indians]] with the goal of redeeming promises made in treaties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Post World War II: 1946-1959 ==
Many [[Native Americans and World War II|Native Americans]] aided the United States in [[World War II]]. Veterans came back from serving, only to find that the US government and American people would not recognize their contributions to the war effort. This encouraged Natives to begin moving towards activism that was more focused on [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]] and [[self-determination]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Advocacy groups, such as the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI), which was founded in 1944, began representing tribal interests to the public and to [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The NCAI's founding members came from a wide variety of professionals including veterans, anthropologists, lawyers, elected state and federal officials, and a professional baseball player, George Eastman, and half of them had previously served on [[Indian Rights Association]]-chartered tribal councils. At least four of them were also members of the [[Society of American Indians]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Civil Rights Movement: 1960-1968 ==
In 1961, the [[National Indian Youth Council]] formed in pursuit of  "a greater Indian America". The organization members were young and had grown out of a summer program that brought students from all around the US to [[Boulder, Colorado]] and introduced to the [[Southwest Regional Indian Youth Council]] so that they could learn about the Native state of affairs. The organizations' members, people such as [[Clyde Warrior]], [[Melvin Thom]], [[Vine Deloria Jr.]], and [[Hank Adams]], rejected beliefs that Natives were unable to help themselves or that they needed to adopt American society as their own. They were seen as an upset to norms in the Native community, as they were much younger than other recognized leaders of Native civil rights movements. They emphasized [[Direct action|direct protest action]] and pursued [[federal recognition]] of several then-[[Unrecognized tribe|unrecognized Native nations]]. They also organized the first conference where unrecognized Native community members, tribal chiefs, and US chairpersons shared a public stage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Indian Civil Rights Act (1968)===
With the passage of the [[Indian Civil Rights Act]] (ICRA) in 1968, also called the Indian Bill of Rights, Native Americans were guaranteed many civil rights they had been fighting for.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 IDAHO LAW REVIEW 465 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRA supports the following:&lt;ref&gt;(Sokolow)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to [[free speech]], [[Freedom of press|press]], and [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]]
* Protection from unreasonable search and seizure
* Right of criminal defendant to a speedy trial, to be advised of the charges, and to confront any adverse witnesses
* Right to hire an attorney in a criminal case
* Protection against self incrimination
* Protection against [[cruel and unusual punishment]], excessive bail, incarceration of more than one year and/or a fine in excess of $5,000 for any one offense
* Protection from [[double jeopardy]] or ''[[ex post facto]]'' laws
* Right to a [[jury trial]] for offenses punishable by imprisonment
* Equal protection under the law and [[due process]]

Other civil rights such as [[sovereignty]], hunting and fishing, and voting are still issues facing Native people today.

== Contemporary movements (1969-present) ==
There has been increased dialogue around the controversy of using Native American symbols such as for school or team mascots. Concerns are that the use of the symbols distort Native American history and culture and often stereotype in offensive ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_indian_quarterly/v032/32.2hemmer.html|title=The American Indian Quarterly|last=Hofmann|first=Sudie|pages=156–177|volume=29, Number 1&amp;2, Winter/Spring 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of unequal schooling, the [[National Indian Education Association]] (NIEA) was formed to fight for equal education for Native Americans in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;http://seamonkey.ed.asu.edu/~mcisaac/emc598geold97/Spring97/5/eshel5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

Native American advocates went to the [[United Nations]] to seek laws that protected the rights of Native people to own their own media, and for the prosecution of those who persecuted their journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proquest.com|title=ProQuest - Databases, EBooks and Technology for Research|work=proquest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious rights ==

===Religion after Euro-American contact===
Over the last five centuries, "Christianity has made enormous inroads into Native society."&lt;ref name="JUtter2"&gt;Utter, Jack. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious Native Americans today voluntarily practice Christianity, both Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, or a combination of Christianity and Native religion.&lt;ref name="JUtter2"/&gt; There was both voluntary and forced conversion; however, not all tribes embraced Christianity, nor did all members of tribes.

"Euro-American contact and interactions contributed much to Indian marginality and the disruption and destruction of traditional customs and even the aboriginal use of psychoactive substances. This process was noted in the 1976 Final Report to the American Indian Policy Review Commission, Task Force Eleven: Alcohol and Drug Abuse.&lt;ref&gt;French, Laurence Armand. ''Addictions &amp; Native Americans.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000. p 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] was passed in 1978. It allowed freedom of religion except for some restrictions on use of ceremonial items as the eagle feathers or bones (a protected species) or [[peyote]] (considered a restricted drug by the federal government);&lt;ref&gt;Enumeration of areas of conflict from Francis Paul Prucha. ''The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians, Volume 2''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1984, p. 1127&lt;/ref&gt; however, other laws provide for ceremonial use of these by Native American religious practitioners.

One example of Christianity's influence on Native American religion is the prominence of the figure of Jesus Christ in peyote ceremonies of the [[Native American Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Woodhead, Linda. ''Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations.'' New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion.

Many indigenous religions arose in response to colonization. These include the [[Longhouse Religion]], which arose at the end of the 18th century, and the [[Ghost Dance]], [[Four Mothers Society]], [[Indian Shaker Church]], [[Kuksu religion]], and others in the 19th century.

===Suppression during the Progressive Era===
During the [[Progressive Era]] from the 1890s to the 1920s, a "quasi-theocracy" reigned in what federal policymakers called "Indian Country"; they worked hand-in-hand with churches to impose Christianity upon Native Americans "as part of the government's civilizing project".&lt;ref name="BDuthu"&gt;Duthu, N. Bruce. ''American Indians and the Law''. New York: Viking, 2008. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping in the vein of the colonialists before them, Progressive-Era policymakers found no need to separate religious endeavors concerning Native Americans from Native political policy.&lt;ref name=FHoxie&gt;Hoxie, Frederick E., ed. Talking Back to Civilization: Indian Voices from the Progressive Era. Boston: Bedford. 2001. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The government provided various religious groups with funds to accomplish Native American conversion. It was during this time that the government "discouraged or imposed bans on many forms of traditional religious practices, including the [[Sun Dance]], use of [[peyote]] in ceremonial settings and observance of [[potlatch]] rituals."&lt;ref name="BDuthu"/&gt; The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA), or the "Indian Office", as it was then called, played a role in the Christianization of Native Americans. Their boarding schools, often staffed by missionaries, removed Native children from the tribe and away from the influence of their cultures.&lt;ref name="BDuthu"/&gt;

In order to pacify Christians, "some tribal religious practitioners modified elements of their traditional practices".&lt;ref name="BDuthu2"&gt;Duthu, N. Bruce. ibid. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Sun Dance, "a ceremony of renewal and spiritual reaffirmation", some tribes "omit[ted] the element of self-sacrifice (many participants observed the ritual of skin piercing), reduced the number of days for the ceremony from eight to two and otherwise emphasized the ceremony's social, rather than religious, features".&lt;ref name="BDuthu2"/&gt; In the past, tribes have also moved religious days to coincide with national U.S.&amp;nbsp;holidays.

Until 1935, Native American people could be fined and sent to prison for practicing certain traditional religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/wicazo_sa_review/v021/21.2talbot.html|title=Wicazo Sa Review|last=Talbot|first=Steve|pages=7–39|volume=21, Number 2, Fall 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Native American religious issues===
Established in 1918, the Native American Church "emphasiz[ed] the importance of monogamy, sobriety, and hard work".&lt;ref&gt;Hoxie, Frederick E. ibid. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it serves as an intertribal, multilingual network. The Native American Church has had a long struggle with the government of America due to their ancient and deeply spiritual religious practice using [[peyote]]. Peyote is a psychoactive substance that is found on a cactus and it is used for healing practices and in religious ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Young, William A. Quest for Harmony. Seven Bridges P, LLC, 2001. p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this subject is highly debated due to the outbreaks of drug use especially the psychoactive ones among Americans today. Leaders of the Native American Church argue that the use of peyote allows for a direct connection with gods and that peyote is not taken simply for its psychoactive effects. It is taken in the manner that one might take the sacraments of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Catherine M. ''Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions.'' Oxford University Press: New York, 1997. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; "Peyote is not habit forming and 'in the controlled ambiance of a peyote meeting it is in no way harmful'" Rather it is considered a unifying influence on the Native American life because it provides the "basis for Indian friendships, rituals, social gatherings, travel, marriage, and more. It has been a source of healing and means of expression for a troubled people. And it has resulted in one of the strongest pan-Indian movements among American Indians".&lt;ref&gt;Young, William A. Quest for Harmony. Seven Bridges P, LLC, 2001. p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

For years the government has been debating the subject of peyote use.  In 1949 peyote use was condemned by the [[American Medical Association]] because findings in their study led them to believe that it was habit-forming drug. Congress then attempted to regulate the use of peyote in 1963 with little success, but under the [[Drug Abuse Control Act]] in 1965 it was on the list of forbidden psychedelic drugs. Under this act it did not place this on Native American peyotists who were using it for religious practice, though some suffered still under the hands of the state governments for having it in their possession. State laws differed from the United States government standards with states outlawing the use of peyote.&lt;ref&gt;Young, William A. Quest for Harmony. Seven Bridges P, LLC, 2001. p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; "By 1970, of the seventeen states that still had anti-peyote laws, only five did not provide exemptions for Indians to use peyote ritually." These were amended under the pressure from the [[Native American Church]] member if the members showed proof that they were at least 25&amp;nbsp;percent Native American. The states laws were generally similar to those of [[South Dakota]], which says that "when used as a sacrament in services of the Native American Church in a natural state which is unaltered except for drying or curing or slicing", peyote use is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;La Barre, Weston. The Peyote Cult. Archon Books, 1973. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] there was mention of protection for peyote users, but this did not change the fact that they could still be charged. Because it is an "established religion of many centuries' history...not a 20th&amp;nbsp;century [[cult]] nor a fad subject to extinction at a whim",&lt;ref&gt;Botsford and EchoHawk 1996, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; it continues to be somewhat protected under the law.

All [[Native American tribes]] are under the U.S. government just as other minority groups. However, unlike other minority groups who are immigrants to the United States, Native Americans are indigenous to American land and have therefore sought and gained [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="Wildenthal, Bryan H 2003"&gt;Wildenthal, Bryan H. Native American sovereignty on trial: a handbook with cases, laws, and documents. Santa Barbara, California. ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Native sovereignty is made complex by the fact that the British (in colonial times) and American government also co-exist in the same country.&lt;ref name="airpi2005"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.airpi.org/index.html |title=American Indian Policy Center |access-date=2008-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225175315/http://www.airpi.org/index.html |archive-date=2008-12-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Native American "government" is not government in the western sense of authority and control, but is more like leadership over a community.&lt;ref name="airpi2005"/&gt;  It is difficult to describe Native American government in a definite manner due to the fact that there are many different Native tribes with different forms of governing. As of January 2016, there are 566 [[Federally recognized tribes|federally recognized]]&amp;nbsp;Native American tribes.&lt;ref name="Wildenthal, Bryan H 2003" /&gt; During the colonial period, Native American sovereignty was upheld by the negotiation of treaties between British proprietor and Native American tribes. Treaties are agreements between two sovereign governments, and, therefore, the treaties made were made under the understanding that the tribes had equal sovereignty to the sovereignty of the colonial governments. The signing of treaties ended with the [[Indian Appropriations Act#1871|Indian Appropriations Act of 1871]], which preserved the same rights and privileges, but changed recognition to "domestinanic dependent nations" rather than independent nations.

==Fishing and hunting rights==
Although Native Americans lost the battle for their lands, the US government eventually conceded hunting and fishing rights both within the reservations and on old tribal land that had been sold to and settled. The reserved rights doctrine allowed for tribes to hunt and fish, along with any other rights, as long as they were not specifically denied in a treaty. This angered hunters and fishers who had restrictions placed on them by the government and they protested against the Natives' right to fish and hunt off of reservations. 

As the United States government pushed to colonize as much of North America as they could, they began making treaties with tribes, so that they may have reservations of land. One particular treaty with the [[Yakama]] in the Northwest guarantees that the tribe has the rights to "taking fish at all usual and accustomed places in common with the citizens of the Territory".&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association|volume=443|page=658|pin=|year=1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1890s, Lineas and Audubon Winans operated a state-licensed fishing mill in [[Celilo Falls|Celio Falls]], an important place for fishing to not only the Yakama, but also the [[Umatilla people|Umatilla]] and the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]]. The Winans decided to develop a [[fish wheel]] to catch [[salmon]] by the tons, which would deplete the river of fish for the Natives very quickly. In addition, the Winans purchased land that made it impossible for Native people to approach the river at all. The Yakama took this case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v. Winans]]'' (1905) and won the rights to fish and to have treaties interpreted by the US government as the members of tribes would have interpreted them at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Duthu, N. Bruce (2008). ''American Indians and the Law: The Penguin Library of American Indian History'' p.101. Penguin Group (USA). {{ISBN|0-670-01857-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State agencies pointed out that conservation efforts were possibly compromised by the Native Americans' habits; however the Supreme Court upheld the privilege with certain cases, such as ''[[Antoine v. Washington]]'' (1975), even going so far as to appropriate for Native Americans the right to hunt and fish on all of their old grounds whether or not they were currently privately owned, and to prevent private owners from erecting obstacles to exercising this right. The largest amount of opposition and resentment towards Native Americans' fishing and hunting rights stems from the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Law Encyclopedia. West's Encyclopedia of American Law. Copyright © 1998 by The Gale Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1988, the United States government passed a federal [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]], which provides the legislative basis for protecting Native lands for their community health and economic growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Traveling rights==
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government attempted to control the travel of Native Americans off Native reservations.  Since Native Americans did not obtain U.S. citizenship until 1924, they were considered wards of the state and were denied various basic rights, including the right to travel.&lt;ref&gt;''Heartbeat of the People:  Music and Dance of the Northern Pow-Wow'', Browner&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) discouraged off-reservation activities, including the right to hunt, fish, or visit other tribes. As a result, the BIA instituted a "pass system" designed to control movement of the Natives.  This system required Natives living on reservations to obtain a pass from a Native agent before they could leave the reservation.&lt;ref&gt;In a Barren Land:  American Indian Dispossession and Survival, Marks&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, agents were often ordered to limit the number of passes they issued for off-reservation travel. The reasons cited for this limitation were that Natives with passes often overstayed the time limits imposed, and many times Natives left without requesting passes.  When this occurred, the military was frequently called to force the Natives to return their reservations. For example, in April 1863, Superintendent J.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Perit Huntington forced 500&amp;nbsp;Native Americans to return from the [[Willamette Valley]] who had violated the pass system, and estimated that up to 300&amp;nbsp;Natives were still in the area without US authorization.&lt;ref&gt;''Indians of the Pacific Northwest'', Elizabeth von Aderkas&lt;/ref&gt;

While attempting to implement this pass system, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) received numerous complaints regarding Natives who traveled without permission. Many complained that Native Americans were killing game merely for the sport and were taking the hides. Other settlers complained that Natives overstayed their visits at neighboring reservations while neglecting their farming duties at home. For example, in December, 1893, Governor [[John E. Osborne]] of [[Wyoming]] wrote a letter to the BIA protesting that Natives from [[Fort Hall Indian Reservation|Fort Hall]], [[Lemhi Shoshone|Lemhi]], [[Wind River Indian Reservation|Wind River]], and [[Crow Indian Reservation|Crow Reservations]] were leaving illegally. In response, the commissioner sent a note to all Native agents stating that Natives who disobeyed the pass system would be arrested and punished by state officials.&lt;ref&gt;''The Northern Shoshoni'', Madsen, 134&lt;/ref&gt; Additional rules were also implemented at this time.  For example, the Native agents were now required to notify other reservations of the departure time of Natives, names of Natives, and the route they intended to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard University, U.S. Office of Indian Affairs, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these concerns, many settlers were unhappy with the travel of Native Americans on the railroads. For example, the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] in [[Nevada]] had granted Natives the privilege of riding on the roof and flatbeds of rail cars without tickets, in exchange for the right-of-way through their reservations.&lt;ref&gt;As Long as the River Shall Run, Knack, 103,&lt;/ref&gt; Other railroad lines, including the Carson and the Colorado allowed free railroad travel to the Natives. [[Paiute]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2018}} Natives, for example, frequently rode the trains to their traditional hunting and fishing grounds. "Paiutes would pack up their gathering baskets and hop on the rails, take off a day or two to gather seeds, and bring their harvest back home again, on the car roofs. Men and women used free passes to travel into town or to ranches farther in the hinterlands for jobs."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''As Long as the River Shall Run'', Knack, 103&lt;/ref&gt; Angry Native agents, who wanted the Paiutes to stay under their jurisdiction, wrote letters urging the BIA to stop this free travel. According to one Native agent, "The injurious effects of this freedom from restraint, and continual change of place, on the Indian, can not be overestimated."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

The loss of the right to free movement across the country was difficult for Native Americans, especially since many tribes traditionally traveled to hunt, fish, and visit other tribes.  The passage of the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] in 1924 granted citizenship to all Natives born in America.  As a result, Native Americans were finally granted free travel in the United States. At the present time, Native Americans who live on reservations are free to travel as they wish.

== Voting ==
In the 18th century, starting when the Constitution was created, There was a struggle to define what the Native tribes relationship was with the United States. Article;1, Section;2 of the Constitution states that Natives are not under any control of the United States, and therefore cannot be taxed. (Daniel, Susan M. Olson, and Jennifer L. Robinson. Native Vote).&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2007. pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution also stated that Congress has the power to "regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among several states, and with Indian tribes" as stated in Article;I, Section;8. 

The [[Marshall Trilogy]] in 1831 helped define sovereignty by stating that the Cherokee nation was a distinct political society but a domestic dependent nation and one that "resembles that of a ward to a guardian".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'' (1831)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Native Americans' relationship to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government was similar to that of people in an occupied land under the control of a foreign power.&lt;ref name="McCool 2"&gt;McCool 2&lt;/ref&gt; This definition meant that Native people did not have a right to vote. Further clarification was made when in 1856 Attorney General [[Caleb Cushing]] stated, "Indians are the subjects of the United States, and therefore are not, in mere right of home-birth, citizens of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Official Opinions of the Attorneys General 1856, 749–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCool 2" /&gt;

In 1817 the Cherokee became the first Native Americans recognized as U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizens. Under Article&amp;nbsp;8 of the 1817 Cherokee treaty, "Upwards of 300&amp;nbsp;Cherokees (Heads of Families) in the honest simplicity of their souls, made and election to become American citizens."&lt;ref name="McLoughlin"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth&amp;nbsp;Amendment]] and the first civil rights act were passed in 1866 regarding the role of African-Americans in the United States, citizenship of Natives was defined as well. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 states, "That all persons born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States".&lt;ref name="McCool 3"&gt;McCool 3&lt;/ref&gt; The country at this time was not necessarily ready for Natives to become citizens. Senator [[Jacob Howard]] of Michigan commented, "I am not yet prepared to pass a sweeping act of naturalization by which all the Indian savages, wild or tame, belonging to a tribal relation, are to become my fellow-citizens and go to the polls and vote with me…".&lt;ref name="CG 1866, 2895"&gt;Congressional Globe 1866, 2895&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCool 3" /&gt; This sentiment is also shown through a Senate floor debate regarding the Fourteenth Amendment where [[James Rood Doolittle]] of Wisconsin stated, "…all those wild Natives to be citizens of the United States, the Great Republic of the world, whose citizenship should be a title as proud as that of king, and whose danger is that you may degrade that citizenship."&lt;ref name="CG 1866, 2892"&gt;Congressional Globe 1866, 2892&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCool 3" /&gt; One of his other concerns was that because of the substantial number of Natives at the time, their numbers would be able to overwhelm the power of the white vote.&lt;ref name="McCool 3" /&gt; As Doolittle argued, "there is a large mass of the Indian population who are clearly subject to the jurisdiction of the United States who ought not to be included as citizens of the United States…the word "citizen," if applied to them, would bring in all the Digger Indians of California".&lt;ref name="CG 1866, 2892" /&gt;

While not all Natives were granted citizenship at that time under a blanket law, there were some special considerations made to grant individual Natives citizenship. This in turn gave them the right of suffrage. For example, a treaty involving the United States and the [[Lakota people]] demonstrates this. In 1868 Article&amp;nbsp;6 of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] stated that Natives could gain citizenship by "receiving a patent for land under the foregoing provisions… and be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of such citizens, and shall, at the same time retain all [their] rights to benefits accruing to Indians under this treaty".&lt;ref name="McCool 5"&gt;McCool 5&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this was that the Natives could become citizens yet still maintain their status and rights as Natives.&lt;ref name="McCool 5" /&gt;

Even for signatory Native Nations to the Fort Laramie Treaty, however, it was made clear though that just because a few Natives were citizens, it did not mean that they all in turn had the right to vote. In 1884, when John Elk, a Native who lived in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], attempted to register in local elections, he was refused a ballot. When he took the case to Supreme Court and through the ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'' trial, he was ruled against under the circumstances that Natives did not fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref name="McCool 6"&gt;McCool 6&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Dawes Act]] in 1887 continued to pave the pathway for Native citizenship in that members of certain Native American tribes who accepted an allotment of land was considered a citizen.&lt;ref name="McCool 6" /&gt; The goal was for Natives to, through assimilation, "adopt the habits of civilized life".&lt;ref&gt;Keyssar, Alexander. The Right to Vote. New York: Basic Books, 2000. pg. 165&lt;/ref&gt; This movement certainly convinced a lot of Natives to gain citizenship. This is seen through President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s statement on the allotment policy in which he reported that by 1901, 60,000&amp;nbsp;Natives had already become citizens of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt 1901, 6672&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCool 6" /&gt;

Piece by piece, more acts were created that added Natives to the citizenship rolls.&lt;ref name="McCool 6"/&gt; When the Native Territory (what is now Oklahoma) was abolished in 1907, all Natives who lived in that territory were made citizens through the [[Oklahoma Enabling Act]].&lt;ref name="McCool 6" /&gt;

Furthermore, after [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], any Native who had fought with [[honorable discharge]] was also considered a citizen through the Act of November 6, 1919.&lt;ref name="McCool 7"&gt;McCool 7&lt;/ref&gt; As Native Vote states, "The underlying assumption of this act was that these particular Indians had demonstrated that they had become part of the larger Anglo culture and were no longer wholly Indian".&lt;ref name="McCool 7" /&gt;

By the early 1920s, Congress was considering a bill to make the remainder of Native Americans citizens in their aim to have them "adopt Anglo culture".&lt;ref name="McCool 7"/&gt; This finally was stated with the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] which was created on June 2, 1924. This act showed progress in that Natives would not have to give up being a Native to be a citizen of the United States. This included being an enrolled member of a tribe, living on a federally recognized reservation, or practicing his or her culture.&lt;ref name="McCool 7" /&gt; However, this did not create the right to vote automatically.

There remained instances in many states that still prevented Natives from voting, even though they were citizens of the United States. For example, the attorney general of [[Colorado]] in 1936 declared that Natives could not vote because they were not citizens of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen 1942, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCool 9&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, states found ways around voting in other ways. Because the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] 1870 barred states from limiting voting on account of race, states found other ways – residency: claiming that Native Americans were not residents of the state if they resided on reservations, self-termination: one must first abandon their tribal ties in order to vote, taxation: Natives who do not need to pay taxes cannot vote, guardianship: the claim that Native Americans were incompetent and "wards of the state", and on the lack of ability to read English.&lt;ref name="McCool 19"&gt;McCool 19&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and the need for more soldiers through the draft, Congress reaffirmed Native people's citizenship with the Nationality Act of 1940.&lt;ref name="ITCA 2"&gt;ITCA 2&lt;/ref&gt; However, when some 25,000 veterans returned home after the war, they realized that even though they had put their lives on the line for their country, they were still not allowed to vote.&lt;ref name="ITCA 2" /&gt;

In 1965 the [[Voting Rights Act]] (VRA) put an end to individual states' claims on whether or not Natives were allowed to vote through a federal law. Section&amp;nbsp;2 of the VRA states that, "No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure, shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color".&lt;ref&gt;McCool 22&lt;/ref&gt; Further sections describe the measures taken if violations to this act are discovered.

However, efforts by states and municipalities to disenfranchise Native Americans are ongoing, such that there have been about 74&amp;nbsp;cases brought by or on behalf of Natives under the VRA or the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] or Fifteenth Amendment since 1965.&lt;ref&gt;McCool 45&lt;/ref&gt; These in the most part have proved to be successful to upholding the rights of Native Americans as citizens of the United States. Most of these cases are centered on states that have large reservations, or Native populations, such as New Mexico, Arizona and Oklahoma.

== Land rights ==
{{main|Aboriginal title in the United States}}
One of the major issues surrounding land ownership rights of the Native American Nations is for what they are and are not allowed to use their land.

A typical example of the struggle faced involved the [[Seneca Nation]] of [[New York State]]. On April 18, 2007, the Seneca Nation laid claim to a stretch of [[Interstate&amp;nbsp;90]] that crosses the [[Cattaraugus Reservation]] by revoking the 1954 agreement that granted the [[Interstate Highway System]] and [[New York State Thruway Authority]] permission to build the highway through the territory. The move was a direct shot at New York Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]]'s attempts to collect taxes on Seneca territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalonews.com/101/story/57227.html Buffalo News story]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Senecas had previously made the same claim in a lawsuit which they lost because of the state's assertion of sovereign immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.upstate-citizens.org/Seneca-v-NYS-tway.pdf |title=United States Court of Appeals - Seneca Nation v. State of New York |access-date=2008-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808172704/http://www.upstate-citizens.org/Seneca-v-NYS-tway.pdf |archive-date=2007-08-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Magistrate Heckman's Report and Recommendation it was noted that the State of New York asserted its immunity from suit against both counts of the complaint (one count was the challenge regarding the state's acquisition of [[Grand Island, New York|Grand Island]] and other smaller islands in the [[Niagara River]] and another count challenging the thruway easement).  The United States was permitted to intervene on behalf of the Seneca Nation and the [[Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians]]. The United States was then directed to file an amended complaint that "clearly states the relief sought by the United States in this action". In this amended complaint the United States did not seek any relief on behalf of the Seneca Nation relative to the thruway easement. By not seeking such relief in its amended complaint the United States of America permitted the action relative to the thruway easement to be subject to dismissal based on New York's immunity from suit under the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] to the United States Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upstate-citizens.org/Tway-RR-and-Dist-Ct-decisions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 4, the Seneca Nation threatened to do the same with [[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate&amp;nbsp;86]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salamancapress.com/site/tab1.cfm?newsid=18301123&amp;BRD=2725&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=562848&amp;rfi=6 Salamanca Press article]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[organic chemistry]], '''negative hyperconjugation''' is the donation of [[electron density]] from a filled π- or p-orbital to a neighboring [[antibonding orbital|σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-orbital]].&lt;ref name="iupac1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.iupac.org/goldbook/NT07081.pdf |title=Negative Hyper-Conjugation |publisher=Old.iupac.org |accessdate=2013-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324085532/http://old.iupac.org/goldbook/NT07081.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon, a type of [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]], can stabilize the molecule or [[transition state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/54173058/46/Negative-Hyperconjugation |title=2.2.3 Negative Hyperconjugation for Ebooksclub.org Molecular Orbitals and Organic Chemical Reactions Student Edition |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2011-04-29 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also causes an elongation of the [[sigma bond|σ-bond]] by adding electron density to its [[antibonding orbital]].&lt;ref name="iupac1"/&gt;

Negative hyperconjugation is most commonly observed when the σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-orbital is located on certain C–F or C–O bonds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2008/NJ/b718430a |title=Negative hyperconjugation of some fluorine containing groups – New Journal of Chemistry (RSC Publishing) |publisher=Pubs.rsc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo7017476 |title=Role of Negative Hyperconjugation and Anomeric Effects in the Stabilization of the Intermediate in SNV Reactions - The Journal of Organic Chemistry (ACS Publications) |publisher=Pubs.acs.org |date=2007-08-09 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not occur to an appreciable extent with normal C–H bonds.

In negative hyperconjugation, the electron density flows in the ''opposite'' direction (from π- or p-orbital to empty σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-orbital) than it does in the more common [[hyperconjugation]] (from σ-orbital to empty p-orbital).

===Shaivism===
''Nirvikalpaka yoga'' is a technical term in the philosophical system of [[Shaivism]], in which there is a complete identification of the "I" and [[Shiva]], in which the very concepts of name and form disappear and Shiva alone is experienced as the [[real Self]].  In that system, this experience occurs when there is complete cessation of all thought-constructs.{{sfn|Singh|1979|p=xxxiii}}

==Buddhism==
{{See also|Pre-sectarian Buddhism|Dhyāna in Buddhism|Four Noble Truths}}

While Patanjali was influenced by Buddhism, and incorporated Buddhist thought and terminology,{{sfn|Werner|1994|p=26}}{{sfn|White|2014|p=10, 19}}&lt;ref&gt;Robert Thurman, ''The Central Philosophy of Tibet.'' Princeton University Press, 1984, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; the term "nirvikalpa samadhi" is unusual in a Buddhist context, though some authors have equated ''nirvikalpa samadhi'' with the [[Dhyāna in Buddhism#The Arupa Jhānas|formless jhanas]] and/or ''nirodha samapatti''.&lt;ref&gt;Partial transcript from the workshop entitled “Self-Discovery through Buddhist Meditation”, presented by John Myrdhin Reynolds at Phoenix, Arizona, on October 20, 2001, http://www.vajranatha.com/articles/what-is-meditation.html?showall=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Jay Rothberg, Sean M. Kelly (1998), ''Ken Wilber in Dialogue: Conversations with Leading Transpersonal Thinkers''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Candradhara Śarmā (1996), The Advaita Tradition in Indian Philosophy: A Study of Advaita in Buddhism, Vedānta and Kāshmīra Shaivism, Motilal Banarsidass, p.139: "In the Buddhist works, both in Pale and in Sanskrit, the words used for nirvikalpa-samadhi are samnja-vedayita-nirodha and nirodha-samapatti."&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to Jianxin Li, it is ''asamprajnata samadhi'', c.q. ''[[savikalpa samadhi]]'' and ''sabija samadhi'', Patanjali's first stage of meditation with a (subtle) object, that may be compared to the ''arupa jhanas'' of Buddhism, and to ''Nirodha-Samapatti''.{{sfn|Jianxin Li|year unknown}} Crangle also notes that ''sabija-asamprajnata samadhi'' resembles the four formless ''jhanas''.{{sfn|Crangle|1984|p=191}} According to Crangle, the fourth ''arupa jhana'' is the stage of transition to Patanjali's "consciousness without seed," c.q. ''nirvikalpa samadhi''.{{sfn|Crangle|1984|p=194}} Crangle further notes that the first ''jhana'' also resembles ''sabija-asamprajnata samadhi''.{{sfn|Crangle|1984|p=191}} According to Gombrich and Wynne the first and second ''jhana'' represent concentration, whereas the third and fourth ''jhana'' combine concentration with mindfulness.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106; 140, note 58}}

In the Buddhist canonical texts, the word "jhāna" is never explicitly used to denote the four formless jhānas; they are instead referred to as ''[[āyatana]]''. However, they are sometimes mentioned in sequence after the first four jhānas (other texts. e.g. MN 121 treat them as a distinct set of attainments) and thus came to be treated by later exegetes as jhānas. The immaterial attainments have more to do with expanding, while the Jhanas (1–4) focus on concentration.

The relation between ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'' and [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|insight]] is a core problem in the study of early Buddhism.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} According to tradition, the Buddha had mastered several forms of formless meditation states, without attaining [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|liberation]], or the cessation of suffering and rebirth. This was attained when he recalled his past lives, gained insight into the cycle of rebirth, and gained direct insight into the [[four noble truths]].&lt;ref&gt;Sutta 36 of the Majjhima Nikkaya - Mahā Saccaka Sutta, Translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN36.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutta 2 of the Digha Nikkaya - Samaññaphala Sutta, Translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to Schmithausen, the [[four noble truths]] as "liberating insight" may be a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36,{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}} and liberating insight and samadhi are alternately accnetuated as the highest means to salvation throughout the Buddhist traditions.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}{{refn|group=note|Bronkhorst and Vetter note that the earliest teachings may have emphasized a path culminating into samadhi, and that the postulation of insight into the four truths as the liberating factor contains practical inconsistencies.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=77–78, Section 8.4.3}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5}} The four truths emphasize that liberation is attained by practicing the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]; yet, in Majjhima Nikaya 36 liberation is attained by gaining insight into the four truths, including the need to practice the eightfold path; yet, this eigthfold path does not state that insight alone suffices. Vetter: "[T]hey do not teach that one is released by knowing the four noble truths, but by practising the fourth noble truth, the eightfold path, which culminates in right samadhi."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5}}}}

The technical [[Yogacara]] term ''{{IAST|nirvikalpa-jñāna}}'' is translated by [[Edward Conze]] as "undifferentiated cognition".{{sfn|Conze|1962|p=253}} Conze notes that, in Yogacara, only the actual experience of ''{{IAST|nirvikalpa-jñāna}}'' can prove the reports given of it in scriptures. He describes the term as used in the Yogacara context as follows:
{{quote|The "undiscriminate cognition" knows first the unreality of all objects, then realizes that without them also the knowledge itself falls to the ground, and finally directly intuits the supreme reality. Great efforts are made to maintain the paradoxical nature of this [[gnosis]]. Though without concepts, judgements and discrimination, it is nevertheless not just mere thoughtlessness. It is neither a cognition nor a non-cognition; its basis is neither thought nor non-thought.... There is here no duality of subject and object. The cognition is not different from that which is cognized, but completely identical with it.{{sfn|Conze|1962|p=253, footnote ‡}}{{refn|group=note|Routledge 2013 edition: note 854}}}}

A different sense in Buddhist usage occurs in the Sanskrit expression ''{{IAST|nirvikalpayati}}'' ([[Pali]]: ''{{IAST|nibbikappa}}'') that means "makes free from uncertainty (or false discrimination)" &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''distinguishes, considers carefully''.{{refn|group=note|For Buddhist usage as "makes free from uncertainty (or false discrimination) &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''distinguishes, considers carefully'', and note that the term means "free from vikalpa", and Pali equivalent ''{{IAST|nibbikappa}}'', see Edgerton 1953, p.304.{{sfn|Edgerton|1953|p=304, volume 2}}}}

[[File:BerlinWallMonumentWestView.jpg|thumb|right|Berlin Wall Monument (west view). The west side of the wall is covered with graffiti that reflects hope and optimism.]]

'''Optimism''' is a mental [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] reflecting a belief or hope that the outcome of some specific endeavor, or outcomes in general, will be positive, favorable, and desirable. A common [[idiom]] used to illustrate optimism versus pessimism is [[Is the glass half empty or half full?|a glass filled with water to the halfway point]]: an optimist is said to see the glass as half full, while a pessimist sees the glass as half empty.

The term derives from the Latin ''optimum'', meaning "best". Being optimistic, in the typical sense of the word, is defined as expecting the best possible outcome from any given situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/optimism|title=Definition of optimism|access-date=November 14, 2017|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115083225/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/optimism|archivedate=November 15, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually referred to in [[psychology]] as dispositional optimism.

Theories of optimism include dispositional models, and models of [[explanatory style]]. Methods to measure optimism have been developed within both theoretical systems, such as various forms of the Life Orientation Test, for the original definition of optimism, or the Attributional Style Questionnaire designed to test optimism in terms of explanatory style.

=== Dispositional optimism ===
[[File:Оптимист и пессимист.jpg|thumb|220px|''An optimist and a pessimist'', [[Vladimir Makovsky]], 1893]]
Researchers [[operationalize]] the term differently depending on their research. As with any trait characteristic, there are several ways to evaluate optimism, such as the Life Orientation Test (LOT).

Dispositional optimism and pessimism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=Dispositional optimism and physical well-being: the influence of generalized outcome expectancies on health |last1=Scheier |first1=M. F. |last2=Carver |first2=C.

The LOT returns separate optimism and pessimism scores for each individual. Behaviourally, these two scores correlate around r = 0.5. Optimistic scores on this scale predict better outcomes in relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Social relationships and health |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.3399889 |journal=Science |date=1988-07-29 |pages=540–545 |volume=241 |issue=4865 |doi=10.1126/science.3399889 |first=J. |last=House |first2=K. |last2=Landis |first3=D |last3=Umberson}}&lt;/ref&gt; higher [[social status]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Depression and socio-economic risk factors: 7-year longitudinal population study |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/190/4/293 |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |date=2007-04-01 |issn=0007-1250 |pmid=17401034 |pages=293–298 |volume=190 |issue=4 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.105.020040 |first=Vincent |last=Lorant |first2=Christophe |last2=Croux |first3=Scott |last3=Weich |first4=Denise |last4=Deliège |first5=Johan |last5=Mackenbach |first6=Marc |last6=Ansseau |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151222003929/http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/190/4/293 |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reduced loss of well-being following adversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On the self-regulation of behavior |last1=Carver |first1=C.

Some have argued that pessimism and optimism are ends of a single dimension, with any distinction between them reflecting factors such as [[Social desirability bias|social desirability]].  [[Confirmatory factor analysis|Confirmatory modelling]], however, supports a two-dimensional model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Separating optimism and pessimism: A robust psychometric analysis of the Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R). |url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1040-3590.18.4.433 |journal=Psychological Assessment |pages=433–438 |volume=18 |issue=4 |doi=10.1037/1040-3590.18.4.433 |first=Philipp Yorck |last=Herzberg |first2=Heide |last2=Glaesmer |first3=Jürgen |last3=Hoyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two dimensions predict different outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Distinguishing optimism from pessimism in older adults: Is it more important to be optimistic or not to be pessimistic? |url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.6.1345 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |pages=1345–1353 |volume=73 |issue=6 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.6.1345 |first=Susan |last=Robinson-Whelen |first2=Cheongtag |last2=Kim |first3=Robert C. |last3=MacCallum |first4=Janice K. |last4=Kiecolt-Glaser}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic modelling confirms this independence, showing that pessimism and optimism are inherited as independent traits, with the typical correlation between them emerging as a result of a general well-being factor and family environment influences.&lt;ref name="Bates2015" /&gt;

=== Explanatory style ===

[[Explanatory style]] is distinct from dispositional theories of optimism. While related to life-orientation measures of optimism, attributional style theory suggests that dispositional optimism and [[pessimism]] are reflections of the ways people explain events, i.e., that attributions cause these dispositions {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Measures of attributional style distinguish three dimensions among explanations for events: Whether these explanations draw on internal versus external causes; whether the causes are viewed as stable versus unstable; and whether explanations apply globally versus being situationally specific. In addition, the measures distinguish attributions for positive and for negative events.

An optimistic person attributes internal, stable, and global explanations to good things. Pessimistic explanations attribute these traits of stability, globality, and internality to negative events, such as difficulty in relationships.&lt;ref name="Gillham2001"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillham |first1=Jane E. |last2=Shatté |first2=Andrew J. |last3=Reivich |first3=Karen J. |last4=Seligman |first4=Martin E.

In addition to this, individuals vary in how optimistic their attributions are for good events, and on how pessimistic their attributions are for bad events, but these two traits of optimism and pessimism are un-correlated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The structure of attributional style: Cognitive styles and optimism–pessimism bias in the Attributional Style Questionnaire|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886914001810|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|date = 2014-08-01|pages = 79–85|volume = 66|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2014.03.022|first = Caimei|last = Liu|first2 = Timothy C.|last2 = Bates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is much debate about the relationship between explanatory style and optimism. Some researchers argue that optimism is simply the lay-term for what researchers know as explanatory style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C. |last=Peterson |title=The Future of Optimism |journal=American Psychologist |volume=55 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=44–55 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly, it is found that explanatory style is quite distinct from dispositional optimism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Abramson |first2=B. |last2=Dykman |first3=D. |last3=Needles |title=Attributional Style and Theory: Let No One Tear Them Asunder |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=1991 |pages=11–13 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0201_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. |last=Zullow |title=Explanations and Expectations: Understanding the 'Doing' Side of Optimism |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=1991 |pages=45–49 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0201_13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two should not be used interchangeably as they are marginally correlated at best. More research is required to "bridge" or further differentiate these concepts.&lt;ref name="Gillham2001" /&gt;

=== Origins ===
[[File:Optimistic Personality.png|thumb|Optimistic Personality (modified from &lt;ref name="Bates2015" /&gt;)]]

As with all psychological traits, differences in both dispositional optimism and pessimism &lt;ref name="Bates2015"/&gt;  and in attributional style  &lt;ref name="Schulman 1993 569–574"&gt;{{cite journal |first = P.|last = Schulman|first2 = D.|last2 = Keith|first3 = M.|last3 = Seligman|title = Is Optimism Heritable?

Both optimism and pessimism are strongly influenced by [[environmental factors]], including family environment.&lt;ref name="Bates2015" /&gt; It has been suggested that optimism may be indirectly inherited as a reflection of underlying heritable traits such as [[intelligence]], [[temperament]] and [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name="Schulman 1993 569–574"/&gt; Many theories assume optimism can be [[Learned helplessness|learned]],&lt;ref name="Vaughan 2000" /&gt; and research supports a modest role of family-environment acting to raise (or lower) optimism and lower (or raise) [[neuroticism]] and pessimism.&lt;ref name="Bates2015" /&gt;

Work utilising [[brain imaging]] and [[biochemistry]] suggests that at a [[biological trait]] level, optimism and pessimism reflect brain systems specialised for the tasks of processing and incorporating beliefs regarding [[Optimism bias|good and bad information]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Sharot2011"/&gt;

=== Assessment ===

==== Life Orientation Test ====

The Life Orientation Test (LOT) was designed by Scheier and Carver (1985) to assess dispositional optimism – expecting positive or negative outcomes,&lt;ref name="Gillham2001"/&gt; and is one of the more popular tests of optimism and pessimism. There are eight items and four filler items. Four are positive items (e.g. "''In uncertain times, I usually expect the best''") and four are negative items e.g. "''If something can go wrong for me, it will.''"&lt;ref name="ScheierCarver1985"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Scheier|first1 = Michael F.|last2 = Carver|first2 = Charles S.|title = Optimism, coping, and health: Assessment and implications of generalized outcome expectancies.|journal = Health Psychology|date = 1985|volume = 4|issue = 3|pages = 219–247|doi = 10.1037/0278-6133.4.3.219|pmid = 4029106|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/hea/4/3/219/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LOT has been revised twice—once by the original creators (LOT-R) and also by Chang, Maydeu-Olivares, and D'Zurilla as the Extended Life Orientation Test (ELOT). The Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R: Scheier, Carver, &amp; Bridges, 1994) consists of 6 items, each scored on a 5-point scale from "Strongly disagree" to "Strongly agree".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Distinguishing optimism from neuroticism (and trait anxiety, self-mastery, and self-esteem): A reevaluation of the Life Orientation Test.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1063|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 1063–1078|volume = 67|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1063|first = Michael F.|last = Scheier|first2 = Charles S.|last2 = Carver|first3 = Michael W.|last3 = Bridges|pmid=7815302|date=December 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Attributional Style Questionnaire ====

This Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ: Peterson et al. 1982 &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peterson |first1=Christopher |last2=Semmel |first2=Amy |last3=von Baeyer |first3=Carl |last4=Abramson |first4=Lyn Y. |last5=Metalsky |first5=Gerald I. |last6=Seligman |first6=Martin E.

Subjects read a list of six positive and negative events (e.g. "''you have been looking for a job unsuccessfully for some time''"), and are asked to record a possible cause for the event. They then rate whether this is internal or external, stable or changeable, and global or local to the event.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; There are several modified versions of the ASQ including the Expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire (EASQ), the Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanations (CAVE), and the ASQ designed for testing the optimism of children.&lt;ref name="Gillham2001" /&gt;

=== Associations with health ===

The relationship between optimism and health has also been studied with regards to physical symptoms, coping strategies and negative affect for those suffering from [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[asthma]], and [[fibromyalgia]].

It has been found that among individuals with these diseases, optimists are not more likely than pessimists to report pain alleviation due to coping strategies, despite differences in psychological well-being between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Glenn |last1=Affleck |first2=Howard |last2=Tennen |first3=Andrea |last3=Apter |chapter=Optimism, Pessimism, and Daily Life With Chronic Illness |title=Optimism &amp; Pessimism: Implications for Theory, Research, and Practice |editor-first=E. |editor-last=Chang |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=2001 |pages=147–168 |isbn=9781557986917}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] has confirmed the assumption that optimism is related to psychological well-being: "Put simply, optimists emerge from difficult circumstances with less distress than do pessimists."&lt;ref name="Scheier"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael F. |last=Scheier |first2=Charles S. |last2=Carver |first3=Michael W. |last3=Bridges |chapter=Optimism, Pessimism, and Psychological Well-Being |title=Optimism &amp; Pessimism: Implications for Theory, Research, and Practice |editor-first=E. |editor-last=Chang |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=2001 |pages=189–216 |isbn=1-55798-691-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the correlation appears to be attributable to coping style: "That is, optimists seem intent on facing problems head-on, taking active and constructive steps to solve their problems; pessimists are more likely to abandon their effort to attain their goals."&lt;ref name="Scheier" /&gt;

Optimists may respond better to stress: pessimists have shown higher levels of cortisol (the "stress hormone") and trouble regulating cortisol in response to stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Bergland, Christopher. "Optimism Stabilizes Cortisol Levels and Lowers Stress."Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness + Find a Therapist. N.p., n.d. Web. . http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201307/optimism-stabilizes-cortisol-levels-and-lowers-stress.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by Scheier examined the recovery process for a number of patients that had undergone surgery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The study showed that optimism was a strong predictor of the rate of recovery. Optimists achieved faster results in "behavioral milestones" such as sitting in bed, walking around, etc. They also were rated by staff as having a more favorable physical recovery. In a 6-month later follow-up, it was found that optimists were quicker to resume normal activities.

=== Optimism and well-being ===
A number of studies have been done on optimism and psychological well-being. One study conducted by Aspinwall and Taylor (1990) assessed incoming freshmen on a range of personality factors such as optimism, self-esteem, locus of self-control, etc.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheier |first1=Michael F. |last2=Carver |first2=Charles S. |title=Effects of optimism on psychological and physical well-being: Theoretical overview and empirical update |journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research |date=April 1992 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=201–228 |doi=10.1007/BF01173489}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that freshmen who scored high on optimism before entering college were reported to have lower levels of psychological distress than their more pessimistic peers, while controlling for the other personality factors. Over time, the more optimistic students were less stressed, less lonely, and less depressed than their pessimistic counterparts. Thus, this study suggests a strong link between optimism and psychological well-being.

In addition low optimism may help explain the association between caregivers' anger and reduced sense of vitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=López|first=J.|last2=Romero-Moreno|first2=R.|last3=Márquez-González|first3=M.|last4=Losada|first4=A.|date=2015-04-01|title=Anger and Health in Dementia Caregivers: Exploring the Mediation Effect of Optimism|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.2539/abstract|journal=Stress and Health|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=158–165|doi=10.1002/smi.2539|issn=1532-2998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent meta-analysis of optimism supported past findings that optimism is positively correlated with [[life satisfaction]], happiness, psychological and physical well-being and negatively correlated with depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alarcon |first1=Gene M. |last2=Bowling |first2=Nathan A. |last3=Khazon |first3=Steven |title=Great expectations: A meta-analytic examination of optimism and hope |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=May 2013 |volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=821–827 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to explain the correlation, researchers find that optimists choose healthier lifestyles. For example, optimists smoke less, are more physically active, consume more fruit, vegetables and whole-grain bread, and are more moderate in alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giltay|first1=Erik J.|last2=Geleijnse|first2=Johanna M.|last3=Zitman|first3=Frans G.|last4=Buijsse|first4=Brian|last5=Kromhout|first5=Daan|title=Lifestyle and dietary correlates of dispositional optimism in men: The Zutphen Elderly Study|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=November 2007|volume=63|issue=5|pages=483–490|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.07.014|pmid=17980220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Translating association into modifiability ===

Research to date has demonstrated that optimists are less likely to have certain diseases or develop certain diseases over time. By comparison, research has not yet been able to demonstrate the ability to change an individual's level of optimism through [[psychological intervention]]s, and thereby alter the course of disease or likelihood for development of disease.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Though in that same vein, an article by [[Mayo Clinic]] argues steps to change [[self-talk]] from negative to positive may shift individuals from a negative to a more positive/optimistic outlook.&lt;ref name="MayoTalk"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/stress-management/in-depth/positive-thinking/art-20043950 | title=Positive thinking: Stop negative self-talk to reduce stress | publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] | date=March 4, 2014 | accessdate=September 18, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916091418/http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/stress-management/in-depth/positive-thinking/art-20043950 | archivedate=September 16, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategies claimed to be of value include surrounding oneself with positive people, identifying areas of change, practicing positive self-talk, being open to humor, and following a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref name="MayoTalk"/&gt;

==Philosophical optimism==
&lt;!-- "Philosophical optimism" redirects here --&gt;
Distinct from a disposition to believe that things will work out, there is a philosophical idea that, perhaps in ways that may not be fully comprehended, the present moment is in an optimum state.  This view that all of nature - past, present, and future - operates by laws of optimization along the lines of [[Hamilton's principle]] in the realm of physics is countered by views such as [[idealism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], and philosophical [[pessimism]]. [[Philosophy|Philosopher]]s often link the concept of optimism with the name of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who held that we live in the [[best of all possible worlds]] (''le meilleur des mondes possibles''), or that God created a physical universe that applies the laws of physics. 

Leibniz proposed that it was not in God's power to create a perfect world, but among possible worlds, he created the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Voltaire|last=Cronk|first=Nicholas|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780521849739|location=Cambridge|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his writings, he responded to the [[Blaise Pascal]]'s philosophy of awe and desperation in the face of the infinite by claiming that infinity should be celebrated. While Pascal advocated for making man's rational aspirations more humble, Leibniz was optimistic about the capacity of human reason to further extend itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Studies in Early Modern Philosophy, Volume 8|last=Garber|first=Daniel|last2=Rutherford|first2=Donald|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780198829294|location=9780198829294|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was famously mocked by [[Voltaire]] in his satirical novel ''[[Candide]]'' as baseless optimism of the sort exemplified by the beliefs of one of its characters [[Candide#Main characters|Dr. Pangloss]], which are the opposite of his fellow traveller [[Martin (Candide)|Martin]]'s [[pessimism]] and emphasis on [[free will]]. 
The optimistic position is also called [[:wikt:Panglossianism|Panglossianism]] and became an adjective for excessive, even stupendous, optimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Regret: On Collective Memory and Historical Responsibility|last=Olick|first=Jeffrey|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780415956833|location=New York|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "panglossian pessimism" has been used{{by whom|date=June 2017}}{{year needed|date=June 2017}} to describe the pessimistic position that, since this is the best of all possible worlds, it is impossible for anything to get any better. Conversely,   philosophical pessimism might be{{by whom|date=June 2017}}{{year needed|date=June 2017}} associated with an optimistic long-term view because it implies that no change for the worse is possible. 
&lt;!--[[William Godwin]] for instance argued that society would eventually reach the state where calm reason would replace all violence and force, that mind could eventually make matter subservient to it, and that intelligence could discover the secret of [[immortality]].{{year needed}}{{page needed}} -- does Godwin make any explicit reference to pessimism?--&gt;

===Optimalism===
&lt;!-- Redirect from optimalism to here --&gt;
Philosophical optimalism, as defined by [[Nicholas Rescher]], holds that this universe exists because it is better than the alternatives.&lt;ref name=Rescher2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Optimalism and axiological metaphysics|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2000|volume=53|issue=4|pages=807–35|issn=0034-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this philosophy does not exclude the possibility of a [[deity]], it also doesn't require one, and is compatible with [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinhart|first=Eric|title=Platonic Atheism|url=http://www.ericsteinhart.com/articles/platonicatheism.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710200257/http://www.ericsteinhart.com/articles/platonicatheism.pdf|archivedate=10 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological optimalism, as defined by the [[positive psychology|positive psychologist]] [[Tal Ben-Shahar]], means willingness to accept failure while remaining confident that success will follow, a positive attitude he contrasts with negative [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]].&lt;ref name="Pursuit"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tal Ben-Shahar|title=The Pursuit of Perfect: How to Stop Chasing Perfection and Start Living a Richer, Happier Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szotznWmQEYC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=26 July 2011|date=11 March 2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-160882-4|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfectionism can be defined as a persistent compulsive drive toward unattainable goals and valuation based solely in terms of accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Parker|first=W. D.|last2=Adkins|first2=K.

They cannot accept failures, delaying any ambitious and productive behavior in fear of failure again.&lt;ref name="horne1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Horne|first=Amanda|title=Positive Psychology News Daily|url=http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/amanda-horne/200909035149|accessdate=July 24, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614124828/http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/amanda-horne/200909035149|archivedate=June 14, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[neuroticism]] can even lead to [[clinical depression]] and low productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Staff|title=Perfectionism: Impossible Dream|newspaper=Psychology Today|date=May 1995|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19950501-000002.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130104131133/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19950501-000002.html|archivedate=2013-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to negative perfectionism, Ben-Shahar suggests the adoption of optimalism. Optimalism allows for failure in pursuit of a goal, and expects that while the trend of activity is towards the positive, it is not necessary to always succeed while striving towards goals. This basis in reality prevents the optimalist from being overwhelmed in the face of failure.&lt;ref name="Pursuit" /&gt;

Optimalists accept failures and also learn from them, which encourages further pursuit of achievement.&lt;ref name="horne1"/&gt; Dr. Tal Ben-Shahar believes that Optimalists and Perfectionists show distinct different motives. Optimalists tend to have more intrinsic, inward desires, with a motivation to learn, while perfectionists are highly motivated by a need to consistently prove themselves worthy.&lt;ref name=Pursuit /&gt;

In [[computational complexity theory]], a '''polynomial reduction''' is a [[reduction (complexity)|reduction]] of one problem to another that is performed in [[Time_complexity#Polynomial_time|polynomial time]]. A polynomial reduction takes polynomial time to pre-process inputs and post-process outputs. In such a reduction, the number of calls of the algorithm used to solve the problem being reduced also takes polynomial time.

'''Rankism''' is "abusive, discriminatory, or exploitative behavior towards people because of their [[Social class|rank]] in a particular [[hierarchy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Fuller
  | first = Robert
  | title = Rankism: A Social Disorder
  | url=http://www.breakingranks.net/weblog/rankism
  | accessdate = 2008-09-16
  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Rank-based abuse underlies many other phenomena such as [[bullying]], [[racism]], [[hazing]], [[ageism]], [[sexism]], [[ableism]], [[mentalism (discrimination)|mentalism]], [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]]. The term "rankism" was coined by physicist, educator, and [[Citizen diplomacy|citizen diplomat]] [[Robert W. Fuller]].

== Characteristics ==

Rankism can take many forms, including
* exploiting one's position within a hierarchy to secure unwarranted advantages and benefits (e.g. massive corporate bonuses);
* abusing a position of power (e.g., abusive [[parental abuse of children|parent]] or [[Religious abuse|priest]], [[Corporate corruption|corrupt CEO]], [[Workplace bullying|bully boss]], [[prisoner abuse]]);
* using rank as a shield to get away with [[insulting]] or [[humiliating]] others with impunity;
* using rank to maintain a position of power long after it can be justified;
* exporting the rank achieved in one sphere of activity to claim superior value as a person;
* exploiting rank that is illegitimately acquired or held (as in situations resting on specious distinctions of social rank, such as [[racism]], [[sexism]], or [[classism]]).

Rankism can occur in any [[social hierarchy]], such as governments, corporations, families, non-profit organizations, and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-09-19
  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of term ==

The term rankism first appeared in print in the ''Oberlin Alumni Magazine'' for fall of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert
 | year = Fall 1997
 | title = Campus Activities (sidebar)
 | journal = Oberlin Alumni Magazine
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later appeared in a book called ''Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank,'' written by Fuller and published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.
 | year = 2003
 | title = Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank
 | publisher = New Society Publishers
 | location = Gabriola Island, Canada
 | isbn = 0-86571-486-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of the term in a management journal occurred in 2001 in a ''[[Leader to Leader Institute]]'' article. The piece questioned the abuse of rank in work hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W
 |date=Summer 2001
 | title = A New Look at Hierarchy: How do we make sure that rank is exercised appropriately?
 | journal = Leader to Leader
 | volume = 21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of rankism has since been widely covered in the media, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[NPR]]'', ''[[C-SPAN]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', the ''[[BBC]]'', ''[[Voice of America]]'', and ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]''.

Other notable references of rankism include Fuller's second book on the subject, ''All Rise: Somebodies, Nobodies, and the Politics of Dignity,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.
 | year = 2006
 | title = All Rise: Somebodies, Nobodies, and the Politics of Dignity
 | publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers
 | isbn = 978-1-57675-385-9 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and an action-oriented guide titled ''Dignity for All: How to Create a World Without Rankism.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fuller
 | first = Robert W.
 |author2=Pamela A. Gerloff
  | year = 2008

 | publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers
 | isbn = 978-1-57675-789-5
 | nopp = true
 | page = back cover 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Dignity and Humiliation Studies]] (HumanDHS) network has also accepted the concept of rankism as core to its mission. It asserts, "...the mission we have undertaken at Human DHS is the confrontation of abuse, rankism and the humiliation endemic to it, on the historical scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | last = The Human DHS Team

 | accessdate = 2008-09-24
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional mediator Julia Ann Wambach uses Fuller's definition of rankism to explore the abuse of position within a hierarchy from both up and down the lines of power, including how rankism feeds on itself in group contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Wambach, Julie Ann (2008). ''Battles between Somebodies and Nobodies: Combat Abuse of Rank at Work and At Home''. Brookside Press. {{ISBN|978-0-9814818-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rankism and dignity ==

According to Fuller, the abuse of rank is experienced by victims as an affront to their [[dignity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Fuller
  | first = Robert
  | title = Dignity: A Universal Right
  | url=http://www.breakingranks.net/weblog/dignity
  | accessdate = 2008-09-16
  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller and his supporters have launched a new [[social movement]] to promote the creation of a dignitarian society. The Dignity Movement's goal is to overcome rankism in the same way that the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[feminist movement|women's movements]] targeted racism and sexism.

Innes"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6yXo5ARzFaMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+Social+Control:+Crime+and+Social+Order+in+Late+Modernity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI5JDpgL75xgIVS-0UCh0FRg_z#v=onepage&amp;q=Understanding%20Social%20Control%3A%20Crime%20and%20Social%20Order%20in%20Late%20Modernity&amp;f=false|author=M.

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] identify two basic forms of social control:
# ''Informal means of control'' – [[Internalisation (sociology)|Internalization]] of [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[value (ethics)|value]]s by a process known as [[socialization]], which is "the process by which an individual, born with behavioral potentialities of enormously wide range, is led to develop actual behavior which is confined to the narrower range of what is acceptable for him by the [[Social group|group standards]]."&lt;ref&gt;Lindzey, Gardner (Ed), (1954). Handbook of social psychology. I. Theory and method. II. Special fields and applications. (2 vols)., (pp. II, 655-692). Oxford, England: Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., xx, 1226 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Formal means of social control'' – External [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] enforced by government to prevent the establishment of [[Lawlessness|chaos]] or [[anomie]] in society. Some theorists, such as [[Émile Durkheim]], refer to this form of control as [[regulation]].

As briefly defined above, the means to enforce social control can be either informal or formal.&lt;ref name=Poore&gt;Poore, S. [http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/curric/soc/crime/s_contro.htm Overview of Social Control Theories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822133540/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/curric/soc/crime/s_contro.htm |date=2007-08-22 }}. The Hewett School. Retrieved on: September 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Edward A. Ross]] argues that [[belief]] systems exert a greater control on human behavior than laws imposed by government, no matter what form the beliefs take.&lt;ref name = Ross&gt;Ross, E.A. 2009 (1901). [http://www.transactionpub.com/title/-978-1-4128-1028-9.html Social Control: Control A Survey of the Foundations of Order]. Piscataway, NJ: Transaction Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social control is considered one of the foundations of [[Social order|order within society]].&lt;ref name="E.A. Ross"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c08PekqsQFUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS4turnbTJAhUDOBoKHWYPDqIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=E.A.

==Definition of the concept==
Roodenburg identifies the concept of social control as a classical concept.&lt;ref name="H. Roodenburg"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ1Ty4dxHQ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW2-HgnrTJAhWJHxoKHU9XDgcQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=H. Roodenburg|title=text|publisher=published by Ohio State University Press 2004, {{ISBN|0814209688}} |accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept of social control has been around since the formation of organized sociology, the meaning has been altered over time. Originally, the concept simply referred to society's ability to [[Regulation|regulate itself]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sociological Theory and Social Control|author=Morris Janowitz|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=81|number=1|date=Jul 1975|pages=82–108|publisher=The University of Chicago Press Article|jstor=2777055|doi=10.1086/226035}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s, the term took on its more modern meaning of an individual's conversion to [[conformity]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Academics began to study [[Social control theory]] as a separate field in the early 20th century.

The concept of social control is related to the notion of [[social order]], a concept identified as existing in the following areas of society:&lt;ref name="M. Innes"/&gt;
{{bulleted list|The [[Education|education system]]|[[Policing]] and the [[law]]|[[Psychiatry]]|[[Social work]]|The [[welfare state]]|The [[Management|working environment]]}}

==Informal==

===Social values===
Social values present in individuals are products of informal social control, exercised implicitly by a society through particular [[customs]], [[social norm|norms]], and [[mores]]. Individuals internalize the values of their society, whether conscious or not of the indoctrination. [[Traditional values|Traditional society]] relies mostly on informal social control embedded in its customary [[culture]] to socialize its members.

===Sanctions===
Informal sanctions may include [[shame]], [[Appeal to ridicule|ridicule]], [[sarcasm]], [[criticism]], and disapproval, which can cause an individual to stray towards the social norms of the society. In extreme cases sanctions may include social [[discrimination]] and [[social exclusion|exclusion]]. Informal social control usually has more effect on individuals because the social values become [[internalized]], thus becoming an aspect of the individual's [[Personality psychology|personality]].

Informal sanctions check '[[deviant]]' behavior.  An example of a negative sanction comes from a scene in the Pink Floyd film ''[[The Wall]]'', whereby the young protagonist is ridiculed and verbally [[abuse]]d by a high school teacher for writing poetry in a mathematics class. Another example from the movie ''[[About a Boy (film)|About a Boy]]'', when a young boy hesitates to jump from a high springboard and is ridiculed for his fear. Though he eventually jumps, his behavior is controlled by shame.&lt;ref&gt;Holland G., Skinner B. F. ''The Analysis of behaviour (The autoinstructing program)''. McGraw-Hill N. Y., 1961, Lesson 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reward and punishment===
{{see also|Mesolimbic pathway|Reward system}}

Informal controls reward or [[Punishment|punish]] acceptable or unacceptable behavior (i.e., [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]]) and are varied from individual to individual, group to group, and society to society. For example, at a [[Women's Institutes (British)|Women's Institute]] meeting, a disapproving look might convey the message that it is inappropriate to flirt with the minister. In a [[Organized crime|criminal gang]], on the other hand, a stronger sanction applies in the case of someone threatening to inform to the police of illegal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Theoretical bias within the modern media===
Theorists such as [[Noam Chomsky]] have argued that [[systemic bias]] exists in the modern media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Powerful ideological, economic and religious [[lobbyists]] have often used school systems and centralized electronic communications to influence [[public opinion]].

==Formal==

===Historically===
Social control developed together with civilization, as a rational measure against the uncontrollable forces of nature, which [[tribe|tribal]] organisations were at prey to, within archaic tribal societies.&lt;ref name="D.S. McIntosh "&gt;{{cite book |jstor=1952567|author=D.S. McIntosh |title=DOI: 10.2307/1952567 (p.619)|publisher=published by The American Political Science Review  September 1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[divine right of kings|Rulers]] have [[Legitimation|legitimately]] used [[torture]] as a means of [[mind control]]  as well as [[murder]], [[imprisonment]] and [[exile]] to remove from public space anyone the state authorities deemed undesirable.

In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], harsh penalties for [[crimes]] and [[civil disobedience]] were criticized by [[List of civil rights leaders|philosophers]] such as [[Cesare Beccaria]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]], whose work inspired [[reform movement]]s. These movements eventually led to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948, which informs most western [[jurisdictions]] and the similar [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] in 1990.

The word ''[[crime]]''  became part of the [[vocabulary]] of the [[English language]] via [[Old French]], during the [[Middle Ages]], and within the [[Middle English]] of the language.&lt;ref name="B. Hanawalt, D. Wallace"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pIdd74zfZ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-9M7dyLXJAhWJ2hoKHehcChg4ChDoAQgnMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author= B.

In history, [[religion]] provided a moral influence on the community and each person, providing an internal [[locus of control]] oriented toward a [[morality]], so that each person was empowered to have a degree of control over themselves within society. As [[Auguste Comte]] instituted sociology ([[The Course in Positive Philosophy|1830-1842]]), already certain thinkers predicted the discontinuation of a perceived ''false consciousness'' intrinsic to religious belief.  Nevertheless, within the twentieth century, social scientists presumed that religion was still a principal factor of social control.&lt;ref name="R. Stark, W.S. Bainbridge"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVt4yqoeP0YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSmpfmu7XJAhWLcBoKHSBoCMAQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=R.

Comte, and those who preceded him, were breathing the air of a [[revolution]] in the latter part of the eighteenth century ([[French Revolution]]) to bring about a so-called  enlightened way of being in society, which brought about a new [[liberty]] for the individual, without the constraints of an over-seeing [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;G.S. Wood - [https://books.google.com/books?id=AWI8fmyhN5IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Liberty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipj6nByrXJAhUIcBoKHV2jAwsQ6AEISjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Liberty&amp;f=false text] published by [[Oxford University Press]] September 26, 2009, 800 pages, {{ISBN|0199741093}}  [[Political Science]] [Retrieved 2015-11-29]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context social control through penal and correctional services, the ''rehabilatative ideal'' (Francis Allen 1964) is a key idea that formed within the 20th century—the first principle of which is that behavior is first caused by things that happened before ("Human behaviour is a product of antecedent causes").&lt;ref name="T.G. Blomberg, K.

===Techniques===
[[Law]] is a technique used for the purposes of social control.&lt;ref name="Roscoe Pound"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1sCffAYNpu0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSmpfmu7XJAhWLcBoKHSBoCMAQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=R. Pound|title=text|publisher=published by Transaction Publishers 1942 (reprint, revised), {{ISBN|1560009160}},  Powell lectures |accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are certain laws regarding appropriate sexual relationships and these are largely based on societal values. Historically, homosexuality has been criminalised. In modern times, this is no longer an offence and this is due to shifts in society's values. Howerever, there are still laws regarding age of consent and incest, as these are still deemed as issues in society that require means of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009|title=Roffee, James (2015).

A mechanism of social control occurs through the use of selective incentives.&lt;ref&gt;B. Janky, K.

Oberschall, in his work, identifies three elements to the pragmatics of social control as they exist in our current society. These are, confrontational control, such as  [[riot control]] and [[crowd control]], preventative measures to deter non-normal behaviors, which is legislation outlining expected boundaries for behavior,  and measures complementary to preventative measures, which amount to punishment of criminal offences.&lt;ref name="Anthony Oberschall"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT8761v8-x4C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=social+control+riot+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAmoVChMIxrnl-tD5xgIVATwUCh3RJQJZ#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control%20riot%20control&amp;f=false|author=Anthony Oberschall|title=Social Movements: Ideologies, Interests, and Identities|publisher=Transaction Publishers 1995, 402 pages, {{ISBN|1412834368}}|accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities can implement park exclusion orders (prohibiting individuals from frequenting some or all of the parks in a city for an extended period due to a previous infraction), trespass laws (privatizing areas generally thought of as public so police can to choose which individuals to interrogate), and off-limit orders (Stay Out of Drug Areas (SODA) and Stay Out of Areas of Prostitution (SOAP) that obstruct access to these spaces). These are just a few of the new social control techniques cities use to displace certain individuals to the margins of society.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Several common themes are apparent in each of these control mechanisms. The first is the ability to spatially constrain individuals in their own city. Defying any of the above statutes is a criminal offense resulting in possible incarceration.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Though not all individuals subjected to an exclusion order obey it, these individuals are, at the very least, spatially hindered through decreased mobility and freedom throughout the city.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; This spatial constrain on individuals leads to disruption and interference in their lives. Homeless individuals generally frequent parks since the area provides benches for sleeping, public washrooms, occasional public services, and an overall sense of security by being near others in similar conditions. Privatizing areas such as libraries, public transportation systems, college campuses, and commercial establishments that are generally public gives the police permission to remove individuals as they see fit, even if the individual has ethical intent in the space. Off-limit orders attempting to keep drug addicts, prostitutes, and others out of concentrated areas of drug and sex crimes commonly restricts these individuals' ability to seek social services beneficial to rehabilitation, since these services are often located within the SODA and SOAP territories.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

====Broken windows theory in the United States====
In the United States, early societies were able to easily expel individuals deemed undesirable from public space through [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] laws and other forms of banishment. In the 1960s and 1970s, however, these exclusion orders were denounced as unconstitutional in America&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;Herbert, Steve and Katherine Beckett. 2009. Zoning out disorder: Assessing contemporary practices of urban social control. ''Studies in Law, Politics, and Society''. 47: 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently were rejected by the US Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;Beckett, Katherine and Steve Herbert. 2008. Dealing with disorder: Social control in the post-industrial city. ''Theoretical Criminology''. 12: 5-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[broken windows theory]] in the 1980s transformed the concepts cities used to form policies, to circumvent the previous issue of unconstitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;Harcourt, Bernard and Jens Ludwig. 2005. Broken windows: New evidence from New York City and a five-city [[social experiment]]. ''The University of Chicago Law Review''. 73: 271-320.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory, the environment of a particular space signals its health to the public, including to potential vandals. By maintaining an organized environment, individuals are dissuaded from causing disarray in that particular location. However, environments filled with disorder, such as broken windows or graffiti, indicate an inability for the neighborhood to supervise itself, therefore leading to an increase in criminal activity.&lt;ref name="tented"&gt;Ranasinghe, Prashan. 2010. Public disorder and its relation to the community-civility-consumption triad: A case study on the uses and users of contemporary urban public space. ''Urban Studies''. 48: 1925-1943.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of focusing on the built environment, policies substantiated by the Broken Windows Theory overwhelmingly emphasize undesirable human behavior as the environmental disorder prompting further crime.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; The civility laws, originating in the late 1980s and early 1990s, provide an example of the usage of this latter aspect of the Broken Windows Theory as legitimization for discriminating against individuals considered disorderly in order to increase the sense of security in urban spaces.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; These civility laws effectively criminalize activities considered undesirable, such as sitting or lying on sidewalks, sleeping in parks, urinating or [[drinking in public]], and begging,&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Beckett, Katherine and Steve Herbert. 2010. Penal boundaries: Banishment and the expansion of punishment. ''Law and Social Inquiry''. 35: 1-38.&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to force the individuals doing these and other activities to relocate to the margins of society.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Not surprisingly then, [[criminalization of homelessness|these restrictions disproportionally affect the homeless]].&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;

Individuals are deemed undesirable in urban space because they do not fit into [[norm (social)|social norms]], which causes unease for many residents of certain neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;England, Marcia. Stay out of drug areas: Drugs, othering, and regulation of public space in Seattle, Washington. ''Space and Polity''. 12: 197-213.&lt;/ref&gt; This fear has been deepened by the Broken Windows Theory and exploited in policies seeking to remove undesirables from visible areas of society.&lt;ref name="tented" /&gt; In the [[post-industrial society|post-industrial city]], concerned primarily with retail, tourism, and the service sector,&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; the increasing pressure to create the image of a livable and orderly city has no doubt aided in the most recent forms of social control.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; These new techniques involve even more intense attempts to spatially expel certain individuals from urban space since the police are entrusted with considerably more power to investigate individuals, based on suspicion rather than on definite evidence of illicit actions.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

==Recent developments==
In the decades leading up to the end of the 1980s, an increased prevalence of the [[Individualism|individual]] as a feature within society led to many new [[List of psychotherapies|therapies]], suggesting the use of therapy as a means of social control (Conrad &amp; Scheider, 1980: Mechanic 1989).&lt;ref&gt;A.V. Horwitz - [https://books.google.com/books?id=97ReBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT278&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRl6CasbXJAhUIhhoKHVOaDDgQ6AEINjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false text] published by [[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]], June 29th 2013, 290 pages, {{ISBN|148992230X}} , Psychology   [Retrieved 2015-11-28]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists working in social practice co-create their work with a specific audience or propose critical interventions within existing social systems to inspire debate or catalyze social exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cca.edu/academics/graduate/fine-arts/socialpractices|title=Social Practice Workshop|publisher=California College of the Arts|accessdate= Sep 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large overlap between social practice and pedagogy demonstrates the need for art education to embrace collaborative practice.&lt;ref&gt;Sholette, G.

Consequently, images frequently fail to do justice to the engagement and interactions that take place during a project.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artificial Hells: Participatory Art and the politics of Spectatorship|last=Bishop|first=Claire|publisher=Verso Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of terminology==

Until 2005, the term "social practice" was used in a branch of social theory considering human relationships to each other and to the larger society as "practices". The term "art and social practice" was institutionalized in 2005 with the creation of the Social Practice [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] concentration at the [[California College of the Arts]],&lt;ref name="Artnews"&gt;http://www.artnews.com/2013/10/31/how-to-speak-artspeak-properly/&lt;/ref&gt; followed by other institutions of higher education offering similar degrees. Social practice art as a medium has been referenced in the ''New York Times'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/arts/design/outside-the-citadel-social-practice-art-is-intended-to-nurture.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/education/edlife/social-practice-degrees-take-art-to-a-communal-level.html|title=Social Practice Degrees Take Art to a Communal Level|last=Grant|first=Daniel|date=2016-02-05|access-date=2016-02-08|issn=0362-4331|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Artforum'',&lt;ref&gt;http://artforum.com/inprint/issue=201207&amp;id=31944&amp;pagenum=1&lt;/ref&gt; ''ArtNews,''&lt;ref name="Artnews" /&gt; and ''Art Practical.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artpractical.com/feature/notes_toward_a_non_anthropocentric_social_practice/&lt;/ref&gt;  As an emerging field, social practice can encompass a variety of terms: public practice,&lt;ref name="OtisGPP"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.otis.edu/graduate-public-practice|title=Graduate Public Practice|website=Otis College of Art and Design|access-date=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; socially engaged art,&lt;ref&gt;http://pablohelguera.net/2011/11/education-for-socially-engaged-art-2011/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Community arts|community art]], new-genre public art,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Mapping-Terrain-New-Genre-Public/dp/0941920305&lt;/ref&gt; [[participatory art]], [[Art intervention|interventionist art]], [[Collaboration#occupational examples|collaborative art]],&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Claire. “The Social Turn: Collaboration and Its Discontents” ''Artforum,'' February 2006, 178-83.&lt;/ref&gt; [[relational art]] and dialogical aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Artnews" /&gt;

== Characteristics of social practice ==
Socially engaged art differs from its art historical ancestors in that it is not a specific movement or style, but rather a way of defining a new social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Living as Form, Socially Engaged Art from 1991-2011|last=Thompson|first=Nato|publisher=MIT Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of existing social practice projects across the world have taken vastly different approaches to their combination of publics, methodologies, aesthetics, and environments, yet these projects all share an aesthetic of human interaction and development. The end products of such works are not commodities, but rather processes for constructive social change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Some foundational characteristics of socially engaged art remain consistently relevant to a diverse range of works. For an artist or producer to create a successful social practice work, they must consider the unique context in which they are working, and identify specific characteristics of the community and environment. They must also balance aesthetic and methodology in their work, align the timeline of a project with its purpose: a quick-impact ephemeral work, or the regularity of a longitudinal work. 

=== Community and environment ===
Social practice artists and producers aim to affect their community and environment in a real (rather than symbolic) way that enables social and political change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Each project is tailored to the community and environment in which it will take place.  In social practice the identification of the public, or audience, precedes the project's development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It is impossible to create a project founded upon engagement and collaboration without first making assumptions as to who will be involved.  ''Who'' the artist or producer wishes to engage and ''where'' they wish to engage are therefore core characteristics of socially engaged art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Environment could be described on two primary levels: the broader community, city, or region; and the immediate space being occupied – a street, museum, studio, or other area. To understand the context in which they are working, artists and producers must develop relationships with individuals, organizations and institutions that intersect many different parts of their community and environment.  One theorist makes the comparison between socially engaged art projects to exotic fruit, stating that both “usually travel poorly when “exported” to other locations to be replicated.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The community and environment are therefore not merely external influencers on a specific project – they are inherent characteristics.

=== Aesthetics and methodology ===
For much of art history, a work's aesthetic has been upheld as the primary measure of its quality. The 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century broadened the public understanding of art to consider concept and process alongside aesthetic, and by the new millennium the tables had turned to emphasize process over product: one of the defining characteristics of socially engaged art. Process is determined by method; thus social practice producers and artists are often more concerned with the methodology rather than the aesthetic of their work. Many argue that social practice has created a new aesthetic of its own: an aesthetic of human interaction and development that is based not on spectatorship but on participation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This aesthetic captures the diverse methods employed by socially engaged art and encompasses not only traditional methods of painting, photography, architecture, and performance; but also nontraditional forms borrowed from other disciplines, such as festivals, conferences, schools, and protests.  

Aesthetics are typically hierarchical, highly subjective, and greatly determined by external influencers, such as the imagery of a given culture, or the relationship between appearance and market value.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To escape these external influencers, aesthetics can also be defined in terms of “aesthesis,” an autonomous realm of experience and judgment that cannot be reduced to logic, reason or morality but is of great importance to humankind.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Aesthetics  have the capacity to critique our beliefs and values by restructuring our perception of the world.  Their application can achieve one of the core aims of socially engaged art: the definition of a new social order characterized by engagement and participation.

Methodology in socially engaged art refers to the set of practices used throughout the process and production of a project. The method is no longer a means to an end, but an end within itself: the experience of creation and experimentation is a central element of social practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education for Socially Engaged Art|last=Helguera|first=Pablo|publisher=Verso Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While aesthetics reframe ideas and beliefs outside of the disciplines in which we have accepted them, methodology takes the frameworks of those disciplines to produce new aesthetics. Socially engaged art has embraced conferences, urban regeneration projects, pedagogical projects, and protests, which are all frameworks borrowed from other disciplines.

While aesthetics and methodology can have conflicting interests, there are important reasons why artists and producers should seek to integrate the two. Methodology will engage the public, but aesthetics will play a large role in determining how a project is interpreted.
While aesthetics and methodology can have conflicting interests, there are important reasons why artists and producers should seek to integrate the two. Ultimately, the two can work together to enhance each other: the aesthetic value of a project can increase its social function, while the method can heighten the aesthetic experience through public engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What We Made: Conversations on art and social cooperations|last=Finkelpearl|first=Tom|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Longevity vs. ephemerality ===
The method and aesthetic adopted in social practice work is greatly influenced by intended timeline.  Length determines the type of social and/or political change the artist aims to achieve, the types of dialogue created, and the ways in which an individual can engage with a work. The length of a project is also extremely situational. Some projects aim to have an immediate impact, while others prefer to build relationships that foster change over an extended period.

Ephemeral projects are typically characterized by temporary gatherings and occupation of space. They create situations in which social interactions are momentary and not expected to become long-lasting. The immediate impact of ephemeral works often means they take place around a particular issue or concept. Protests, festivals, conferences, or pop-up performances have all been used as mediums for ephemeral social practice work.

Longitudinal projects are those built upon regular and reoccurring social interactions and dialogue, organized with the intention to be sustained over a longer period. They typically occupy the same space, and are characterized by deeper partnerships and relationships that are gradually built over the course of the work’s existence. As a result, many long-term social practice projects include a pedagogical element in their work. Classes, urban regeneration work, schools, or institutional partnerships are all examples of longitudinal projects.

== Social practice and institutions ==
Much social practice has taken place in the gap between the public and cultural institutions, which has been identified and acted upon as a new site for artistic intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Living as Form, Socially Engaged Art from 1991-2011|last=Cruz|first=Teddy|publisher=Creative Time Books|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Thompson|editor-first=Nato|location=New York|pages=58|chapter=Democratizing Urbanization and the Search for a New Civic Imagination.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However institutions, such as museums, foundations, non-profit organizations, and universities all play a significant role in supporting and amplifying social practice work.  Many institutions constitute an extension of the public sphere, regardless of whether they are public or private in their ownership and operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=[[Maves]] Mark|first=[[Hodal]] [[Stephanie]]|date=1999|title=Museums and Livable Communities|url=|journal=The Journal of Museum Education|volume=24|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Partnerships between socially engaged art and contemporary institutions have thus widened the public sphere, and provided mutual benefits to the institution, the community, those engaged in the project, and the producers.

=== Social practice and the art market ===
In the traditional art world, market value and a work's collectability are deeply intertwined. This has posed a challenge to socially engaged artists seeking museum and gallery support, since many works go against the capitalist market to challenge traditional collecting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education for Socially Engaged Art|last=Helguera|first=Pablo|publisher=Jorge Pinto Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many socially engaged artists and producers must look elsewhere for support. The expansion of the art world in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century has seen the emergence of alternative supports, such as non-profit organizations and the ever-growing biennale network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The One and the Many: Contemporary Collaborative Art in a Global Context|last=Kester|first=Grant|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other partners include art fairs, or commissions and residencies associated with universities, foundations, and urban regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What we Made: Conversations on art and social cooperation|last=Finkelpearl|first=Tom|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists and producers have also formed their own means of support, as artist-run exhibition spaces, journals and blogs demonstrate.

=== Social practice in the university ===
Universities often partner with producers, artists and theorists of socially engaged art. These relationships offer mutual benefits for both academic institutions and artists. Universities offer artists employment security, the support and validation often required for establishing grant-based and corporate partnerships, and access to a high interdisciplinary environment that not only accepts, but encourages, experimentation. Artists in turn provide knowledge, skills and research to support individuals and broader programs within the university. As producers and scholars, they generate both new theory and new practice for the field of socially engaged art.

==Exhibitions and conferences==

Exhibitions of social practice art often include multiple artists or [[art collective]]s, and rather than exhibiting art objects, the artist’s participatory role in their work as well as their collaboration with the public becomes the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/arts/design/outside-the-citadel-social-practice-art-is-intended-to-nurture.html&lt;/ref&gt; Several conferences are held nationally and internationally to bring together artists and academics involved in the field. They have featured [[installation art|installation]], [[performance art]], [[film]], [[dance]], art talks, forums, and gallery exhibitions.

[[China Central Television]] is a '''soft power of China'''. CCTV is a state-owned media organization and under supervised by SARPPFT. The organization and directors inside the media company are assigned by the government. The government control the news and supervised the directors in order to show their perspectives to the world.

== Soft Power ==
[[Soft power]], according to [[Joseph Nye]], who coined the term in his book in 1990: “ is the ability to get others to want the outcomes that you want, and the ability to achieve goals through attraction rather than coercion”(Nye, 1990). Indeed, soft power enables a change of behavior in others, without competition or conflict, by using persuasion and attraction. In this modern day, soft power becomes vital for a country. [[Mass media|Media industry]] plays an essential role among all the industries, and it’s the most influential power.

=== Introduction ===
China Central Television (CCTV) is a state-owned ministerial level institution of China, used to be called [[Beijing Television]] before 1978. China Central Television owns 50 television channels, and the broadcaster provides programming in six different languages. Among the 50 television channels, 16 of them are public while 21 are pay channels, and with 13 channels of foreign languages, which are English, French, Russian, Arabic as well as Spanish. It is one of the largest official mouthpieces of the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and under the supervision of [[State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television|State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television]] of the People’s Republic of China (SAPPRFT), a department within the State Council. State Council is the main department that supervising and censoring the whole China’s television industry. SAPPRFT is an executive branch under the State Council. Its main task is the administration and supervision of state-owned enterprise engaged in the television, radio and film industries. It performs the actual daily oversight, including censorship of sensitive content. Government related media organizations like CCTV, [[Xinhua News Agency]] and [[China National Radio]] must have permissions from SAPPRFT to broadcast the new content to the public.

In June 2017, CCTV "relaunched and rebranded its stable of foreign-language TV channels. The six are now labeled as [[China Global Television Network]] (CGTN) with CGTN English as its flagship channel. "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/asia/cctv-international-channels-relaunch-cgtn-1201952228/|title=CCTV International Channels Relaunched as CGTN|last=Frater|first=Patrick|date=2017-01-04|work=Variety|access-date=2017-07-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Directors ===
The directors on CCTV also have positions in related government organizations and all of them are the members of Communist Party of China. Nie Chenxi, who is the main director of CCTV since 2015. He’s also the vice director of the [[Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China|Propaganda Department]] of the Communist Party of China (CPC), main director of SAPPRFT as well as the director of the National Copyright Administration of the People’s Republic of China. Nie was born in 1957 and from Hebei Province.  He worked for the local government since 1974. In the duration, he studied a master degree in management and engineering. In February 1993, He joined the Communist Party of China and worked towards to the CCP.  During Nie’s time, the government has issued repeated orders telling television channels to focus on “uplifting, patriotic programs and screen out ‘base and vulgar’ content” (Reuters, 2015). Historically, directors of CCTV made [[Cultural Revolution|cultural revolutions.]] In December 1991, Yang Weiguang was assigned as president of CCTV. With his peasant family background, it’s no doubt helped him secure a steady position in the government related broadcaster organizations. He left his CCTV post in 1999, and the ten years of his management of CCTV were considered as the best days. In Yang’s decade, CCTV was “unquestionably the network’s high point in terms of party approval, market position, and public sphere” (Zhu, 2012). It was the first decade of CCTV’s transformation from state-funded proselytizer to [[commercial broadcaster]].

=== Income ===
The main financial support to CCTV is from [[advertising]].  In 2013, CCTV earned a total of 15.88 billion Yuan, and increased its revenues 11.4% each year. The graph (Figure 2) showing the most of the advertisers is liquor companies. Within those companies, liquor company JNC Group had spent the most money on advertising. The company spent 608 million Yuan by placing their logo on four daily slots on the news bulletins for eight months. Other liquor companies like [[Kweichow Moutai Company|Kweichow Moutai Co]] and Wuliangye Group Co also are the main advertiser of CCTV. Kweichow Moutai Co spent 352 million Yuan on placing their advertising on CCTV before [[Xinwen Lianbo]] (National News broadcasting, which airing the CCTV news in local channel [[Xinwen Lianbo|everyday between 7pm to 7:30pm), and Wuliangye Group Co spent 499 million Yuan on the same time slots (C]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;hina Daily[[Xinwen Lianbo|, 2012). Those companies provided a steady financial support to CCTV. CCTV’s]] New Year[[Xinwen Lianbo|’s Gala is popular and attracted among the country, even internationally. CCTV’s New Year’s Gala is on Chinese New Year’s Eve and it’s a tradition that nearly every family in China participates in to ring in the New Year. The tickets of Gala doesn’t open for the public, but CCTV sen]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;nd invitations to some celebrities, such as people who hold a high post in the government, annually influenced people like [[Jack Ma]] ([[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Ali Baba (disambiguation)|Alibaba]]) as well as their family members. At the same time, CCTV will air the Gala on every local channel as well as in its foreign channels. People over the world will have a chance to watch this well-known performance. As a result, the advertisings during Gala are incredibly expensive but it still attracts a lot of companies to engage. CCTV also orients different kinds of event that open to the public, such as Skits, Xiangsheng, and Chinese Opera. (Mack, 2017), which tickets are available to the public. CCTV earns profits mainly through advertisements as well as its events.

=== Domestic Influence ===
China Central Television, [[China Radio International]] (CRI), [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua news agency]], and ''[[China Daily|The China Daily]]'' newspaper and website are the largest four state-owned media corporations. They all under control by SAPPRFT and rely on each other for producing news to the public. Xinhua News Agency is the main news source of CCTV. As they both are the official press agencies of the state, they have been tightly controlled and packaged by the government. In 2008, an [[earthquake]] [[List of earthquakes in China|measuring 8 on the Richter scale hit Sichuan Province]]. China Central Television was reporting on the disaster within minutes of the quake and had reporters airing with the updates within half an hour. “Domestic disaster of any sort were too hot to handle without instruction from the state and could harm the national image” (Zhu, 2012). This earthquake was a milestone of China as the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] was opened in a few months later in Beijing. In the chaos of the disaster, the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China requested other Chinese news organizations not to broadcast their reports of the disaster, but instead only used information released by either CCTV or the Xinhua News Agency. This process reveals that the government controls the news.

=== International Policy ===
In 2001, a project called “Going Out” came up by president [[Jiang Zemin]] and launched by Xu Guangchun, who was the deputy head of the Propaganda Ministry and the head of SAPPRFT. This was a new start for CPC develop its power overseas. The project aims to bring China’s voice to the world. “Going Out” program was proposed to “land China’s TV and radio channels overseas within five years and provide multi languages and regionalized broadcasting and coverage by 2011” (Zhu, 2012). The image of China globally was misrepresent and misunderstand by other international medias like BBC, as result CPC wishes to erase its national image and present its voice to the world.

At the beginning of the “Going Out” Program CPC realized CCTV would meet some obstacles in western countries, because media organizations like [[CNN]] and [[BBC News|BBC]] are dominants in western world while CCTV is an Asian broadcaster. Besides, westerners have some kind of stereotyped opinions to Asian, especially to Chinese. It is not an easy job to change their perspective to Chinese, as a result China moved to Africa, where western medias did not cover too much. That’s why CCTV moved their attention to Africa in 2012. As Zhang mentioned that “the Africa-oriented ‘channel’ is a ‘testing ground’ for the construction of an expand state-centered Sino centric media discourse aimed at showcasing China’s soft power and challenging the perceived Western-centric world order” (Zhang, 2013). China understands that the Africans are facing the same problem, which is the misrepresenting image in the world, so it is much easier for CPC to bring the voice there. It is an essential as well as a significant step that push Chinese media steps to global.

The terms "soft target" and "hard target" are flexible in nature and the distinction between the two is not always clear.{{Sfn|Forest|2006|p=38}} However, typical "soft targets" are civilian sites where unarmed people congregate in large numbers; examples include [[national monument]]s, hospitals, schools, sporting arenas, hotels, cultural centers,  movie theaters, [[café]]s and restaurants, [[places of worship]], nightclubs, shopping centers, transportation sites (such as [[railway station]]s, buses, rail systems, and ferries), and farmers' cooperatives.{{Sfn|Forest|2006|p=37}}{{Sfn|McGovern|2012|p=371}}{{Sfn|Bennett|2007|p=62}}{{Sfn|Preston|1987|}} Soft targets are contrasted with hard targets, which typically restrict access to the public and are well-protected.{{Sfn|Bennett|2007|p=62}} Examples of hard targets include airports, government buildings, military installations, [[diplomatic missions]], and [[power station]]s.{{Sfn|Forest|2006|p=37}}{{Sfn|McGovern|2012|p=371}}{{Sfn|Bennett|2007|p=62}}

==History==
Terrorist groups almost exclusively choose to strike soft targets.{{Sfn|McGovern|2012|p=371}}{{Sfn|Forest|2006|p=40}} Of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1968 to 2005, 72% (8,111) struck soft targets and 27% (4,248) struck hard targets.{{Sfn|Forest|2006|pp=39-40}} The intent of attacks on soft targets is to instil fear as well as inflict casualties.{{Sfn|Bennett|2007|p=62}} [[Clark Kent Ervin]] notes that attacks on soft targets inflict psychological damage.{{Sfn|Ervin|2006|p=158}} In 2011, while preparations were being made for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the deputy commissioner of London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]] noted that if the primary targets were secure, terrorists might substitute targets that are nearby but not as well protected.{{Sfn|Ervin|2006|p=103}}

Military and paramilitary groups may adopt a strategy of attacking soft targets in order to avoid direct confrontation with a stronger opponent. For example, U.S. military general [[John Galvin (general)|John Galvin]] noted in 1987 that [[Contras|Contra rebels]] switched to civilian targets rather than continuing the direct fighting against the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]].{{Sfn|Kaplan|1987|}}

'''Special sciences''' are those sciences other than [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]], that are presumed to be [[reductionism|reducible]] to fundamental physics, at least in principle. In this view, [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[neuroscience]]—indeed, all sciences except fundamental physics—are special sciences.  The status of the special sciences, and their relation to physics, is unresolved in the [[philosophy of science]]. [[Jerry Fodor]], for instance, has argued for ''strong autonomy'', concluding that the special sciences are not even in principle reducible to physics.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J. (1974): "Special sciences and the disunity of science as a working hypothesis", ''Synthese'', 28, pp. 97-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teen dating violence''' is the [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], or [[psychological abuse|psychological]] / [[emotional abuse|emotional]] [[abuse]] (or [[violence]]) within a dating relationship among adolescents.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web | last = CDC | author-link = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | title = Teen dating violence | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = June 29, 2015 | accessdate = November 15, 2015 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/teen_dating_violence.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Intimate partner violence]] (IPV) has been a well examined and documented phenomenon in adults; however, there has not been nearly as much study on violence in adolescent dating relationships, and it is therefore not as well understood. The research has mainly focused on Caucasian youth, and there are yet no studies which focus specifically on IPV in adolescent same-sex romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Chu | first1 = Ann T. | last2 = Sundermann | first2 = Jane M. | last3 = DePrince | first3 = Anne P. | contribution = Intimate partner violence in adolescent romantic relationships | editor-last1 = Donohue | editor-first1 = William T. | editor-last2 = Benuto | editor-first2 = Lorraine T. | editor-last3 = Woodward Tolle | editor-first3 = Lauren | title = Handbook of adolescent health psychology | page = 193 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | location = New York, New York | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781461466338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=KX29BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimate partner violence (IPV) in adolescents is an important realm of study as, in addition to the usual negative effects of abuse, this violence occurs at a critical period in the social and mental development of a person.  This is also an important topic from a [[gender studies]] perspective as almost 32% of male adolescents engage in some form of violence, whether sexual, physical or emotional, towards their partners while adolescent violence from females is nearly half of that rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bachman | first1 = Ronet | last2 = Peralta | first2 = Robert | title = The relationship between drinking and violence in an adolescent population: does gender matter? | journal = [[Deviant Behavior (journal)|Deviant Behavior]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–19 | doi = 10.1080/016396202317192008 | date = January 2002 | ref = harv }} [http://www3.uakron.edu/publications/relationshiprp.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the United States public health authority, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), "[a]dolescents and adults are often unaware that teens experience dating violence."&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

==Gender differences==
{{see also|Domestic violence#Gender differences}}
The literature on IPV among adolescents indicates that the rates are similar for the number of girls and boys in heterosexual relationships who report experiencing IPV, or that girls in heterosexual relationships are more likely than their male counterparts to report perpetrating IPV.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Knox | first1 = Lyndee | last2 = Lomonaco | first2 = Carmela | last3 = Alpert | first3 = Elaine | contribution = Adolescent relationship violence | editor-last1 = Mitchell | editor-first1 = Connie | editor-last2 = Anglin | editor-first2 = Deirdre | title = Intimate partner violence: a health-based perspective | pages = 514, 516 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Oxford New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780199720729 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q04QO7UmyowC&amp;pg=PA514 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Jessica R. | last2 = Ghandour | first2 = Reem M. | last3 = Kub | first3 = Joan E. | title = Female perpetration of violence in heterosexual intimate relationships: adolescence through adulthood | journal = [[Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse]] | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 227–249 | doi = 10.1177/1524838008324418 | pmc = 2663360 | date = October 2008 | ref = harv | pmid=18936281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ely et al. stated that, unlike domestic violence in general, equal rates of IPV perpetration is a unique characteristic with regard adolescent dating violence, and that this is "perhaps because the period of adolescence, a special developmental state, is accompanied by sexual characteristics that are distinctly different from the characteristics of adult."&lt;ref name="Rapp-Paglicci"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Ely | first1 = Gretchen | last2 = Dulmus | first2 = Catherine N. | last3 = Wodarski | first3 = John S. | contribution = Adolescent dating violence | editor-last1 = Rapp-Paglicci | editor-first1 = Lisa A. | editor-last2 = Roberts | editor-first2 = Albert R. | editor-last3 = Wodarski | editor-first3 = John S. | title = Handbook of violence | page = 36 | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780471214441 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=YtOvUULaNZEC&amp;pg=PA36 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Wekerle and Wolfe theorized that "a mutually coercive and violent dynamic may form during adolescence, a time when males and females are more equal on a physical level" and that this "physical equality allows girls to assert more power through physical violence than is possible for an adult female attacked by a fully physically mature man."&lt;ref name="Rapp-Paglicci"/&gt;

Regarding studies that indicate that girls are as likely or more likely than boys to commit IPV, the authors emphasize that substantial differences exist between the genders, including that girls are significantly more likely than boys to report having experienced severe IPV, such as being threatened with a weapon, punched, strangled, beaten, burned, or raped, and are also substantially more likely than boys to need  psychological help or experience physical injuries that require medical help for the abuse, and to report sexual violence as a part of dating violence. They are also more likely to take IPV more seriously. By contrast, boys are more likely to report experiencing less severe acts, such as being pinched, slapped, scratched or kicked. Girls are more likely to report committing less serious forms of IPV, including as a means of self-defense, whereas boys are more likely to report committing more severe acts of IPV, including threats, physical violence and controlling a partner.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; That girls are more likely to engage in IPV as a result of self-defense is supported by findings that previous victimization is a stronger predictor of perpetration in females than in males.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{citation | last1 = Edwards | first1 = Katie M. | last2 = Dardis | first2 = Christina M. | last3 = Gidycz | first3 = Christine A. | contribution = The role of victimization experiences in adolescent girls and young women's aggression in dating relationships | editor-last = Paludi | editor-first = Michele A. | title = The psychology of teen violence and victimization, volume 2, Part I. Impact of teen violence on adolescents, family, and peers | pages = 71–82 | publisher = Praeger | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780313393761 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research indicates that boys who have been abused in childhood by a family member are more prone to IPV perpetration, while girls who have been abused in childhood by a family member are prone to lack empathy and [[self-efficacy]]; but the risks for the likelihood of IPV perpetration and victimization among adolescents vary and are not well understood.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

==Controversies and arguments==
There is a common misconception that aggression is stable over time. That is, young people who are labeled as or considered to be violent and aggressive at any point in time are then assumed to be dangerous for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Loeber | first1 = Rolf | last2 = Stouthamer-Loeber | first2 = Magda | title = Development of juvenile aggression and violence: some common misconceptions and controversies | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–259 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.242 | pmid = 9491750 | date = February 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a contentious issue because there is a desire to protect both parties involved (or that have the potential to become involved) in teen dating violence. While classifying the perpetrator as a threat may be detrimental to his or her life and future relationships, not classifying the perpetrator this way may put future partners at risk.

There is considerable debate over whether we as a society have an accurate picture of the prevalence and severity of teen dating violence by gender. It is important to note that although male and female adolescents do not differ in "overall frequency of violence in dating relationships," females are subject to "significantly higher levels of severe violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molidor | first1 = Christian | last2 = Tolman | first2 = Richard M. | title = Gender and contextual factors in adolescent dating violence | journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–194 | doi = 10.1177/1077801298004002004 | pmid = 12295440 | date = April 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact begs the question of whether abuse should be evaluated based on “severity” and how that can and should be measured, or if all abuse should be considered equally harmful.

[[Age of consent]] is an issue that cannot be ignored in the discussion of teenage dating violence. Teenage sex is regulated in such a way that "age of consent laws render teenagers below a certain age incapable of consent to sexual activity with adults, and sometimes with peers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sutherland | first = Kate | title = From jailbird to jailbait: age of consent laws and the construction of teenage sexualities | journal = [[William &amp; Mary Law School#Law journals|William &amp; Mary Journal of Women and the Law]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–349 | ssrn = 1586883 | date = Spring 2003 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/wmjwl9&amp;div=20 | ref = harv }} [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1167&amp;context=wmjowl Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the adult may be just a few months older than the minor. There are a number of states in which "age of consent statutes are used to prosecute consensual sex between two persons both under the age of consent." This type of prosecution has been deemed unconstitutional in some states by citing violation of privacy rights, but remains in effect in other states. Sexual behavior and aggression can be so deeply intertwined that the legality of underage consensual sex is sure to have an effect on teen dating violence.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Nature vs. nurture==
{{OR section|date=September 2015}}
Significant research has been done on the causes behind violent behavior in adolescent dating relationships with the intention of guiding the creation of dating violence prevention programs, and in turn has provided findings on the roles of nature and nurture in the development of such behavior with a strong favor towards nurture factors. A study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health examined the potential association between a spectrum of childhood adverse experiences and physical violence in relationships before age 21 for both members. The subjects were asked questions about violence in their adolescent relationships, as either victim or perpetrator, and their childhood surrounding twelve different adversities: parental death, parental divorce, long-term separation from parent, parental mental illness, parental substance abuse disorder, parental criminality, inter-parental violence, serious physical illness in childhood, physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and family economic adversity. The results demonstrated a strong positive correlation between ten out of the twelve childhood adversities and physically violent behavior in a teen relationship, with 13.8% responding with experiences of sexual violence, and 11.6% experiencing inter-parental violence. This points to a strong influence of experience, or nature, on violent tendencies in adolescent relationships. Multiple other studies corroborate these findings, citing childhood bullying, assault, and maltreatment as significant indicators for future violence in adolescent dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Elizabeth | last2 = Breslau | first2 = Joshua | last3 = Chung | first3 = W.J. Joanie | last4 = Green | first4 = Jennifer Greif | last5 = McLaughlin | first5 = Katie A. | last6 = Kessler | first6 = Ronald C. | title = Adverse childhood experiences and risk of physical violence in adolescent dating relationships | journal = [[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]] | volume = 65 | issue = 11 | pages = 1006–1013 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2009.105429 | pmid = 21321063 | date = November 2011 | ref = harv | pmc=3686487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there has been little explicit study of the relationship between nature and teen dating violence, there has been proven correlation between testosterone levels and violent tendencies that could come to fruition in adolescent dating relationships. Higher testosterone levels “manifests itself in various intensities and forms from; thoughts, anger, verbal aggressiveness, competition, dominance behavior, to physical violence.”  A study published in the International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism reported, “Testosterone plays a significant role in the arousal of these behavioral manifestations in the brain centers involved in aggression and on the development of the muscular system that enables their realization. There is evidence that testosterone levels are higher in individuals with aggressive behavior, such as prisoners who have committed violent crimes.” However, the study also noted that many cases of high testosterone levels are disarmed through socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Batrinos | first = Menelaos L. | title = Testosterone and aggressive behavior in man | journal = International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 563–568 | doi = 10.5812/ijem.3661 | pmc = 3693622 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv | pmid=23843821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, because children are exposed to relationships early in their life through their parents and being so malleable at a young age, most evidence points to an adverse experience or experiences in childhood as fodder for such behavior in adolescence.

==Prevalence and approaches==
The literature on IPV among adolescents primarily focuses on Caucasian youth, and there are yet no studies which focus specifically on IPV in adolescent same-sex romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;

====Statistics====
While dating, domestic and sexual violence affect women regardless of their age, teens and young women are especially vulnerable. Young people ages 12 to 19 experience the highest rates of rape and sexual assault,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Truman | first1 = Jennifer L. | last2 = Rand | first2 = Michael R. | title = Criminal victimization, 2009 | url = http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv09.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = October 2010 }} {{NCJ|231327}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people age 18 and 19 experience the highest rates of stalking. Approximately one in three adolescent girls in the United States is a victim of physical, emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner—a figure that far exceeds victimization rates for other types of violence affecting youth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davis | first = Antoinette | title = Interpersonal and physical dating violence among teens | journal = The National Council on Crime and Delinquency Focus | date = September 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425153501/http://www.nccd-crc.org/nccd/pubs/2008_focus_teen_dating_violence.pdf | archive-date = 25 April 2012 | url = http://www.nccd-crc.org/nccd/pubs/2008_focus_teen_dating_violence.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Andrew Green|Mark Green]], former Wisconsin Representative said "if the numbers we see in domestic violence (dating violence) were applied to terrorism or gang violence, the entire country would be up in arms, and it would be the lead story on the news every night".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Savacool | first = Julia | title = Our most important mission ever: stop violence against women now | url = http://www.marieclaire.com/world-reports/news/domestic-violence-stop | work = [[Marie Claire]] | publisher = [[Hearst Corporation]] | date = 10 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Women's Health'', "81% of parents surveyed either believed dating violence is not an issue or admit they don't know if it's an issue",&lt;ref name=UMHS&gt;{{cite journal | last = Staff writer | title = Who's affected by dating violence? | journal = Women's Health | page = 3 | date = June–July 2004 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905041051/http://www.med.umich.edu/whp/newsletters/summer04/p03-dating.html | archive-date = 5 September 2008 | url = http://www.med.umich.edu/whp/newsletters/summer04/p03-dating.html | ref = harv }} Sources: [[Futures Without Violence|Family Violence Prevention Fund]] and [[Advocates for Youth]]&lt;/ref&gt; this is concerning because of the growth of dating abuse in teenagers relationships.&lt;ref name=UMHS /&gt; Dating violence has advanced{{Clarify|date=September 2015}} through the years by the means of communication technology.  A survey conducted by Teenage Research Unlimited stated that "[10] percent of teens have been threatened physically via e-mail, IM, text messaging, chat rooms, etc."

A 2008 [[meta-analysis]], which examined 62 [[empirical research]] studies between 1996 and 2006, relating to domestic violence in heterosexual intimate relationships from adolescence through to adulthood in the United States, reported on research findings that consistently show that adolescent females commit significantly more acts of domestic violence in intimate relationships than adolescent males. It stated, however, that the "data also suggest that females who commit acts of domestic violence may experience more violent or frequent IPV victimization than males" and that "[t]he highest rates [for female-perpetrated IPV] were found for emotional violence, followed by physical and sexual violence. Prevalence rates varied widely within each population, most likely due to methodological and sampling differences across studies." The authors added, "Few longitudinal studies existed, limiting the extent to which we could identify developmental patterns associated with female perpetrated intimate partner violence." They found a few studies which reported prevalence rates of IPV perpetration among females at two or more time points, which they stated made "it difficult to obtain a clear picture of the developmental patterns associated with this type of violence." There was also only one study that reported on prevalence rates over time for female perpetrated IPV among adolescents. "This study found a significant increase in prevalence over a six month period; however, they measured lifetime perpetration of IPV, therefore, it is unclear if there was an actual increase or simply an accumulation of violence," stated the authors. "Together, these studies provide very limited evidence that female perpetration of IPV may follow a similar developmental trajectory as other forms of violence. [...] Unfortunately, many of the studies included in this review used modified or alternative instruments making it difficult to accurately compare prevalence estimates."&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

In a 2009 survey, the CDC found that 9.8% of high school students in the U.S. reported having been intentionally physically hurt by their boyfriend or girlfriend in the preceding 12&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; A 2011 CDC nationwide survey of the U.S. population reported that 23% of females and 14% of males who ever experienced rape, other physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner first experienced some form of partner violence between 11 and 17 years of age.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The ages between 16 and 24 are when youth are the most susceptible to dating violence. Also, according to the CDC, one in ten teens will be physically abused between seventh and twelfth grade. Because of this abuse, victims are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, employ precarious sexual conduct, develop eating disorders, and attempt suicide.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The above numbers are notable in their magnitude and in their discrepancy, indicating that at some point between birth and high school a huge number of males are learning that it is useful and acceptable to abuse their dating partners in some way. The reciprocal of males learning violent behaviors is that women are not learning this fact and are instead learning through our culture and through violence directed at them that they are to be submissive. Males learning violent behaviors coupled with females thinking it normative creates a cycle of women being abused, learning to accept it and imparting this idea to their children and repeating the process. According to a study conducted by Susan M. Sanders she found that many adolescents do not always view aggressive behavior as violent or abusive and roughly 77.6% young girls agreed that after a physical altercation such as being kicked by their partner that they would cease to date them. The study conducted demonstrated that many adolescents, primarily females were more susceptible to leave only after a physical altercation took place. With these studies it was found that once a physical altercation took place the victim  would then view it as abusive and eventually desire to leave the relationship.&lt;ref&gt; Susan, M. S.(2003) Teen Dating Violence: The Invisible Peril. New York. Peter Lang Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent dating violence is a subject which must be understood in order for true equality between the sexes to be achieved and to help stop partner violence in adults before it occurs.

In the United States, the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) states that "[p]olicymakers can play a role in preventing teen dating violence".&lt;ref name=NCSL&gt;{{cite web | title = Teen dating violence | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120609073629/http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/health/teen-dating-violence.aspx | archive-date = 9 June 2012 | url = http://www.ncsl.org/?tabid=17582 | website = ncsl.org | publisher = [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] | date = May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lists those states that currently have laws requiring school boards to develop and adopt programs to address this issue. Further, according to NCSL "[i]n 2011 at least eight states have introduced legislation to address teen dating violence".&lt;ref name=NCSL/&gt; On January 31, 2011, President Obama proclaimed February 2011 to be "National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = President of the United States | author-link = President of the United States | title = Presidential proclamation--National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2011 | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/31/presidential-proclamation-national-teen-dating-violence-awareness-and-pr | website = whitehouse.gov | publisher = [[White House]] | date = 31 January 2011 | access-date = 13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the U.S. first recognized "National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Week", sponsored by Senator [[Mike Crapo]], to "increase public awareness and education of the prevalence of teen dating violence among our nation's teens".&lt;ref name=Crapo&gt;{{cite web | last = Crapo | first = Mike (Sen.) | author-link = Mike Crapo | title = Teen dating violence awareness week | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130219164115/http://www.crapo.senate.gov/issues/teen_dating_violence.cfm | archive-date = 19 February 2013 | url = http://www.crapo.senate.gov/issues/teen_dating_violence.cfm | website = crapo.senate.gov | date = 19 February 2013 | access-date = 13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first week in February was so recognized through 2009. Beginning in 2010, Senator Crapo joined the Department of Justice in recognizing the month of February as Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month.&lt;ref name=Crapo/&gt;

====National helpline and organizations====
The National Dating Abuse Helpline, created by [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]], is a 24-hour nationwide Web-based and telephone resource created to help teens and young people who are experiencing dating abuse. They offer information on building healthy relationships and how to recognize warning signs. It is the only helpline in the country serving all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hingorani | first = Jitin | title = New national teen dating abuse helpline to provide urgent support for teens | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090214073216/http://www.jwi.org/site/c.okLWJ3MPKtH/b.2541101/k.7124/New_National_Teen_Dating_Abuse_Helpline_to_Provide_Urgent_Support_for_Teens.htm | archive-date = 14 February 2009 | url = http://www.jwi.org/site/c.okLWJ3MPKtH/b.2541101/k.7124/New_National_Teen_Dating_Abuse_Helpline_to_Provide_Urgent_Support_for_Teens.htm | website = jwi.org | publisher = Resources, Training &amp; Education: Domestic Violence Newsletters, Jewish Women International | date = March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lead too short|date=September 2016}}

'''Value criticism''' (in German ''Wertkritik'') is a branch of [[post-Marxism]] which criticizes [[Capitalism|capitalistic society]]. Value criticism follows in the traditions of the [[Frankfurt School]] and [[critical theory]] developed under [[Max Horkheimer]]. Prominent adherents of value criticism include [[Robert Kurz (philosopher)|Robert Kurz]], Roswitha Scholz, [[Moishe Postone]] and Jean-Marie Vincent.
==Aspects of value criticism==
Value criticism takes crucial aspects of Marx's critiques of [[commodity fetishism]], commodities and value, while criticizing Marx's theory of [[Class conflict|class struggle]] and [[historical materialism]]. As a result, proponents of Value Criticism feel that the working class is not necessarily a revolutionary subject. Instead, it is pointed out that labor has to be understood as a historic specific entity and that criticizing capitalism implies not only criticizing the distribution process in capitalism, but also the capitalistic production process and the productive powers. From this, they conclude that [[all actually existing socialisms thus far]] have been in essence forms of [[state-led capitalism]], where production still followed capitalistic principles. This interpretation, which rejects the traditional Marxist point of view, is defended in the [[Refusal of work#Manifesto Against Labour|''Manifesto Against Labour'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krisis.org/1999/manifesto-against-labour |title=Manifesto against Labour |publisher=Krisis |date=1999-12-31 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique of value-direction==
In addition to value criticism, a new branch appeared within a circle of theorists led by Roswitha Scholz. The so-called critique of value direction (in German called "Wertabspaltungskritik") includes not only precise descriptions of the "abstract and fetishized character of modern domination",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://platypus1917.org/2013/05/01/marx-and-wertkritik/ |title=Marx and "Wertkritik" : Platypus |publisher=Platypus1917.org |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also seeks to explain why irrational attitudes are delegated to women, while men are counted as relatively rational actors in the capitalistic society.

==Criticism==
Many leftists{{Who|date=February 2014}} claim that books such as [[Schwarzbuch Kapitalismus|''The Black Book of Capitalism'']] neither offers a realistic alternative to capitalistic society nor provide any options for actions to overcome capitalism. Additionally, Gerhard Hanloser and Karl Reitter claim that value criticism is a critique from the standpoint of the circulation sphere which can not be explained from within itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grundrisse.net/grundrisse17/17karl_reitter.htm |title=Das Kapital wieder lesen |publisher=Grundrisse.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Publishers of value criticism in Germany are the ''[[Krisis (German journal)|Krisis]]'' group and [[Exit!]], to both of which Robert Kurz made crucial contributions. Much value critical literature has still to be translated into English. Elmar Flatschart from the University of Vienna is also publishing in English for the Exit! group. Moishe Postone and his work "Time, Labor and Social Domination" is often cited by value critics.

'''Victim mentality''' is an acquired [[personality]] [[trait theory|trait]] in which a person tends to recognize themselves as a victim of the negative actions of others, and to behave as if this were the case in the face of contrary evidence of such circumstances. Victim mentality depends on clear [[thought]] processes and [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]. In most cases, those with a victim mentality have in fact been the victim of wrongdoing by others or have otherwise suffered misfortune through no fault of their own; however, such misfortune does not necessarily imply that one will respond by developing a ''pervasive and universal'' victim mentality where one frequently or constantly perceives oneself to be a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/victim-mentality.htm|title=The Victim Mentality – What It Is &amp; Why You Use It|website=HarleyTherapy.co.uk (Harley Therapy Ltd.- Psychotherapy &amp; Counselling in London)|orig-year=2006|department=Counselling Blog|layurl=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/about-us.htm|date=April 26, 2016|accessdate=August 7, 2018|postscript= → Constantly acting a victim can have perceived benefits: '''(1) Having the 'Right' to Complain (2) Less likely to Receive Criticism (3) More likely to be Granted Requests (4) Avoiding Anger, too Occupied w/ Feeling Sad'''. → People with a victim mentality '''believe they have little other means of achieving Attention, Feelings of Value, &amp; Power'''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used in reference to the tendency for recognizing one's misfortunes on somebody else's misdeeds, which is also referred to as '''victimism'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=Annelie J.|last2=Callan|first2= Mitchell J. |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4103766/|pmc=4103766|title=Getting "Just Deserts" or Seeing the "Silver Lining": The Relation between Judgments of Immanent and Ultimate Justice|date=July 18, 2014|department=Abstract|journal=[[PLOS ONE]] - beta version of PLOS (Public Library of Science) - Scientific Journal|volume=9|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0101803 |accessdate=August 7, 2018|postscript= → Observers engaged in more ultimate justice reasoning for a "good" victim &amp; '''greater immanent justice reasoning for a "bad" victim.'''

Victim mentality is primarily developed, for example, from family members and situations during childhood. Similarly, criminals often engage in victim thinking, believing themselves to be moral and engaging in crime only as a reaction to an immoral world and furthermore feeling that authorities are unfairly singling them out for persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar-Tal|first1=Daniel|last2=Chernyak-Hai|first2=Lily|last3=Schori|first3=Noa|last4=Gundar|first4=Ayelet |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc-874-bartal-chernyakhai-schori-gundar.pdf|format=PDF|title=A sense of self-perceived collective victimhood in intractable conflicts|date=June 2009|department=Sequential stages: the process of victimization; Victim-to-victimizer cycle|journal=[[International Review of the Red Cross]]|volume=91|number=874|pages=234; 256|doi=10.1017/S1816383109990221|accessdate=August 7, 2018|quote=those who '''perceive themselves as a victim attempt to gain social validation by persuading others (family, friends, authorities''', etc.) to recognize that the harm occurred &amp; that they are victims...the sense of '''collective victimhood is related to negative affective consequences of fear, reduced empathy &amp; anger, to cognitive biases such as interpretation of ambiguous information as hostile &amp; threatening, to emergence of the belief that violent action taken is morally justified, to reduced moral accountability &amp; finally to a tendency to seek revenge'''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Foundations ==
In the most general sense, a victim is anyone who experiences injury, loss, or misfortune as a result of some event or series of events.&lt;ref&gt;K. Aquino and K. Byron, 'Dominating interpersonal behavior and perceived victimization in groups: Evidence for a curvilinear relationship', Journal of Management, Vol. 28, No. 1, 2002, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; This negative experience, however, is insufficient for the emergence of a sense of victimhood. Individuals may identify as a victim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/victim-mentality.htm|title=The Victim Mentality – What It Is &amp; Why You Use It|website=HarleyTherapy.co.uk (Harley Therapy Ltd.- Psychotherapy &amp; Counselling in London)|orig-year=2006|department=Counselling Blog|layurl=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/about-us.htm|date=April 26, 2016|accessdate=August 7, 2018|postscript= → You might be the victim of a crime. In such a case you have every right to feel that things were out of your control, because they were, &amp; any thought that it’s somehow your fault &amp; you are responsible is erroneous thinking. '''A healthy person recognises that beyond random bad occurrences, many things in life happen because of choices they themselves made, &amp; that they have power to choose differently. They understand that when misfortune does happen, it is nothing to do with personal value or 'deserving' or 'not deserving''''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; if they believe that:
* they were harmed;
* they were not the cause of the occurrence of the harmful act;
* they were under no obligation to prevent the harm;
* the harm constituted an injustice in that it violated their rights (if inflicted by a person) and/or in that they possessed qualities (''e.g.'', strength or goodness of character) making them persons whom that harm did not befit;
* they deserve empathy.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Sykes, ''A nation of victims: The decay of the American character,'' St. Martin's Press: New York, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
The desire of empathy is crucial in that the mere experience of a harmful event is not enough for the emergence of the sense of being a victim. In order to have this sense, there is the need to perceive the harm as undeserved, unjust and immoral, an act that could not be prevented by the victim. The need to obtain empathy and understanding can then emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayIssue?jid=IRC&amp;volumeId=91&amp;seriesId=0&amp;issueId=874|title=International Review of the Red Cross: Volume 91 - War victims - Cambridge Core|website=Cambridge Core}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals harbouring a victim mentality would believe that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/victim-mentality.htm|title=The Victim Mentality – What It Is &amp; Why You Use It|website=HarleyTherapy.co.uk (Harley Therapy Ltd.- Psychotherapy &amp; Counselling in London)|orig-year=2006|department=Counselling Blog|layurl=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/about-us.htm|date=April 26, 2016|accessdate=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* their lives are a series of challenges directly aimed at them;
* most aspects of life are negative and beyond their control;
* the challenges in their lives merit them deserving of sympathy;
* as they have little power to change things, little action should be taken to improve their problems. 
In essence, victim mentality is a method of avoiding responsibility and criticism, receiving attention and compassion, and evading feelings of genuine [[anger]].

==Features==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2013}}
A victim mentality may manifest itself in a range of different behaviours or ways of thinking and talking:
* Identifying others as the cause for an undesired situation and denying an personal responsibility for one's own life or circumstances.&lt;ref name="Vries"/&gt;
* Exhibiting heightened attention levels ([[hypervigilance]]) when in the presence of others. 
* Awareness of negative intentions of other people.
* Believing that other people are generally more fortunate.
* Gaining relief from feeling empathy for oneself or receiving empathy from others.

In has been typically characterized by attitudes of [[pessimism]], [[self-pity]], and repressed anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drshirin.com/victimme.htm|title=The Victim Mentality|website=DrShirin.com|department=Articles|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327185951/http://www.drshirin.com:80/victimme.htm|archivedate=March 27, 2007|first=Dr. Kim K.|last=Shirin|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with victim mentality may develop convincing and sophisticated explanations in support of such ideas, which they then use to explain to themselves and others of their situation.

People with victim mentality may also be generally:
* realist, with a general tendency to realistically perceive a situation; yet may lack an awareness and/or curiosity about the root of actual powerlessness in a situation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/inviting-monkey-tea/201801/are-you-ready-stop-feeling-victim|first=Nancy|last=Colier|title=Are You Ready to Stop Feeling Like a Victim?|magazine=Psychology Today|date=January 12, 2018|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* introspective
* likely to display entitlement and selfishness.&lt;ref&gt;
Zitek, E. M., Jordan, A. H., Monin, B., &amp; Leach, F. R. (2010). Victim entitlement to behave selfishly. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 98(2), 245-255.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0017168&lt;/ref&gt;
* defensive: In conversation, reading a negative intention into a neutral question and reacting with a corresponding accusation, hindering the collective solution of problems by recognizing the inherent conflict.
* categorizing: tending to divide people into "good" and "bad" with no gray zone between them.&lt;ref name="Vries"&gt;de Vries M.F.R.K. (2014) Are You a Victim of the Victim Syndrome?. In: Mindful Leadership Coaching. INSEAD Business Press. Palgrave Macmillan, London&lt;/ref&gt;
* unadventurous: generally unwilling to take even small and calculated risks; exaggerating the importance or likelihood of possible negative outcomes.
* exhibiting [[learned helplessness]]: underestimating one's ability or influence in a given situation; feeling powerless.
* [[self-abasing]]: Putting oneself down even further than others are doing.

A victim mentality may be reflected by linguistic markers or habits, such as pretending
* not to be able to do something ("I can't..."),
* not to have choices ("I must...") ("I have no choice..."), or
* epistemological humilty ("I don't know").

==Victims of abuse and manipulation==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
Victims of [[abuse]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] often get trapped into a [[self-image]] of victimisation. The psychological profile of victimisation includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, [[pessimism]], negative thinking, strong feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;Braiker, Harriet B., Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breaking out==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Since victim mentality is primarily a reaction to one's experiences and not inborn, it is possible to change it which may be provoked by an extraordinary situation or crisis. Since recognizing naive and condescending suggestions is a general characteristic feature of victim mentality, a person with victim mentality will generally not respond positively to attempts by another person to wrongly identify the problem and its solution. For this reason, the condition may become chronic.

However, successful identified techniques have included therapeutic teaching methods regarding concepts of [[normative]] [[decision theory]], [[emotional intelligence]], [[cognitive therapy]], and psychological [[locus of control]]. These methods have proven helpful in allowing individuals with a victim mentality mindset to both recognize and release the mindset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danziger|first=Sanford|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/9766a32d3470e98b8b39bb8ea8fdfd4a/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=47765|title=The Educational Benefits of Releasing "Victim Mentality": An Approach from the Fields of Business and Psychology|date=2010|department=Developments|journal=Journal of Developmental Education|volume=34|issue=2|page=43|url-access=subscription|format=PDF|publisher=[[ProQuest]]|location=Boone, North Carolina|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

One may consider collective victimhood in political settings. If the leaders of a country, and the citizens who support them, collectively feel like victims of neighboring countries (e.g. following past border disputes), those leaders may be more likely to advocate violent conflict resolution or suppression of freedom of speech.

Political psychologists Bar-Tal and Chernyak-Hai write that collective victim mentality develops from a progression of self-realization, social recognition, and eventual attempts to maintain victimhood status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar-Tal|first1=Daniel|last2=Chernyak-Hai|first2=Lily|last3=Schori|first3=Noa|last4=Gundar|first4=Ayelet |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc-874-bartal-chernyakhai-schori-gundar.pdf|format=PDF|title=A sense of self-perceived collective victimhood in intractable conflicts|date=June 2009|department=Foundations|journal=[[International Review of the Red Cross]]|volume=91|number=874|pages=233|doi=10.1017/S1816383109990221|accessdate=August 21, 2018|postscript= → Sense of Victimhood has 3 foundations: (1) rooted in a Realization of Harm Experienced either directly or indirectly (2) 'Victim': a social label → result of Social Recognition of an act as illegitimate harm (3) Individuals Perceive Themselves as Victims → often attempt to maintain this status}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international relations '''violent non-state actors''' ('''VNSA''') (also known as '''non-state armed actors''' or '''non-state armed groups''') are individuals and groups that are wholly or partly independent of [[state government]]s and which threaten or use violence to achieve their goals.{{Sfn|Hofmann and Schneckener|2011|p=2-3}}

VNSAs vary widely in their goals, size, and methods. They may include [[Illegal drug trade|narcotics cartels]], popular [[liberation movements]], religious and ideological organizations, [[corporations]] (e.g. [[Private military company|private military contractors]]), self-defence [[militia]], and [[Paramilitary|paramilitary groups]] established by state governments to further their interests.{{Sfn|Hofmann and Schneckener|2011|p=2-3}}{{Sfn|Chatham House|2016|p=8}}

While some VNSAs oppose governments, others are allied to them.{{Sfn|Hofmann and Schneckener|2011|p=2-3}} Some VNSAs are organized as paramilitary groups, adopting methods and structure similar to those of state [[Military|armed forces]]. Others may be informally structured and use violence in other ways, such as kidnapping, using [[improvised explosive device]]s, or [[Security hacker|hacking]] into computer systems.

==Description==
{{See also|Non-state actor}}

[[File:Mara_Salvatrucha_Graffiti.jpg|thumb|upright|[[MS-13]] gang graffiti.]]

Thomas, Kiser, and Casebeer asserted in 2005 that "VNSA play a prominent, often destabilizing role in nearly every humanitarian and political crisis faced by the international community".{{sfn|Thomas|Kiser|Casebeer|2005|p={{page needed|date=October 2012}}}} As a new type of actor in international relations, VNSAs represent a departure from the traditional [[Westphalian sovereignty]] system of states in two ways: by providing an alternative to state governance; and by challenging the state's [[monopoly of violence]].

Phil Williams stated in 2008 that in the 21st century, they "have become a pervasive challenge to nation-states".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep4"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams argues that VNSAs develop out of poor state governance but also contribute to the further undermining of governance by the state. He explains that when weak states are "unable to create or maintain the loyalty and allegiance of their populations", "individuals and groups typically revert to or develop alternative patterns of affiliation".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6" /&gt; This causes the family, tribe, clan or other group to become "the main reference points for political action, often in opposition to the state".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6" /&gt; According to Williams, globalization has "not only... challenged individual state capacity to manage economic affairs, it has also provided facilitators and force multipliers for VNSAs".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Transnational flows of arms, for example, are no longer under the exclusive surveillance of states. Globalization helps VNSAs develop transnational social capital and alliances as well as funding opportunities.&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=6—7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been used in several papers published by the [[US military]].{{sfn|Casebeer|Thomas|2002}}{{sfn|Bartolomei|Casebeer|Thomas|2004}}{{sfn|Thomas|Casebeer|2004}}{{sfn|Shultz|Farah|Lochard|2004|}}

== Types ==
Some common and influential types of VNSAs include:
* Criminal organizations. [[Drug cartel]]s, for example, may carry out assassinations, kidnappings, thefts, extortions; operate protection rackets; and [[wikt:turf war|defend their ''turf'']] from rival groups and the military.
* [[Social movement|People's movements]] or sections of them that have chosen [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] (also known as [[asymmetric warfare]]) to pursue their aims. An example is the [[Naxalite–Maoist insurgency|Naxalite-Maoist insurgency]] in central India.{{Sfn|Economist|2006|p=}}
* [[Private military company|Private military companies]], and corporations that either have their own, or hire, private military services.{{Sfn|Daugaard|2012|p=}} An example is [[Floating armoury|floating armouries]] in the Indian Ocean.{{Sfn|Holtom and Chapsos|2015|p=}}
* Religious or ideological groups, such as [[Boko Haram]] in and around Nigeria, that espouse armed violence as a moral or sacred duty.{{Sfn|Drake|1998|p=}}{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=30-31}}
* Citizen militia, which may form to protect a locality from (or threaten it with) attack, such as the [[Anti-balaka|anti-balaka movement]] in the Central African Republic.{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2016b|p=4}}
* [[Paramilitary]] groups, which make use of military methods and structures to pursue their agenda, such as the now-decommissioned Irish Republican Army.
* [[Warlord]]s, who are leaders using armed violence to exercise military, economic, and political control over territory within a sovereign state. Warlords have a long history in Afghanistan, for example.{{Sfn|Coll|2004|p=4}}
Phil Williams, in an overview article, identifies five types of VNSAs:&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep9-16"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=9—16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Warlord]]s
* [[Militia]]s
* [[Insurgency|Insurgencies]]
* [[List of designated terrorist organizations|Terrorist organizations]]
* [[Criminal organization]]s and gangs

== Relationship to terrorism ==
There is no commonly accepted [[Definitions of terrorism|definition of "terrorism"]],{{Sfn|Emmerson|2016|p=10-11}}{{Sfn|Halibozek et al|2008|p=4-5}}{{Sfn|Williamson|2009|p=38}} and the term is frequently used as a political tactic to denounce opponents whose status as [[Terrorism|terrorists]] is disputed.{{Sfn|Sinclair and Antonius|2012|p=14}} An attempt at a global definition appears in the working draft of Comprehensive Convention Against International Terrorism, which defines terrorism as a type of act, rather than as a type of group.{{Sfn|UN General Assembly|2005|p=8-9}} Specifically, "terrorism" in the draft refers to the threatened or actual intentional injury to others, and serious damage to property resulting in major economic loss:{{quote|when the purpose of the conduct, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.{{Sfn|UN General Assembly|2005|p=8-9}}}}

Since the definition encompasses the actions of some violent non-state actors (and of some state actors) and not others, disagreements remain and the treaty has yet to be agreed, {{as of|lc=yes|2015}}.{{Sfn|European Parliament|2015|p=}} For example, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] has called for acts of terrorism to be distinguished from:{{quote|the legitimate struggle of peoples under foreign occupation and colonial or alien domination in the exercise of their right to [[self-determination]] in accordance with the principles of [[international law]]".{{Sfn|European Parliament|2015|p=}}}}

== Use of children ==

{{See also|Children in the military|Child soldiers in Africa|Impact of war on children}}

Violent non-state actors have drawn international condemnation for relying heavily on children under the age of 18 as combatants, scouts, porters, spies, informants, and in other roles{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2016a|p=}}{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=}} (although many state armed forces also recruit children).{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2012|p=}} In 2017, for example, the United Nations identified 14 countries where children were widely used by armed groups: Afghanistan, Colombia, [[Child soldiers in the Central African Republic|Central African Republic]], [[Child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]], Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, The Philippines, [[Child soldiers in Somalia|Somalia]], South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Not all armed groups use children, and approximately 60 that used to do so have entered agreements to reduce or end the practice since 1999.{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2016a|p=4}} For example, by 2017 the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) in the [[Philippines]] had released nearly 2,000 children from its ranks,{{Sfn|UNICEF|2017|p=}} and the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC-EP]] guerilla movement in Colombia agreed in 2016 to stop recruiting children.{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=41}} In other situations, the use of children was increasing in 2017, particularly in Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria and Syria, where Islamist militants and groups opposing them intensified efforts to recruit children.{{Sfn|Human Rights Watch|2016|p=}}{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=}}

==Humanitarian engagement==

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] propose that engagement with VNSAs, which they call armed non-state actors, is essential to humanitarian efforts in conflicts. They claim that it is often necessary to do so to facilitate access to those affected and to provide humanitarian assistance.{{sfn|Jackson|2012}} However, humanitarian agencies often fail to engage strategically with VNSAs. This tendency has strengthened since the end of the Cold War, partly because of the strong discouragement of humanitarian engagement with VNSAs in counterterrorism legislation and donor funding restrictions. In their opinion, further study is necessary to identify ways in which humanitarian agencies can develop productive dialogue with VNSAs.{{sfn|Jackson|2012}}

The International Security Department and the International Law Programme at Chatham House are seeking to understand the dynamics that will determine support for a principle-based approach to engagement by humanitarian actors with VNSAs.{{sfn|''Chatham House''}}

[[File:ComputerHotline - Papaver rhoeas--25-juil-5 (by).jpg|thumb|White poppy&lt;br&gt;(''[[Arctomecon merriamii]]'')]]

The '''white poppy''' is a flower used as a symbol of [[pacifism]], worn either in place of or in addition to the red [[remembrance poppy]] for [[Remembrance Day]] or [[Anzac Day]].

== History ==
In 1926, a few years after the introduction of the red poppy in the UK, the idea of [[pacifist]]s making their own poppies was put forward by a member of the [[No More War Movement]] (as well as the proposal that the black centre of the [[The Royal British Legion|British Legion's]] red poppies should be imprinted with "No More War").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/04/the-great-poppy-war-how-did-we-get-here|title=The great 'poppy war': how did we get here?|last=Usborne|first=Simon|date=4 November 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their intention was to remember casualties of all wars, with the added meaning of a hope for the end of all wars; the red poppy signified only the [[British military]] dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/whitepoppy/index.html|title=White Poppies for Peace|website=www.ppu.org.uk|language=en|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they did not pursue the idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first white poppies were sold by the [[Co-operative Women's Guild]] in 1933&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1502478/British-Legion-reaches-a-truce-with-the-white-poppy-movement.html|title=British Legion reaches a truce with the white poppy movement|last=Iggulden|first=By Amy|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=19 July 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU) took part in their distribution from 1936, and white poppy wreaths were laid from 1937 as a pledge to peace that war must not happen again&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-big-question-why-are-we-asked-to-wear-a-poppy-and-is-its-significance-being-lost-1807573.html|title=The Big Question: Why are we asked to wear a poppy, and is its|work=The Independent|access-date=19 July 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Anti-war organisations such as the [[Anglican Pacifist Fellowship]] now support the White Poppy Movement.

Those who promote the wearing of white poppies argue that the red poppy also conveys a specific political standpoint, and point to the divisive nature of the red poppy in [[Northern Ireland]], where it is worn mainly by [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] but boycotted by [[Irish republican]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John Montgomery, quoted in the ''Irish News'', 10 November 1986, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales of white poppies steadily rose throughout the 2010s, often causing supporters of the PPU to become targets of abuse. On 1 November 2018 sales of white poppies were higher than in any previous year since white poppies were founded in 1933. As of 7 November 2018, 119,555 white poppies had been sold. The final figure was 122,385. The previous record was 110,000 white poppies in 2015. Until 2014, the record was around 80,000 in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenews.coop/133716/sector/community/white-poppies-sales-highest-level-ever/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ppu.org.uk/news/white-poppy-sales-break-all-records | title=White poppy sales break all records &amp;#124; Peace Pledge Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, St John Ambulance allowed its volunteers to wear the white poppy for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/15/st-john-ambulance-volunteers-white-poppy-red-poppy-remembrance-day | title=St John Ambulance to let volunteers wear white remembrance poppy| newspaper=The Guardian| date=15 October 2018| last1=Correspondent| first1=Robert Booth Social Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's author [[Michael Morpurgo]] described his decision to wear a white poppy alongside his red one in a ''Radio Times'' article:
"Wearing the red poppy for me is not simply a ritual, not worn as a politically correct nod towards public expectation. It is in honour of them, in respect and in gratitude for all they did for us. But I wear a white poppy alongside my red one, because I know they fought and so many died for my peace, our peace. And I wear both side by side because I believe the nature of remembrance is changing, and will change, as the decades pass since those two world wars."

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, a ''White Poppy Annual Appeal'' has been run since 2009 by Peace Movement Aotearoa in the week preceding [[Anzac Day]], with all proceeds going to ''White Poppy [[peace studies|Peace Scholarships]]''.&lt;ref name="scoop"&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0904/S00238.htm 2009 White Poppy Annual Appeal] on [[scoop.co.nz]], retrieved 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was controversial for some, with Veterans' Affairs Minister Judith Collins claiming the white poppy appeal was "incredibly disrespectful to those who served their country".&lt;ref name="stuff"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3603373/Rival-poppy-campaign-angers-veterans |title=Rival poppy campaign angers veterans |author=Hank Schouten and Paul Easton |date=21 April 2010 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White poppies have also been worn in New Zealand to mark [[Remembrance Day]]. In previous years, the annual white poppy appeal was run as a fundraiser for the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] around the time of [[Hiroshima Day]] in August. Responsibility for organising the annual appeal was transferred to Peace Movement Aotearoa, as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in New Zealand closed down in 2008.&lt;ref name="scoop"/&gt;

The [[Royal British Legion]] has no official opinion on the wearing of white poppies, stating that it "is a matter of choice, the Legion doesn't have a problem whether you wear a red one or a white one, both or none at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/red-white-or-none-at-all-the-great-poppy-debate-6230165.html|title=Red, white, or none at all?

Some groups such as Northern Irish nationalists though still see the red poppy as primarily remembering the British dead and not those who were victims in wars against the British, hence the belief that the red poppy is a political symbol.&lt;ref&gt; Breen, Paul (2016).

In 1986, [[John Baker (bishop)|John Baker]], Bishop of Salisbury, stated in his diocesan newsletter that he had been asked about the appropriateness of the white poppy.

'''World Conference on Women, 1975''' was held between 19 June and 2 July 1975 in Mexico City, Mexico. It was the first international conference held by the United Nations to focus solely on women's issues and marked a turning point in policy directives. After this meeting, women were viewed as part of the process to develop and implement policy, rather than recipients of assistance. The conference was one of the events established for [[International Women's Year]] and led to the creation of both the United Nations Decade for Women and follow-up conferences to evaluate the progress that had been made in eliminating discrimination against women and their equality. Two documents were adopted from the conference proceedings, the [[World Plan of Action]] which had specific targets for nations to implement for women's improvement and the [[Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace]], which discussed how nations foreign policy actions impacted women. It also led to the establishment of the [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] to track improvements and continuing issues and the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] to provide funding for developmental programs. The conference marked the first time that the parallel Tribune meeting was successful in submitting input to the official meeting and became a catalyst for women's groups to form throughout the world.

==History==
The World Conference on Women occurred in the 1970s amid the [[Cold War]] when geopolitical conflict was controlled based on the interests of the United States or the USSR in various regions throughout the world, polarizing the world into two camps and their respective fields of influence.{{sfn|Cascio|Pellegrini|Segura i Mas|2014|p=93}} At a time when the United States had just withdrawn from [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]],{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=6}} forty-eight separate conflicts would rock Asia in such places as [[1973 Afghan coup d'état|Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh]], [[Cambodian coup of 1970|Cambodia]], [[New Order (Indonesia)|Indonesia]], [[Laotian Civil War|Laos]], [[Communist insurgency in Myanmar|Myanmar]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Pakistan]], [[1977 anti-Tamil pogrom|Sri Lanka]].{{sfn|Cascio|Pellegrini|Segura i Mas|2014|pp=94–95}} African wars during the end of [[decolonization]] in the 1970s turned toward long-lasting [[civil wars]] in [[Angolan Civil War|Angola]], [[Ogaden War|Ethiopia-Somali]], [[Mozambique]] and other African nations, with the superpowers manipulating the conflicts in the background with troops and arms.{{sfn|Cascio|Pellegrini|Segura i Mas|2014|pp=92–96}} [[Decolonization]] of the Caribbean saw twelve states gain their independence between 1962 and 1983, but simultaneously remain marginalized by pressures from world powers which continued to manipulate local concerns.{{sfn|Bégot|Buleon|Shurmer-Smith|2012}}{{sfn|Bourbonnais|2016|p=175}} Two significant Middle East conflicts occurred in [[Six-Day War|1967]] and [[Yom Kippur War|1973]] with the US backing its Arab allies and Israel, while the USSR backed [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] regimes.{{sfn|Cascio|Pellegrini|Segura i Mas|2014|pp=92–93}} In [[Central America|Central]] and South America various [[coups d'état]]s in [[1976 Argentine coup d'état|Argentina]], [[History of Bolivia (1964–82)#The Banzer regime|Bolivia]], [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|Chile]], [[History of Ecuador (1960–1990)#Velasco (1967 - 72)|Ecuador]], [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador]] and dictatorships led to instability and decimation of indigenous populations.{{sfn|Cascio|Pellegrini|Segura i Mas|2014|p=93}}

Responses to the conflict often had additional repercussions, such as the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 Oil embargo]], a response to the Arab-Israeli conflict, which caused the price of oil to rise on the world market from three dollars per barrel to twelve dollars per barrel.{{sfn|Frum|2008|p=318}} The embargo was followed by the [[1979 energy crisis]], sparked by concerns over lowered production caused by the [[Iranian Revolution]] and how continued instability might impact oil availability. That in turn led to a build up of reserves, during which time the price of oil doubled and forced the world to look at alternative sources of oil.{{sfn|Graefe|2013}}{{sfn|Macalister|2011}} Adding to the conflicts of the time were racial inequalities, ranging from [[Apartheid]] and [[Zionism]] to [[Paternalism]].{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=524}}

Work had long been ongoing by the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] (CSW) to adopt a declaration to eliminate discrimination against women. By 1965, it was believed that enough support had been garnered to obtain passage of a declaration to secure women's human rights. Collating responses covering education, employment, inheritance, penal reform, and other issues, from government actors, NGO representatives and UN staff, CSW delegates began drafting a declaration. On 7 November 1967, the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women]] (DEDAW), was passed by the General Assembly.{{sfn| Fraser|1999|pp=891–892}} In 1972, the [[United States Congress]] passed [[Title IX]], eliminating discrimination in education for any institution receiving federal funding. That same year, CSW proposed that DEDAW become a legally binding [[Treaty|Convention]]. To that end, the United Nations proclaimed 1975 as [[International Women's Year]] and the CSW set about the tasks to prepare the "machinery" necessary to secure passage. [[Helvi Sipilä]], was selected as the Assistant Secretary General for Social Development and Humanitarian affairs and placed in charge of organizing events.{{sfn| Fraser|1999|pp=893–894}} Added significance of the date was that the conference would take place on the thirtieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=123}}

===Official conference===
When the United Nations designated 1975 as [[International Women's Year]], no conference was planned as part of the celebrations because delegates on opposing sides of the [[Cold War]] could not agree to authorize one.{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} Initially proposed by the Romanian delegate of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|UN Commission on the Status of Women]], communist women joined to [[filibuster]] the project,{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=5}} instead proposing a women's congress in [[East Berlin]], which had nothing to do with the United Nations.{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} As a counter, the US proposed a gender neutral conference to be held in [[Bogotá]], Colombia to promote equality for men and women, because the presence of men would legitimize the conference.{{sfn|Teltsch|1974}} When Mexico City agreed to host the conference, [[Princess Ashraf]] of Iran began collecting funds,{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} and each side mobilized to shape the agenda. The US position advocated for political rights and elimination of discrimination through legal remedies. The Soviet camp advocated for women to be empowered so that they could use their natural abilities as nurturers to stem violence and inequality which created poverty and injustice.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=4}}

Though {{ill|Pedro Ojeda Paullada|es}}, the Mexican Attorney General, was appointed head of the conference, the majority, 113 of the 133 delegation leaders were women.{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=443}}{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=42}} The conference was a governmental meeting, not a meeting of women, and as such the high percentage of women marked the first time that 73% of the delegates for a UN conference were women, even if the 27% participation by men was higher than the number of women typical at such conferences.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=42}} The nature of the conference also dictated that all delegates, as representatives of their governments would follow the ideological agendas of their governments, rather than act upon any private convictions.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=5}} Among the prominent delegates, which many feminists felt were chosen for ideological reasons or ties to prominent male politicians, were [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]], Prime Minister of [[Sri Lanka]];{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=124}} [[Anna Louise Beer]], chair of the [[Norwegian National Women's Council]]; [[Vilma Espín|Vilma Espín de Castro]], sister-in-law to the Cuban president; [[Francoise Giroud]], [[Ministry of Women's Affairs (France)|French Minister of Women's Affairs]];{{sfn|''The Ames Daily Tribune''|1975|p=6}} [[Imelda Marcos]], [[First Lady of the Philippines]]; [[Ashraf Pahlavi]], twin sister of Iran's shah;{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=526}} [[Leah Rabin]], [[First Lady of Israel]];{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=448}} [[Elizabeth Anne Reid]] of Australia;{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=527}} [[Silvana Maria Rota]], [[Argentina|Argentine]] congresswoman;{{sfn|''The Ames Daily Tribune''|1975|p=6}} [[Jehan Sadat]], [[First Lady of Egypt]];{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=265}} Soviet [[Cosmonaut]] [[Valentina Tereshkova]], the first woman in space; [[Vida Tomšič]], [[Yugoslavia]]n representative of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]];{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=534}} [[Khunying Suparb Visessurakarn]], vice president of [[Thailand]]'s National Council on Social Welfare;{{sfn|Klemesrud|1975|p=7}} but not [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Betty Ford]], as the US administration feared linking the threat of [[anti-capitalist]] sentiment with women's issues.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=5}}

After opening remarks by [[Kurt Waldheim]], President [[Luis Echeverría]] of Mexico spoke, stating that women, in their role as mothers, were allies of the oppressed and that "no woman was more discriminated against or exploited than the woman without bread, school or medicines for her children". Setting the stage, Echeverría's comments mirrored the position that the nurturing nature of women could help to solve the worlds' crises, if marginalization were eliminated.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|pp=123–124}} It was agreed that the themes of equality, development and peace were the primary focus of action, as they were international in nature and required simultaneous action by global components.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=131}} In general discussion it was recognized that to achieve equality and attain the fundamental human rights and freedoms expressed in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the inferior status of women had to be addressed to bring about parity in civic, economic, legal, social and political spheres.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=132}} Recognizing that legal changes alone could not ensure equality, the general discussion agreed that developmental programs made available to both urban and rural women must include women in all decision-making levels, from planning to implementation and analysis, and must provide adequate training. The discussion also recognized the need to monitor advances in women's progress as well a societal change in attitudes toward women via national institutions.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|pp=135–137}} In efforts toward peace, the discussion recognized women's contributions to developing friendly international relationships and pressing for disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament. Increased participation by women in international and regional problem-solving summits, was discussed as a way to maintain peace and security.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=139}} 
 
The first committee, under the chair [[Jeanne Martin Cissé]] of [[Guinea]], with vice-chairs, [[Gladys Freire de Addiego]] of [[Uruguay]], {{ill|Jaroslav Havelka|cs}} of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Nilima Ibrahim]] of [[Bangladesh]] and [[Rapporteur]] John Bruce Campbell of Australia{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=140}} discussed the World Plan of Action. The plan, which had previously been drafted by a diverse range of UN committees, established a broad range of targets, considering that national developments were in varying stages, to be accomplished over the next decade (1975–1985).{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=141}}{{sfn|Fraser|1975|p=7}} In addition to adopting the overall plan as revised by subcommittees, the first committee evaluating six draft resolutions, which dealt with research and training, international cooperation, women's status, the role of the UN in implementation of the Plan, women's health, and participation of women in future meetings of the UN. All were accepted with either no or minimal modification. The ''Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace'', was also reviewed by the committee and the draft accepted with minimal or no modification.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|pp=151–152}} Some radical feminists, uninterested in reviewing a plan already prepared by UN committees tried to take over a US embassy meeting and yet another group walked out of the conference when Leah Rabin spoke.{{sfn|Fraser|1975|p=7}}

The second committee, under the chair Shapour Rassekh of Iran, with vice-chairs, [[Edmonde Dever]] of [[Belgium]], [[Annie Jiagge]] of [[Ghana]] and [[Anna Papp]] of [[Hungary]] and Rapporteur {{ill|Phyllis MacPherson-Russell|de}} of [[Jamaica]]{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=153}} evaluated current trends and obstacles in the roles of men and women to achieving parity in rights, opportunities, and responsibilities; and how women could be integrated into developmental programs.  They discussed passage of the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) as a critical step in the process. Recognizing the wide gap between the ''[[de jure]]'' and ''de facto'' status of women, the committee noted that to achieve equality changes would need to be made in a broad spectrum of areas including: education, employment opportunity, family, integration into existent systems, and the law.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|pp=155–160}} Fifty-eight draft resolutions had been submitted for the committee to review, which covered these areas and they divided them into working groups to reduce duplications.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=163}} Winnowing down the drafts to twenty-one items which were accepted with modifications, the major areas concerned communications media, education and training, employment, exploitation of women and girls, family health, family planning, family security (including the elderly and disabled), financial assistance, integration to development, political and social participation, and systems to gather, collate and evaluate data on women's status.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|pp=163–165}} The committee evaluated seven other drafts having to do with expanding the role of women in peace initiatives and nation rebuilding, and adopted each of them with little or no modification.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=166}}

===Tribune===
The International Women's Year Tribune was a parallel conference scheduled by women to be held simultaneously with the official conference. The format allowed for non-governmental organizations (NGO) to meet and discuss the issues tabled at the official conference, but gave them no authority to take any action.{{sfn|Women's World Conferences|2008}}{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=444}} There were around 6,000 delegates who attended the Tribune,{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=5}} organized by [[Mildred Persinger]] the UN's [[YWCA]] observer,{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} including such women as [[Domitila Chúngara|Domitila Barrios de Chungara]], head of the Siglo XX Miners' Union Housewives Committee of [[Bolivia]];{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=261}} [[Nancy Cárdenas]], Mexican lesbian activist;{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=529}} [[Jacqui Ceballos]], former president of the New York chapter of [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW);{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=450}} [[Thelma Daily]] of the [[Coalition of Labor Union Women]] (CLUW); [[Carole DeSaram]], president of the New York NOW{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=447}} [[Betty Friedan]], founder of NOW;{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=529}} [[Ronnie Feit]] of the [[National Women's Political Caucus]]; [[Dorothy Haene]] of the [[United Auto Workers]]; [[Dorothy Height]] of the [[National Council of Negro Women]];{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=447}} [[Pat Keppler]] of the [[Harvard Divinity School]];{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=451}} [[Esperanza Brito de Martí|Esperanza Martí]], director of ''[[Fem (magazine)|Fem]]'' magazine and a Mexican feminist;{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=460}} [[Jan Peterson]] of CLUW;{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=447}} and [[Margo St. James]], founder of [[COYOTE]].{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=267}} The founders of [[Women's World Banking]] met as part of the tribunal, including  [[Michael Walsh (banker)|Michaela Walsh]], a program associate at the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]], who met [[Ela Bhatt|Ela R.

The Tribune was held on the opposite side of Mexico City, creating a physical as well as philosophical separation of the two groups.{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=525}} The difference in format stemmed from position that the delegates participated in discussions on official policy; whereas, the NGO tribunal women dealt with means and methods of program implementation to improve women's educational opportunities, equality, economic position and collaboration.{{sfn|Pauley|1975|p=12}} The Tribune hosted thirty-six planned meetings and nearly two hundred spontaneously organized additional sessions covering a wide variety of topics from [[Economic development|development]], [[Female education|education]], [[Population health|health]], human rights, [[peace]] and [[Women in the workforce|work]] to [[birth control]], [[Violence against women|gender violence]], lesbianism, prostitution, racism and [[sexism]].{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=525}} The dynamics of this conference were different from the official UN session because the participants were not governmental representatives, and delegates were free to discuss items openly avoided by the officials.{{sfn|Fraser|1975|p=17}} But the free discussion also made apparent the divide separating the women. [[Western world|Westernized]] women focused on [[individual freedom]], Socialist women focused on the state's obligation to enforce the [[Collectivism|collective rights]] of all members of a society,{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|pp=526, 535}} and those from countries not aligned to either of these views pointed to the need for development, economic empowerment, food security{{sfn|''The Piqua Daily Call''|1975|p=3}} and correction of the structural problems in systems.{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=268}}

Women from developing nations pointed out issues such as how aid from industrialized nations was often harmful, as it displaced women practicing subsistence agriculture with technology. Without adequate training to utilize technology, women who had been the prevalent food producers no longer had means to support their families. If they were utilized by new industry, women tended to be exploited as a cheap labor source, as laws for equal pay were non-existent in many developing economies.{{sfn|''The News Herald''|1975|p=4}} In light of these survival issues, the demands of others asking for [[sexual and reproductive health and rights]] seemed frivolous and indicative of self-indulgence.{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=263}} Socialist women felt that equality could only come with a transformation of [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] relationships, which recognized the contributions of all members of society and denounced exploitation and discrimination on any basis.{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=535}} Amid the wide range of views, there were performances aimed at capturing media attention, with some attendees wearing [[Folk costume|national costumes]] and others wearing business attire, as well as rhetoric pitting ideologies against each other to gain a spotlight.{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=265}}{{sfn|Bonfiglioli|2016|p=529}} At one point, frustrated that they could not be part of the official dialogue, a group of radical feminists planned to stage a march through the streets of Mexico City. Instead, a group of fifteen delegates was chosen who presented amendments to Helvi Sipilä requesting that they be given to the official committees. It was the first time that a Tribune had ever been successful in presenting their input to the officials. The amendments the Tribune proposed included establishment of a UN office to monitor success of the Plan, issue annual progress reports, and investigate human rights abuse against women. They also asked for the UN to improve their internal hiring policies so that more women were not only hired, but promoted to management and executive positions.{{sfn|Brady|1975|p=26}}

==Outcomes==
The conference adopted the official [[World Plan of Action]], as well as the [[Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace]], which was an indictment of the foreign policies that pushed [[military intervention|military]] or corporatist [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]] to coerce developing nations from determining their own path. The Declaration passed with a vote of eighty-nine in favor, three against, and eighteen nations abstaining.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=6}} The Plan established minimum targets to be attained within the next five years to secure for women the equal access of the mechanisms to attaining equality and eliminating discrimination; to full participation in development and their integration in extant systems; and to their contributions toward world peace and non-aggression. To reach these goals, the conference made education, employment, family planning, health and nutrition, and housing key focal points. The Tribune played a uniting role, by bringing together people of diverse cultures and backgrounds to formulate the means to overcome differences in objective and create pathways for NGOs to participate in the policy-making process. The conference not only encouraged member countries to develop policies which would lead to the improvement of women's lives, but led to the establishment of the United Nations Decade for Women as a means to focus those policies, as well as establishing a series of conferences to follow-up. The first of these would be the [[World Conference on Women, 1980|Second World Conference on Women]] to be held in [[Copenhagen]]. To assist in advancing women's development with research, operations support and training, the UN created the [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] (INSTRAW) and the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM).{{sfn|Women's World Conferences|2008}}{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=43}}

For the first time, institutional collection within the UN evaluated the extent of problems and conditions of women in varying nations, specifically separating data by sex to bring to light the level of inequality and discrimination towards women.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=43}} It was also one of the first international meetings of organized lesbians from multiple countries and cultures.{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=5}} Attitudes within the member nations and the UN itself began to change as a result of the focus on women brought about by the conference.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=45}} Another benefit of the conference was that it connected women to other women in their struggles. Though in many ways the conference was not as effective in poor and undeveloped countries, because enforcement of the principals established and communication with women was harder in the developing world,{{sfn|Martin|2015}} there was a surge in women's activists coming together across the globe, as well as governmental understanding of the needs of their constituent women.{{sfn|Maier|Lebon|2010|pp=21, 143}}{{sfn|Fraser|2013}}

[[File:Everest Peace Project - Climbing ladder northcol everest.jpg|thumb|Mountaineers who climb [[Mount Everest]], such as this climber, could be said to have zest, as they have “motivation in challenging situations or tasks”.]]

In [[positive psychology]], '''zest''' is one of the 24 strengths possessed by humanity. As a component of the [[virtue]] of [[courage]], zest is defined as living life with a sense of excitement, anticipation, and energy. Approaching life as an adventure; such that one has “motivation in challenging situations or tasks”. Zest is essentially a concept of courage, and involves acquiring the motivation to complete challenging situations and tasks. Those who have zest exude [[enthusiasm]], excitement and energy while approaching tasks in life. Hence, the concept of zest involves performing tasks wholeheartedly, whilst also being adventurous, vivacious and energetic.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, C. R., &amp; Lopez, S. J. (2007). The Value of Wisdom and Courage. Positive psychology: the scientific and practical explorations of human strengths (p. 241). Thousand Oaks, Calif.: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; It discourages the focus on the negative views of psychology. It embraces a notion that one must observe people that "live well" in order to truly understand positive psychology. (For example, a [[Buddhist]] monk would be a preferred subject of observation compared to a college student.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peterson |first=C. |year=2009 |title=Positive psychology |journal=Reclaiming Children and Youth |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zestful people simply enjoy things more than people low in zestfulness.&lt;ref name="SnyderLopez"&gt;{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=C. R. |last2=Lopez |first2=S. J. |title=Positive Psychology: The Scientific and Practical Explorations of Human Strengths |publisher=Sage |location=California |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zest is a positive trait reflecting a person’s approach to life with anticipation, energy, [[enthusiasm]] and excitement.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/job.584| title = Zest and work| journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior| volume = 30| issue = 2| pages = 161–172| year = 2009| last1 = Peterson | first1 = C. | last2 = Park | first2 = N. | last3 = Hall | first3 = N. | last4 = Seligman | first4 = M. E. P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman]] developed terminology to describe human strengths. They developed a descriptive list of six human virtues (Wisdom and Knowledge, Courage, Humanity, Justice, Temperance, and Transcendence) comprising 24 strengths.  Zest is one of the four strengths that combine to make up the virtue of courage, as defined by this system.&lt;ref name="SnyderLopez" /&gt;

==Measurement==
The '''[[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|VIA-IS]]''' is a self-report questionnaire that assesses the strength with which respondents answer strength-relevant statements about themselves on a 1-5 [[Likert scale]].  The following statements on the VIA-IS are used to measure a persons zest: I look forward to each new day; I cannot wait to get started on a project; I want to fully participate in life, not just view it from the sidelines.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2016}}

As with many other constructs in the relatively new field of Positive Psychology, it is difficult to [[Quantification (science)|quantify]] zest. Other traits like [[socioeconomic status]], which can easily be measured by [[gross income]] per household, or constructs like fear, which can be quantified by changes in [[heart rate]], [[skin conductance]], and [[pupil dilation]], have much more defined and widely accepted methods of measure. However, measurements of Zest are still in the beginning stages of development. How do we measure how energetic one person is compared to another? How do we determine exactly how excited a person is about life? What precisely does it mean to approach life adventurously? These are just a few of the questions that must be answered to most effectively research zest.

Relating to the problem of operationalizing zest, much of the research currently done on this and many of the 24 character strengths are done via self-report. A [[Self report study]] is one in which participants are simply asked to report their own feelings or thoughts. There are many problems in research associated with self-report. The most pertinent one being the validity and reliability of measures as they are completely subjective rather than objective. People can misrepresent themselves or misinterpret the questions posed to them.

Since such data is not the most scientifically convincing body of evidence upon which to rest scientific conclusions, Positive Psychological research is very focused on developing more objective measures for topics such as zest in order to help build a stronger science of [[organizational behavior]].&lt;ref name="WrightQuick2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/job.582| title = The emerging positive agenda in organizations: Greater than a trickle, but not yet a deluge| journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior| volume = 30| issue = 2| pages = 147–159| year = 2009| last1 = Wright | first1 = T.

Zest can be promoted in the [[workplace]] so that workers can have a more positive approach in their life which indirectly can affect their anticipation, excitement, and energy in the workplace. Evidence from a present study that had 9803 employed adults respond to a survey on an internet site, measured zest, orientation to work as a calling, and [[job satisfaction|satisfaction]] to work and life in general. The survey showed that for many of the employees, work was a calling and a satisfaction. Employers can use such information to increase the [[productivity]] of their employees by taking zest into consideration. The study found that professionals had the highest zest, while clerical workers and homemakers were the least zestful. Professionals and homemakers viewed their job as a calling, while clerical workers were the least likely to do so. Clerical workers displayed one of the lowest levels of zest because in most instances they viewed their work as a career, a pedestal in the hopes of acquiring status and power to find a more suitable job for themselves in the future.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt; The results of this study follow trends observed by many other studies as well.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt;

Zest is speculated to be contagious just like many other strengths of character. Zest is obviously connected to, if not equal to group [[morale]] and can be a point of discussion for new studies from a positive organizational perspective with emphasis on zest.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt; Psychologists have learned about two main ways of promoting zest within workers: [[physical fitness]] and health set the tone for zest and it can be sustained through hope and [[optimism]].&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt; Depression is a well-documented enemy of zest, and its toll on productivity and physical health is enormous. The prevention or reduction of depression among workers might pay the additional benefit of increasing their sense that work is a calling.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt;

Zest is also linked to psychological well-being which is crucial in a work organization. For instance, psychological well-being predicts improved [[job performance]], reduced [[absenteeism]] and reduced [[employee turnover]]. These are all benefits that can be explored more critically to make changes in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt;

Increasing zestfulness is highly likely to increase the ability to be habitually happy.&lt;ref&gt;Wilner, J. (2012). Zest, Savoring and Happiness. Psych Central. Retrieved on March 21, 2013, from http://blogs.psychcentral.com/positive-psychology/2012/04/zest-savoring-and-happiness/&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a 2009 study on 228 [[schoolteacher]] in Hong Kong indicated that zest was often associated with positive emotions as well as increased levels of life satisfaction in teachers. It is suggested that cultivating zest in school teachers could help combat teacher [[Occupational burnout|burnout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X09000225|title = The hierarchy of strengths: their relationship with subjective well-being among Chinese teachers in Hong Kong|date = 2009|accessdate = April 1, 2015|journal = Teaching and Teacher Education|last = Chan|first = David W.|doi=10.1016/j.tate.2009.01.010|volume=25|issue = 6|pages=867–875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, zest is said to be one character strength that coincides with healthy working behaviors such as ambition, creativity, persistence and leadership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The good character at work: an initial study on the contribution of character strengths in identifying healthy and unhealthy work-related behavior and experience patterns|date = January 20, 2012|author = Gander|author2 = Proyer|author3 = Ruch|author4 = Wyss|last-author-amp = yes|pmid=22261976|doi=10.1007/s00420-012-0736-x|volume=85|issue=8|journal=Int Arch Occup Environ Health|pages=895–904|url = http://doc.rero.ch/record/312151/files/420_2012_Article_736.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that strengths-based interventions that cultivate zest can help improve work environments (see application for more information).It is also suggested that zest should be cultivated in the workplace in order to increase work satisfaction as well as general life satisfaction. The cultivation of zest may also decrease workplace burnout, which is the loss of productivity and enthusiasm for working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/61871/584_ftp.pdf|title = Zest and Work|date = 2009|accessdate = April 1, 2015|website = Deepblue|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|last = Peterson, Park, Hall, Seligman|first = Christopher, Nansook, Nicholas, Martin E.

==Positive youth development==
Zest, along with gratitude, hope, curiosity and love, are important aspects of positive psychology and key to positive character development. The adequate promotion of these characteristics not only in domestic life but also in schools and other educational environments is extremely important to positive youth development. Furthermore, through promotion of character strengths such as zest children tend to experience fewer psychological problems such as depression and anxiety disorders. In fact, research shows that zest, along with hope and leadership, is associated with fewer issues with anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-4611-4_2#page-1|title = VIA Character Strengths: Research and Practice (The first 10 Years)|date = July 10, 2012|accessdate = April 6, 2015|website = springer.com|publisher = springer|author = Knoop|author2 = Niemic|last-author-amp = yes|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-4611-4_2|pages=11–29|isbn = 9789400746107 9789400746114}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the cultivation of zest can serve as a buffer against mental illness.

Youths with high levels of zest also tend to excel academically and lead happier, brighter lives. More emphasis needs to be placed on positive developing characteristics such as zest, gratitude, hope, curiosity and love in schooling environments and live in general so that youth successfully and positively develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Nansook|title=Building Strengths of Character: Keys to Positive Youth Development|journal=Reclaiming Children and Youth|year=2009|volume=18|issue=2|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life satisfaction and Zest ==
Zest has been found to be linked to higher levels of [[life satisfaction]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Testing Strengths-Based Interventions: A preliminary study on the effectiveness of a program targeting curiosity, gratitude, hope, humor, and zest for enhancing life satisfaction.|journal = Journal of Happiness Studies|date = March 16, 2012|author1 = Proyer|author2 = Ruch|author3 = Buschor|last-author-amp = yes|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9331-9|volume=14|pages=275–292|citeseerx = 10.1.1.474.7083}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226476882|title = Character Strengths and Well Being: Are There Gender Differences?|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.academia.edu/1038647|title = Strengths of Character and Well Being|issue = 5|pages = 603–619|date = 2004|accessdate = April 6, 2015|journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume = 23|author1 = Park|author2 = Peterson|author3 = Seligman|last-author-amp = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; among adults as well as youths.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Character Strengths: Research and Practice|journal = Journal of College and Character|date = April 4, 2009|author = Park|author2 = Peterson|last-author-amp = yes|doi=10.2202/1940-1639.1042|volume=10|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that certain character strengths, including zest as well as [[curiosity]], [[gratitude]], hope, and [[humor]] are highly [[correlation|correlated]] with life satisfaction, whereas others strengths demonstrate low correlations with life satisfaction (appreciation of beauty and excellence, [[creativity]], kindness, love of learning and perspective) &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is suggested that zest is associated with higher life satisfaction because it is associated with living in the "here and now," which is also associated with life satisfaction. Furthermore, it is difficult to imagine zestful people who are often unhappy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Demographics ==
Certain character strengths, including zest, have been found to be more common among youths than adults. This possibly reflects the influence of social and cognitive maturation and certain needs during different developmental periods &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In yet another study that reaffirmed the idea that zest was one of the VIA character strengths that had a strong link to life satisfaction, another trend in zest was discovered. This study indicated slight gender differences in levels of zest. For women, life satisfaction was predicted by zest, gratitude, hope, appreciation of beauty and love, whereas men's life satisfaction was predicted by creativity, perspective, fairness and humor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These findings go along with gender stereotypes and suggest that life satisfaction comes when one lives according to the strengths especially valued in one's culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Zest and mental state ==
There is evidence on the VIA-Youth subscale&lt;ref&gt;https://www.viacharacter.org/www/Portals/0/VIA%20Supplement-%20Using%20Youth%20Survey%20with%20Children%20with%20Intellectual%20Disabilities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.viacharacter.org/www/Research/Psychometric-Data-VIA-Youth-Survey | title=VIA Youth Survey Character Psychometric Data: VIA Character}}&lt;/ref&gt; that zest is correlated with higher levels of [[neuroticism]] as well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Levels of zest have been found to be linked with [[post-traumatic growth]], meaning that levels of zest increased with each traumatic event. This suggest that people may be more [[Psychological resilience|resilient]] than existing theories state, given the correlation between traumatic events and increases in character strengths such as zest &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/58571/20332_ftp.pdf|title = Strengths of Character and Posttraumatic Growth|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
There are a few working ways to help individuals cultivate zest:

One method to cultivate zest is acting "as if,' which involves living a "faith-based" rather than an "evidenced-based" life. This means believing in things that there may not be much evidence for or proof of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.positive-living-now.com/increase-your-happiness-add-some-zest-to-your-life/|title = Increase your happiness: add some zest to your life|date = Jan 18, 2013|accessdate = April 7, 2015|website = Positive-Living-Now|publisher = Positive-Living-Now|last = Minarik|first = Susan K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, adopting strong body language may help, as well as "faking it until you make it" meaning acting as though one has an increased enthusiasm for life (more zest) until that increased enthusiasm is a reality (thus, an increase in zest is a reality) .

Another 2012 study demonstrated that groups that trained strengths (worked to cultivate these strengths) which are highly correlated with life satisfaction (including zest), had significant improvements in self-reported life satisfaction post-test (after training those strengths).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zest can be an important characteristic to cultivate life satisfaction, thereby acting as a potential buffer against mental illness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
