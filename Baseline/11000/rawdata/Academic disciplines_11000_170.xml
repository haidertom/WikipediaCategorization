      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9843">In the field of [[artificial intelligence]], the most difficult problems are informally known as '''AI-complete''' or '''AI-hard''', implying that the difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problem—making computers as intelligent as people, or [[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]].&lt;ref name="Shapiro92"&gt;Shapiro, Stuart C. (1992). [http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf Artificial Intelligence] In Stuart C. Shapiro (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence'' (Second Edition, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–57). New York: John Wiley. (Section 4 is on "AI-Complete Tasks".)&lt;/ref&gt;  To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple specific algorithm.  

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include [[computer vision]], [[natural language understanding]], and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem.&lt;ref&gt;Roman V. Yampolskiy. Turing Test as a Defining Feature of AI-Completeness . In Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Computation and Metaheuristics (AIECM) --In the footsteps of Alan Turing. Xin-She Yang (Ed.). pp. 3-17. (Chapter 1). Springer, London. 2013. http://cecs.louisville.edu/ry/TuringTestasaDefiningFeature04270003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, AI-complete problems cannot be solved with modern computer technology alone, but would also require [[human computation]].  This property can be useful, for instance to test for the presence of humans as with [[CAPTCHA]]s, and for [[computer security]] to circumvent [[brute-force attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas Hopper, and John Langford. [http://www.captcha.net/captcha_crypt.pdf CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001102/http://www.captcha.net/captcha_crypt.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}. In Proceedings of Eurocrypt, Vol. 2656 (2003), pp. 294-311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Richard | last = Bergmair | title = Natural Language Steganography and an "AI-complete" Security Primitive | citeseerx = 10.1.1.105.129 | date = January 7, 2006 }} (unpublished?)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was coined by [[Fanya Montalvo]] by analogy with [[NP-complete]] and [[NP-hard]] in [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], which formally describes the most famous class of difficult problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Mallery | first=John C.  |year=1988 | url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/mallery88thinking.html | contribution=Thinking About Foreign Policy: Finding an Appropriate Role for Artificially Intelligent Computers | title=The 1988 Annual Meeting of the International Studies Association. | location=St. Louis, MO }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early uses of the term are in Erik Mueller's 1987 Ph.D. dissertation&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Erik T. (1987, March). [ftp://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/tech-report/198_-reports/870017.pdf ''Daydreaming and Computation'' (Technical Report CSD-870017)] Ph.D. dissertation, University of California, Los Angeles. ("Daydreaming is but one more ''AI-complete'' problem: if we could solve any one artificial intelligence problem, we could solve all the others", p.&amp;nbsp;302)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Eric S. Raymond|Eric Raymond]]'s 1991 [[Jargon File]].&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Eric S. (1991, March 22). [http://catb.org/esr/jargon/oldversions/jarg282.txt Jargon File Version 2.8.1] (Definition of "AI-complete" first added to jargon file.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==AI-complete problems==
AI-complete problems are hypothesized to include:
*[https://www.wired.com/2017/02/ai-can-solve-peer-review-ai-can-solve-anything/ AI peer review] (composite [[natural language understanding]], [[automated reasoning]], [[automated theorem proving]], [[Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)|formalized]] [[logic]] [[expert system]])
*[[Bongard problems]]
*[[Computer vision]] (and subproblems such as [[object recognition]])
*[[Natural language understanding]] (and subproblems such as [[text mining]], [[machine translation]], and [[word sense disambiguation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ide |first=N. |last2=Veronis |first2=J. |year=1998 |title=Introduction to the special issue on word sense disambiguation: the state of the art |journal=Computational Linguistics |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=2–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem, whether it's [[robotic mapping|navigation]] or [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] or even the kind of [[reasoning]] done by [[expert system]]s.

===Machine translation===
{{main|Machine translation}}

To translate accurately, a machine must be able to understand the text. It must be able to follow the author's argument, so it must have some ability to [[artificial intelligence#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]. It must have extensive [[commonsense knowledge|world knowledge]] so that it knows what is being discussed — it must at least be familiar with all the same commonsense facts that the average human translator knows. Some of this knowledge is in the form of facts that can be explicitly represented, but some knowledge is unconscious and closely tied to the human body: for example, the machine may need to understand how an ocean makes one ''feel'' to accurately translate a specific metaphor in the text. It must also model the authors' goals, intentions, and emotional states to accurately reproduce them in a new language. In short, the machine is required to have wide variety of human intellectual skills, including [[artificial intelligence#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]], [[commonsense knowledge]] and the intuitions that underlie [[robotics|motion and manipulation]], [[machine perception|perception]], and [[artificial intelligence#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]. [[Machine translation]], therefore, is believed to be AI-complete: it may require strong AI to be done as well as humans can do it.

==Software brittleness==
{{main|Software brittleness}}
Current AI systems can solve very simple and/or restricted versions of AI-complete problems, but never in their full generality. When AI researchers attempt to "scale up" their systems to handle more complicated, real world situations, the programs tend to become excessively [[brittle (software)|brittle]] without [[commonsense knowledge]] or a rudimentary understanding of the situation: they fail as unexpected circumstances outside of its original problem context begin to appear.  When human beings are dealing with new situations in the world, they are helped immensely by the fact that they know what to expect: they know what all things around them are, why they are there, what they are likely to do and so on. They can recognize unusual situations and adjust accordingly. A machine without strong AI has no other skills to fall back on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lenat | first=Douglas |  last2=Guha | first2=R. V.| year = 1989 | title = Building Large Knowledge-Based Systems | publisher = Addison-Wesley| author-link=Douglas Lenat|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formalization==
[[Computational complexity theory]] deals with the relative computational difficulty of [[computable function]]s.  By definition it does not cover problems whose solution is unknown or has not been characterised formally.  Since many AI problems have no formalisation yet, conventional complexity theory does not allow the definition of AI-completeness.

To address this problem, a complexity theory for AI has been proposed.&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"&gt;Dafna Shahaf and Eyal Amir (2007) [http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2007/SS-07-05/SS07-05-026.pdf Towards a theory of AI completeness]. [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/commonsense07 Commonsense 2007,  8th International Symposium on Logical Formalizations of Commonsense Reasoning].&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on a [[model of computation]] that splits the computational burden between a computer and a human: one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by human.  This is formalised by a '''human-assisted [[Turing machine]]'''.  The formalisation defines algorithm complexity, problem complexity and reducibility which in turn allows [[equivalence class]]es to be defined.

The complexity of executing an algorithm with a human-assisted Turing machine is given by a pair &lt;math&gt;\langle\Phi_{H},\Phi_{M}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where the first element represents the complexity of the human's part and the second element is the complexity of the machine's part.

===Results===
The complexity of solving the following problems with a human-assisted Turing machine is:&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"/&gt;

* [[Optical character recognition]] for printed text: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(1), poly(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Turing test]]:
** for an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sentence conversation where the oracle remembers the conversation history (persistent oracle): &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
** for an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sentence conversation where the conversation history must be retransmitted: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n^2) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
** for an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sentence conversation where the conversation history must be retransmitted and the person takes linear time to read the query: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n^2), O(n^2) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* [[ESP game]]: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* Image labelling (based on the [[Arthur–Merlin protocol]]): &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Object categorization from image search|Image classification]]: human only: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, and with less reliance on the human: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(\log n), O(n \log n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Ancient Monuments Society''' (AMS) is a [[learned society]] and [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]] in England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|209605}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1924 "for the study and conservation of ancient monuments, historic buildings and fine old craftsmanship".

==National Amenity Societies==
The Ancient Monuments Society is recognised as one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], and as such is informed of any application for listed building consent in England and Wales involving any element of demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015 |publisher=www.gov.uk |date=24 March 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such it plays an important part in shaping the historic environment in England and Wales.

==Partnership with Friends of Friendless Churches==
The Ancient Monuments Society works in partnership with the [[Friends of Friendless Churches]], sharing an office and staff and operating a joint membership scheme. The co-operation came about because Friends of Friendless Churches was set up by [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas]], who was also Secretary and later Chairman of the Ancient Monuments Society.

==Publications==
The AMS publishes three newsletters and a volume of ''Transactions'' (scholarly articles on a range of architectural historic topics) annually for its 2,100 members.

The '''arabesque''' is a form of artistic decoration consisting of "surface decorations based on rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, tendrils" or plain lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fleming, John |author2=Honour, Hugh |title=Dictionary of the Decorative Arts |year=1977 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-670-82047-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; often combined with other elements. Another definition is "Foliate ornament, used in the Islamic world, typically using leaves, derived from stylised [[half-palmette]]s, which were combined with spiralling stems".&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 236&lt;/ref&gt;  It usually consists of a single design which can be '[[tessellation|tiled]]' or seamlessly repeated as many times as desired.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, Francis |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-66993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the very wide range of [[Eurasia]]n decorative art that includes [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s matching this basic definition, the term "arabesque" is used consistently as a technical term by [[history of art|art historians]] to describe only elements of the decoration found in two phases: [[Islamic art]] from about the 9th century onwards, and European decorative art from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. [[Interlace (art)|Interlace]] and [[Scroll (art)|scroll]] decoration are terms used for most other types of similar patterns.

Arabesques are a fundamental element of Islamic art but they develop what was already a long tradition by the coming of Islam. The past and current usage of the term in respect of European art can only be described as confused and inconsistent. Some Western arabesques derive from Islamic art, but others are closely based on [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] decorations. In the West they are essentially found in the [[decorative arts]], but because of the generally non-figurative nature of Islamic art, arabesque decoration is there often a very prominent element in the most significant works, and plays a large part in the decoration of [[Islamic architecture|architecture]].

Claims are often made regarding the theological significance of the arabesque, and its origin in a specifically Islamic view of the world; however these are without support from written historical sources as, like most medieval cultures, the Islamic world has not left us documentation of their intentions in using the decorative motifs they did.  At the popular level such theories often appear uninformed as to the wider context of the arabesque.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 74-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In similar fashion, proposed connections between the arabesque and Arabic knowledge of [[geometry]] remains a subject of debate; not all art historians are persuaded that such knowledge had reached, or was needed by, those creating arabesque designs, although in certain cases there is evidence that such a connection did exist.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 88&lt;/ref&gt;  The case for a connection with [[Islamic mathematics]] is much stronger for the development of the [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] with which arabesques are often combined in art.  Geometric decoration often uses patterns that are made up of straight lines and regular angles that somewhat resemble curvilinear arabesque patterns; the extent to which these too are described as arabesque varies between different writers.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabesque is a French term that derived from the Italian word Arabesco, and it means Arabic style. 

The development of this and related terms in the main European languages is complicated, and described in "Western arabesque" below.

== Islamic arabesque ==
The arabesque developed out of the long-established traditions of plant-based [[scroll (art)|scroll]] ornament in the cultures taken over by the early [[Islamic conquests]].  Early Islamic art, for example in the famous 8th century [[mosaic]]s of the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque of Damascus]], often contained plant-scroll patterns, in that case by Byzantine artists in their usual style.  The plants most often used are stylized versions of the [[Acanthus mollis|acanthus]], with its emphasis on leafy forms, and the vine, with an equal emphasis on twining stems.  The evolution of these forms into a distinctive Islamic type was complete by the 11th century, having begun in the 8th or 9th century in works like the [[Mshatta Facade]]. In the process of development the plant forms became increasing simplified and stylized.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 75-88; Canby, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  The relatively abundant survivals of [[stucco]] [[relief]]s from the walls of palaces (but not mosques) in [[Abbasid Samarra]], the Islamic capital between 836 and 892, provide examples of three styles, Styles A, B, and C, though more than one of these may appear on the same wall, and their chronological sequence is not certain.&lt;ref&gt;Necipoğlu, Gülru, Payne, Alina, ''Histories of Ornament: From Global to Local'', 88-90, 2016, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0691167281}}, 978069116728, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9nACCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88 google books]; [https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/museums/mik/miksamarra.html "Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin: Objects from Samarra"]; Ettinghausen et al, 57-59; examples of styles A,B, and C illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Though the broad outline of the process is generally agreed, there is a considerable  diversity of views held by specialist scholars on detailed issues concerning the development, categorization and meaning of the arabesque.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa's Chapter 4 gives an overview of these questions.&lt;/ref&gt;  The detailed study of Islamic arabesque forms was begun by [[Alois Riegl]] in his [[formalism (art)|formalist]] study ''[[Stilfragen|Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik]]'' (''Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament'') of 1893, who in the process developed his influential concept of the ''Kunstwollen''.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;  Riegl traced formalistic continuity and development in decorative plant forms from [[ancient Egyptian art]] and other ancient Near Eastern civilizations through the classical world to the Islamic arabesque.  While the ''Kunstwollen'' has few followers today, his basic analysis of the development of forms has been confirmed and refined by the wider ''corpus'' of examples known today.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 24-25; see also [http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-8220-Style-8221-151-or-whatever-4745 "“Style”—or whatever", J. Duncan Berry], A review of ''Problems of Style'' by Alois Riegl, ''[[The New Criterion]]'', April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Rawson]] has recently extended the analysis to cover [[Chinese art]], which Riegl did not cover, tracing many elements of Chinese decoration back to the same tradition; the shared background helping to make the assimilation of Chinese motifs into Persian art after the [[History of Iran#Mongol invasion .281219.E2.80.931221.29|Mongol invasion]] harmonious and productive.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, the subject of her book, see Preface, and Chapter 5 on Chinese influences on Persian art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many arabesque patterns disappear at (or "under" as it often appears to a viewer) a framing edge without ending, and thus can be regarded as infinitely extendable outside the space they actually occupy; this was certainly a distinctive feature of the Islamic form, though not without precedent.  Most but not all foliage decoration in the preceding cultures terminated at the edge of the occupied space, although infinitely repeatable patterns in foliage are very common in the modern world in [[wallpaper]] and [[textile]]s.

Typically, in earlier forms there is no attempt at realism; no particular species of plant is being imitated, and the forms are often botanically impossible or implausible. "Leaf" forms typically spring sideways from the stem, in what is often called a "half-[[palmette]]" form, named after its distant and very different looking ancestor in ancient Egyptian and Greek ornament.  New stems spring from leaf-tips, a type often called [[honeysuckle]], and the stems often have no tips, winding endlessly out of the space.  The early [[Mshatta Facade]] is recognisably some sort of vine, with conventional leaves on the end of short stalks and bunches of grapes or berries, but later forms usually lack these.  Flowers are rare until about 1500, after which they appear more often, especially in Ottoman art, and are often identifiable by species.  In Ottoman art the large and feathery leaves called ''saz'' became very popular, and were elaborated in drawings showing just one or more large leaves.  Eventually floral decoration mostly derived from Chinese styles, especially those of [[Chinese porcelain]], replaces the arabesque in many types of work, such as pottery, textiles and miniatures.

=== Significance in Islam ===

[[File:Alhambra (038).jpg|thumb|upright|Three modes: Arabesques, [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] and [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]] used together in the [[Court of the Myrtles]], [[Alhambra]].]]

The arabesques and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] of Islamic art are often said to arise from the [[Islam]]ic view of the world (see above). The [[Aniconism in Islam|depiction of animals and people is generally discouraged]], which explains the preference for abstract geometric patterns.

There are two modes to arabesque art. The first recalls the principles that govern the order of the world. These principles include the bare basics of what makes objects structurally sound and, by extension, beautiful (i.e. the angle and the fixed/static shapes that it creates—esp. the [[truss]]). In the first mode, each repeating geometric form has a built-in symbolism ascribed to it. For example, the square, with its four [[equilateral]] sides, is symbolic of the equally important elements of nature: [[soil|earth]], [[air]], [[fire]] and [[water]]. Without any one of the four, the physical world, represented by a circle that inscribes the square, would collapse upon itself and cease to exist. The second mode is based upon the flowing nature of [[plant]] forms. This mode recalls the [[female|feminine]] nature of life giving. In addition, upon inspection of the many examples of Arabesque art, some would argue that there is in fact a third mode, the mode of [[Islamic calligraphy]].

Instead of recalling something related to the 'True Reality' (the reality of the spiritual world), Islam considers [[calligraphy]] a visible expression of the highest art of all; the art of the spoken word (the transmittal of thoughts and of history). In Islam, the most important document to be transmitted orally is the [[Qur'an]]. [[Proverb]]s and complete passages from the Qur'an can be seen today in Arabesque art. The coming together of these three forms creates the Arabesque, and this is a reflection of unity arising from diversity; a basic tenet of Islam.

The arabesque may be equally thought of as both [[art]] and [[science]]. The artwork is at the same time [[mathematical]]ly precise, aesthetically pleasing, and symbolic. Due to this duality of creation, the artistic part of this equation may be further subdivided into both [[secular]] and [[religious]] artwork. However, for many Muslims there is no distinction; all forms of art, the natural world, mathematics and science are seen to be creations of God and therefore reflections of the same thing: God's will expressed through his creation. In other words, man can discover the geometric forms that constitute the arabesque, but these forms always existed before as part of God's creation, as shown in this picture.

There is great similarity between arabesque artwork from very different geographic regions.&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=David |title=The Evolution of Style |url=http://patterninislamicart.com/background-notes/the-evolution-of-style |website=Pattern in Islamic Art |accessdate=19 December 2015 |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the similarities are so pronounced that it is sometimes difficult for experts to tell where a given style of arabesque comes from. The reason for this is that the science and mathematics that are used to construct Arabesque artwork are universal. Therefore, for most Muslims, the best artwork that can be created by man for use in the [[Mosque]] is artwork that displays the underlying order and unity of nature. The order and unity of the material world, they believe, is a mere [[ghost]]ly approximation of the [[spirit]]ual world, which for many Muslims is the place where the only true reality exists. Discovered geometric forms, therefore, exemplify this perfect reality because God's creation has been obscured by the [[sin]]s of man.

Mistakes in repetitions may be intentionally introduced as a show of humility by artists who believe only Allah can produce perfection, although this theory is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Textile Art: Anomalies in Kilims |author=Thompson, Muhammad |author2=Begum, Nasima |url=http://www.turkotek.com/salon_00101/salon.html |work=Salon du Tapis d'Orient |publisher=TurkoTek |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The future of art in a digital age: from Hellenistic to Hebraic consciousness |last=Alexenberg |first=Melvin L. |year=2006 |publisher=Intellect Ltd |isbn=1-84150-136-0 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Only God is Perfect |url=http://www.geometricdesign.co.uk/perfect.htm |work=Islamic and Geometric Art |author=Backhouse, Tim |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Arabesque art consists of a series of repeating geometric forms which are occasionally accompanied by [[calligraphy]]. Ettinghausen et al. describe the arabesque as a "vegetal design consisting of full...and half [[palmette]]s [as] an unending continuous pattern...in which each leaf grows out of the tip of another."&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen et al, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; To the adherents of [[Islam]], the Arabesque is symbolic of their united faith and the way in which traditional Islamic cultures view the world.

==Western arabesque==
[[File:Tapis de Savonnerie Louis XIV apres Charles Le Brun pour la Grande Galerie du Louvre.jpg|thumb|The French sense of arabesque: [[Savonnerie]] carpet after [[Charles Le Brun]] for the ''Grande Galerie'' of the [[Louvre]].]]
[[File:Царское-село,-Екатерининский-дворец.jpg|thumb|What is called the "Arabesque Room" in the [[Catherine Palace]], with [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[grotesque]] decoration.|221x221px]]
The term arabesque was first used in the West in [[Italian language|Italian]], where ''rabeschi'' was used in the 16th century as a term for "[[pilaster]] ornaments featuring [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] decoration",&lt;ref name="Osborne, 34"&gt;Osborne, 34&lt;/ref&gt; specifically "running scrolls" that ran vertically up a panel or pilaster, rather than horizontally along a [[frieze]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 159&lt;/ref&gt;  The book ''Opera nuova che insegna a le donne a cuscire … laqual e intitolata Esempio di raccammi'' (A New Work that Teaches Women how to Sew … Entitled "Samples of Embroidery"), published in Venice in 1530, includes "groppi moreschi e rabeschi", Moorish knots and arabesques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/35.75.3 Met Museum]; the Italian word uses the Latin derived "inceptive" or "inchoative" word ending "-esco" signifying a beginning, thus ''ferveo'', to boil and ''fervesco'' to begin to boil.&lt;/ref&gt;

From there it spread to England, where [[Henry VIII]] owned, in an inventory of 1549, an [[agate]] cup with a "fote and Couer of siluer and guilt enbossed with Rebeske worke",&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Arabesque":"1549 Inventory Henry VIII (1998) 25/2 Item one Cuppe of Agathe the fote and Couer of siluer and guilt enbossed with Rebeske worke";&lt;/ref&gt; and William Herne or Heron, [[Serjeant Painter]] from 1572 to 1580, was paid for painting Elizabeth I's barge with "rebeske work".&lt;ref&gt;"rebeske" being a now disused version of "arabesque", see OED, "Rebesk". Herne payment quoted in [[Erna Auerbach]], ''Tudor Artists'', 1954; not in print OED&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately the styles so described can only be guessed at, although the design by [[Hans Holbein the younger|Hans Holbein]] for a covered cup for [[Jane Seymour]] in 1536 (see gallery) already has zones in both Islamic-derived arabesque/moresque style (see below) and classically derived [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus volutes]].&lt;ref name=marks&gt;Marks, Richard and Williamson, Paul, eds. ''Gothic: Art for England 1400-1547'', 156, 2003, V&amp;A Publications, London, {{ISBN|1-85177-401-7}}.  For other Renaissance ornament from Henry's court, see also no 13 on page 156, and pp. 144-145, 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related term is [[moresque]], meaning "[[Moors|Moorish]]"; [[Randle Cotgrave]]'s ''A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues'' of 1611 defines this as: "a rude or anticke painting, or carving, wherin the feet and tayles of beasts, &amp;c, are intermingled with, or made to resemble, a kind of wild leaves, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;OED, "Moresque", citing Cotgrave&lt;/ref&gt; and "arabesque", in its earliest use cited in the [[OED]] (but as a French word), as "Rebeske work; a small and curious flourishing".&lt;ref name="OED, Arabesque"&gt;OED, "Arabesque"&lt;/ref&gt;  In France "arabesque" first appears in 1546,&lt;ref&gt;Larrouse dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and "was first applied in the latter part of the 17th century" to [[grotesque]] ornament, "despite the classical origin of the latter", especially if without human figures in it - a distinction still often made, but not consistently observed,&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 34 (quoted), see also [[OED]] quoted below and Cotgrave - Osborne says the French usage begins in the "latter part of the 17th century" but in the following paragraphs describes a development beginning rather before this.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following centuries the three terms grotesque, moresque and arabesque were used largely interchangeably in English, French and German for styles of decoration derived at least as much from the European past as the Islamic world, with "grotesque" gradually acquiring its main modern meaning, related more to Gothic [[gargoyle]]s and [[caricature]] than to either [[Pompeii]]-style Roman painting or Islamic patterns.  Meanwhile, the word "arabesque" was now being applied to Islamic art itself, by 1851 at the latest, when [[John Ruskin]] uses it in ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'', [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/sov/1.html chapter 1, para 26]&lt;/ref&gt;  Writers over the last decades have attempted to salvage meaningful distinctions between the words from the confused wreckage of historical sources.

Peter Fuhring, a specialist in the history of ornament, says that (also in a French context): &lt;blockquote&gt;The ornament known as moresque in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (but now more commonly called arabesque) is characterized by bifurcated scrolls composed of branches forming interlaced foliage patterns.  These basic motifs gave rise to numerous variants, for example, where the branches, generally of a linear character, were turned into straps or bands. ... It is characteristic of the moresque, which is essentially a surface ornament, that it is impossible to locate the pattern's beginning or end. ... Originating in the Middle East, they were introduced to continental Europe via Italy and Spain ... Italian examples of this ornament, which was often used for bookbindings and embroidery, are known from as early as the late fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fuhring notes that grotesques were "confusingly called arabesques in eighteenth century France", but in his terminology "the major types of ornament that appear in French sixteenth century etchings and engraving... can be divided into two groups. The first includes ornaments adopted from antiquity: grotesques, architectural ornaments such as the orders, foliage scrolls and self-contained elements such as trophies, terms and vases. A second group, far smaller than the first, comprises modern ornaments: moresques, interlaced bands, strapwork, and elements such as cartouches...", categories he goes on to discuss individually.&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 155-156&lt;/ref&gt;

The moresque or arabesque style was especially popular and long-lived in the Western arts of the book: [[bookbinding]]s decorated in gold tooling, borders for illustrations, and printer's ornaments for decorating empty spaces on the page. In this field the technique of gold tooling had also arrived in the 15th century from the Islamic world, and indeed much of the leather itself was imported from there.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Small motifs in this style have continued to be used by conservative book designers up to the present day.

According to Harold Osborne, in France, the "characteristic development of the French arabesque combined bandwork deriving from the moresque with decorative acanthus foliage radiating from C-scrolls connected by short bars".&lt;ref name="Osborne, 34"/&gt; Apparently starting in [[embroidery]], it then appears in garden design before being used in [[Northern Mannerist]] painted decorative schemes "with a central medallion combined with acanthus and other forms" by [[Simon Vouet]] and then [[Charles Lebrun]] who used "scrolls of flat bandwork joined by horizontal bars and contrasting with ancanthus scrolls and [[palmette]]."&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; More exuberant arabesque designs by [[Jean Bérain the Elder]] are an early "intimation" of the [[Rococo]], which was to take the arabesque into three dimensions in reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "arabesque" as an English noun first appears, in relation to painting, in [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s novel ''[[Vathek]]'' in 1786.&lt;ref name="OED, Arabesque"/&gt;
Arabesque is also used as a term for complex freehand pen flourishes in drawing or other graphic media. The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art]]'' will have none of this confusion, and says flatly: "Over the centuries the word has been applied to a wide variety of winding and twining vegetal decoration in art and meandering themes in music, but it properly applies only to Islamic art",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Art Online]], "Arabesque", accessed March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; so contradicting the definition of 1888 still found in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "A species of mural or surface decoration in colour or low relief, composed in flowing lines of branches, leaves, and scroll-work fancifully intertwined. Also fig[uratively]. As used in Moorish and Arabic decorative art (from which, almost exclusively, it was known in the Middle Ages), representations of living creatures were excluded; but in the arabesques of [[Raphael]], founded on the ancient Græco-Roman work of this kind, and in those of Renaissance decoration, human and animal figures, both natural and grotesque, as well as vases, armour, and objects of art, are freely introduced; to this the term is now usually applied, the other being distinguished as Moorish Arabesque, or Moresque."&lt;ref&gt;OED, printed and online editions (accessed March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printing==
A major use of the arabesque style has been artistic printing, for example of book covers and page decoration. Repeating geometric patterns worked well with traditional printing, since they could be printed from metal type like letters if the type was placed together; as the designs have no specific connection to the meaning of a text, the type can be reused in many different editions of different works. [[Robert Granjon]], a French printer of the sixteenth century, has been credited with the first truly interlocking arabesque printing, but other printers had used many other kinds of ornaments in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Henry Lewis|title=Decorative ornaments and alphabets of the Renaissance : 1,020 copyright-free motifs from printed sources|date=1991|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=9780486266053}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was rapidly used by many other printers.&lt;ref name="Hoefler Text: Arabesques"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoefler Text: Arabesques|url=http://www.typography.com/fonts/hoefler-text/features/hoefler-text-arabesques-patterns|publisher=Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English printers' ornaments"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plomer|first1=Henry R.|title=English printers' ornaments|date=1924|publisher=Martino Pub.|location=Mansfield Center, CT|isbn=9781578987153|url=https://archive.org/details/englishprinterso00plom|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Historic Design in Printing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Henry Lewis|title=Historic Design in Printing|date=1923|publisher=Graphic Arts Company|location=Boston, MA|url=https://archive.org/details/historicdesignin00john|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of disuse in the nineteenth century, when a more minimal page layout became popular with printers like [[Giambattista Bodoni|Bodoni]] and [[Firmin Didot|Didot]], the concept returned to popularity with the arrival of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], Many fine books from the period 1890-1960 have arabesque decorations, sometimes on paperback covers.&lt;ref name="The craftsman and the critic : defining usefulness and beauty in arts and crafts-era Boston"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Beverly K.|title=The craftsman and the critic : defining usefulness and beauty in arts and crafts-era Boston|date=2009|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|location=Amherst|isbn=9781558496774|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many digital [[serif font]]s include arabesque pattern elements thought to be complementary to the mood of the font; they are also often sold as separate designs.&lt;ref name="Moresque 2D"&gt;{{cite web |title=Moresque 2D |url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/2d-typo/moreske-2d/ |website=MyFonts |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archaeology''', or '''archeology''',&lt;ref name="Society for American Archaeology"/&gt; is the study of human activity through the recovery and [[analysis]] of [[material culture]]. The [[archaeological record]] consists of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[architecture]], [[biofact (archaeology)|biofacts]] or ecofacts and [[cultural landscapes]]. Archaeology can be considered both a [[social science]] and a branch of the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name="Renfrew_Bahn1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Sinclair A | year = 2016 | title = The Intellectual Base of Archaeological Research 2004–2013: a visualisation and analysis of its disciplinary links, networks of authors and conceptual language | journal = Internet Archaeology | volume =  | issue = 42| page =  | doi=10.11141/ia.42.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In North America archaeology is a sub-field of [[anthropology]],&lt;ref name="Haviland_et_al_2005"/&gt; while in Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines.

Archaeologists study human [[prehistory]] and history, from the development of the first [[stone tool]]s at [[Lomekwi]] in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades. Archaeology is distinct from [[palaeontology]], the study of fossil remains. It is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies, for whom there may be no written records to study. Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past, from the [[Paleolithic]] until the advent of literacy in societies across the world.&lt;ref name="Renfrew_Bahn1991"/&gt; Archaeology has various goals, which range from understanding [[culture history]] to reconstructing past [[lifeway]]s to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.livescience.com/44448-what-is-archaeology.html|title=What Is Archaeology? {{!}} Archaeology Definition|work=Live Science|access-date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline involves [[Archaeological survey|surveying]], [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] and eventually [[Post excavation|analysis]] of data collected to learn more about the past. In broad scope, archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research.

Archaeology developed out of [[antiquarianism]] in Europe during the 19th century, and has since become a discipline practiced across the world.

Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Since its early development, various specific sub-disciplines of archaeology have developed, including [[maritime archaeology]], [[feminist archaeology]] and [[archaeoastronomy]], and numerous different scientific techniques have been developed to aid archaeological investigation. Nonetheless, today, archaeologists face many problems, such as dealing with [[pseudoarchaeology]], the looting of artifacts,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://openscience.com/a-special-issue-of-open-archaeology-on-non-professional-metal-detecting/ |title=A Special Issue of Open Archaeology on Non-Professional Metal-Detecting  |first=Pablo |last=Markin |work=[[OpenScience]] |date=10 April 2017 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lack of public interest, and opposition to the excavation of human remains.

===Antiquarians===

The science of archaeology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀρχαιολογία}}, ''archaiologia'' from {{lang|grc|ἀρχαῖος}}, ''arkhaios'', "ancient" and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''-logia'', "[[-logy]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=archaeology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=archaeology|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; grew out of the older multi-disciplinary study known as antiquarianism. Antiquarians studied [[history]] with particular attention to ancient artifacts and manuscripts, as well as historical sites. Antiquarianism focused on the empirical evidence that existed for the understanding of the past, encapsulated in the motto of the 18th-century antiquary, Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]], "We speak from facts not theory". Tentative steps towards the systematization of archaeology as a [[science]] took place during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]] in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/historyofarchaeology/a/history_series.htm|last=Hirst|first=K. Kris|title=The History of Archaeology: How Ancient Relic Hunting Became Science|work=ThoughtCo|date=9 February 2017|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, philosophical interest in the remains of [[Ancient Greece|Greco]]-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilization and the rediscovery of classical culture began in the late [[Middle Age]]. [[Flavio Biondo]], an Italian [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins and [[topography of ancient Rome]] in the early 15th century, for which he has been called an early founder of archaeology. Antiquarians of the 16th century, including [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] and [[William Camden]], conducted surveys of the English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered.

===First excavations===
[[File:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=old photograph of stonehenge with toppled stones|An early photograph of Stonehenge taken July 1877]]
One of the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation was [[Stonehenge]] and other [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]] in England. [[John Aubrey]] (1626–1697) was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous [[megalith]]ic and other [[Ancient monument|field monuments]] in southern England. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning |place=London |publisher=Duckworth |year=1975|isbn=978-0-7156-0818-0|pages=156–57, 162–66, 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations were also carried out in the ancient towns of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], both of which had been covered by ash during the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]]. These excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of [[fresco]]s, had a big impact throughout Europe.

However, prior to the development of modern techniques, excavations tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratification]] and [[Archaeological context|context]] were overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy King]], ''The Elgin Marbles'' (Hutchinson, January 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of archaeological method===
[[File:Both Lozenges.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Artifacts discovered at the 1808 [[Bush Barrow]] excavation by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]] and [[William Cunnington]].]]
The father of archaeological excavation was [[William Cunnington]] (1754–1810). He undertook excavations in [[Wiltshire]] from around 1798,&lt;ref&gt;Everill, P. 2010. The Parkers of Heytesbury: Archaeological pioneers. Antiquaries Journal 90: 441–53&lt;/ref&gt; funded by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]]. Cunnington made meticulous recordings of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[tumulus|barrows]], and the terms he used to categorize and describe them are still used by archaeologists today.&lt;ref&gt;Everill, P. 2009. Invisible Pioneers. British Archaeology 108: 40–43&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major achievements of 19th-century archaeology was the development of [[stratigraphy]]. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new [[geology|geological]] and [[palaeontology|paleontological]] work of scholars like [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]]. The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of [[Prehistory|prehistorical]] and [[Bronze Age]] sites. In the third and fourth decades of the 19th-century, archaeologists like [[Jacques Boucher de Perthes]] and [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen]] began to put the artifacts they had found in chronological order.

A major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]],&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, Mark (1984) ''General Pitt Rivers: The father of scientific archaeology''. [[Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum]]. {{ISBN|0-947535-00-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who began excavations on his land in England in the 1880s. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. He [[Pitt Rivers Museum|arranged his artifacts]] by type or "[[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]], and within types by date or "chronologically". This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that ''all'' artifacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Dan|last=Hicks|year=2013|chapter=Characterizing the World Archaeology Collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum|title=World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum: a characterization|publisher=Archaeopress|location=Oxford|editor1-first=Dan|editor1-last=Hicks|editor2-first=Alice|editor2-last=Stevenson|chapter-url=http://archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/download.asp?id=%7B64476CB8-7963-40E1-B225-F54DA37A2F9A%7D|isbn=9781905739585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Flinders Petrie]] is another man who may legitimately be called the Father of Archaeology. His painstaking recording and study of artifacts, both in Egypt and later in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], laid down many of the ideas behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that "I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details." Petrie developed the [[seriation (archaeology)|system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings]], which revolutionized the chronological basis of [[Egyptology]]. Petrie was the first to scientifically investigate the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in Egypt during the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/profiles/sir-william-flinders-petrie-1853-1942|title= Sir William Flinders Petrie|publisher=Palestine Exploration Fund|year=2000|accessdate=19 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including [[Howard Carter]] who went on to achieve fame with the discovery of the tomb of 14th-century BC pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]].

[[File:Aerial photograph of Maiden Castle from the west, 1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=earthern fort with many walls|[[Mortimer Wheeler]] pioneered [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|systematic excavation]] in the early 20th century. Pictured, are his excavations at [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], in October 1937.]]
The first stratigraphic excavation to reach wide popularity with public was that of [[Hissarlik]], on the site of ancient [[Troy]], carried out by [[Heinrich Schliemann]], [[Frank Calvert]] and [[Wilhelm Dörpfeld]] in the 1870s. These scholars individuated nine different cities that had overlapped with one another, from prehistory to the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=363| title=Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor| first=Kenneth W.| last=Harl| accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the work of Sir [[Arthur Evans]] at [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]] revealed the ancient existence of an equally advanced [[Minoan civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Joseph Alexander|last=MacGillivray|title=Minotaur: Sir Arthur Evans and the Archaeology of the Minoan Myth|location=New York|publisher=Hill and Wang (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major figure in the development of archaeology was Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s and 1930s brought the science on swiftly. Wheeler developed the [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|grid system of excavation]], which was further improved by his student [[Kathleen Kenyon]].

Archaeology became a professional activity in the first half of the 20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools. By the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates. Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in this period, when [[maritime archaeology]] and [[urban archaeology]] became more prevalent and [[rescue archaeology]] was developed as a result of increasing commercial development.&lt;ref name="Renfrew_Bahn1991#5"&gt;Renfrew and Bahn (2004 [1991]:33–35)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:Australopithecus africanus - Cast of taung child.jpg|thumb|Cast of the skull of the [[Taung child]], uncovered in [[South Africa]]. The Child was an infant of the ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' species, an early form of [[hominin]]]]
The purpose of archaeology is to learn more about past societies and the development of the [[human race]]. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within [[prehistory|prehistoric cultures]], who did not make use of [[literacy|writing]], thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5 million years ago when we find the first stone tools – [[Oldowan|The Oldowan Industry]]. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the [[human evolution|evolution of humanity]] during the [[Paleolithic]] period, when the [[hominin]]s developed from the [[australopithecines]] in [[Africa]] and eventually into modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of [[stone tool]]s, the discovery of [[metallurgy]], the beginnings of [[religion]] and the creation of [[agriculture]]. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.&lt;ref name="ncl"/&gt;

However, it is not only prehistoric, pre-literate cultures that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of [[historical archaeology]]. For many literate cultures, such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Mesopotamia]], their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the [[elite]] classes, such as the [[clergy]] or the [[bureaucracy]] of court or temple. The literacy even of [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into [[library|libraries]] and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually a small fraction of the larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own biases, such as [[sampling bias]] and [[differential preservation]].&lt;ref name="archaeological"/&gt;

Often, archaeology provides the only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of which there is little or no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, ''Homo sapiens'' has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of ''Homo'' for millions of years (see [[Human evolution]]). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization – the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities – must come from archaeology.

In addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong aesthetic appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies.

This view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon's Mines. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents ''(see [[Pseudoarchaeology]])''. However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern archaeology.

===Theory===
{{main|Archaeological theory}}
[[File:Archeologists sign at Lubbock Lake Monument IMG 1591.JPG|upright=0.9|right|thumb|alt=Archaeologists dig in the dirt very carefully so they won't miss anything important. |Sign at [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]]]

There is no one approach to archaeological theory that has been adhered to by all archaeologists. When archaeology developed in the late 19th century, the first approach to archaeological theory to be practiced was that of [[cultural-history archaeology]], which held the goal of explaining why cultures changed and adapted rather than just highlighting the fact that they did, therefore emphasizing [[historical particularism]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In the early 20th century, many archaeologists who studied past societies with direct continuing links to existing ones (such as those of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Siberia]]ns, [[Mesoamerica]]ns etc.) followed the [[direct historical approach]], compared the continuity between the past and contemporary ethnic and cultural groups.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In the 1960s, an archaeological movement largely led by American archaeologists like [[Lewis Binford]] and [[Kent Flannery]] arose that rebelled against the established cultural-history archaeology.&lt;ref name="Binford1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flannery1967"/&gt; They proposed a "New Archaeology", which would be more "scientific" and "anthropological", with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as [[processual archaeology]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In the 1980s, a new [[postmodern]] movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]],&lt;ref name="Shanks_Tilley1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanks_Tilley1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanks1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanks1993"/&gt; [[Christopher Tilley]],&lt;ref name="Tilley1993"/&gt; [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]],&lt;ref name="Miller_Tilley1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller_etal1989"/&gt; and [[Ian Hodder]],&lt;ref name="Hodder1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1992"/&gt; which has become known as [[post-processual archaeology]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical theoretical [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate. Meanwhile, another theory, known as [[historical processualism]] has emerged seeking to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual archaeology's emphasis of reflexivity and history.&lt;ref name="Pauketat2001"/&gt;

Archaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-evolutionary thought]],&lt;ref name="Hinshaw2000"/&gt;[[#cite note-Hinshaw2000-35|&lt;span class="mw-reflink-text"&gt;[35]&lt;/span&gt;]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[structural functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[feminist archaeology]], and [[systems theory in archaeology|systems theory]].

==Methods==
[[File:Indusketa arkeologikoa.webm|thumb|Video showing the different works in an archaeological recovery and analysis]]
An archaeological investigation usually involves several distinct phases, each of which employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective as to what the archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is [[Archaeological survey|surveyed]] to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground. And, third, the data collected from the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.&lt;ref name="renfrew"/&gt;

===Remote sensing===
Before actually starting to dig in a location, [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote sensing]] can be used to look where sites are located within a large area or provide more information about sites or regions. There are two types of remote sensing instruments—passive and active. Passive instruments detect natural energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene. Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. [[Satellite imagery]] is an example of passive remote sensing. Here are two active remote sensing instruments:

'''[[Lidar]]''' (Light Detection and Ranging)
A lidar uses a laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) to transmit a light pulse and a receiver with sensitive detectors to measure the backscattered or reflected light. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using the speed of light to calculate the distance travelled. Lidars can determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other constituents of the atmosphere.

'''[[Laser altimeter]]'''
A laser altimeter uses a lidar (see above) to measure the height of the instrument platform above the surface. By independently knowing the height of the platform with respect to the mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined.
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/RemoteSensing/|title=Remote Sensing : Feature Articles|first=Graham|last=Steve|date=17 September 1999|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Field survey===
{{main|Archaeological survey}}
[[File:Monte Albán archeological site, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Alban]] archaeological site]]
The archaeological project then continues (or alternatively, begins) with a [[archaeological survey|field survey]]. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden]]s, within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.

Survey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]],&lt;ref name="Willey1953"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willey1968"/&gt; and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.&lt;ref name="Billmand_Feinman1999"/&gt;

Survey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.)&lt;ref name="Redman1974"/&gt; As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[Human settlement|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map]]s, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.
[[File:Archeoscan excavation site.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inverted kite aerial photo of an excavation of a Roman building at Nesley near Tetbury in Gloucestershire.]]
The simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger (drill)|augers]], [[corer]]s, and [[shovel test]] pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed [[sterile deposit|sterile]].

[[Aerial survey]] is conducted using [[camera]]s attached to [[airplane]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[UAVs]], or even [[Kite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/kite03.htm |title=Kite Aerial Photography |accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document the status of the archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant]]s growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden]]s) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs [[ultraviolet]], [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, [[LiDAR]] and [[thermography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Reeves|first= D.M. |year=1936|title=Aerial photography and archaeology|journal=American Antiquity|volume=2|issue=2|pages= 102–07|doi=10.2307/275881|jstor=275881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|Geophysical survey]] can be the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer]]s detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artifacts, [[kiln]]s, some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.

Although some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector]]s to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sánchez |first=Rosalía |title=Para los arqueólogos es un ladrón, para los buscadores de tesoros un ídolo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2015/02/25/54ee2718ca4741d71a8b457b.html |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=19 December 2017 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to archaeology where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context. In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]].

Regional survey in [[underwater archaeology]] uses geophysical or remote sensing devices such as marine magnetometer, [[side-scan sonar]], or sub-bottom sonar.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hall|first= E.T. |year=1970|title= Survey techniques in underwater archaeology|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

===Excavation===
{{main|Excavation (archaeology)}}
[[File:Iowa archaeology edgewater.JPG|thumb|Excavations at the 3800-year-old [[Edgewater Park Site]], [[Iowa]]]]
[[File:Vill excavation.jpg|thumb|upright|Archaeological excavation that discovered prehistoric caves in [[Vill]] ([[Innsbruck]]), [[Austria]]]]
[[File:Sifting for POW remains, Wake Island.jpg|thumb|right|An archaeologist sifting for [[Prisoner of war|POW]] remains on [[Wake Island]].]]

Archaeological excavation existed even when the field was still the domain of amateurs, and it remains the source of the majority of data recovered in most field projects. It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as [[stratigraphy]], three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.

Modern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Harris matrix#Harris's Laws of Archaeological Stratigraphy|Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Likewise, their [[archaeological association|association]], or [[relationship (archaeology)|relationship]] with nearby objects and [[feature (archaeology)|features]], needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce which [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and features were likely used together and which may be from different [[archaeological phase|phases]] of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.

Excavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research, in relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and "method statement" issued. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey.Sometimes large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), is used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with [[trowel]]s or [[hoe (tool)|hoes]] to ensure that all features are apparent.

The next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the [[Archaeological natural|natural subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the [[Cut (archaeology)|cut]] and the [[Fill (archaeology)|fill]]. The cut describes the edge of the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and [[Single context recording|recording]] sheets are filled in describing the [[Archaeological context|context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.

===Analysis===
{{main|Post-excavation analysis}}

Once artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is known as [[post-excavation analysis]], and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.

At a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them [[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]] and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], and [[palynology]], while any texts can usually be [[Deciphering|deciphered]].

These techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.

[[Computer graphics]] are now used to build virtual [[3D modeling|3D models]] of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome.&lt;ref name="virt"/&gt; [[Photogrammetry]] is also used as an analytical tool, and digital [[topography|topographical]] models have been combined with [[astronomy|astronomical]] calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical events such as the sun's position at a [[solstice]].&lt;ref name=virt/&gt; [[Agent-based modeling]] and [[Computer simulation|simulation]] can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes. [[Data mining]] can be applied to large bodies of archaeological 'grey literature'.

===Drones===

Archaeologists around the world use drones to speed up survey work and protect sites from squatters, builders and miners. In Peru, small drones helped researchers produce three-dimensional models of Peruvian sites instead of the usual flat maps – and in days and weeks instead of months and years.&lt;ref name=peru&gt;{{citation|author=Reuters in Lima |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/25/peru-archaeologists-drones-ancient-ruins |title=Peru's archaeologists turn to drones to help protect and explore ancient ruins &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |date=25 August 2013 |accessdate=27 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825124451/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/25/peru-archaeologists-drones-ancient-ruins|archivedate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drones costing as little as £650 have proven useful. In 2013, drones have flown over at least six Peruvian archaeological sites, including the colonial Andean town Machu Llacta {{convert|4000|m}} above sea level. The drones continue to have altitude problems in the Andes, leading to plans to make a drone [[blimp]], employing open source software.&lt;ref name=peru/&gt;

Jeffrey Quilter, an archaeologist with Harvard University said, "You can go up three metres and photograph a room, 300 metres and photograph a site, or you can go up 3,000 metres and photograph the entire valley."&lt;ref name=peru/&gt;

In September 2014 drones weighing about {{convert|5|kg|0|abbr=on}} were used for 3D mapping of the above-ground ruins of the Greek city of [[Aphrodisias]]. The data is being analysed by the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Hudson|first1=Hal|title=Air-chaeological drones search for ancient treasures|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329883.900-airchaeological-drones-search-for-ancient-treasures.html#.VC1hk_ldV8E|accessdate=2 October 2014|issue=2988|publisher=New Scientist|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic sub-disciplines==
{{Main|Archaeological sub-disciplines}}

As with most [[academia|academic]] disciplines, there are a very large number of [[archaeological sub-disciplines]] characterized by a specific method or type of material (e.g., [[lithic analysis]], [[music (archaeology)|music]], [[archaeobotany]]), geographical or chronological focus (e.g. [[Near Eastern archaeology]], Islamic archaeology, [[Medieval archaeology]]), other thematic concern (e.g. [[maritime archaeology]], [[landscape archaeology]], [[battlefield archaeology]]), or a specific [[archaeological culture]] or [[civilization]] (e.g. [[Egyptology]], [[Indology]], [[Sinology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.saa.org/Default.aspx?TabId=1346|title=What is Archaeology?|last=Archaeology|first=Society for American|website=www.saa.org|language=en-US|access-date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical archaeology===
{{Main|Historical archaeology}}

Historical archaeology is the study of cultures with some form of writing.

In [[England]], archaeologists have uncovered layouts of 14th century medieval villages, abandoned after crises such as the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref name=dyer&gt;{{citation|last1=Dyer|first1=Christopher|title=Deserted Medieval Villages in the West Midlands|volume=35|number=1|date=1982|journal=Economic History Society|jstor=2595101|pp=19–34|doi=10.2307/2595101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In downtown [[New York City]], archaeologists have exhumed the 18th century remains of the [[African Burial Ground National Monument|African Burial Ground]].

===Ethnoarchaeology===
{{Main|Ethnoarchaeology}}

[[Ethnoarchaeology]] is the ethnographic study of living people, designed to aid in our interpretation of the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="Gould1971a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould1971b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yellen1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yellen1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould_Yellen1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yellen1991"/&gt; The approach first gained prominence during the processual movement of the 1960s, and continues to be a vibrant component of post-processual and other current archaeological approaches.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sillet_et_al2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schott_Sillitoe2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ogundele2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kuznar2001"/&gt; Early ethnoarchaeological research focused on [[hunter-gatherer]] or foraging societies; today ethnoarchaeological research encompasses a much wider range of human behaviour.

===Experimental archaeology===
{{Main|Experimental archaeology}}

[[Experimental archaeology]] represents the application of the experimental method to develop more highly controlled observations of processes that create and impact the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="Ascher1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saraydar_Shimada1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saraydar_Shimada1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gifford-Gonzalez_et_al1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frison1989"/&gt; In the context of the logical positivism of processualism with its goals of improving the scientific rigor of archaeological [[epistemological|epistemologies]] the experimental method gained importance. Experimental techniques remain a crucial component to improving the inferential frameworks for interpreting the archaeological record.

===Archaeometry===
{{Main|Archaeological science}}

[[Archaeometry]] aims to systematize archaeological measurement. It emphasizes the application of analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is a field of research that frequently focuses on the definition of the chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis.&lt;ref name="Glasscock_et_al1994"/&gt; Archaeometry also investigates different spatial characteristics of features, employing methods such as space syntax techniques and [[geodesy]] as well as computer-based tools such as [[geographic information system]] technology.&lt;ref name="GIS, critique, representation and beyond"/&gt; [[Rare earth elements]] patterns may also be used.&lt;ref name="An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns"/&gt;  A relatively nascent subfield is that of archaeological materials, designed to enhance understanding of prehistoric and non-industrial culture through scientific analysis of the structure and properties of materials associated with human activity.&lt;ref name="mit"/&gt;

===Cultural resources management===
{{Main|Cultural resources management}}
{{Original research|section|date=March 2014}}

Archaeology can be a subsidiary activity within [[Cultural resources management]] (CRM), also called heritage management in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="The University of Exeter - SoGAER - Department of Archaeology"/&gt; CRM archaeologists frequently examine archaeological sites that are threatened by development. Today, CRM accounts for most of the archaeological research done in the United States and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the US, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA) of 1966, and most taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, the NHPA mandates that projects on federal land or involving federal funds or permits consider the effects of the project on each [[archaeological site]].

The application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990, [[PPG 16]]&lt;ref name="Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and planning - Planning, building and the environment - Communities and Local Government"/&gt; has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organizations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the [[polluter pays principle|developer's expense]].

In England, ultimate responsibility of care for the historic environment rests with the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]&lt;ref name="Department for Culture Media and Sport - historic environment"/&gt; in association with [[English Heritage]].&lt;ref name="English Heritage - Stonehenge &amp; the History of England: English Heritage"/&gt; In [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], the same responsibilities lie with [[Historic Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/ |title= Historic Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090426014641/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/| archivedate= 26 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cadw]]&lt;ref name="Cadw"/&gt; and the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]]&lt;ref name="Built Environment"/&gt; respectively.

In France, the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in archaeology. Their mission is to enhance the objects discovered. The [[curator]] is the link between scientific knowledge, administrative regulations, heritage objects and the public.

Among the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely.

Cultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate [[State Historic Preservation Office]] (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.

The annual ratio of open academic archaeology positions (inclusive of [[postdoctoral|post-doc]], temporary, and non- tenure track appointments) to the annual number of archaeology MA/MSc and PhD students is disproportionate. Cultural Resource Management, once considered an intellectual backwater for individuals with "strong backs and weak minds,"&lt;ref name="Flannery1982"/&gt; has attracted these graduates, and CRM offices are thus increasingly staffed by advance degreed individuals with a track record of producing scholarly articles but who also have extensive CRM field experience.

==Popular views of archaeology==

[[File:Beit shean1.jpg|thumb|right|Extensive excavations at [[Beit She'an]], [[Israel]]]]
[[File:Exhibition in a multi-storey car park on archological discoveries having been made during construction.JPG|thumb|Permanent exhibition in a German [[multi-storey car park]], explaining the archaeological discoveries made during the construction of this building]]

Early archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities. Early archaeology was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This generalization laid the foundation for the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. This generalization has been with western culture for a long time. Another popular thought that dates back to this era is that archaeology is monetarily lucrative. A large majority of the general public is under the impression that excavations are undertaken for money and not historical data.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} It is easy for the general public to hold this notion for that is what is presented to them through general media, and has been for many decades.

The majority of the public view archaeology as being something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a "romantic adventurist occupation".&lt;ref name="McGeough 2006 174–185"&gt;{{Citation|last=McGeough|first=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in the Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|year=2006|volume=69|pages=174–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; To generalize, the public views archaeology as a fantasized hobby more than a job in the scientific community. The audience may not take away scientific methods from popular cinema but they do form a notion of "who archaeologists are, why they do what they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted".&lt;ref name="McGeough 2006 174–185"/&gt; The modern depiction of archaeology is sensationalized so much that it has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is. The public is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts.

Much thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Copán]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the bulk of activities and finds of modern archaeology are not so sensational. Archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern surveys, [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]]. Some archaeologists refer to such off-the-mark portrayals as "[[pseudoarchaeology]]".&lt;ref name="Romancing the Past-Archaeology"/&gt;
Archaeologists are also very much reliant on public support; the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed.&lt;ref name="Denning2004"/&gt;

==Current issues and controversy==

===Public archaeology===
[[File:Dolina-Pano-3.jpg|thumb|upright|Excavations at the site of [[Gran Dolina]], in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]], Spain, 2008]]
Motivated by a desire to halt looting, curb [[#Pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeology]], and to help preserve archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns.&lt;ref name="Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)"/&gt; They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.

One audience for archaeologists' work is the public. They increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility to educate and inform the public about archaeology. Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The U.S.Dept. of Agriculture, [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT). Volunteers work with professional USFS archaeologists and historians on national forests throughout the U.S. Volunteers are involved in all aspects of professional archaeology under expert supervision.&lt;ref name="rapidcityjournal"/&gt;

Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The ''Mardi Gras'' Shipwreck Project&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mardi Gras Shipwreck |url=http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |website=uwf.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516045935/http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |archivedate=16 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; integrated a one-hour HD documentary,&lt;ref name="Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck"&gt;{{citation|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live [[Underwater videography|underwater video]] of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' Shipwreck Project was [[webcast]] to the [[Internet]] as a part of the ''QAR DiveLive''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://digital.ncdcr.gov/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll22/id/695248|title=Live from Morehead City, it's Queen Anne's Revenge :: State Publications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; educational program that reached thousands of children around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=C Southerly |author2=J Gillman-Bryan |title=Diving on the Queen Anne's Revenge |journal=In: SF Norton (ed).

In the UK, popular archaeology programs such as ''[[Time Team]]'' and ''[[Meet the Ancestors]]'' have resulted in a huge upsurge in public interest.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Where possible, archaeologists now make more provisions for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than they once did, and many local archaeological organizations operate within the [[Community archaeology]] framework to expand public involvement in smaller-scale, more local projects. Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Archaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which is one reason why [[Community archaeology]] projects are starting to become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do.

Archaeological Legacy Institute (ALI), is a registered 501[c] [3] non-profit, media and education corporation registered in Oregon in 1999. ALI founded a website, [http://archaeologychannel.org/ The Archaeology Channel] to support the organization's mission "to nurturing and bringing attention to the human cultural heritage, by using media in the most efficient and effective ways possible."&lt;ref name="The Archaeology Channel and About Us: Archaeological Legacy Institute"/&gt;

===Pseudoarchaeology===
{{Main|Pseudoarchaeology}}

[[Pseudoarchaeology]] is an umbrella term for all activities that falsely claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and scientific archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in [[Post-processual archaeology|post-processualism]].

An example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von Däniken]]. His 1968 book, ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilization on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], or [[Ancient astronaut theory]], is not exclusively Däniken's, nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.

===Looting===
[[File:Looting rontoy2007.jpg|thumb|right|A looter's pit on the morning following its excavation, taken at [[Rontoy]], [[Huaura Valley]], [[Peru]] in June 2007. Several small holes left by looters' prospecting probes can be seen, as well as their footprints.]]
[[File:Adad-Nirari stela.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stela]] of a king named [[Adad-nirari I|Adad-Nirari]]. Object stolen from the Iraq National Museum in the looting in connection with the [[Iraq War]] of 2003.]]

[[Looting]] of archaeological sites is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s were looted during [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].&lt;ref name="civilizations" /&gt; Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the [[illicit antiquities]] trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately denying them the opportunity to know their past.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

In 1937, W. F. Hodge the Director of the [[Southwest Museum]] released a statement that the museum would no longer purchase or accept collections from looted contexts.&lt;ref name="Hodge1937" /&gt; The first conviction of the transport of artifacts illegally removed from private property under the [http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA; Public Law 96-95; 93 Statute 721;] {{usc|16|470aamm}}) was in 1992 in the State of Indiana.&lt;ref name="Munson_et_al1995" /&gt;

Archaeologists trying to protect artifacts may be placed in danger by looters or locals trying to protect the artifacts from archaeologists who are viewed as looters by the locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Archaeologist's Execution Highlights Risks to History's Guardians|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/150820-syria-archaeologist-isis-protecting-artifacts/|website=National Geographic News|accessdate=21 August 2015|first=Mark|last=Strauss|date=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descendant peoples===
In the United States, examples such as the case of [[Kennewick Man]] have illustrated the tensions between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and archaeologists, which can be summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.

As a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of [[postprocessualism]], some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.

Archaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.

While this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.

====Repatriation====
:''See [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains]]''
A new trend in the heated controversy between [[First Nations]] groups and scientists is the [[repatriation]] of native [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to the original descendants. An example of this occurred on 21 June 2005, when community members and elders from a number of the 10 [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] nations in the [[Ottawa]] area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near [[Maniwaki, Quebec]], to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods—some dating back 6,000 years. It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region. The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin. Moreover, the oldest of these remains might have no relation at all to the Algonquin or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited the area.

The remains and artifacts, including [[jewelry]], [[tool]]s and [[weapons]], were originally excavated from various sites in the [[Ottawa Valley]], including [[Morrison Island|Morrison]] and the [[Allumette Island]]s. They had been part of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]'s research collection for decades, some since the late 19th century. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional [[Juniperus virginiana|redcedar]] and [[birchbark]] boxes lined with redcedar chips, [[muskrat]] and [[Beaver#Commercial uses|beaver pelts]].

An inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 80 boxes of various sizes are buried. Because of this reburial, no further scientific study is possible. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement.&lt;ref name="Canadian Geographic Online" /&gt;

[[Kennewick Man]] is another repatriation candidate that has been the source of heated debate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10611">[[File:William Hogarth 016.jpg|thumb|300px|Painting based on ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', act 3, scene 2, [[William Hogarth]], c. 1728]]The '''ballad opera''' is a genre of [[England|English]] [[stage play|stage entertainment]] that originated in the early 18th century, and continued to develop over the following century and later.  Like the earlier ''[[comédie en vaudeville]]'' and the later ''[[Singspiel]]'', its distinguishing characteristic is the use of tunes in a popular style (either pre-existing or newly composed) with spoken dialogue. These English plays were '[[opera]]s' mainly insofar as they satirized the conventions of the imported ''[[opera seria]]''.   Music critic [[Peter Gammond]] describes the ballad opera as "an important step in the emancipation of both the musical stage and the popular song."&lt;ref name="gammond"&gt;{{cite book| first1= Peter| last1= Gammond| year= 1991| title= The Oxford Companion to Popular Music| publisher= Oxford University Press| location= Oxford| pages=35–36 | isbn= 0-19-311323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earliest ballad operas==
Ballad opera has been called an "eighteenth-century protest against the Italian conquest of the London operatic scene."&lt;ref name=Lubbock&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962), pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of racy and often [[Satire|satirical]] spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short (mostly a single short stanza and refrain) to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story, which involves lower class, often criminal, characters, and typically shows a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period.

It is generally accepted that the first ballad opera, and the one that was to prove the most successful, was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' of 1728.&lt;ref&gt;J. Milling, P. Thomson, J. W. Donohue, eds, ''The Cambridge History of British Theatre: 1660 to 1895'' / edited by Joseph Donohue (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a libretto by [[John Gay]] and music arranged by [[Johann Christoph Pepusch]], both of whom probably experienced vaudeville theatre in [[Paris]], and may have been motivated to reproduce it in an English form.  They were also probably influenced by the burlesques and musical plays of [[Thomas D'Urfey]] (1653–1723) who had a reputation for [[parody music|fitting new words to existing songs]]; [[Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy|a popular anthology of these settings]] was published in 1700 and frequently re-issued.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "D'Urfey, Thomas".&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the tunes from this anthology were recycled in ''The Beggar's Opera''.

After the success of ''The Beggar's Opera'', many similar pieces were staged.  The actor [[Thomas Walker (actor)|Thomas Walker]], who played [[Macheath]] in the original production, wrote several ballad operas,&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt; and Gay produced further works in this style, including a much less successful sequel, ''Polly''.  [[Henry Fielding]], [[Colley Cibber]], [[Charles Coffey]], [[Thomas Arne]], [[Charles Dibdin]], Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity.&lt;ref name=Lubbock/&gt; By the middle of the century, however, the genre was already in decline.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WarwickWest1992&gt;J. Warwick and E. West, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they featured the lower reaches of society, the audiences for these works were typically the London bourgeois. As a reaction to serious opera (at this time almost invariably sung in Italian), the music, for these audiences, was as satirical in its way as the words of the play. The plays themselves contained references to contemporary politics—in ''The Beggar's Opera'' the character Peachum was a lampoon of Sir [[Robert Walpole]]. This satirical element meant that many of them risked censorship and banning—as was the case with Gay's successor to ''The Beggar's Opera'', ''Polly''.

The tunes of the original ballad operas were almost all pre-existing (somewhat in the manner of a modern "[[jukebox musical]]"): however they were taken from a wide variety of contemporary sources, including [[folk music|folk melodies]], popular airs by classical composers (such as [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]) and even children's [[nursery rhymes]]. A significant source from which the music was drawn was the fund of popular airs to which 18th century London [[broadside (music)|broadside ballad]]s are set. It is from this connection that the term "ballad opera" is drawn. This ragbag of [[Parody music|"pre-loved" music]] is a good test for distinguishing between the original type of ballad opera and its later forms.  Many ballad operas used the same tunes, such as "[[Lillibullero]]", and by about 1750 it had become clear that there was a need for new tunes to be written.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;  In 1762, Thomas Arne's ''[[Love in a Village]]'' presented a new form of ballad opera, with mainly new music and much less reliance on traditional tunes. It was followed in similar style by Charles Dibdin's ''Lionel and Clarissa'' in 1768.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;

''[[The Disappointment]]'' (1762) represents an early American attempt at such a ballad opera.

==Singspiel connection==
In 1736 the [[Prussia]]n ambassador in England commissioned an arrangement in German of a popular ballad opera, ''The Devil to Pay'', by [[Charles Coffey]]. This was successfully performed in [[Hamburg]], [[Leipzig]] and elsewhere in Germany in the 1740s. A new version was produced by C. F. Weisse and [[Johann Adam Hiller]] in 1766. The success of this version was the first of many by these collaborators, who have been called (according to [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove]]) "the fathers of the German Singspiel". (The storyline of ''The Devil to Pay'' was also adapted for [[Gluck]] for his 1759 French opera ''[[Le diable à quatre (opera)|Le diable à quatre]]'').

==Pastoral ballad opera ==
A later development, also often referred to as ballad opera, was a more "pastoral" form. In subject matter, especially, these "ballad operas" were antithetical to the more satirical variety. In place of the rag-bag of pre-existing music found in (for example) ''The Beggar's Opera'', the scores of these works consisted in the main of original music, although they not infrequently quoted folk melodies, or imitated them. Thomas Arne and [[Isaac Bickerstaffe]]'s ''Love in a Village'', and [[William Shield]]'s ''Rosina'' (1781) are typical examples. Many of these works were introduced as after-pieces to performances of Italian operas.

Later in the century broader comedies such as [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''The Duenna'' and the innumerable works of [[Charles Dibdin]] moved the balance back towards the original style, but there was little remaining of the impetus of the satirical ballad opera.

==19th century==
English 19th century opera is very heavily drawn from the "pastoral" form of the ballad opera, and traces even of the satiric kind can be found in the work of "serious" practitioners such as [[John Barnett]]. Much of the satiric spirit (albeit in a greatly refined form) of the original ballad opera can be found in [[W. S. Gilbert|Gilbert's]] contribution to the [[Savoy opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], and the more pastoral form of ballad opera is satirised in one of Gilbert and Sullivan's early works, ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walbrook|first=H. M.|year=1922|title=Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera, A History and a Comment|url=http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/index.html|location=|accessdate=24 June 2009|publisher=F. V. White &amp; Co.

==20th century==
''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' of [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] (1928) is a reworking of ''The Beggar's Opera'', setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite. On the other hand, it uses just one tune from the original—all the other music being specially composed, and thus omits one of the most distinctive features of the original ballad opera.

In a completely different vein, ''[[Hugh the Drover]]'', an [[opera]] in two acts by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] first staged in 1924, is also sometimes referred to as a "ballad opera". It is plainly much closer to [[William Shield|Shield's]] ''Rosina'' than to ''The Beggar's Opera''.

In the twentieth century folk singers have produced musical plays with folk or folk-like songs called "ballad operas". [[Alan Lomax]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Burl Ives]], and others recorded ''The Martins and the Coys'' in 1944, and [[Peter Bellamy]] and others recorded ''The Transports'' in 1977. The first of these is in some ways connected to the "pastoral" form of the ballad opera, and the latter to the satiric ''Beggar's Opera'' type, but in all they represent yet further reinterpretations of the term.

Ironically, it is in the [[Musical theatre|musicals]] of [[Kander and Ebb]]—especially ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''—that the kind of satire embodied in ''The Beggar's Opera'' and its immediate successors is probably best preserved, although here, as in Weill's version, the music is specially composed, unlike the first ballad operas of the 18th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9800">The term '''Bible fiction''' refers to works of [[fiction]] which use characters, settings and events taken from the [[Bible]]. The degree of fictionalization in these works varies and, although they are often written by [[Christian]]s or [[Jew]]s, this is not always the case.

Originally, these novels were consistent with true belief in the historicity of the Bible's narrative, replete with miracles, and God's explicit presence.  Some of these works have been important and influential, and eventually there have appeared heterodox Bible novels that reflect [[modernism|modern]], [[postmodern]] or [[realism (arts)|realist]] influences and themes.

An early Bible novel that may still be the most influential is ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' by [[Lew Wallace]], and published by Harper &amp; Brothers on November 12, 1880.  It remained the best-selling American novel of all time, surpassing [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) in sales and remaining at the top of the US all-time bestseller list until the publication of [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1936). ''Ben-Hur'' is a [[bildungsroman]] and adventure novel that follows the tumultuous life of its protagonist, Judah Ben-Hur. He is a fictional Jewish noble from Jerusalem who suffers betrayal (by a boyhood friend) and consequently his enslavement and his family's imprisonment by the Romans.  Concurrent with Judah's narrative is the developing Christian story, as Jesus and Judah are natives of the same region and about the same age. Judah survives his ordeal and becomes a famous soldier and charioteer, enabling him to avenge his misfortune.  Judah's encounters with Jesus first during Judah's and then during Jesus' suffering lead to the Messiah's curing of Judah's sister and mother of leprosy and Judah's conversion to Christianity. There have been numerous film adaptations including the 1959 version starring [[Charlton Heston]] that won ten academy awards.

''[[The Robe]]'' (1942) by [[Lloyd C. Douglas]] was one of the best-selling novels of the 1940s and dramatizes the crucifixion of Jesus from the point of view of Marcellus Gallio, the Roman tribune who commands the garrison that carries out the crucifixion of Jesus. Marcellus winds up in custody of Jesus' robe and converts to Christianity because of his experiences interacting with the robe's magical powers.  Like ''Ben-Hur'', ''The Robe'' was in 1953 adapted into an Academy Award winning film.

In the twentieth century, there began to appear heterodox Bible fiction.  [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]' ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1960), caused a widespread outcry and appeared on many banned book lists for its dramatization of Jesus as wracked by temptations, beset by fear, doubts, depression, reluctance and lust.  However, Jesus is nevertheless portrayed as a miracle-worker and the son of God who is resurrected following the crucifixion.  [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Gospel According to the Son]]'' (1997) is a retelling in Mailer's own words that adheres closely to the Gospel narrative including miracles and resurrection.  This was noteworthy in part because Mailer was a Jew, not a Christian.

[[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ]]'' (2010) is a heavily allegorical retelling of the Christian story that uses postmodern techniques and is an evident polemic against Christianity.  It retells the story of Jesus as if he were two people, brothers, "Jesus" and "Christ," with contrasting personalities:  Jesus is a moral and spiritual man, and his brother Christ is an ambitious character who wishes to hijack Jesus' biography and legacy to develop a myth that will be the foundation for a powerful and worldly Church.

Other works are regarded as heterodox simply because they dramatize the Bible stories realistically, shorn of mythical, miraculous or magical elements.  They may even include the transformation from real life events to mythology as part of the narrative.  Realist Bible novels are typically semi-historical in that they develop the setting in Israel or Egypt or Rome or as the case may be—including the political and class and racial conflicts and urban and rural landscape imagery—with fidelity to known historical facts. As [[Robert Graves]] said of his novel ''[[King Jesus]]'' (1946), "I undertake to my readers that every important element in my story is based on some tradition, however tenuous, and that I have taken more than ordinary pains to verify my historical background."

Realist Bible novels employ in some way the narratives that comprise the canonical Biblical narrative, but shorn of miracles, or God's explicit presence.  With respect to Jesus' biography, Jesus is portrayed as a man, usually a rebel against the wealthy classes (sometimes he himself is born into a privileged background and rebels against his own class), and the ruling Romans and their local client autocrats.   Sometimes Jesus' biography is enhanced by sources external to the canonical gospels such as Josephus' chronicles, the Talmud, or non-canonical gospels, and the author's imagination.

Graves' ''King Jesus'' develops the protagonist as, not the son of God, but rather as a philosopher with a legitimate claim to be the earthly king of the Jews as a descendant of Herod the Great, and the Old Testament's David.  The novel has heterodox retellings of Biblical stories.

''[[Joseph and His Brothers]]'' (1943) is a novel by [[Thomas Mann]] that retells the familiar stories of Genesis, from Jacob to Joseph, setting it in the historical context of the Amarna Period. Mann considered it his greatest work.

''[[The Red Tent (Anita Diamant novel)|The Red Tent]]'' (1997) a novel by [[Anita Diamant]], is a first-person narrative that tells the story of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and sister of Joseph.  Diamont has broadened her character from her minor and brief role in the Bible.  The book's title refers to the tent in which women of Jacob's tribe must, as dictated by ancient law, be quarantined while menstruating or giving birth. There the women find mutual support and encouragement from their mothers, sisters and aunts.

[[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Geraldine Brooks (writer)|Geraldine Brooks]]' ''[[The Secret Chord]]'' (2015) is narrated by Natan, the prophet who communicates God's directives to David.  The scriptures are her primary sources for the plot, which includes all the well-known key events: Goliath, David's facility with the harp, kingdom building, Bathsheba, and so on.  There are other characters fully developed from Brooks' imagination and portrayed through Natan's point of view.

''[[The Testament of Mary]]'' (2012) a novella by [[Colm Toibin]], is a retelling of the Christian story from the point of view of Mary, the mother of Jesus. However, she does not believe Jesus is the Son of God – she knows he is a man – and she is contemptuous of the Gospel writers who visit her to solicit her cooperation and give her food and shelter. The themes or questions that the novel explores are narrative truth and fiction, feminism, loss, identity and corruption thereof, invasion of privacy, and worldly ambition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/books/review/the-testament-of-mary-by-colm-toibin.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Testament of Mary'' was adapted into a Broadway play.

''The Liars' Gospel'' (2012), by Jewish author [[Naomi Alderman]], retells the Christ story from a Jewish perspective.  Four witnesses to the key events, Mary, Judas, Caiaphas and Barabbas, are the narrators in four sections of the novel, and the story spans the period from Pompey's siege of Jerusalem in 63 BC through Titus's siege in 70 AD.

''John the Baptizer'' (2009), by Brooks Hansen and published by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], is a novelized life of John the Baptist that dramatizes the man beneath the hagiography. According to Christian theology, John was merely a forerunner to Christ, but Hansen's portrait is strongly influenced by the Gnostic teachings that reveal John as a messianic figure at the center of a sect called the Mandeans, and more mature, rigorous and restrained than his younger and charismatic protégé Jesus.

''Logos'' (2015), a novel by John Neeleman and published by Homebound Publications, a [[small press]], and winner of an [[Independent Publisher Book Awards]] gold medal for religious fiction and the Utah Book Award for fiction,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utahhumanities.org/index.php/Center-for-the-Book/utah-book-award.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a bildungsroman that follows the life and development of the anonymous author of the original gospel.  Jacob, a former temple priest in Jerusalem who has been rendered bereft by the Jewish wars and consequent destruction of his family and culture, is inspired by his own autobiography and Paul's mythmaking to create the canonical gospels' original narrative.

''The Gospel According to Lazarus'' (2019), a novel by [[Richard Zimler]], expands upon the story of [[Lazarus of Bethany]], who was raised from the dead in the [[Gospel of John]]. According to Zimler, one of the objectives of his novel was to return to the New Testament figures their [[Judaism]], so in his narrative, Jesus is called Yeshua ben Yosef and Lazarus is called Eliezer ben Natan. Yeshua and Eliezer have been best friends from childhood, and Yeshua is characterized as a [[Merkabah]] mystic.  The themes of the book include how we cope with a loss of faith, the terrible sacrifices we make for those we love, the transcendent meaning of Yeshua's mission, and how we go on after suffering a shattering trauma.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4425">'''Bioresource engineering''' is similar to [[biological engineering]], except that it is based on biological and/or agricultural feedstocks. Bioresource engineering is more general and encompasses a wider range of technologies and various elements such as [[biomass]], biological waste treatment, bioenergy, [[biotransformations]], bioresource systems analysis, [[bioremediation]] and technologies associated with Thermochemical conversion technologies such as combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, catalysis, etc.

Bioresource engineering also contains biochemical conversion technologies such as aerobic methods, anaerobic digestion, microbial growth processes, enzymatic methods, and composting.  Products include fibre, fuels, feedstocks, fertilisers, building materials, polymers and other industrial products, and management products e.g. modelling, systems analysis, decisions, and support systems. 
Bioresource engineering is a discipline that is usually very similar to environmental engineering.

The impact of [[urbanization]] and increasing demand for food, water and land presents bioresource engineers with the task of bridging the gap between the biological world and traditional engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smithers |first=JC |title=WHAT IS BIORESOURCES ENGINEERING?"

A '''black hole cosmology''' (also called '''Schwarzschild cosmology''' or '''black hole cosmological model''') is a [[cosmological model]] in which the [[observable universe]] is the interior of a [[black hole]]. Such models were originally proposed by [[theoretical physicist]] [[Raj Pathria]],&lt;ref name=pathria&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pathria, R. K. |authorlink=Raj Pathria |year=1972 |title=The Universe as a Black Hole |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=240 |pages=298–299 |doi=10.1038/240298a0 |issue=5379|bibcode = 1972Natur.240..298P }}&lt;/ref&gt; and concurrently by [[mathematician]] [[I. J. Good]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Good, I. J. |authorlink=I. J. Good |title=Chinese universes |journal=[[Physics Today]] |volume=25 |issue=7 |page=15 |date=July 1972 |doi=10.1063/1.3070923|bibcode = 1972PhT....25g..15G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any such model requires that the [[Hubble radius]] of the observable universe is equal to its [[Schwarzschild radius]], that is, the product of its mass and the [[Schwarzschild radius#Formula for the Schwarzschild radius|Schwarzschild proportionality constant]]. This is indeed known to be nearly the case; however, most cosmologists consider this close match a coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Landsberg, P. T. |title=Mass Scales and the Cosmological Coincidences |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |volume=496 |issue=2 |pages=88–92 |year=1984 |doi=10.1002/andp.19844960203|bibcode = 1984AnP...496...88L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the version as originally proposed by Pathria and Good, and studied more recently by, among others, [[Nikodem Popławski]],
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Popławski, N. J. |authorlink=Nikodem Popławski |year=2010 |title=Radial motion into an Einstein-Rosen bridge |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=687 |issue=2–3 |pages=110–113 |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.03.029 |bibcode=2010PhLB..687..110P|arxiv = 0902.1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the observable universe is the interior of a black hole existing as one of possibly many inside a larger universe, or [[multiverse]].

According to [[general relativity]], the gravitational collapse of a sufficiently compact mass forms a singular Schwarzschild black hole. In the [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan]]–Sciama–Kibble theory of gravity, however, it forms a regular Einstein–Rosen bridge, or [[wormhole]]. Schwarzschild wormholes and Schwarzschild black holes are different mathematical solutions of general relativity and the Einstein–Cartan theory. Yet for observers, the exteriors of both solutions with the same mass are indistinguishable. The Einstein–Cartan theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the affine connection and regarding its antisymmetric part, the [[torsion tensor]], as a dynamical variable. Torsion naturally accounts for the quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum ([[spin (physics)|spin]]) of matter. The minimal coupling between torsion and [[Dirac spinor]]s generates a repulsive spin-spin interaction which is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction prevents the formation of a gravitational singularity. Instead, the collapsing matter reaches an enormous but finite density and rebounds, forming the other side of an [[Wormhole|Einstein-Rosen bridge]], which grows as a new universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Popławski, N. J. |authorlink=Nikodem Popławski |year=2010 |title=Cosmology with torsion: An alternative to cosmic inflation |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=694 |issue=3 |pages=181–185 |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.09.056|arxiv = 1007.0587 |bibcode = 2010PhLB..694..181P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the [[Big Bang]] was a nonsingular [[Big Bounce]] at which the universe had a finite, minimum scale factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Popławski, N. |authorlink=Nikodem Popławski |year=2012 |title=Nonsingular, big-bounce cosmology from spinor-torsion coupling |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=85 |issue=10 |pages=107502 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.85.107502|arxiv = 1111.4595 |bibcode = 2012PhRvD..85j7502P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5061">'''Botany 2000''' is the name for a scientific program, organized under the auspices of [[UNESCO]]. While a similar UNESCO program, [[ASOMPS]], focus on promotion of collaboration and co-operation between scientists in Asia, Botany 2000 is composed of activities in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. Activities in [[Europe]] are confined to support of herbaria in countries in transition and reconstruction e.g. [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

The Botany 2000 program was accepted by the UNESCO General Conference in 1989. 

Activities in Africa and Asia subsume activities in predecessor networks such as the: 

* Botany 2000-Asia
* Botany 2000-Africa

The Botany 2000-Asia program is the new name for the former ''Southeast Asian Cooperative Program on Descriptive Botany'' (SEABOP) and of the work being carried out by the majority of the other organizations involved in the ''Asian Coordinating Group for Chemistry'' (ACGC).

Botany 2000-Asia is implemented by UNESCO's New Delhi Office and focuses on the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and biological and cultural [[Biodiversity|diversity]] of medicinal and [[ornamental plants]], and their protection against [[environmental pollution]], as well as ethnobiological classification and biological [[systematics]] and the correct documentation of useful plants through collection of voucher specimens. Within the framework of the project Botany 2000-Asia, [[UNESCO]] supports also the computerization of holdings and locations in herbaria throughout Asia.

Under the Botany 2000-Asia program some conferences were held:

* Botany 2000-Asia: Herbarium Curation Workshop (15-20 October 1990, [[Point Walter]], Bicton, Western Australia)
* Botany 2000-Asia: Zingiberaceae Workshop (15-18 October 1991, Hat Yai, Thailand)
* Botany 2000-Asia: Rutaceae Workshop (2-7 February 1992, in conjunction with ASOMPS VII, Manila, Philippines)
* Botany 2000-Asia: International Botanical Congress (28 August-3 September 1993, Tokyo, Japan)
* Botany 2000-Asia: International Seminar and Workshop : taxonomy and phytochemistry of the Asclepiadaceae in tropical Asia (June 1994, Malacca, Malaysia) &lt;ref&gt; Proceedings were published as: R. Kiew (Ed.) 1994. The taxonomy and phytochemistry of the Asclepiadaceae in tropical Asia : proceedings of Botany 2000-Asia International Seminar and Workshop, Malacca, June 1994. Publ. by Herbarium, Department of Biology, Universiti Pertanian Malaysia, vi, 101 pp., ill. &lt;/ref&gt;
* Second Symposium on The Family Zingiberaceae (9-12 May 1995, Guangzhou, China) &lt;ref&gt; Proceedings were published as: Te-Lin Wu; Qi-Gen Wu; Z.-Y. Chen (Eds.) 1996. Proceedings of the Second Symposium on the Family Zingiberaceae. Publ. by Zhongshan University Press, Guangzhou - 510 275, People's Republic of China, v, 306 pp., ill., {{ISBN|7-306-01218-5}} &lt;/ref&gt;
* Botany 2000-Asia: Workshop on the Family Apocynaceae (6-8 February 1996, Chittagong, Bangladesh)
 
[[Neville Marchant]], Director of the [[Western Australian Herbarium]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], has been involved in the Botany 2000-Asia programme since its inception.

The UNESCO Office, New Delhi also published the ''Botany 2000-Asia Newsletter'' four times a year. A typical issue contains news on workshops, training courses, databases, projects and forthcoming meetings as well as reports on unauthorized collection and export of medicinal plants from the region. The editor requests one to two page articles and reports of seminars and meetings of general relevance to [[botany]] and [[ethnobotany]] in Asia. Apart from producing the newsletter, the UNESCO Botany 2000-Asia program sponsors occasional workshops on the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[ethnobotany]] and [[Phytochemistry |chemistry]] of various plant families, as well as training courses in herbarium techniques and curation.  

Botany 2000-Africa is implemented by UNESCO's Nairobi Office and deals with the conservation and use of the medicinal flora of Africa.

Some of the activities of the Botany 2000-Africa program are published in: S. Edwards and Z. Asfaw (Editors): ''The Status of Some Plant Resources in Parts of Tropical Africa''. Botany 2000: East and Central Africa; NAPRECA Monograph Series No. 2. Published by ''Natural Products Research Network for Eastern and Central Africa'' (NAPRECA), Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, 1992.

The UNESCO ''Botany 2000'' program is different from the annual meeting of the ''Botanical Society of America'' (BSA), who organised an annual scientific conference named ''Botany''. This ''Botany 2000 : New Frontiers in Botany'' conference was held in Portland, Oregon on 6-10 August 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3751">In [[neuroscience]] the '''bridge locus''' for a particular sensory [[percept]] is a hypothetical set of [[neuron]]s whose activity is the basis of that sensory percept. The term was introduced by D.N. Teller and E.Y. Pugh, Jr. in 1983, and has been sparingly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=D.N. Teller |author2=E.Y. Pugh, Jr. |title=Colour Vision |editors=J.D. Mollon, L.T. Sharpe |year=1983 |publisher=Academic Press |pages=581 |isbn=978-0-12-504280-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activity in the bridge locus neurons is postulated to be [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient]] for sensory perception: if the bridge locus neurons are not active, then the sensory perception does not occur, regardless of the actual sensory input. Conversely if the bridge locus neurons are active, then sensory perception occurs, regardless of the actual sensory input. It is the highest neural level of a sensory perception. So, for example, [[retina]]l neurons are not considered a bridge locus for visual perception because stimulating [[visual cortex]] can give rise to [[phosphene|visual percepts]].&lt;ref&gt;Davida Y Teller "Linking propositions" Vision Research (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all scholars believe in such a [[neural correlate of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Quest for Consciousness |author=Christof Koch |page=88 |publisher=Roberts and Company Publishers |year=2004 |isbn13=9780974707709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pessoa et al., for example, argue that there is no necessity for a bridge locus, basing their argument on the requirement of an isomorphism between neural states and conscious states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Neural Correlates of Consciousness |editor=Thomas Metzinger |chapter=What is a Neural Correlate of Consciousness |author=David J. Chalmers |page=37 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2000 |isbn13=9780262133708}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2011}} Thompson argues that there are good reasons to think that the notion of a bridge locus, which he calls a "localizationist approach", is misguided, questioning the premise that there has to be one particular neural stage whose activity forms the immediate substrate of perception. He argues, based upon work by Zeki &amp; Shipp, DeYoe &amp; Van Essen, and others, that brain regions are not independent stages or modules but have dense forward and backward projections that act reciprocally, and that visual processing is highly interactive and context-dependent. He also argues that cells in the visual cortex "are not mere 'feature detectors{{'"}}, and that neuroscience has revealed that the brain in fact employs distributed networks, rather than centralized representations. He equates the notion of a bridge locus to a [[Cartesian theatre]] and suggests that as a notion it should be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Consciousness and Intentionality |editor=Denis Fisette |chapter=Filling-in: Visual Science and the Philosophy of Perception |author=Evan Thompson |page=156 |publisher=Springer |year=1999 |isbn13=9780792359074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''capability approach''' (also referred to as the '''capabilities approach''') is an economic theory conceived in the 1980s as an alternative approach to [[welfare economics]].&lt;ref name=Sen1985&gt;{{cite book | last = Sen | first = Amartya | author-link = Amartya Sen| title = Commodities and capabilities | publisher = North-Holland Sole distributors for the U.S.A. and Canada, Elsevier Science Pub. Co | location = Amsterdam New York New York, N.Y., U.S.A | year = 1985 | isbn = 9780444877307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, [[Amartya Sen]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]] bring together a range of ideas that were previously excluded from (or inadequately formulated in) traditional approaches to the economics of welfare. The core focus of the capability approach is on what individuals are able to do (i.e., capable of).

== Assessing capability ==

Initially, Sen argued for five components in assessing capability:
# The importance of real freedoms in the assessment of a person's advantage
# Individual differences in the ability to transform resources into valuable activities

Subsequently, and in collaboration particularly with political philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], development economist Sudhir Anand and economic theorist James Foster, Sen has helped to make the capabilities approach predominant as a paradigm for policy debate in human development where it inspired the creation of the UN's [[Human Development Index]] (a popular measure of human development, capturing capabilities in health, education, and income). In addition, the approach has been operationalised with a high income country focus by [[Paul Anand]] and colleagues.&lt;ref name=Anand2009_125&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dowding | first1 = Keith  | last2 = Martin | first2 = Van Hees | last3 = Anand | first3 = Paul | last4 = Hunter | first4 = Graham | last5 = Carter | first5 = Ian | last6 = Guala | first6 = Francesco | author-link1 = Keith Dowding | author-link2 = Martin van Hees | title = The development of capability indicators | journal = Journal of Human Development and Capabilities | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 125–152 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/14649880802675366 | date = 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649880802675366 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anand2009Fest&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Anand | first1 = Paul | last2 = Santos | first2 = Cristina | last3 = Smith | first3 = Ron | contribution = The measurement of capabilities | editor-last1 = Basu | editor-first1 = Kaushik | editor-last2 = Kanbur | editor-first2 = Ravi | editor-link1 = Kaushik Basu | editor-link2 = Ravi Kanbur | title = Arguments for a better world: essays in honor of Amartya Sen | volume = 1 | pages = 283–310 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780199239115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, since the creation of the [[Human Development and Capability Association]] in the early 2000s, the approach has been much discussed by political theorists, philosophers, and a range of social scientists, including those with a particular interest in human health.

The approach emphasizes functional capabilities ("substantive freedoms", such as the ability to live to old age, engage in economic transactions, or participate in political activities); these are construed in terms of the substantive freedoms people have reason to value, instead of [[utility]] ([[happiness]], desire-fulfillment or [[choice]]) or access to resources ([[income]], commodities, [[asset]]s). Poverty is understood as capability-deprivation. It is noteworthy that the emphasis is not only on how humans actually function but also on their having the capability, which is a practical choice, "to achieve outcomes that they value and have reason to value".&lt;ref name = Sen1999_291&gt;{{cite book | last = Sen | first = Amartya | author-link = Amartya Sen | title = Development as freedom | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2001 | page = 291 | isbn = 9780192893307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone could be deprived of such capabilities in many ways, e.g. by ignorance, government oppression, lack of financial resources, or false consciousness.

This approach to human [[well-being]] emphasizes the importance of freedom of choice, individual heterogeneity and the multi-dimensional nature of welfare. In significant respects, the approach is consistent with the handling of choice within conventional [[microeconomics]] [[consumer theory]], although its conceptual foundations enable it to acknowledge the existence of claims, like rights, which normatively dominate utility-based claims (see {{harvnb|Sen|1979}}).

== Key terms ==

=== Functionings ===
In the most basic sense, functionings consist of "beings and doings".&lt;ref name=Sen1992&gt;{{cite book | last = Sen | first = Amartya | author-link = Amartya Sen | title = Inequality reexamined | publisher = Russell Sage Foundation Clarendon Press Oxford Univ. Press | location = New York Oxford New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780198289289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, living may be seen as a set of interrelated functionings. Essentially, functionings are the states and activities constitutive of a person's being. Examples of functionings can vary from elementary things, such as being healthy, having a good job, and being safe, to more complex states, such as being happy, having self-respect, and being calm. Moreover, Amartya Sen contends that functionings are crucial to an adequate understanding of the capability approach; capability is conceptualized as a reflection of the freedom to achieve valuable functionings.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt;

In other words, functionings are the subjects of the capabilities referred to in the approach: what we are capable, want to be capable, or should be capable to be and/or do. Therefore, a person's chosen combination of functionings, what they are and do, is part of their overall capability set — the functionings they were able to do. Yet, functionings can also be conceptualized in a way that signifies an individual's capabilities. [[Eating]], [[starving]], and [[fasting]] would all be considered functionings, but the functioning of fasting differs significantly from that of starving because fasting, unlike starving, involves a choice and is understood as choosing to starve despite the presence of other options.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt;  Consequently, an understanding of what constitutes functionings is inherently tied together with an understanding of capabilities, as defined by this approach.

=== Capabilities ===
Capabilities are the alternative combinations of functionings that are feasible for a person to achieve. Formulations of capability have two parts: functionings and opportunity freedom — the substantive freedom to pursue different functioning combinations.&lt;ref name=Alkire2009&gt;{{Citation | last = Alkire | first = Sabina | author-link = Sabina Alkire | contribution = The human development and capability approach | editor-last1 = Deneulin | editor-first1 = Séverine | editor-last2 = Shahani | editor-first2 = Lila | editor-link1 = Séverine Deneulin | title = An introduction to the human development and capability approach freedom and agency | pages = 22–48 | publisher = Earthscan International Development Research Centre | location = Sterling, Virginia Ottawa, Ontario | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781844078066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, capabilities denote a person's opportunity and ability to generate valuable outcomes, taking into account relevant personal characteristics and external factors. The important part of this definition is the "freedom to achieve", because if freedom had only [[instrumental value]] (valuable as a means to achieve an end) and no [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] (valuable in and of itself) to a person's well-being, then the value of the capability set as a whole would simply be defined by the value of a person's actual combination of functionings.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt; Such a definition would not acknowledge the entirety of what a person is capable of doing and their resulting current state due to the nature of the options available to them. Consequently, the capability set outlined by this approach is not merely concerned with achievements; rather, freedom of [[choice]], in and of itself, is of direct importance to a person's [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt;

For example, the difference between [[fasting]] and [[starving]], on person's well-being, is whether the person is choosing not to eat.&lt;ref name=Sen1999&gt;{{cite book | last = Sen | first = Amartya | author-link = Amartya Sen | title = Development as freedom | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780192893307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, the functioning is starving but the capability to obtain an adequate amount of food is the key element in evaluating well-being between individuals in the two states. In sum, having a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] is not the same as choosing it; well-being depends on how that lifestyle came to be.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt; More formally, while the combination of a person's functionings represents their actual achievements, their capability set represents their opportunity freedom — their freedom to choose between alternative combinations of functionings.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt;

An extension of the capabilities approach was published in 2013 in ''Freedom, Responsibility and Economics of the Person''. This book explores the interconnected concepts of person, responsibility and freedom in economics, moral philosophy and politics.  It tries to reconcile the rationality and morality of individuals. It presents a methodological reflection (phenomenology ''versus'' Kantian thought) with the aim to re-humanise the person, through actions, and through the values and norms that lead to corresponding rights and obligations that must be ordered. The book extends the capabilities approach in a critical form. In particular, it considers freedom in relation to responsibility, that is, the capacity of people to apply moral constraints to themselves. By contrast, Sen's capability approach considers freedom as a purely functional rationality of choice.

=== Agency ===
Amartya Sen defines an agent as someone who acts and brings about change, whose achievement can be evaluated in terms of his or her own [[values]] and goals.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt; This differs from a common use of the term "[[Agent (economics)|agent]]" sometimes used in [[economics]] and [[game theory]] to mean a person acting on someone else's behalf.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt; Agency depends on the ability to personally choose the functionings one values, a choice that may not correlate with personal well-being. For example, when a person chooses to engage in [[fasting]], they are exercising their ability to pursue a goal they value, though such a choice may not positively affect [[physical well-being]]. Sen explains that a person as an agent need not be guided by a pursuit of well-being; agency achievement considers a person's success in terms of their pursuit of the whole of their goals.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt;

For the purposes of the capability approach, agency primarily refers to a person's role as a member of [[society]], with the ability to participate in economic, social, and political actions. Therefore, agency is crucial in assessing one's capabilities and any economic, social, or political barriers to one's achieving substantive freedoms. Concern for agency stresses that [[participation (decision making)|participation]], public debate, [[democracy|democratic]] practice, and [[empowerment]], should be fostered alongside well-being.&lt;ref name=Alkire2005a&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Alkire | first = Sabina | author-link = Sabina Alkire | title = Capability and functionings: definition &amp; justification | journal = HDCA Introductory Briefing Note | publisher = Human Development and Capability Association (HDCA) | date = 2005 | url = https://hd-ca.org/publications/capability-and-functionings-definition-justification | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sabina Alkire|Alkire]] and [[Séverine Deneulin|Deneulin]] pointed out that agency goes together with the expansion of valuable freedoms. That is, in order to be agents of their lives, people need the freedom to be educated, speak in public without fear, express themselves, associate, etc.; conversely, people can establish such an environment by being agents.&lt;ref name=Alkire2009/&gt; In summary, the agency aspect is important in assessing what a person can do in line with his or her conception of the good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Crocker | first = David A | contribution = Functioning and capability: the foundations of Sen's and Nussbaum's development ethic | editor-last1 = Nussbaum | editor-first1 = Martha | editor-last2 = Glover | editor-first2 = Jonathan | editor-link1 = Martha Nussbaum | editor-link2 = Jonathan Glover | pages = 153–199 | title = Women, culture, and development: a study of human capabilities | publisher = Clarendon Press Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780198289647 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nussbaum's central capabilities ==
Nussbaum (2000) frames these basic principles in terms of 10 capabilities, i.e. real opportunities based on personal and social circumstance. She claims that a political order can only be considered as being decent if this order secures at least a threshold level of these 10 capabilities to all inhabitant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha|title=Creating Capabilities The Human Development Approach|date=March 2011|publisher=Belknap Press|isbn=9780674050549|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nussbaum's capabilities approach is centered around the notion of individual human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=0674072359|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given Nussbaum's contention that the goal of the capabilities approach is to produce capabilities for each and every person, the capabilities below belong to individual persons, rather than to groups.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780674072350|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capabilities approach has been very influential in development policy where it has shaped the evolution of the human development index ([[Human Development Index|HDI]]), has been much discussed in philosophy, and is increasingly influential in a range of social sciences.

More recently, the approach has been criticized for being grounded in the liberal notion of freedom:

{{cquote| This is a fundamentally reductive view of the human condition. Moreover, the emphasis on freedom betrays a profoundly modern orientation. The compound problem is that freedom in Nussbaum’s hands is both given an intrinsic and primary value (a reductive claim), and, at the same time, the list is treated as a contingent negotiated relation in tension with other virtues such as justice, equality and rights. Both propositions cannot hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2018 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | chapter= Creating Capacities for Human Flourishing: An Alternative Approach to Human Development | title= Cultures of Sustainability and Wellbeing: Theories, Histories, Policies | editor= Paola Spinozzi and Mazzanti Massimiliano | url= https://www.academia.edu/36899596/Creating_Capacities_for_Human_Flourishing_An_Alternative_Approach_to_Human_Development | publisher= Routledge | page= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The core capabilities Nussbaum argues should be supported by all democracies are:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=0674072359|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Nussbaum did not claim her list as definite and unchanging, she strongly advocated for outlining a list of central human capabilities.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | title = Capabilities as fundamental entitlements: Sen and social justice | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 9 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 33–59 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/1354570022000077926 | date = 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1354570022000077926 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Sen refuses to supply a specific list of capabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sen argues that an exact list and weights would be too difficult to define. For one, it requires specifying the context of use of capabilities, which could vary. Also, Sen argues that part of the richness of the capabilities approach is its insistence on the need for open valuational scrutiny for making social judgments. He is disinclined to in any way devalue the domain of reasoning in the [[public sphere]]. Instead, Sen argues that the task of weighing various capabilities should be left to the ethical and political considerations of each society based on public reasoning.&lt;ref name="Sen2005"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Sen |first= Amartya |author-link= Amartya Sen |title= Human rights and capabilities |journal= Journal of Human Development |volume= 6 |issue= 2 |pages= 151–166 |publisher= Taylor and Francis |doi= 10.1080/14649880500120491 |date= 2005 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649880500120491 |ref= harv |postscript = .}} [http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/files/Human_Rights_and_Capabilities.pdf Pdf version]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with concerns raised about Nussbaum's list, Alkire and Black also argue that Nussbaum's methodology "runs counter to an essential thrust of the capabilities approach which has been the attempt to redirect development theory away from a reductive focus on a minimally decent life towards a more holistic account of human well-being for all people."&lt;ref name=Alkire2005a/&gt;

That said, applications to development are discussed in Sen (1999), Nussbaum (2000), and Clark (2002, 2005), and are now numerous to the point where the capabilities approach is widely accepted as a paradigm in development. The programme of work operationalising the capability approach by Anand and colleagues draws heavily on Nussbaum's list as a relatively comprehensive, high-level account of the space in which human well-being or life quality is experienced. This work argues that the subitems on Nussbaum's list are too distinct to be monitored by single question and that a dashboard of some 40-50 indicators is required to inform the development of empirical work.

== Measurement of capabilities ==
The measurement of capabilities was, in the early days, thought to be a particular barrier to the implementation and use of the approach. However, two particular lines of work, in research and policy have sought to show that meaningful indicators of what individuals (and in some cases governments) are able to do can be developed and used to generate a range of insights.

In 1990, the UN Human Development report published the first such exercise which focused on health, education and [[income]] which were equally weighted to generate the [[Human Development Index]]. At the same time, and subsequently, researchers recognizing that these three areas covered only certain elements of life quality have sought to develop more comprehensive measures. A major project in this area has been the 'capabilities measurement project' in which Anand has led teams of philosophers, economists and social scientists to generate that gives a full and direct implement of the approach drawing particular on the key relations and concepts developed in Sen (1985) but also on work to do with the content of the approach. The earliest work in this project developed a set of around 50 capability indicators which were used to develop a picture of quality of life and deprivation in the UK. Subsequently, Anand and colleagues have developed datasets for the USA, UK and Italy in which all the elements of Sen's framework are reflected in data which permits all three key equations, for functionings, experience and capabilities, to be estimated.

In a series of papers, they have shown that both their primary data and some secondary datasets can be used to shed light on the production and distribution of life quality for working age adults, those in retirement, very young children, those vulnerable to domestic violence, [[Human migration|migrants]], excluded traveler communities and the disabled. They use these applications to argue that the capability framework is a particularly good fit for understanding quality of life across the life course and that it provides a relatively universal grammar for understanding the elements of human [[well-being]].

===Monetary vs. non-monetary measures of well-being===
[[Monetary]] and non-monetary measures of well-being are ideal when used to complement each other.&lt;ref name=Anand2009Fest/&gt;  Understanding the various aspects of economic development process not only helps address issues of inequality and lags in human development, but also helps to pinpoint where countries lag, which once addressed can further promote well-being and advancement.  As the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) (2006) notes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Well-being has several dimensions of which monetary factors are only one. They are nevertheless an important one, since richer economies are better placed to create and maintain other well-being-enhancing conditions, such as a [[clean environment]], the likelihood that the average person will have a right to 10 years or more of education, and lead a comparatively [[longevity|long]] and healthy life. Well-being will also be increased by institutions that enable citizens to feel that they control their own lives, and that investment of their time and resources will be rewarded. In turn, this will lead to higher incomes in a [[virtuous circle]].&lt;ref name=OECD2006&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Alternative measures of well-being | editor-last1 = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development | editor-first1 = OECD | editor-link1 = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  | title = Economic policy reforms: going for growth 2006 | pages = 129–142 | doi = 10.1787/growth-2006-en  | publisher = OECD | location = Paris | year = 2006 | isbn = 9789264035911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Simon Kuznets]], the developer of GNP, cautioned against using the measure as an indicator of overall welfare, which speaks to the unintended use of output-based measures as indicators of human welfare.

====Critique of output-based measures====
The use of GDP and GNP as an approximation of well-being and development have been critiqued widely, because they are often misused as indicators of well-being and human development when in fact they are only telling about the economic capacity of a country or an average income level when expressed on a per person basis. In particular, [[feminist economics]] and [[environmental economics]] offer a number of critiques. Critics in these fields typically discuss gender inequalities, insufficient representation of environmental costs of productions and general issues of misusing an output-based measure for unintended purposes.  In sum, the conclusion of Capabilities Approach is that people do not just value monetary income, and that development is linked to various indicators of [[life satisfaction]] and hence are important in measuring well-being. Development policies strive to create an environment for people to live long, healthy creative lives.&lt;ref name=Anand2009Fest/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Martha Nussbaum | title = Creating capabilities | medium = Video | publisher = YouTube | location = Harvard | date = 19 May 2011 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoD-cjduM40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waringfilm1995/&gt;
 
''Feminist critiques''

Nussbaum highlights some of the problematic assumptions and conclusions of output-based approaches to development.  First, she notes that GNP and GDP do not consider special requirements to help the most vulnerable, such as women.&lt;ref name=Nussbaum2004&gt;{{Citation | last = Nussbaum  | first = Martha | author-link= Martha Nussbaum | contribution = Promoting women's capabilities | editor-last1 = Benería | editor-first1 = Lourdes | editor-last2 = Bisnath | editor-first2 = Savitri | editor-link1 = Lourdes Benería | title = Global tensions: challenges and opportunities in the world economy | pages = 200–214 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780415934411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Nussbaum mentions that output-based approaches ignore the distribution of needs for the varying circumstances of people, for example a pregnant woman needs more resources than a non-pregnant woman or a single man.&lt;ref name=Nussbaum2004/&gt;

Also, output-based measures ignore [[unpaid work]], which includes child rearing and the societal advantages that result from a mother's work.  [[Marilyn Waring]], a political economist and activist for women's rights, elaborates on the example of a mother engaged in child care, domestic care and producing few goods for the informal market, all of which are usually done simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Waring2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Waring | first = Marilyn | author-link = Marilyn Waring | title = Counting for something!

''Environmental critiques''

Another critique by Waring is that the output-based measures ignore negative effects of economic growth&lt;ref name=Waringfilm1995&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Terre Nash | title = Who's Counting? Marilyn Waring on Sex, Lies and Global Economics |medium = Motion picture | publisher = National Film Board of Canada (NFB) and Studio B  | location = Canada | date = 1995 | url = https://www.nfb.ca/film/whos_counting/ }} See ''[[Who's Counting? Marilyn Waring on Sex, Lies and Global Economics]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waring2003/&gt; and so commodities that lower social welfare, such as nuclear weapons, and oil extraction which causes spills, are considered a good input. The "anti-bads" or the defensive expenditures to fight "bads" are not counted as a deduction in accounting systems (p.&amp;nbsp;11).&lt;ref name=Waringfilm1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waring2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanton2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanton|first1=Elizabeth A|title=The human development index: a history|date=February 2007|publisher=Political Economy Research Institute - PERI, University of Massachusetts Amherst|location=Massachusetts|id=Working paper no. 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, natural resources are treated as limitless and negative outputs such as pollution and associated health risks, are not deducted from the measures.&lt;ref name=Stanton2007/&gt;

''Technical and misinterpretation critiques''

When GNP and GDP were developed, their intended use was not for measuring human well-being; the intended use was as an indicator of economic growth, and that does not necessarily translate into human well-being.&lt;ref name=OECD2006/&gt; Kuznets has often made this point, in his words, "distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and returns and between the short and long run. Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what" (p.&amp;nbsp;9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development | first = OECD | author-link1 = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development | title = The well-being of nations: the role of human and social capital | page = 9 | publisher = Centre for Educational Research and Innovation, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development | location = Paris | year = 2001  | website = www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/40/33703702.pdf | isbn = 9789264185890 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum also points out that GNP and GDP omit income distribution and the opportunity or ability to turn resources into activities (this critique stems directly from Capabilities Approach).&lt;ref name=Nussbaum2004/&gt; Kuznets terms this as a problem of "obtaining an unduplicated total of all output", (p.&amp;nbsp;15)&lt;ref name=Kuznets1947&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kuznets | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Kuznets | title = Measurement of economic growth | journal = The Journal of Economic History | volume = 7 | issue = s1 | pages = 10–34 | publisher = Cambridge Journals | doi = 10.1017/S0022050700065190 | date = January 1947 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022050700065190 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; this suggests that people are only seen as consumers and not as potential producers, hence any products purchased by an individual are not seen as "being consumed in the productive process of turning out other goods" (p.&amp;nbsp;15)&lt;ref name=Kuznets1947/&gt;

These accounting measures also fail to capture all forms of work and only focus on "engagement in work 'for pay or profit{{'"}}, (p.&amp;nbsp;133)&lt;ref name=Beneria2003&gt;{{Citation | last = Benería  | first = Lourdes  | author-link = Lourdes Benería | contribution = Paid and unpaid labor: meanings and debates | editor-last = Benería | editor-first = Lourdes | editor-link = Lourdes Benería | title = Gender, development, and globalization: economics as if all people mattered | pages = 131–160 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415927079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving out contributions to a society and economy, like volunteer work and subsistence farming. Kuznets provides the example of the process by which farmers devote time and energy to bringing virgin land into cultivation.&lt;ref name=Kuznets1947/&gt; Furthermore, GNP and GDP only account for monetary exchanges, and place no value on some important intangibles such as leisure time.&lt;ref name=Stanton2007/&gt;

===Shift to alternative measures===
Capabilities Approach has been highly influential thus far in human development theories and valuational methods of capturing capabilities,&lt;ref name=Anand2009_125/&gt; the theory has led to the creation of the HDI, IHDI and GII and their uses among international organizations such as the United Nations and others. In companies, capabilities are included in [[Key Development Indicator]]s, or KDIs as measures of development, including employee development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aubrey|first1=Bob|title=The Measure of Man: Leading Human Development|date=2015|publisher=McGraw Hill Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 in the [[Human Development Report]] (HDR)commissioned by the UNDP set out to create a distribution-sensitive development measure.&lt;ref name="Reforming"&gt;{{Cite journal |  last1= Klasen |first1= Stephan | last2 = Schüler | first2 = Dana | title = Reforming the gender-related development index and the gender empowerment measure: implementing some specific proposals | journal = Feminist Economics| volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–30 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/13545701.2010.541860 | date = 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13545701.2010.541860 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was created to rival the more traditional metrics of GDP and GNP, which had previously been used to measure level of development in a given country, but which did not contain provisions for terms of distribution.&lt;ref name="Gender"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klasen |first=Stephan |title= UNDP's gender-related measures: some conceptual problems and possible solutions |journal=Journal of Human Development - special issue, Revisiting the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=243–274 |doi=10.1080/14649880600768595  |date=2006 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649880600768595 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting measure was entitled the Human Development Index, created by Mahbub ul Haq in collaboration with Sen and others.  The purpose was to create an indicator of human development, especially one that would provide a general assessment and critique of global human development to shed light on persistent inequality, poverty and other capability deprivations despite high levels of GDP growth.&lt;ref name=Sen2005/&gt;

Currently the HDI continues to be used in the Human Development Report in addition to many other measures (based on theoretical perspectives of Capabilities) that have been developed and used by the United Nations.  Among these indices are the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI), the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM), introduced in 1995, and the more recent [[Gender Inequality Index]] (GII) and the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI), both adopted in 2010.

===Capabilities-based indices===
The following are a few of the major indices that were created based on the theoretical grounds of Capabilities Approach.

====Human development index====

The [[Human Development Index]] takes into consideration a number of development and well-being factors that are not taken into account in the calculation of GDP and GNP. The Human Development Index is calculated using the indicators of life expectancy, adult literacy, school enrollment, and logarithmic transformations of per-capita income.&lt;ref name=Reforming/&gt; Moreover, it is noted that the HDI "is a weighted average of income adjusted for distributions and purchasing power, life expectancy, literacy and health" (p.&amp;nbsp;16)&lt;ref name=Schischka2002&gt;{{Citation | last = Schischka | first = John | chapter = The capabilities approach as a metric for economic development: an application in Nepal | title = Conference proceedings - promoting women's capabilities, examining Nussbaum's capabilities approach | place = von Hügel Institute, St Edmund's College, Cambridge | publisher = The Pennsylvania State University CiteSeerX Archives | date = 9–10 September 2002 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.197.7649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HDI is calculated for individual countries with a value between 0 and 1 and is "interpreted...as the ultimate development that has been attained by that nation" (p.&amp;nbsp;17).&lt;ref name=Schischka2002/&gt; Currently, the 2011 Human Development Report also includes the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index which accounts for exactly the same things that the HDI considers however the IHDI has all three dimensions (long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living) adjusted for inequalities in the distribution of each dimension across the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contribution = Statistical annex: technical notes - technical note 2: calculating the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme  | title = Human development report 2011: sustainability and equity: a better future for all | page = 169 | publisher = United Nations Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York Basingstoke | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780230363311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender-related development index====

The [[Gender-related Development Index]] is defined as a "distribution-sensitive measure that accounts for the human development impact of existing gender gaps in the three components of the HDI" (p.&amp;nbsp;243).&lt;ref name=Gender/&gt; In this way, the GDI accounts for shortcomings in the HDI in terms of gender, because it re-evaluates a country's score in the three areas of the HDI based on perceived gender gaps, and penalizes the score of the country if, indeed, large gender disparities in those areas exist. This index is used in unison with the HDI and therefore also captures the elements of capabilities that the HDI holds. In addition, it considers women's capabilities which has been a focus in much of Sen's and Nussbaum's work (to list a few: Nussbaum, 2004a; Nussbaum, 2004b; Sen, 2001; Sen, 1990.)

====Gender empowerment measure====

The [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM) is considerably more specialized than the GDI. The GEM focuses particularly on the relative empowerment of women in a given country.&lt;ref name=Gender/&gt; The empowerment of women is measured by evaluating women's employment in high-ranking economic positions, seats in parliament, and share of household income. Notably this measurement captures more of Nussbaum's 10 Central Capabilities, such as, Senses, Imagination and Thought; Affiliation; and Control Over Ones Environment.

====Gender inequality index====

In the 2013 Human Development Report the Gender Inequality Index, which was introduced in 2011, continues to adjust the GDI and the GEM. This composite measurement uses three dimensions: [[reproductive health]], empowerment, and labor force participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contribution = Chapter 1: The state of human development (progress of nations, equity and human development): Gender and women's status | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme  | title = Human development report 2013: the rise of the South: human progress in a diverse world | page = 31 | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = New York, NY | year = 2013 | isbn = 9789211263404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When constructing the index the following criteria were key: conceptual relevance to definitions of human development and theory; Non-ambiguity so that the index is easily interpreted; Reliability of data that is standardized and collected/processed by a trustworthy organization; No redundancy found in other indicators; and lastly Power of discrimination, where distribution is well distinguished among countries and there is no "bunching" among top and bottom countries (p.&amp;nbsp;10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Gaye | first1 = Amie | last2 = Klugman | first2 = Jeni | last3 = Kovacevic | first3 = Milorad | last4 = Twigg | first4 = Sarah | last5 = Zambrano | first5 = Eduardo| author-link2 = Jeni Klugman | contribution = 3: Introducing the gender inequality index - 3.1: Selection of dimensions and indicators | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme  | title = Human development research paper 2010/46 - Measuring key disparities in human development: the gender inequality index | pages = 9–10 | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = New York, NY | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This index also captures some of Nussbaum's 10 Central Capabilities (Senses, Imagination and Thought; Affiliation; and Control Over Ones Environment).

====Other measures====

In 1997, the UNDP introduced the Human Poverty Index  (HPI), which is aimed at measuring poverty in both industrialized and developing countries. The HPI is a "nonincome-based" measure of poverty (p.&amp;nbsp;100) which focuses on "human outcomes in terms of choices and opportunities that a person faces" (p.&amp;nbsp;99).&lt;ref name=Fukuda-Parr1999&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fukuda-Parr | first1 = Sakiko | author-link = Sakiko Fukuda-Parr | title = What does feminization of poverty mean? It isn't just lack of income | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–103 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/135457099337996 | date = 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/135457099337996 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this index, [[Sakiko Fukuda-Parr]]—a development economist and past Director of The Human Development Report Office—differentiates between income poverty and human poverty.  Human poverty can be interpreted as deprivations to lead a long healthy and creative life with a decent standard of living.&lt;ref name=Fukuda-Parr1999/&gt;

=== Economic evaluation in health care ===
The capability approach is being developed and increasingly applied in [[health economics]], for use in [[cost-effectiveness analysis]]. It is seen as an alternative to existing preference-based measures of health-related quality of life (for example the [[EQ-5D]]) that focus on functioning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Welfarism, extra-welfarism and capability: The spread of ideas in health economics|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795360800333X|journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine|date = 2008-10-01|pages = 1190–1198|volume = 67|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.06.027|first = Joanna|last = Coast|first2 = Richard D.|last2 = Smith|first3 = Paula|last3 = Lorgelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Choice of Outcome Measure in an Economic Evaluation: A Potential Role for the Capability Approach|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40273-015-0275-x|journal = PharmacoEconomics|date = 2015-04-11|issn = 1170-7690|pages = 849–855|volume = 33|issue = 8|doi = 10.1007/s40273-015-0275-x|language = en|first = Paula K.|last = Lorgelly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be applied within the framework of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = QALYs and the capability approach|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hec.975/abstract|journal = Health Economics|date = 2005-08-01|issn = 1099-1050|pages = 817–829|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1002/hec.975|language = en|first = Richard|last = Cookson}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of measures have been created for use in particular contexts such as older people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessing quality of life among British older people using the ICEPOP CAPability (ICECAP-O) measure|journal = Applied Health Economics and Health Policy|date = 2011-09-01|issn = 1179-1896|pmid = 21875162|pages = 317–329|volume = 9|issue = 5|doi = 10.2165/11594150-000000000-00000|first = Terry N.|last = Flynn|first2 = Phil|last2 = Chan|first3 = Joanna|last3 = Coast|first4 = Tim J.|last4 = Peters}}&lt;/ref&gt; public health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Operationalising the capability approach as an outcome measure in public health: The development of the OCAP-18|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361530054X|journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine|date = 2015-10-01|pages = 68–81|volume = 142|doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.08.002|first = Paula K.|last = Lorgelly|first2 = Karen|last2 = Lorimer|first3 = Elisabeth A.

===Alternative measures of well-being===

As noted above, to a great extent, Nussbaum's Central Human Capabilities address issues of equality, political freedom, creativity and the right to the self, as do the various indices that are based on capabilities.  It is evident that these measures are very subjective, but this fact is in the essence of defining quality of life according to Nussbaum and Sen. Nussbaum refers to Sen in saying that, although measures of well-being may be problematic in comparative, quantifiable models due to their subjective matter, the protection of and commitment to human development are too important of matters to be left on the sidelines of economic progress.  Well-being and quality of life are too important to be left without intentional focus towards political change.&lt;ref name= Nussbaum2003/&gt;

Measures such as the HDI, GDI, GEM, GII, IHDI and the like are crucial in targeting issues of well-being and indicators of quality of life. Anand, et al. (2009) can be summarized as demonstrating that it is possible to measure capabilities within the conventions applied to standard household survey design, contrary to earlier doubts about the ability to operationalise the capabilities approach.

== Contrast with other approaches ==

===Utility-based or subjective approaches ===
Much of conventional [[welfare economics]] today is grounded in a [[utilitarian]] approach according to the classical Benthamite form of [[utilitarianism]], in which the most desirable action is the one that best increases peoples' psychological [[happiness]] or satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Alkire2009/&gt; The "[[utility]]" of a person stands for some measure of his or her [[pleasure]] or [[happiness]]. Some merits associated with this approach to measuring well-being are that it recognizes the importance of taking account of the results of social arrangements in judging them and the need to pay attention to the well-being of the people involved when judging social arrangements and their results.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt;  Amartya Sen, however, argues this view has three main deficiencies: distributional indifference, neglect of [[rights]], [[freedoms]] and other non-utility concerns, and adaptation and mental conditioning.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt;

Distributional indifference refers to a utilitarian indifference between different the distributions of utility, so long as the sum total is the same (note that the utilitarian is indifferent to the distribution of happiness, not income or wealth - the utilitarian approach would generally prefer, all else being equal, more materially equal societies assuming [[diminishing marginal utility]]). Sen argues that we may "want to pay attention not just to "aggregate" magnitudes, but also to extents of inequalities in happiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sen|first1=Amartya|title=Development as freedom|date=2000|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0385720274|page=62|edition= 1st Anchor Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sen also argues that while the [[utilitarian]] approach attaches no [[intrinsic value (ethics)]] to claims of rights and freedoms, some people value these things independently of their contribution to utility.

Lastly, Amartya Sen makes the argument that the [[utilitarian]] view of individual well-being can be easily swayed by mental conditioning and peoples' happiness adapting to [[oppressive]] situations. The [[utility calculus]] can essentially be unfair to those who have come to terms with their deprivation as a means for survival, adjusting their desires and expectations. The capability approach, on the other hand, doesn't fall victim to these same criticisms because it acknowledges inequalities by focusing on equalizing people's capabilities, not happiness, it stresses the intrinsic importance of rights and freedoms when evaluating well-being, and it avoids overlooking deprivation  by focusing on capabilities and opportunities, not state of mind.

=== Resource-based approaches ===
Another common approach in conventional economics, in [[economic policy]] and judging development, has traditionally been to focus on [[income]] and [[resources]]. These sorts of approaches to development focus on increasing resources, such as assets, property rights, or basic needs.&lt;ref name=Alkire2009 /&gt; However, measuring resources is fundamentally different from measuring functionings, such as the case in which people don't have the capability to use their resources in the means they see fit. Arguably, the main difficulty in a resource- or income-based approach to well-being lies in personal heterogeneities, namely the diversity of human beings.&lt;ref name=Sen1999 /&gt;

Different amounts of income are needed for different individuals to enjoy similar capabilities, such as an individual with severe [[disabilities]] whose treatment to ensure the fulfillment of basic capabilities may require dramatically more income compared to an able-bodied person. All sorts of differences, such as differences in age, gender, talents, etc. can make two people have extremely divergent opportunities of [[quality of life]], even when equipped with exactly the same commodities. Additionally, other contingent circumstances which affect what an individual can make of a given set of resources include environmental diversities (in geographic sense), variations in social climate, differences in relational perspectives, and distribution within the family.&lt;ref name=Sen1999 /&gt;

The capability approach, however, seeks to consider all such circumstances when evaluating people's actual capabilities. Furthermore, there are things people value other than increased resources. In some cases, maximizing resources may even be objectionable. As was recognized in the 1990 [[Human Development Report]], the basic objective of development is to create an enabling environment for people to live long, healthy, and creative lives. This end is often lost in the immediate concern with the accumulation of commodities and financial wealth that are only a means to expansion of capabilities. Overall, though resources and income have a profound effect on what we can or cannot do, the capability approach recognizes that they are not the only things to be considered when judging well-being, switching the focus from a means to a good life to the freedom to achieve actual improvements in lives, which one has reason to value.

==Research Programs==


===Bioinformatics and Genomics===

There are several lines of research within Bioinformatics and Genomics. Gene Prediction and Modeling of Splicing is related to the research on Regulation of Alternative Splicing, Regulation of Protein Synthesis within the Gene Regulation program, and Genes and Diseases program. Another research line involves identification and characterization of genomic regions associated with gene regulation. This is connected to research on Chromatin and Gene Expression, as well as research on RNA proteins interactions. Yet another line of research pertains to Molecular Evolution, which includes evolution of the exonic structure of genes and splicing.

Within this program, there is also a group that studies microarrays. 

The "Bioinformatics" program is associated with the Research Group in Biomedical Informatics (GRIB). In this group, research lines in Molecular Modeling, Protein Structure Prediction, and Complex Systems are in their nascent stages. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;2013. Centre for Genome Regulation. Retrieved from www.crg.eu/en&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell and Developmental Biology===

Cell and Developmental Biology, or CDB, is built on the idea that the cell should be the primary focus of developmental biology, and that a cell ought to be understood in the context of its 'host' organism. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Because the principles that underlie the behavior of proteins within and across cells are poorly understood, the CDB program aims to study the interactions between intercellular signaling systems and the cytoskeleton. Another goal is to understand how this affects cellular spatial organization and information processing. Methods include multidimensional phenotypes grounded in genomics and proteomics. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Gene Regulation, Stem Cells, and Cancer===

The Gene Regulation, Stem Cells, and Cancer program focus on mechanisms of gene expression, mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, and the molecular underpinnings of cellular operations pertaining to tissue homeostasis and cancer. Gene regulation studies include the organization and evolution of the regulatory genome, chromatin composition and transcriptional regulation mediated by steroid hormones, epigenetic mechanisms in leukemia and stem cells, regulation of periodic splicing and mRNA translation, and gene function and epigenetic reprogramming in embryogenesis and the germline. Stem cell research includes differentiation and transdifferentiation in the hematopoietic system, somatic cell reprogramming, and tissue regeneration. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Systems Biology===

Systems Biology research includes dynamic gene regulatory networks and systems neuroscience. Some models used are prokaryotes, cell lines, C. elegans, Drosophila, and mice. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

This research program combines systematic and quantitative data collection with computational models, with the goal of discovering dynamic comprehension of complex biological processes. An interdisciplinary approach is applied, as physicists, mathematicians, and computer scientists are brought together. Some particular topics of investigation are: signal transduction, gene regulatory networks, multicellular patterning, chemotaxis, systems neuroscience, the evolution of networks, and the effect of stochastic noise at the organism level. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===International Projects===
====Reconstitution of cell polarity and axis determination in a cell-free system====
Cell polarity is a prerequisite for several fundamental operations in animal cells, such as asymmetric cell division and morphogenesis. For both of these, polarization is determined by the same set of proteins, known as PAR proteins. It is not known how these proteins set polarity. The investigators have proposed a dual approach, combining in vitro and cell extract techniques. The goal is to gain knowledge about the micrometer scale behavior of the polarizing system, as well as the attributes of its components. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====Methods for high-resolution analysis of generic effects on gene expression====
Many of the common genetic signals associated with disease are found far from the DNA sequence that encodes for protein sequence. It is probable that they play a role in regulating gene expression. In this project, the investigators develop methodologies that will explore the effects of genetic variation in gene expression. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====Risk prediction in age-related diseases====
This program studies major changes in contemporary society and its concomitant risks. This project integrates molecular, cellular, computational and systems biology approaches in model organisms and human diseases to study the genetic causes of age-related sicknesses. One aim is to create new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Core Facilities===
====Advanced Light Microscopy Unit====
The Advanced Light Microscopy Unit provides instruments that cover the entire application spectrum of advanced light microscopy. Equipment for sample preparation and maintenance are under the responsibility of this unit. Support is also ensured during the processing, rendering, and analysis of the acquired datasets. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Available technology covers: super-resolution microscopy, two photon microscopy, confocal microscopy, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, microinjection, microdissection, image processing and analysis, and other areas. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====Bioinformatics Unit====
The Bioinformatics Unit grants researchers services of consultation, experiment planning, data processing, software and database development, bioinformatics training, and access to high-performance computing resources. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Among the services offered are: sample handling and sequencing, grant proposal development, variant detection in genomics, quality assessment of assemblies, analysis of high-throughput data, identification of microbial and fungi communities from sequences, and protein functional annotation. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====Tissue Engineering Unit====
The goal of the Tissue Engineering Unit is to provide researchers with cutting edge technologies for stem cell biology, stem cell differentiation, [[organoid]] formation, and induced pluripotent stem cells. This unit collaborates with the Biomolecular Screening &amp; Protein Technologies Unit for genome editing technology services. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The study of '''[[neural development]] in humans''' draws on both [[neuroscience]] and [[developmental biology]] to describe the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which complex [[nervous system]]s emerge during [[morphogenesis|embryonic development]] and throughout life.

Some landmarks of [[embryo]]nic neural development include the birth and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of [[neuron]]s from [[stem cells|stem cell]] precursors, the [[cellular migration|migration]] of immature neurons from their birthplaces in the embryo to their final positions, outgrowth of [[axon]]s from neurons and [[axon guidance|guidance]] of the motile [[growth cone]] through the embryo towards postsynaptic partners, the generation of [[synapse]]s between these axons and their postsynaptic partners, the [[synaptic pruning|neuron pruning]] that occurs in [[adolescence]], and finally the lifelong [[synaptic plasticity|changes in synapses]] which are thought to underlie learning and memory.

Typically, these neurodevelopmental processes can be broadly divided into two classes: activity-independent mechanisms and activity-dependent mechanisms.  Activity-independent mechanisms are generally believed to occur as hardwired processes determined by genetic programs played out within individual neurons. These include [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]], [[cellular migration|migration]] and [[axon guidance]] to their initial target areas.  These processes are thought of as being independent of neural activity and sensory experience.   Once [[axon]]s reach their target areas, activity-dependent mechanisms come into play.  Neural activity and sensory experience will mediate formation of new [[synapses]], as well as [[synaptic plasticity]], which will be responsible for refinement of the nascent neural circuits.

==Embryonic stage==

===Neurulation===
{{Main article|neurulation}}
:''See [[embryogenesis]] for understanding the animal development up to this stage.''
Neurulation is the formation of the [[neural tube]] from the [[ectoderm]] of the embryo.  It follows [[gastrulation]] in all vertebrates.

During gastrulation cells migrate to the interior of embryo, forming three [[germ layer]]s&amp;mdash; the endoderm (the deepest layer), mesoderm and ectoderm (the surface layer)&amp;mdash;from which all tissues and organs will arise. In a simplified way, it can be said that the ectoderm gives rise to [[skin]] and nervous system, the endoderm to the [[Gastrointestinal tract|guts]] and the mesoderm to the rest of the [[organ (biology)|organ]]s.

After gastrulation the [[notochord]]&amp;mdash;a flexible, rod-shaped body that runs along the back of the embryo&amp;mdash;has been formed from the mesoderm.  During the third week of gestation the notochord sends chemical signals to the overlying ectoderm, inducing it to become neuroectoderm.  This results in a strip of neuronal stem cells that runs along the back of the embryo.  This strip is called the [[neural plate]], and is the origin of the entire nervous system.  The neural plate folds outwards to form the [[neural groove]].  Beginning in the future neck region, the [[neural folds]] of this groove close to create the [[neural tube]] (this form of neurulation is called [[primary neurulation]]).  The ventral (front) part of the neural tube is called the [[basal plate (neural tube)|basal plate]]; the dorsal (rear) part is called the [[alar plate]].  The hollow interior is called the [[neural canal]].  By the end of the fourth week of gestation, the open ends of the neural tube (the '''neuropores''') close off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Estomih Mtui |author2=Gregory Gruener |title=Clinical Neuroanatomy and Neuroscience |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2006 |pages=1 |isbn=1-4160-3445-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of the spinal cord===

[[File:Gray640.png|thumb|Cross-section of a developing spinal cord at four weeks.]]The spinal cord forms from the lower part of the neural tube.  The wall of the neural tube consists of neuroepithelial cells, which differentiate into neuroblasts, forming the mantle layer (the gray matter).  Nerve fibers emerge from these neuroblasts to form the marginal layer (the white matter).

The ventral part of the mantle layer (the basal plates) forms the motor areas of the spinal cord, whilst the dorsal part (the alar plates) forms the sensory areas.  Between the basal and alar plates is an intermediate layer that contains neurons of the autonomic nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://embryo.chronolab.com/spinal.htm Atlas of Human Embryology, Chronolab].

===Formation of the brain===

[[File:4 week embryo brain.jpg|150px|thumb|right|The embryo's brain at four weeks.]]
Late in the fourth week, the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future midbrain&amp;mdash;the [[mesencephalon]].  Above the [[mesencephalon]] is the [[prosencephalon]] (future forebrain) and beneath it is the [[rhombencephalon]] (future hindbrain).  The [[optical vesicle]] (which will eventually become the optic nerve, retina and iris) forms at the basal plate of the prosencephalon.

[[File:6 week human embryo nervous system.svg|thumb|right|The embryo's nervous system at six weeks.]]
In the fifth week, the alar plate of the prosencephalon expands to form the cerebral hemispheres (the [[telencephalon]]).  The basal plate becomes the [[diencephalon]].

The diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon constitute the [[brain stem]] of the embryo.  It continues to flex at the mesencephalon.  The rhombencephalon folds posteriorly, which causes its alar plate to flare and form the fourth ventricle of the brain.  The [[pons]] and the [[cerebellum]] form in the upper part of the rhombencephalon, whilst the medulla oblongata forms in the lower part.

==Neuronal migration== &lt;!--Neuronal migration redirects here--&gt;
Neuronal [[Cellular migration|migration]] is the method by which neurons travel from their origin or birthplace to their final position in the brain. There most common means of migration are radial and tangential migration.  

===Radial migration===
Neuronal precursor cells proliferate in the ventricular zone of the developing [[neocortex]]. The first  [[mitosis|postmitotic]] cells to migrate from the preplate which are destined to become [[Cajal-Retzius cells]] and [[subplate]] neurons. These cells do so by somal translocation. Neurons migrating with this mode of locomotion are bipolar and attach the leading edge of the process to the [[Pia mater|pia]]. The [[soma (biology)|soma]] is then transported to the pial surface by nucleokenisis, a process by which a [[microtubules|microtubule]] "cage" around the nucleus elongates and contracts in association with the [[centrosome]] to guide the nucleus to its final destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Samuels BA, Tsai LH | title = Nucleokinesis illuminated | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 1169–70 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15508010 | doi = 10.1038/nn1104-1169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radial fibres (also known as radial glia) can translocate to the cortical plate and differentiate either into [[astrocyte]]s or [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell K, Götz M | title = Radial glia: multi-purpose cells for vertebrate brain development | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 235–8 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11972958 | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(02)02156-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Somal translocation can occur at any time during development.&lt;ref name=Nadar1&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nadarajah B, Brunstrom JE, Grutzendler J, Wong RO, Pearlman AL | title = Two modes of radial migration in early development of the cerebral cortex | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–50 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11175874 | doi = 10.1038/83967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent waves of neurons split the preplate by migrating along [[radial glia]]l fibres to form the cortical plate. Each wave of migrating cells travel past their predecessors forming layers in an inside-out manner, meaning that the youngest neurons are the closest to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nadarajah B, Parnavelas JG | title = Modes of neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex | journal = Nature Reviews. Neuroscience | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 423–32 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12042877 | doi = 10.1038/nrn845 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rakic P | title = Mode of cell migration to the superficial layers of fetal monkey neocortex | journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology | volume = 145 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–83 | date = May 1972 | pmid = 4624784 | doi = 10.1002/cne.901450105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that glial guided migration represents 80-90% of migrating neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~sereno/201/readings/03.08-NeuralMigration.pdf|title=Central Nervous System Neuronal Migration|last=Hatten|first=Mary|publisher=Annual Reviews in Neuroscience|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Axophilic migration===
Many neurons migrating along the anterior-posterior axis of the body use existing axon tracts to migrate along in a process called axophilic migration. An example of this mode of migration is in [[GnRH Neuron|GnRH-expressing neurons]], which make a long journey from their birthplace in the nose, through the forebrain, and into the hypothalamus.&lt;ref name=Wray10&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wray S | title = From nose to brain: development of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-1 neurones | journal = Journal of Neuroendocrinology | volume = 22 | issue = 7 | pages = 743–53 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20646175 | pmc = 2919238 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2826.2010.02034.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the mechanisms of this migration have been worked out, starting with the extracellular guidance cues&lt;ref name=Giacobini07&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giacobini P, Messina A, Wray S, Giampietro C, Crepaldi T, Carmeliet P, Fasolo A | title = Hepatocyte growth factor acts as a motogen and guidance signal for gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone-1 neuronal migration | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 431–45 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17215404 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4979-06.2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that trigger intracellular signaling. These intracellular signals, such as [[calcium signaling]], lead to [[actin]] &lt;ref name=Hutchins13&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hutchins BI, Klenke U, Wray S | title = Calcium release-dependent actin flow in the leading process mediates axophilic migration | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 33 | issue = 28 | pages = 11361–71 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23843509 | pmc = 3724331 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3758-12.2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and microtubule &lt;ref name=Hutchins14&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hutchins BI, Wray S | title = Capture of microtubule plus-ends at the actin cortex promotes axophilic neuronal migration by enhancing microtubule tension in the leading process | journal = Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | volume = 8 | pages = 400 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25505874 | pmc = 4245908 | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2014.00400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; cytoskeletal dynamics, which produce cellular forces that interact with the extracellular environment through cell adhesion proteins &lt;ref name=Parkash12&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parkash J, Cimino I, Ferraris N, Casoni F, Wray S, Cappy H, Prevot V, Giacobini P | title = Suppression of β1-integrin in gonadotropin-releasing hormone cells disrupts migration and axonal extension resulting in severe reproductive alterations | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 32 | issue = 47 | pages = 16992–7002 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23175850 | pmc = 5238668 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3057-12.2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to cause the movement of these cells.

===Tangential migration===
Most interneurons migrate tangentially through multiple modes of migration to reach their appropriate location in the cortex. An example of tangential migration is the movement of [[Cajal–Retzius cell|Cajal-Retzius cells]] within the marginal zone of the cortical neuroepithelium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen JP, Zhang DW, Liu JM | title = Exotic skyrmion crystals in chiral magnets with compass anisotropy | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 29126 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27377149 | pmc = 4932608 | doi = 10.1038/srep29126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Others===
There is also a method of neuronal migration called '''multipolar migration'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabata H, Nakajima K | title = Multipolar migration: the third mode of radial neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 31 | pages = 9996–10001 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14602813 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/23/31/9996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nadarajah B, Alifragis P, Wong RO, Parnavelas JG | title = Neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex: observations based on real-time imaging | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 607–11 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12764035 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.6.607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen in  multipolar cells, which are abundantly present in the [[cortical intermediate zone]]. They do not resemble the cells migrating by locomotion or somal translocation. Instead these multipolar cells express neuronal markers and extend multiple thin processes in various directions independently of the radial glial fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabata H, Nakajima K | title = Multipolar migration: the third mode of radial neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 31 | pages = 9996–10001 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14602813 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14602813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurotrophic factors==
[[Neurotrophic factor]]s are molecules which promote and regulate neuronal survival in the developing nervous system. They are distinguished from ubiquitous [[metabolite]]s necessary for cellular maintenance and growth by their specificity; each neurotrophic factor promotes the survival of only certain kinds of neurons during a particular stage of their development. In addition, it had been argued that neurotrophic factors are involved in many other aspects of [[neuronal development]] ranging from axonal guidance to regulation of neurotransmitter synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Alan M. Davies (1 May 1988)"Trends In Genetics", Volume 4-Issue 5; Department of Anatomy, St George's Hospital Medical School, Cranmer Terrace, Tooting, London SW17 0RE, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult neurogenesis==
{{main article|Adult neurogenesis}}
Contrary to popular belief, [[neurogenesis]] also occurs in specific parts of the adult brain.

==Adult neural development==
{{Main article|Neuroregeneration}}
Neurodevelopment in the adult nervous system includes mechanisms such as [[remyelination]], generation of new [[neuron]]s, [[glia]], [[axon]]s, [[myelin]] or [[synapse]]s. Neuroregeneration differs between the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS) and the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) by the functional mechanisms and especially, the extent and speed.

The term was first introduced in a paper in Nature Biotechnology by [[Sachin H. Jain]] and [[John Brownstein]].&lt;ref name="JainPowers2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jain|first1=Sachin H|last2=Powers|first2=Brian W|last3=Hawkins|first3=Jared B|last4=Brownstein|first4=John S|title=The digital phenotype|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=33|issue=5|year=2015|pages=462–463|issn=1087-0156|doi=10.1038/nbt.3223|pmid=25965751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smartphones are well suited to digital phenotyping given their widespread adoption and ownership, the extent to which users engage with the devices, and richness of data that may be collected from them. Smartphone data can be used to study behavioral patterns, social interactions, physical mobility, gross motor activity, and speech production, among others. Smartphone ownership has been in steady rise globally over the past few years. For example, in the U.S., smartphone [[ownership]] among adults increased from 35% in 2011 to 64% in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/|title=U.S. Smartphone Use in 2015|last=Smith|first=Aaron|date=2015-04-01|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017 an estimated 95% of Americans own a cellphone of some kind and 77% own a smartphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/mobile/|title=Mobile Fact Sheet|date=2017-01-12|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of passive data collection from smartphone devices can provide granular information relevant to psychiatric and other illness phenotypes. Types of relevant passive data include [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] data to monitor spatial location, [[accelerometer]] data to record movement and gross motor activity, and call and messaging logs to document [[social engagement]] with others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torous|first=John|last2=Staples|first2=Patrick|last3=Onnela|first3=Jukka-Pekka|date=2015-08-01|title=Realizing the Potential of Mobile Mental Health: New Methods for New Data in Psychiatry|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|language=en|volume=17|issue=8|pages=61|doi=10.1007/s11920-015-0602-0|issn=1523-3812|pmc=4608747|pmid=26073363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31163">A '''drought refuge''' is a site that provides permanent [[fresh water]] or moist conditions for plants and animals, acting as a [[Refuge (ecology)|refuge]] habitat when surrounding areas are affected by [[drought]] and allowing [[ecosystem]]s and core species populations to survive until the drought breaks.  Drought refuges are important for conserving ecosystems in places where the effects of climatic variability are exacerbated by human activities.

==Description==
Reliable drought refuges are characterised by the ability to retain sufficient water throughout the drought, having [[water quality]] good enough to maintain the life of the ecosystem that are not subject to physical disturbance and that have access to surrounding habitat, so that refugees can [[recolonise]] the main habitat when the drought ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ewater.com.au/drought/refuge_habitats.shtml |title=Refuge habitats |accessdate=2011-09-02 |work=Drought Science |first= |last= |publisher= eWater CRC |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Drought refuge is a secure place persisting through a disturbance with the critical criterion being that after the disturbance the refuge provides colonist to allow populations to recover."{{Quote without source|date=September 2018}}

For some species the refuge is their only water source and is necessary for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Lake, P. Sam ''Drought and Aquatic Ecosystems: Effects and Responses''&lt;/ref&gt; For birds and invertebrate taxa, the drought refuge is not only necessary for survival but contribute to their reproductive success. Some organisms that are able to adapt to the environment when there is a drought but adapting traits that will be beneficial for survival in a prolong drought is extremely difficult to accomplish.

==Terms ''refuge'' and ''drought''==
The term ''[[refugium (population biology)|refugium]]'' (plural: ''refugia'') was originally used by evolutionary biologists for refuges that protected entire species from disturbance events of large temporal and spatial scales, such as glaciation or the long-term effects of climate change.&lt;ref name =Robson5&gt;Robson, B. J., Chester, E. T., Mitchell, B. D., &amp; Matthews, T. G. (2013). Disturbance and the role of refuges in mediterranean climate streams. ''Hydrobiologia'', 719(1), 77–91.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] involves a temporary removal of biomass resulting in change in physical environment.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a&gt;Parkos, J. J., Ruetz, C. R., Trexler, J. C. (2011). Disturbance regime and limits on benefits of refuge use for fishes in a fluctuating hydroscape. Oikos, 120(10), 1519-1530.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller-scale [[ecologists]] now use this term synonymously with the simpler term ''[[refuge (population biology)|refuge]]'', to define places that protect populations of plants or animals from smaller-scale disturbances, such as fire, flood, storm, or human impacts.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; [[Refugium (population biology)|Refugia]] are the habitats or environmental factors that give spatial and temporal resistance and resilience to biotic communities impacted by disturbance.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a&gt;Magoulick, D. D., &amp; Kobza, R. M. (2003). The role of refugia for fishes during drought: A review and synthesis. ''Freshwater Biology'', 48, 1186–1198.&lt;/ref&gt; Here negative effects of disturbance are lower than surrounding areas or times.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Refugia buffer species long-term, where as, a refuge buffers species short-term.&lt;ref name=Kath1a&gt;Kath, J., Powell, S., Reardon-Smith, K., El Sawah, S., Jakeman, A. J., Croke, B. F. W., &amp; Dyer, F. J. (2015). Groundwater salinization intensifies drought impacts in forests and reduces refuge capacity. ''Journal of Applied Ecology'', 52, 1116–1125.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other uses of the term ''refuge'', such as for a wildlife reserve or a place free from predators (predation refuge).&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; A refuge is a place or situation that provides safety or shelter.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Here, species are minimally affected by changing climate conditions.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt;

Lack of [[precipitation]] causes drying of aquatic ecosystems and leads to a natural disturbance called a [[drought]].&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; In order for organisms to survive a drought, the disturbance must be minimal or there must be a drought refuge available.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;

==Effects of drought==
The severity of a disturbance is measured by its intensity, duration, and recovery time.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Intensity and duration influence the strength of a disturbance and the likelihood of the survival of [[organisms]] within an area.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Recovery time influences the level of recovery abundance and composition in a disturbed habitat until next [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] forces [[species]] to seek shelter.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  Disturbances, such as drought, influence [[space|spatial]] and [[Time|temporal]] patterns of refuge use, as well as the role of refuges in community dynamics.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  [[Climate variability|Variability]] in patterns of disturbance affect refuge use patterns and community structure.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  Decreased time between disturbances increases refuge usage until a certain frequency is reached and the usage declines as a result of the weakening [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] of a species.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Refuge [[Biodegradation|degradation]] increases mortality for sensitive species during larger disturbance times.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;

Droughts decrease surface area and volume, while increasing [[physical body|physical]] and [[chemical]] water quality extremes, such as, temperature levels, oxygen concentration and water levels.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; This links with interactions that structure the communities of different species and affects mortality, birth and migration rates.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; During a [[drought]], species must seek refuge or have [[adaptations]] that provide refuge.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;

Hydrological extremes, such as [[flood]] and [[drought]], modify habitats.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a&gt;Stubbington, R. (2012). The hyporheic zone as an invertebrate refuge: A review of variability in space, time, taxa and behavior. Marine and Freshwater Research, 63(4), 293-311.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Droughts]] lead to not only the loss of habitats, but also to [[isolation (habitat)|isolated]] habitat patches created by the separation of [[populations]] which together form a [[meta population]].&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Increased [[density]] of [[organisms]] is another result of droughts.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt;  Increased organism density leads to [[resource]] limitations, movement limitations, increased [[competition]], and increased [[predation]] pressure.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Droughts also cause changes in food resources and water quality.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt;

==Function and importance of drought refuges==
Drought refuges protect [[plant]] and [[animal]] populations from extreme weather events as [[climate]] trends evolve .&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bateman1&gt;Bateman, B. L., Pidgeon, A. M., Radeloff, V. C., Allstadt, A. J., Akcakaya, H., R., Thogmartin, W. E., Vavrus, S. J., &amp; Heglund, P. J. (2015). The importance of range edges for an irruptive species during extreme weather events. Landscape Ecology, 30(6), 1095-1110.&lt;/ref&gt;  They serve as places that support populations of plants and animals not able to live elsewhere in a [[landscape]] during disturbance events, whether those events are [[seasonal]] and relatively predictable, or otherwise.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; A [[habitats]] ability to act as a refuge depends on the disturbance.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt;  The ability of a refuge to [[retain]] water becomes essential for the maintenance of most populations.&lt;ref name=Humphries3&gt;Humphries, P., &amp; Baldwin, D. S. (2003). Drought and aquatic ecosystems: An introduction. Freshwater Biology, 48(7), 1141-1146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robson4&gt;Robson, B. J., &amp; Matthews, T. G. (2004). Drought refuges affect algal recolonisation in intermittent streams. River Research and Applications, 20(7), 753-763.&lt;/ref&gt; Refuges of sufficient size and duration maintain populations, sustain [[biodiversity]] and may harbour [[relict]] populations.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; They are of particular importance during increasing [[aridification]] when few other suitable habitats remain.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; [[Biota (ecology)|Biota]] depend heavily on seasonal refuges.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Refuges increase survival rate and recovery time of populations experiencing an environmental disturbance.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Refugial effectiveness is the ability of a refuge to fulfill habitat-related criteria.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt;  Knowledge of refuges in [[mediterranean]] and [[semi-arid]] streams and rivers has increased during the last decade.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;

The disturbance process and the [[Colonisation (biology)|recolonization]] process are two [[ecological]] processes which are associated with how refuges function.&lt;ref name=Chester2&gt;Chester, E. T., &amp; Robinson, B. J. (2011). Drought refuges, spatial scale and recolonisation by invertebrates in non-perennial streams. Freshwater Biology, 56(10), 2094-2104.&lt;/ref&gt; The disturbance process makes locations into refuges and the recolonization process restocks the wider [[landscape]] once a disturbance has passed.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt;   Recolonization is driven by [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]], local survival in drought refuges, or [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]], high local [[Death|mortality]] with individuals moving back to streams when conditions improve.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pires3a&gt;Pires, D. F., Pires, A. M., Collares, M. J., &amp; Magalhaes, M. F. (2010). Variation in fish assemblages across dry-season pools in a Mediterranean stream: Effects of pool morphology, physicochemical factors and spatial context. Ecology of Freshwater Fish, 19, 74-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The processes of disturbance, refuge formation, refuge function and recolonization occur at varying temporal and spatial scales.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Humphries3 /&gt;  The [[spatial distribution]] of refuges influences the usage and recolonization.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Spatial factors alone have a small contribution. Refuges vary with [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[physicochemical]] factors as well; contribution is shared.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Refuges can be small or large and can be used for short or long periods of time.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;

Refugia are relative depending on species [[adaptations]], spatial and temporal scale, and disturbance regime.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;  Many relative influences are unclear as each situation is different.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Drought refuges are important for sustaining biodiversity over larger spatial scales.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt;

[[Perennial water]]s are the most important drought refuge.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; As refuges, they require the least investment by stream [[invertebrates]] and have the greatest [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennial surface water is crucial to the survival of [[macroinvertebrate]] and [[fish]].&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Differences in [[longitude|longitudinal]] pattern affect the location and function of perennial water refuges.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;

Refuge occupancy is predictable based on [[species]]' [[Phenotypic trait|traits]], but not all suitable refuges within a system are occupied.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Refuge community structure is mostly constant because the response to a disturbance carries across a species; the same species takes advantage of the same type of refuge.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Refugia play a central role in the structuring of communities.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;  Most non-perennial stream [[taxa]] appear to have more than one potential refuge from drought.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; The primary determinant of which drought refuges a species uses in a landscape are its [[intrinsic]] traits.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt;

There are specific regions (refuges) to which individuals move during a drought, and within these regions there are specific characteristics of sites used as refuges by different species.&lt;ref name=Bateman1 /&gt; A species may use more than one type of refuge during its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; A variation in refuge use is caused by [[topography]], individual species [[susceptible individual|susceptibility]] and response to disturbance.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Patterns of refuge use are influenced by disturbance type, species type, patch size, potential occupants and location.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; These patterns are poorly understood.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt;

Drought refuges form [[patch dynamics|habitat mosaics]] which are prone to increased [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] by flow regulation.&lt;ref name=Robson4 /&gt; Some mosaics are more vulnerable to water [[abstraction]] than others.&lt;ref name=Robson4 /&gt; The drying of pools results in a patchy mosaic of pools in a dry channel which vary in suitability for different species and life stages.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Different species favor different sized pools in different locations with different [[physicochemical]] properties.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Refuges with low abundance of species require less effort to be adequate than diverse refuges.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; The size of a pool influences the set of species, total number of organisms, and assembly structure because of physicochemical factors.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; [[Species richness]] and [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]] are related to pool [[morphology (biology)|morphology]].&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; [[Shade (shadow)|Shade]], [[location (geography)|location]], and [[soil]] composition are all contributing factors.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Heavily shaded pools have colder water, where as lightly shaded pools have increased levels of primary productivity.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Large refuges have increased abundance and enrichment and are likely to persist through long disturbances.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt;

While used infrequently and often containing only few individuals during normal years, range edges may episodically serve as refuges from extreme weather events or conditions such as drought.&lt;ref name=Bateman1 /&gt; During these extreme conditions, survival probability, [[reproductive success]] or both is higher at the edge than in the core of its range.&lt;ref name=Bateman1 /&gt;

Refuge use is influenced by habitat characteristics, such as hydrolic exchange and [[sediment]] type, active [[Animal migration|migration]] or passive habitat use and species morphology, [[behaviour]] and [[physiology]].&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; A decline in refuge use is due to decreased effectiveness of mortality reduction and reduced time provided for community recovery which leads to reduced time between disturbances.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;

Movement into and out of refuge creates predictable fluxes of [[biomass]] and [[nutrients]].&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  This is important in [[food web]]s and the [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  A dense amount of nutrients in one location during a disturbance means increased [[competition]] and [[predation]].&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  Rates of mortality, [[birth]], migration, and interactions among components of the biota that have retreated to refugia are affected by the nature of the refuge.&lt;ref name=Humphries3 /&gt; The spatial extent, the rate of drying, and the ambient [[physical body|physical]] and [[chemical]] conditions are all contributors.&lt;ref name=Humphries3 /&gt;

Drought refuges for [[algae]] are wide- spread because most med-river [[taxa]] can survive [[desiccation]] and show little specificity for refuges, provided drying occurs slowly.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; They include dry [[biofilm]] on stones and wood, dry leaf packs and [[perennial]] pools.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Refuges for [[macrophytes]] and [[zooplankton]] typically comprise egg and seed banks in med-rivers and are resilient to prolonged drying.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;

==Importance of Refuge Connectivity==

&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;[[Drought]] leads to a shift in refuge spacing and connections at different spatial and temporal scales.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Droughts disrupt hydrological connectivity and impact resident species through loss of water and flow from drying, habitat reduction, and reconfiguration.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Delivery of water is restricted to areas within a stream network.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Habitat patches engineered by members of community serve as refuges that are crucial for other members.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Trails and ponds dug by certain species, like [[alligators]], allow for dispersal into refuges.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; Hydrolic exchange provides movement of [[water]], [[nutrients]], and organisms into a refuge.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Populations of [[sessility (motility)|sessile]] organisms, like [[flora and fauna]] in perennial water refuges, cannot persist indefinitely without hydrological connections among refuges.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Mobile organisms, like fish, will move into a refugia if there are no barriers, like physical obstructions (ex: [[dams]], isolated pools), biotic factors (ex: predation, competition), and physicochemical factors (ex: low dissolved oxygen levels).

&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; During smaller scale, shorter term disturbances, populations within refuges are not necessarily cut off from those in other refuges or those in other undisturbed [[landscapes]], and so [[genetic exchange]] can still occur, or will occur during parts of the life cycle not constrained by the disturbance. Under those circumstances, the survival of a species is unlikely to depend upon a single refuge.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Recovery processes need to restore connectivity, so that [[Animal migration|migration]] can occur from refuges to new patches of habitat.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennially flowing streams may act as drought refuges for neighboring streams, even if they are not hydro logically connected to them.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Refugees must be connected hydrologically at the appropriate times. For [[insects]], refuges on one stream may support recolonization on adjacent streams that are not hydro logically connected, which may also necessitate conservation planning across catchment boundaries.

The drought from 1996 until 2009 had a great impact on the Murray-Darling Basin, in Northern Australia (Murphy and Timbal 2007; Umenhofer et al. 2009). When this drought occurred, it dried the wetlands and water storages (the drought refuge). For many species of birds and fish, the refuge is the only freshwater available. The body of water serves as food and shelter; therefore, it must be conserved. Drought refuges are likely to sustain biodiversity over larger spatial scales such as groups of streams or whole drainage networks. Chester, E. T. and Robson, B. J. (2011), Drought refuges, spatial scale and recolonization by invertebrates in non-perennial streams. Freshwater Biology, 56: 2094–2104.

==Different Types of Drought Refuge==

&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; A [[species]] may use more than one type of refuge during its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Refugia can be physical characteristics of organisms like short-term [[behavior]] or a long-term evolutionary [[adaptation]].&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;[[Animals]] and [[plants]] have mechanisms to increase resistance (survival) and resilience (recovery) to physical disturbance.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; They develop adaptations like [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[physiology]], [[behavior]].&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Physical organism adaptations include an ability to [[aestivate]], mouth orientation that allows for breathing oxygen at the water surface, body armor, and venomous spines.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;[[Motion (physics)|Mobile]] species' coping methods include refuge-seeking behavior; they seek [[habitat]] patches that relieve physiological stress and reduce mortality.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Reliance on dispersal improves resilience to climate change in the short term, but over longer timescales, it will not protect macro [[invertebrate]] [[biodiversity]] from landscape-scale refuge degradation.

&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; The [[hyporheic zone]], a region along streambeds where groundwater mixes with surface water.&lt;ref name=Robson4 /&gt; It is an important refuge for immobile organisms, like [[algae]].&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; The hyporheic zone protects from freezing, high temperature, and [[pollution]].&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; It reduces displacement, with its relatively stable, slow flow.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; In a hyporheic zone, free water is retained, and invertebrates remain submerged.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; The hyporheic zone has been shown to contribute colonists when surface flows recommence.

&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Perennial waters, whether pools, seeps or flowing sections of streams, have repeatedly been shown to be the major refuges.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennially flowing stream sections and perennial pools act as drought refuges for a wider area of the landscape than the stream on which they are located.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Refuges of a size sufficient to maintain whole [[populations]], such as perennially flowing reaches, are likely to be most important and may, during [[aridification]], become refugia containing relictual populations.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennial pools and perennially flowing water generally harbor the greatest diversity of macro invertebrate [[taxa]] because they require the least investment by the invertebrates.

==Threats and conservation==
Because [[drought]] refuges may provide the only sites allowing populations to persist during droughts, they are highly vulnerable to factors that affect water quality such as [[water pollution]] and [[sedimentation]] from [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] [[surface runoff|runoff]].  Consequently, in areas subject to intermittent drought, [[habitat conservation]] requires the identification and protection of drought refuges.&lt;ref name=bond/&gt;

&lt;ref name=Humphries3 /&gt;Drought is specific to certain regions and climatic zones.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;[[Climate change]] in many med-regions may prolong dry periods and threaten refuges.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; The capacity for perennial refuges to support [[biodiversity]] may be severely compromised due to increasing water temperatures, reducing the quality of refuges by exceeding the thermal tolerance of [[invertebrates]] or by causing [[anoxic waters|anoxia]] in stream pools and existing environmental degradation of many [[perennial]] water-ways.

Droughts have the ability to reduce agriculture products and be the cause loss of crops and lives. Hence, reserving the refuge is of extreme importance in more ways than one. In order to conserve the drought refuge for these species, action needs to be taken that will effect short term and long term impacts that the drought have on the species that dwell on it for survival. In California, efforts to conserve the drought refuge there, include reserving water when possible. Water conservation is done in order to migrating bird populations (National Wildlife Refuge; March, 1, 2016). The National wildlife refuge also takes part in mowing, disking, spraying and controlled burns. These measures are taken in an effort to stop non-native vegetation from growing; this type of vegetation typically out grows the native when in drought. Thus, allowing for native vegetation to survive during drought, leading to the dependent species to forage on the available vegetation. The clean water act was passed in order to protect the American waters from pollution. Although the act does not protect all waters, it protects many bodies of water. When drought refuges are polluted, they become an even greater danger for the dwelling species. The clean water act is just one step in cleaning waters, and saving drought refuges "(The Clean Water Rule; National Wildlife Organization)."

Continuous threats to the drought refuge conservation include; sedimentation, waterhole pumping, and the lack of the structure of the water, it is not near any other bodies of water. These of course, lead to situations where there is an extreme decrease in water availability. As water availability decreases, it increases the chances for dependent species to die out.

&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Groundwater [[aquifers]] support drought refuges for water-dependent ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt;[[Pollution]] and over-extraction of [[groundwater]] are both problematic because it lowers its ability to support groundwater-supplied drought refuges.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Over-extraction lowers the [[water table]] and degrades water-dependent [[ecosystems]].&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Over-extraction often occurs in areas with surface [[water scarcity]] and frequent drought; where groundwater refuges and refugia are most important.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Man-made disturbances can mimic the effects of drought, like water withdrawal, and dams.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; Man-made channel modifications threaten the [[hyporheic zone]] as a refuge.

&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Groundwater [[Salinity|salinization]] compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance,  along with [[irrigation]], causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses [[species]] not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing [[photosynthesis]]. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts.

&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; There needs to be an increased focus on conservation efforts.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Knowledge of refuge functions is critical for understanding their role in conservation of [[biodiversity]], especially climatically sensitive species.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Especially in regions where climate change is increasing the frequency and duration of dry periods.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; To best conserve species facing extreme weather events, it is necessary to identify conditions ‘pushing’ species, and, more importantly, to identify the refuge sites to which individuals move.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennially flowing streams and perennial pools may be crucially important for sustaining biodiversity within a mosaic of stream habitats with drier flow regimes.&lt;ref name=Bateman1 /&gt; The primary emphasis of drought refuge protection should be on protecting perennial surface waters and range edges within that landscape.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Conservation approaches for river systems will need to focus on identifying and conserving refuges together with maintaining refuge connectivity, reducing the impacts of other disturbances on these systems, and sustaining predictable seasonal flow patterns.

&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Releases from hydroelectricity reservoirs could be used to lower river water temperatures or replenish reaches of formerly perennial flow, thereby creating refuges for river biota.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; Also, focusing on maintaining groundwater quality is more beneficial than focusing on surface water resources.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Re-vegetation can reduce water [[pollution]] in ground and surface water, benefitting biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Robson5" /&gt; There is increasing evidence that habitats created by humans, such as canals, ditches, and farm ponds can support freshwater biodiversity and, therefore, have potential to provide refuges.&lt;ref name="Parkos2a" /&gt; They can prevent larger organisms, like fish, from becoming stranded as water levels decrease.&lt;ref name="Robson5" /&gt; While the preservation of refuges is crucial to provide recolonization sources, it is not sufficient if colonists cannot get from the refuge to habitat patches suitable for colonization.

Conversely, where management of pest species is necessary, controlling them in their drought refuges during droughts may be more cost-effective than broad-scale control at other times.  One example of this is controlling [[rabbit]]s in [[arid]] and [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid regions]] of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berman, D. |year=2008 |title=Control of rabbits in arid Australia: destroying the drought refuge. |journal=In: Proceedings of the 14th Australasian Vertebrate Pest Conference, 10–13 June 2008, Canberra |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://era.deedi.qld.gov.au/1405/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''engraved gem''', frequently referred to as an '''intaglio''', is a small and usually [[semi-precious]] [[gemstone]] that has been carved, in the Western tradition normally with images or inscriptions only on one face.&lt;ref&gt;Fully half of the antique engraved gems in the [[Berlin museums]] and the [[British Museum]] are either [[sard]] or [[carnelian]], Etta M. Saunders, noted. Saunders, "Goddess Riding a Goat-Bull Monster: A Ceres Zodiac Gem from the Walters Art Gallery" ''The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery'' '''49/50''' (1991/1992;7-11) note 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[engraving]] of gemstones was a major luxury art form in the [[Ancient history|Ancient world,]] and an important one in some later periods.&lt;ref&gt;The three preeminent European collections of post-Classical engraved gems are the [[Cabinet des Médailles]] at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]], Paris, the Habsburg collection, Vienna, and the [[British Museum]], London, [[Ormonde Maddock Dalton|O. M. Dalton]] observed in "Mediæval and Later Engraved Gems in the British Museum — I" ''The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs'' '''23''' No. 123 (June 1913:128-136) and "II" ''The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs'' '''24''' No. 127 (October 1913:28-32).&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking, ''engraving'' means carving ''in intaglio'' (with the design cut ''into'' the flat background of the stone), but [[relief]] carvings (with the design projecting ''out of'' the background as in nearly all [[cameo (carving)|cameos]]) are also covered by the term. This article uses ''cameo'' in its strict sense, to denote a carving exploiting layers of differently coloured stone. The activity is also called ''gem carving'' and the artists ''gem-cutters''. References to antique gems and intaglios in a [[jewellery]] context will almost always mean carved gems; when referring to [[monumental sculpture]], [[counter-relief]], meaning the same as ''intaglio'', is more likely to be used. Vessels like the [[Cup of the Ptolemies]] and heads or figures carved in the round are also known as ''[[hardstone carving]]s''.

'''Glyptics''' or ''glyptic art'' covers the field of small carved stones, including [[cylinder seal]]s and inscriptions, especially in an archaeological context. Though they were keenly collected in antiquity, most carved gems originally functioned as [[seal (insignia)|seals]], often mounted in a ring; intaglio designs register most clearly when viewed by the recipient of a letter as an impression in hardened wax. A finely carved seal was practical, as it made forgery more difficult – the distinctive personal [[signature]] did not really exist in antiquity.

==Technique==
Gems were mostly cut by using abrasive powder from harder stones in conjunction with a hand-drill, probably often set in a [[lathe]]. [[Emery (mineral)|Emery]] has been mined for abrasive powder on [[Naxos island|Naxos]] since antiquity. Some early types of seal were cut by hand, rather than a drill, which does not allow fine detail. There is no evidence that magnifying lenses were used by gem cutters in antiquity. A medieval guide to gem-carving techniques survives from [[Theophilus Presbyter]]. Byzantine cutters used a flat-edged wheel on a drill for intaglio work, while Carolingian ones used round-tipped drills; it is unclear where they learnt this technique from. In intaglio gems at least, the recessed cut surface is usually very well preserved, and microscopic examination is revealing of the technique used.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, 8-16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8bWo5T2JdVUC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Engraved+gem&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Engraved%20gem&amp;f=false quotes passages] from Theophilius and others, and discusses various techniques. See Theophilius's article for full on-line texts.&lt;/ref&gt; The colour of several gemstones can be enhanced by a number of artificial methods, using heat, sugar and dyes. Many of these can be shown to have been used since antiquity – since the 7th millennium BC in the case of heating.&lt;ref&gt;Thoresen, "Gemstone enhancement"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cylinder seal antelope Louvre AM1639.jpg|thumb|Antelopes attacked by birds: [[cylinder seal]] in [[hematite]] and its impression. Late Bronze Age II (maybe 14th century BC), from [[Cyprus]] in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] period, following Near Eastern precedents.]]
The technique has an ancient tradition in the [[Near East]], and is represented in all or most early cultures from the area, and the [[Indus Valley civilization]]. The [[cylinder seal]], whose design only appears when rolled over damp clay, from which the flat ring type developed, was the usual form in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Assyria]] and other cultures, and spread to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan world]], including parts of [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]]. These were made in various types of stone, not all hardstone. The Greek tradition emerged in [[Ancient Greek art]] under Minoan influence on mainland [[Helladic]] culture, and reached an apogee of subtlety and refinement in the [[Hellenistic period]]. Pre-[[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Hellenic]] [[Ancient Egypt]]ian seals tend to have inscriptions in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] rather than images. The Biblical [[Book of Exodus]] describes the form of the [[hoshen]], a ceremonial breastplate worn by the High Priest, bearing twelve gems engraved with the names of the [[Twelve tribes of Israel]].

Round or oval Greek gems (along with similar objects in bone and ivory) are found from the 8th and 7th centuries BC, usually with animals in energetic geometric poses, often with a border marked by dots or a rim.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 39 See Beazley for more detail.&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples are mostly in softer stones. Gems of the 6th century are more often oval,&lt;ref&gt;"Lenticular" or "lentoid" gems have the form of a [[lens (geometry)|lens]].&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] back (in the past this type was called a "scarabaeus"), and human or divine figures as well as animals; the scarab form was apparently adopted from [[Phoenicia]].&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, Later Archaic Greek gems: introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; The forms are sophisticated for the period, despite the usually small size of the gems.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 68-69&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century gems became somewhat larger, but still only 2-3 centimetres tall. Despite this, very fine detail is shown, including the eyelashes on one male head, perhaps a portrait. Four gems signed by [[Dexamenos]] of [[Chios]] are the finest of the period, two showing [[heron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 129-130&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Scarab satyr BM Gem 465.jpg|thumb|Reclining [[satyr]], [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] c. 550 BC, 2.2 cm wide. Note the vase shown "sideways"; it is characteristic of early gems that not all elements in the design are read from the same direction of view.]]

Relief carving became common in 5th century BC Greece, and gradually most of the spectacular carved gems in the Western tradition were in relief, although the [[Sassanian]] and other traditions remained faithful to the intaglio form. Generally a relief image is more impressive than an intaglio one; in the earlier form the recipient of a document saw this in the impressed sealing wax, while in the later reliefs it was the owner of the seal who kept it for himself, probably marking the emergence of gems meant to be collected or worn as [[jewellery]] [[pendant]]s in necklaces and the like, rather than used as seals – later ones are sometimes rather large to use to seal letters. However inscriptions are usually still in reverse ("mirror-writing") so they only read correctly on impressions (or by viewing from behind with transparent stones). This aspect also partly explains the collecting of impressions in plaster or wax from gems, which may be easier to appreciate than the original.

The cameo, which is rare in intaglio form, seems to have reached Greece around the 3rd century; the [[Farnese Tazza]] is the only major surviving Hellenistic example (depending on the date assigned to the [[Gonzaga Cameo]] – see below), but other [[Glass casting|glass-paste]] imitations with portraits suggest that gem-type cameos were made in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 187-188&lt;/ref&gt; The conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] had opened up new trade routes to the Greek world and increased the range of gemstones available.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley,
"Hellenistic gems: introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; Roman gems generally continued [[Hellenistic]] styles, and can be hard to date, until their quality sharply declines at the end of the 2nd century AD. Philosophers are sometimes shown; [[Cicero]] refers to people having portraits of their favourite on their cups and rings.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 275-6&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans invented [[cameo glass]], best known from the [[Portland Vase]], as a cheaper material for cameos, and one that allowed consistent and predictable layers on even round objects.
[[File:Aachen Germany Domschatz Cross-of-Lothair-01.jpg|thumb|There are several antique and medieval engraved gems on the [[Ottonian]] [[Cross of Lothair]] (base later). Many antique engraved gems survived in such contexts]]

During the European [[Middle Ages]] antique engraved gems were one classical art form which was always highly valued, and a large but unknown number of ancient gems have (unlike most surviving classical works of art) never been buried and then excavated. Gems were used to decorate elaborate pieces of goldsmith work such as [[votive crown]]s, book-covers and crosses, sometimes very inappropriately given their subject matter. [[Matthew Paris]] illustrated a number of gems owned by [[St Albans Abbey]], including one large Late Roman imperial [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] (now lost) called ''Kaadmau'' which was used to induce overdue childbirths – it was slowly lowered, with a prayer to St Alban, on its chain down the woman's cleavage, as it was believed that the infant would flee downwards to escape it,&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; a belief in accordance with the views of the "father of mineralogy", [[Georgius Agricola]] (1494–1555) on [[jasper]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qNOB-vcob88C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=poison+gemstone&amp;ei=Xqm6SvHiA4XgywSgscnvDg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false De Natura fossilium Bk 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Some gems were engraved, mostly with religious scenes in intaglio, during the period both in [[Byzantium]] and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Examples: [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/came/ho_40.20.59.htm 14th century French Crucifixion], [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bnpr/ho_1975.1.1522.htm Rosary pendant, 15th century], both onyx and in the MMA New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West production revived from the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian period]], when [[rock crystal]] was the commonest material. The [[Lothair Crystal]] (or ''Suzanna Crystal'', [[British Museum]], 11.5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter), clearly not designed for use as a seal, is the best known of 20 surviving Carolingian large intaglio gems with complex figural scenes, although most were used for seals.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, 1, 4. [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_lothar,_or_susanna_crystal.aspx Susanna Crystal], British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Several crystals were designed, like the ''Susanna Crystal'', to be viewed through the gem from the unengraved side, so their inscriptions were reversed like the seals. In wills and inventories, engraved gems were often given pride of place at the head of a list of treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, 1, 4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Some gems in a remarkably effective evocation of classical style were made in [[Southern Italy]] for the court of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in the first half of the 13th century, several in the [[Cabinet des Médailles]] in Paris. Meanwhile, the church led the development of large, often double-sided, metal seal matrices for wax seals that were left permanently attached to [[charter]]s and similar legal documents, dangling by a cord, though smaller ring seals that were broken when a letter was opened remained in use. It is not clear to what extent this also continued practices in the ancient world.

==Renaissance revival==
[[File:Nicolo intaglio warriors CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Warrior]] supporting dying comrade. 1st century BC or AD.]]
The late medieval French and Burgundian courts collected and commissioned gems, and began to use them for portraits. The British Museum has what is probably a seated portrait of [[John, Duke of Berry]] in intaglio on a [[sapphire]], and the Hermitage has a cameo head of [[Charles VII of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 411&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest had also revived in [[Early Renaissance]] Italy, where [[Venice]] soon became a particular centre of production. Along with the Roman statues and [[sarcophagi]] being newly excavated, antique gems were prime sources for artists eager to regain a classical figurative vocabulary. Cast bronze copies of gems were made, which circulated around Italy, and later Europe.&lt;ref name=draper&gt;Draper, James David. "Cameo Appearances". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/came/hd_came.htm (August 2008)]
&lt;/ref&gt; Among very many examples of borrowings that can be traced confidently, the ''Felix'' or ''Diomedes'' gem owned by [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]] (see below), with an unusual pose, was copied by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and may well have provided the "starting point" for one of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''ignudi'' on the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]].&lt;ref&gt;Claire [[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]] in J.

By the 16th century carved and engraved gems were keenly collected across Europe for dedicated sections of a [[cabinet of curiosities]], and their production revived, in classical styles; 16th-century gem-cutters working with the same types of [[sardonyx]] and other hardstones and using virtually the same techniques, produced classicizing works of glyptic art, often intended as forgeries, in such quantity that they compromised the market for them, as [[Gisela Richter]] observed in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;"Nowadays, however, they have been somewhat neglected—probably because a genuine gem is difficult to distinguish from forged one, and collectors have grown timid in consequence" (Richter, "Engraved Gems" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', '''17'''.9 (September 1922:193-196) p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--(Can any editor retrieve the article that discusses this?) Forgeries of Minoan engraved hardstone seals designed to draw the generation of [[Sir Arthur Evans]] complicate the study of the genuine ones.--&gt; Even today, Sir [[John Boardman (art historian)|John Boardman]] admits that "We are sometimes at a loss to know whether what we are looking at belongs to the 1st or the 15th century AD, a sad confession for any art-historian."&lt;ref name="Boardman lecture"&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/archive/lectures/boardman.htm Boardman lecture]&lt;/ref&gt; Other Renaissance gems reveal their date by showing mythological scenes derived from literature that were not part of the visual repertoire in classical times, or borrowing compositions from Renaissance paintings, and using "compositions with rather more figures than any ancient engraver would have tolerated or attempted".&lt;ref name="Boardman lecture"/&gt; Among artists, the wealthy [[Rubens]] was a notable collector.&lt;ref&gt;Getty, [http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/gems/collectors.html Collectors]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallel traditions==
Engraved gems occur in the [[Bible]], especially when the [[hoshen]] and [[ephod]] worn by the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] are described; though these were inscribed with the names of the [[tribes of Israel]] in letters, rather than any images. A few identifiably Jewish gems survive from the classical world, including Persia, mostly with the owner's name in Hebrew, but some with symbols such as the [[menorah (Temple)|menorah]].&lt;ref&gt;Beazley Archive, "Late Antique, Early Christian and Jewish gems: Sasanian gems – Christian and Jewish"&lt;/ref&gt; Many gems are inscribed in the Islamic world, typically with verses from the [[Koran]], and sometimes gems in the Western tradition just contain inscriptions.

Many Asian and Middle Eastern cultures have their own traditions, although for example the important Chinese tradition of carved gemstones and hardstones, especially [[Chinese jade|jade carving]], is broader than the European one of concentration on a flattish faced stone that might fit into a ring. [[Seal engraving (art)|Seal engraving]] covers the inscription that is printed by stamping, which nearly always only contains script rather than images. [[Seal sculpture (art)|Other decoration]] of the seal itself was not intended to be reproduced.

==Iconography==
[[File:Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna June 2006 031.jpg|thumb|the [[Gemma Augustea]] cameo, in two layered [[onyx]]; 19 × 23 cm.]]
The iconography of gems is similar to that of coins, though more varied. Early gems mostly show animals. Gods, [[satyr]]s, and mythological scenes were common, and famous statues often represented – much modern knowledge of the poses of lost Greek cult statues such as [[Athena Promachos]] comes from the study of gems, which often have clearer images than coins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Numismatic]] evidence is the other most indicative evidence of the general pose of locally important [[cult image]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; A 6th(?) century BC Greek gem already shows [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] committing suicide, with his name inscribed.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/styles/geometric/island.htm Geometric and Early Archaic gems: Island gems] 6th down.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Heracles]] was, as in other arts, the most common source of narrative subjects. A scene may be intended as the subject of an [[Archaic Greece|early Archaic]] gem, and certainly appears on 6th century examples from the later Archaic period.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, Archaic period pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Portraits of monarchs are found from the Hellenistic period onwards, although as they do not usually have identifying inscriptions, many fine ones cannot be identified with a subject. In the Roman Imperial period, portraits of the imperial family were often produced for the court circle, and many of these have survived, especially a number of spectacular cameos from the time of [[Augustus]]. As private objects, produced no doubt by artists trained in the tradition of Hellenistic monarchies, their iconography is less inhibited than the public state art of the period about showing divine attributes as well as sexual matters.&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 154-5. [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/c/cameo_portrait_of_augustus.aspx British Museum] on the [[Blacas Cameo]] of Augustus.&lt;/ref&gt; The identity and interpretation of figures in the [[Gemma Augustea]] remains unclear. A number of gems from the same period contain scenes apparently from the lost epic on the [[Iliou persis|Sack of Troy]], of which the finest is by Dioskurides ([[Chatsworth House]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 153, Boardman, 275-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Renaissance and later gems remain dominated by the Hellenistic repertoire of subjects, though portraits in contemporary styles were also produced.

==Collectors==
[[File:Coupe des Ptolémées 01.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Coupe des Ptolémées]] ([[Cabinet des Médailles]], Paris)]]

Famous collectors begin with King [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] (d. 63 BC), whose collection was part of the booty of [[Pompey the Great]], who donated it to the Temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, see below. Whether he was right to claim Mithridates as the first collector is dubious.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]] was determined to excel Pompey in this as in other areas, and later gave six collections to his own [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]]; according to [[Suetonius]] gems were among his varied collecting passions.&lt;ref&gt;''De Vita Caesarum, Divus Iulius'', (The Lives of the Caesars, The Deified Julius), [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suetonius-julius.html Fordham online text]&lt;/ref&gt; Many later emperors also collected gems. Chapters 4-6 of Book 37 of the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] give a summary art history of the Greek and Roman tradition, and of Roman collecting. According to Pliny [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)]] was the first Roman collector.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'', xxxvii.5&lt;/ref&gt;

As in later periods objects carved in the round from semi-precious stone were regarded as a similar category of object; these are also known as [[hardstone carving]]s.  One of the largest, the ''[[Coupe des Ptolémées]]'' was probably donated to the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, by [[Charles the Bald]], as the inscription on its former gem-studded gold Carolingian mounting stated; it may have belonged to [[Charlemagne]]. One of the best collections of such vessels, though mostly plain without carved decoration, was looted from [[Constantinople]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]], and is in the Treasury of the [[Basilica of San Marco]] in [[Venice]]. Many of these retain the medieval mounts which adapted them for liturgical use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities-interactive.org/medieval/sanmarco/ Treasury of San Marco]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''Coupe des Ptolémées'', most objects in European museums lost these when they became objects of classicist interest from the Renaissance onwards, or when the mounts were removed for the value of the materials, as happened to many in the [[French Revolution]].
[[File:Cameo gonzaga.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Gonzaga Cameo]], carved of Indian [[sardonyx]] ([[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg]]) The gem measures 15.7 × 11.8 cm.]]

The collection of 827 engraved gems of [[Pope Paul II]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/gems/collectors.html Getty Collectors, under Pietro Barbó]&lt;/ref&gt; which included the "Felix gem" of [[Diomedes]] with the [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]],&lt;ref&gt;It passed into the [[Arundel marbles|Arundel collection]] and came to Oxford: see [http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/objectofmonth/2004-10/history.htm Ashmolean image and description] and Graham Pollard, "The Felix Gem at Oxford and its provenance" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''119''' No. 893 (August 1977:574).&lt;/ref&gt; was acquired by [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]]; the [[Medici]] collection included many other gems and was legendary, valued in inventories much higher than his [[Botticelli]]s. Somewhat like Chinese collectors, Lorenzo had all his gems inscribed with his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521452458&amp;ss=exc Online: The ''Introduction'' from ''Lorenzo de'Medici, Collector of Antiquities{{'}}'', by Laurie Fusco &amp; Gino Corti, Cambridge UP 2006, which gives a survey of early Renaissance collecting in general. On his signing his gems see Draper]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gonzaga Cameo]] passed through a series of famous collections before coming to rest in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]]. First known in the collection of [[Isabella d'Este]], it passed to the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] [[Dukes of Mantua]], [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolf II]], Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], Cardinal [[Decio Azzolini]], [[Livio Odescalchi]], Duke of [[Bracciano]], and Pope [[Pius VI]] before [[Napoleon]] carried it off to Paris, where his [[Empress Joséphine]] gave it to [[Alexander I of Russia]] after Napoleon's downfall, as a token of goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cammeogonzaga.it/eng/art-exhibitions-Italy.asp Gonzaga Cameo] Exhibition in Mantua [http://ancientrome.ru/art/artworken/img.htm?id=882 further details]&lt;/ref&gt; It remains disputed whether the cameo is [[Alexandria]]n work of the 3rd century BC, or a [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] imitation of the style from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cammeogonzaga.it/eng/Gonzaga-cameo-hermitage.asp Mantua exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the largest cameo gems from antiquity were created for members of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] and seem to have survived above ground since antiquity. The large [[Gemma Augustea]] appeared in 1246 in the treasury of the [[Basilique St-Sernin, Toulouse]]. In 1533, [[Francis I of France|King François I]] appropriated it and moved it to Paris, where it soon disappeared around 1590. Not long thereafter it was fenced for 12,000 gold pieces to Emperor Rudolph II; it remains in [[Vienna]], alongside the [[Gemma Claudia]]. The largest flat engraved gem known from antiquity is the [[Great Cameo of France]], which entered (or re-entered) the French royal collection in 1791 from the treasury of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], where it had been since at least 1291.

In England, a false dawn of gem collecting was represented by [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]]' purchase of the cabinet of the Flemish antiquary [[Abraham Gorlaeus]] in 1609,&lt;ref&gt;Roy Strong, ''Henry Prince of Wales and England's Lost Renaissance'' (1986:199).&lt;/ref&gt; and engraved gems featured among the antiquities assembled by [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel]]. Later in the century [[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire]], formed a collection of gems that is still conserved at [[Chatsworth, Derbyshire|Chatsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;Diana Scarisbrick, "The Devonshire Parure", ''Archaeologia'' '''108''' (1986:241).&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century a more discerning cabinet of gems was assembled by [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle]], acting upon the advice of Francesco Maria Zanetti and [[Francesco Ficoroni]]; 170 of the Carlisle gems, both Classical and post-Classical, were purchased in 1890 for the [[British Museum]].

By the mid-eighteenth century prices had reached such a level that major collections could only be formed by the very wealthy; lesser collectors had to make do with collecting [[plaster cast]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"Sulphurs" provided even finer detail; [[James Tassie]] made a career of casting gems in plaster and in coloured opaque glass.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also very popular, or buying one of many sumptuously illustrated catalogues of collections that were published.&lt;ref&gt;Apart from those mentioned below, there is information on other notable collections [http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/gems/collectors.html from the Getty Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine the Great]]'s collection is in the [[Hermitage Museum]]; one large collection she had bought was the gems from the [[Orléans Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/04/b2003/hm4_1_i.html Hermitage Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis XV of France]] hired [[Dominique Vivant]] to assemble a collection for [[Madame de Pompadour]].

[[File:Brit Mus 13sept10 brooches etc 068.jpg|thumb|Casts ("pastes") of gems in collector's cabinets]]
In the eighteenth century British aristocrats were able to outcompete even the agents for royal and princely collectors on the Continent, aided by connoisseur-dealers like Count [[Antonio Maria Zanetti]] and [[Philipp von Stosch]]. Zanetti travelled Europe in pursuit of gems hidden in private collections for the British aristocrats he tutored in connoisseurship;&lt;ref&gt;His correspondence with [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle]] is published by Diana Scarisbrick, "Gem Connoisseurship – The 4th Earl of Carlisle's Correspondence with Francesco de Ficoroni and Antonion Maria Zanetti", ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''129'''No. 1007 (February 1987:90-104).&lt;/ref&gt; his own collection was described in [[Antonio Francesco Gori|A.F. Gori]], ''Le gemme antiche di Anton Maria Zanetti'' (Venice, 1750), illustrated with eighty plates of engravings from his own drawings. Baron [[Philipp von Stosch]] (1691–1757), a Prussian who lived in Rome and then Florence, was a major collector, as well as a dealer in engraved gems: "busy, unscrupulous, and in his spare time a spy for England in Italy".&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, Boardman Lecture&lt;/ref&gt; Among his contemporaries, Stosch made his lasting impression with ''Gemmæ Antiquæ Cælatæ'' (''Pierres antiques graveés'') (1724), in which [[Bernard Picart]]'s engravings reproduced seventy antique carved hardstones like onyx, jasper and carnelian from European collections. He also encouraged [[Johann Lorenz Natter]] (1705–1763) whom Stosch set to copying ancient carved gems in Florence. [[Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]] bought Stosch's collection in 1765 and built the [[Antique Temple]] in the park of the [[Sanssouci Palace]] to house his collections of ancient sculpture, coins and over 4,000 gems – the two were naturally often grouped together. The gems are now in the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]].

The collection of [[Joseph Smith (1682–1770)|Joseph Smith]], British [[consul]] in [[Venice]] was bought by [[George III of England]] and remains in the [[Royal Collection]]. The collections of [[Charles Towneley]], [[Richard Payne Knight]] and [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]] were bought by or bequeathed to the [[British Museum]], founding their very important collection.&lt;ref&gt;Towneley's were bought from his heirs, the others bequeathed. See King, 218-225 for a selection of highlights&lt;/ref&gt; But the most famous English collection was that formed by the [[George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough|4th Duke of Marlborough]] (1739–1817), "which the Duke kept in his bedroom and resorted to as a relief from his ambitious wife, his busy sister and his many children".&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/marlborough/default.htm Marlborough Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; This included collections formerly owned by the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]]s of [[Mantua]] (later owned by Lord Arundel), [[William Ponsonby, 2nd Earl of Bessborough|the 2nd Earl of Bessborough]], and the brother of [[Lord Chesterfield]], who himself warned his son in one of his ''Letters'' against "days lost in poring upon imperceptible intaglios and cameos".&lt;ref name="beazley.ox.ac.uk"&gt;Beazley, ''The Marlborough Gems'', [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/archive/lectures/boardman.htm Boardman Lecture].&lt;/ref&gt; The collection, including its single most famous cameo, ''the'' "[[Marlborough gem]]" depicting an initiation of Cupid and Psyche, was dispersed after a sale in 1899, fortunately timed for the new American museums and provided the core of the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan]] in New York and elsewhere,&lt;ref name=draper/&gt; with the largest group still together being about 100 in the [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore.&lt;ref name="beazley.ox.ac.uk"/&gt;

Prince [[Stanisław Poniatowski (1754-1833)|Stanisław Poniatowski]] (1754–1833) "commissioned about 2500 gems and encouraged the belief that they were, in fact, ancient." He presented a set of 419 plaster impressions of his collection to the King of [[Prussia]] which now form the Daktyliothek Poniatowski in [[Berlin]], where they were recognised as modern in 1832, mainly because the signatures of ancient artists from very different times were found on gems in too consistent a style.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/poniatowski/default.htm The Poniatowski Collection of gems]. More details in [http://lacmaonfire.blogspot.com/2009/07/bernie-madoff-of-gem-collectors.html ''The Bernie Madoff of Gem Collectors'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists==
[[File:The Punishment of Tityus, a rock crystal intaglio by Giovanni Bernardi, the British Museum.jpg|thumb|''The Punishment of [[Tityos|Tityus]]'', a rock crystal intaglio by [[Giovanni Bernardi]].]]
As in other fields, not many ancient artists' names are known from literary sources, although some gems are signed. According to Pliny, [[Pyrgoteles]] was the only artist allowed to carve gems for the seal rings of [[Alexander the Great]]. Most of the most famous Roman artists were Greeks, like Dioskurides, who is thought to have produced the Gemma Augustea, and is recorded as the artist of the matching [[signet ring]]s of [[Augustus]] – very carefully controlled, they allowed orders to be issued in his name by his most trusted associates. Other works survive signed by him (rather more than are all likely to be genuine), and his son Hyllos was also a gem engraver.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 275-6. Hennig 153-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anichini family]] were leading artists in Venice and elsewhere in the 15th and 16th centuries. Many Renaissance artists no doubt kept their activities quiet, as they were passing their products off as antique. Other specialist carvers included [[Giovanni Bernardi]] (1494–1553), [[Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio]] (c. 1500–1565), [[Giuseppe Antonio Torricelli]] (1662–1719), the German-Italian [[Anton Pichler]] (1697–1779) and his sons [[Giovanni Pichler|Giovanni]] and [[Luigi Pichler|Luigi]], [[Charles Christian Reisen]] (Anglo-Norwegian, 1680–1725). Other sculptors also carved gems, or had someone in their workshop who did. [[Leone Leoni]] said he personally spent two months on a double-sided cameo gem with portraits of [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] and his wife and son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/came/ho_38.150.9.htm Metropolitan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scot [[James Tassie]] (1735–1799), and his nephew [[William Tassie|William]] (1777–1860) developed methods for taking hard impressions from old gems, and also for casting new designs from carved wax in [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], enabling a huge production of what are really imitation engraved gems. The fullest catalogue of his impressions ("Tassie gems") was published in 1791, with 15,800 items.&lt;ref&gt;An earlier version is on [https://books.google.com/books?id=f-kHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=A+Catalogue,+Of+Impressions+In+Sulphur:+Of+Antique+And+Modern+Gems+From+Which+Pastes+Are+Made+And+Sold&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ltoEkw81eM&amp;sig=iuByBRDFZjRcKrKd8bFMUezGgiE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=l7SvSoO6N4af4gahtcTzBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books] ''A Catalogue, Of Impressions In Sulphur: Of Antique And Modern Gems From Which Pastes Are Made And Sold'' (1775) ({{ISBN|110459093X}} / 1-104-59093-X)&lt;/ref&gt; There are complete sets of the impressions in the Hermitage, the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in London, and in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/tassie/default.htm Tassie]&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of imitation became fashionable for ladies' [[brooch]]es, such as [[ceramic art|ceramic]] cameos by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] in [[jasperware]]. The engraved gem fell permanently out of fashion from about the 1860s,&lt;ref name=draper/&gt; perhaps partly as a growing realization of the number of gems that were not what they seemed to be scared collectors. Among the last practitioners was [[James Robertson (photographer)|James Robertson]], who sensibly moved into the new art of [[photography]]. Perhaps the best known gem engraver of the 20th century, working in a contemporary idiom, is the British artist [[Ronald Pennell]],&lt;ref&gt;Significant Figures in Art &amp; Craft Today, Derek Reay, MoTi publishing, UK 2011&lt;/ref&gt; whose work is held in the British [[Crafts Council]] Collection among many others.

==Imitations==
[[File:Portland Vase BM Gem4036 n4.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Portland Vase]] in Roman [[cameo glass]] in imitation of [[onyx]].]]
[[Cameo glass]] was invented by the Romans in about 30BC to imitate engraved hardstone cameos, with the advantage that consistent layering could be achieved even on round vessels – impossible with natural gemstones. It was however very difficult to manufacture and surviving pieces, mostly famously the [[Portland Vase]], are actually much rarer than Roman gemstone cameos.&lt;ref&gt;Trentinella, Rosemarie. "Roman Cameo Glass". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–9. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rcam/hd_rcam.htm link] (October 2003, retr. 16 September, 2009); Whitehouse, David. ''Roman glass in the Corning Museum of Glass'', Volume 1 [[Corning Museum of Glass]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tyg6KxKwLWYC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Roman+cameo+glass&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=riDU7l91we&amp;sig=o4JaZrguiH5NGKRFPYFA8Ss3rVg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fxOxSqWeMIeL4Abe7bzzBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage&amp;q=Roman%20cameo%20glass&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was revived in the 18th and especially 19th centuries in England and elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;[http://forsyth.tamu.edu/cameobackground Texas A&amp;M University Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408023951/http://forsyth.tamu.edu/cameobackground |date=2009-04-08 }} Exhibition feature ''George Woodall and the Art of English Cameo Glass''&lt;/ref&gt; and was most effectively used in French [[Art Nouveau]] glass that made no attempt to follow classical styles.

The Middle Ages, which lived by [[charter]]s and other sealed documents, were at least as keen on using seals as the ancient world, now creating them for towns and church institutions, but they normally used metal matrices and [[signet ring]]s. However some objects, like a 13th-century Venetian ''[[Seven Sleepers of Ephesus]]'', mimicked the engraved gem.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Britishmuseumsevensleeperscameo.jpg|picture and link]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another offshoot of the mania for engraved gems is the fine-grained slightly translucent [[stoneware]] called [[jasperware]] that was developed by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and perfected in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Reilly, ''Wedgwood Jasper'' London, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Though white-on-blue matte jasperware is the most familiar Wedgwood ceramic line, still in production today and widely imitated since the mid-19th century, white-on-black was also produced. Wedgwood made notable jasperware copies of the Portland Vase and the ''Marlborough gem'', a famous head of [[Antinous]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antinoos.info/antin9a.htm Antinoos.info] See "Gems" section for gem and casts etc&lt;/ref&gt; and interpreted in jasperware casts from antique gems by James Tassie. [[John Flaxman]]'s [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] designs for jasperware were carried out in the extremely low relief typical of cameo production. Some other [[porcelain]] imitated three-layer cameos purely by paint, even in implausible objects like a flat [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres]] tea-tray of 1840.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/royal_porcelain/view_1.asp?item=0 Sèvres tea-tray from the Metropolitan museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholars==
Gems were a favourite topic for [[antiquaries]] from the Renaissance onwards, culminating in the work of Philipp von Stosch, described above. Major progress in understanding Greek gems was made in the work of [[Adolf Furtwängler]] (1853–1907, father of [[Wilhelm Furtwängler|the conductor, Wilhelm]]). Among recent scholars [[John Boardman (art historian)|Sir John Boardman]] (b. 1927) has made a special contribution, again concentrating on Greek gems. [[Gertrud Seidmann]] (1919–2013) moved into the subject, having previously been a German teacher.

The '''Exploratorium''' is a museum in [[San Francisco]] that allows visitors to explore the world through science, art, and human perception. Its mission is to create inquiry-based experiences that transform learning worldwide. It has been described by the ''New York Times'' as the most important science museum to have opened since the mid-20th century, an achievement attributed to "the nature of its exhibits, its wide-ranging influence and its sophisticated teacher training program".&lt;ref name=Lawlessness&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothstein|first=Edward|title=An Emphasis on Newton’s Laws (and a Little Lawlessness)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/arts/design/the-new-exploratorium-opens-in-san-francisco.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characterized as "a mad scientist's penny arcade, a scientific funhouse, and an experimental laboratory all rolled into one",&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Allison|title=A First Look at the New Exploratorium|url=http://www.7x7.com/arts-culture/first-look-new-exploratorium|work=7x7 Magazine|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the participatory nature of its exhibits and its self-identification as a center for informal learning has led to it being cited as the prototype for participatory museums around the world.&lt;ref name=Thrill&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothstein|first=Edward|title=The Thrill of Science, Tamed by Agendas|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium was founded by physicist and educator [[Frank Oppenheimer]] and opened in 1969 at the [[Palace of Fine Arts]], its home until January 2, 2013. On April 17, 2013, the Exploratorium reopened at Piers 15 and 17 on San Francisco's [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]]. The historic interior and exterior of Pier 15 was renovated extensively prior to the move, and is divided into several galleries mainly separated by content, including the physics of seeing and listening (Light and Sound), Human Behavior, Living Systems, Tinkering (including electricity and magnetism), the Outdoor Gallery, and the Bay Observatory Gallery, which focuses on local environment, weather, and landscape.

Since the museum's founding, over 1,000 participatory exhibits have been created, approximately 600 of which are on the floor at any given time. The exhibit-building workshop space is contained within the museum and is open to view. In addition to the public exhibition space, the Exploratorium has been engaged in the professional development of teachers, science education reform, and the promotion of museums as informal education centers since its founding. Since Oppenheimer's death in 1985, the Exploratorium has expanded into other domains, including its 50,000-page website and two iPad apps on sound and color. It has also inspired an international network of participatory museums working to engage the public with general science education.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=San Francisco Exploratorium to Show New Face in a New Place|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/science/exploratorium-to-reopen-on-san-francisco-bay-in-2013.html|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Exploratorium building is also working to showcase environmental sustainability efforts as part of its goal to become the largest net-zero museum in the country.&lt;ref name=SFGateNetZero&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium sets 'Net-Zero' energy goal|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-sets-Net-Zero-energy-goal-4422432.php?t=6a884541ce|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium offers visitors a variety of ways—including exhibits, webcasts, websites and events—to explore and understand the world around them. In 2011, the Exploratorium received the [[National Science Board]] 2011 Public Service Science Award for its contributions to public understanding of science and engineering.&lt;ref name='NSF2011'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=119077&amp;org=NSB&amp;from=news | title = San Francisco-based Exploratorium to Receive National Science Board's 2011 Public Service Award | accessdate = 2012-06-20 | date = April 4, 2011 | publisher = [[National Science Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium is the brainchild of [[Frank Oppenheimer]], an experimental physicist and university professor. Oppenheimer, who worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] with his brother [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], was diverted from an academic career when he was forced to resign from his position at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1949 as a result of an inquiry by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. He was blacklisted from academic positions across the country, and withdrew with his family to run a Colorado [[cattle ranch]] for almost a decade.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|104–115}}

Oppenheimer also began lending a hand with science projects of local high school students, eventually becoming the sole science teacher at the high school in [[Pagosa Springs, Colorado]]. The field trips and experiments he did with his high school students would become a blueprint for the hands-on methods of teaching and learning he would later bring to the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|115–121}}
 
When Oppenheimer was invited to join the University of Colorado's physics department in 1959, he found himself less interested in traditional laboratory research and much more interested in exploring methods of provoking curiosity and inquiry.  He received a grant from the National Science Foundation, which he used to build models of nearly a hundred science experiments.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|136–137}} This "Library of Experiments" would become the core of the Exploratorium exhibit collection, and was the forerunner of the ''Exploratorium Cookbook'', a manual explaining how to build these basic science exhibits.&lt;ref name=Cookbook&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium Cookbook I: A Construction Manual for Exploratorium Exhibits |url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/pubs.net/cookbook1.html |work=Exploratorium Publications |publisher=The Exploratorium |accessdate=2014-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423045619/http://www.exploratorium.edu/pubs.net/cookbook1.html |archivedate=April 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced of the need for public museums to supplement science curricula at all levels, he toured Europe and studied museums on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1965. Three European museums, encountered during that year, served as important influences on the founding of the Exploratorium: the [[Palais de la Découverte]], which displayed models to teach scientific concepts and employed students as demonstrators, a practice that directly inspired the Exploratorium's much-lauded High School Explainer Program; the [[South Kensington Museum]] of Science and Art, which Oppenheimer and his wife visited frequently; and the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, the world's largest science museum, which had a number of interactive displays that impressed the Oppenheimers.

Back in the United States, Oppenheimer was invited to do the initial planning for a new branch of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], but he turned it down to work on what he called his "San Francisco project". In 1967, the Oppenheimers came to [[San Francisco]] with a view towards opening an independent museum of their own. Oppenheimer sought funding and support for the endeavor using a grassroots approach, bringing a written proposal and some handmade exhibits with him as he visited scientists, businesses, city and school officials, relatives, and friends. Many prominent scientists and cultural figures endorsed the project, and the offers of support in conjunction with a $50,000 grant from the [[San Francisco Foundation]] made the museum realizable.

In late August 1969, the Exploratorium opened with little fanfare at the Palace of Fine Arts. Oppenheimer "simply opened the doors".&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|152}} Although the building needed many improvements, Oppenheimer couldn't afford to make the changes, and decided to allow the public to come and watch exhibits being built and changes being made as part of the participatory ethos of the institution.&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite book|title=Something Incredibly Wonderful Happens - Frank Oppenheimer and the World He Made Up|last=[[K.C.

Instead, Oppenheimer insisted that the workshop be placed without a wall, right next to the main entrance so that visitors could experience "the way a shop smells when you burn the wood in a saw, or smell the oil from a lathe".&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|156}} Above the workshop was a sign, made by the wife of [[George Gamow]], a physicist, educator, and friend of Oppenheimer who had died just a year before the opening of the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|152,157}} The inscription said "Here Is Being Created the Exploratorium a Community Museum Dedicated to Awareness".&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|157}}  (Today, a copy of this motto is inscribed above the main entrance to the new Exploratorium at Pier 15.)

Oppenheimer served as the museum’s director until his death in 1985. Dr. Robert L. White served as director from 1987 to 1990. Dr. [[Goéry Delacôte]] served as executive director from 1991 until 2005.&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;{{cite web|title=Goéry Delacôte: Executive Profile &amp; Biography|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=2309151&amp;privcapId=2221131|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Dennis Bartels served as executive director of the Exploratorium from 2006 to 2016. In June 2016, the Exploratorium welcomed its newest director, Chris Flink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/chris-flink-selected-as-new-exploratorium-executive-director Chris Flink Selected as New Exploratorium Executive Director | Exploratorium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum has expanded greatly since the 1980s, increasing outreach, expanding programs for educators, creating an expanded Web presence, and forming museum partnerships around the world.

===Move to Piers 15 and 17===
The Exploratorium relocated from the Palace of Fine Arts to Piers 15 and 17, located between the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]] and [[Pier 39]] along the San Francisco Embarcadero, in April 2013. The Piers location was identified by Goéry Delacôte and then-board chairman Van Kasper as a potential space for relocation in 2004.&lt;ref name="Build"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Build: The Making of a Museum | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-66-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}  In 2005, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution exempting the museum’s 66-year lease of the piers from San Francisco’s competitive bidding process due to its unique nature as a cultural and educational institution.&lt;ref name=Sadiq&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadiq|first=Sheraz|title=Exploratorium Unveils Plans for New Home|url=http://science.kqed.org/quest/2010/10/19/exploratorium-unveils-plans-for-new-home/|work=QUEST|publisher=KQED|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundbreaking for the project, which required substantial construction and renovation, occurred on October 19, 2010. The Exploratorium holds a 66-year lease on the piers with the Port of San Francisco. Exhibits are currently only viewable at the  Pier 15 campus; Pier 17 houses some staff, with the option for future expansion.&lt;ref name=Perlman2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium in S.F. beginning work on new home|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-in-S-F-beginning-work-on-new-home-3170176.php|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piers 15 and 17 are historic piers, built in 1931 and 1912 respectively.&lt;ref name="Under"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Under: The World Below the Museum | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-67-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}}    In 1954, the area between the piers was infilled and paved over. This infill was removed as part of the construction phase, restoring the space between the piers to public plazas, a pedestrian bridge, and open water.

==Architecture and design==

===Renovation of Piers 15 and 17===
[[File:Rust wedge.jpg|thumb|upright|Outdoors "Rust Wedge" display shows the enormous expansive force of [[rust|rusting iron]]]]
The Exploratorium campus comprises  {{convert|330,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of indoor and outdoor exhibit space, and includes {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}} of freely accessible public space. The exhibits are housed in and around Pier 15, which extends over {{convert|800|ft|m|abbr=on}} over the Bay.&lt;ref name=MovingScience&gt;{{cite news|last=Beato|first=Greg|title=The Science of Moving Science Across Town|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/arts/artsspecial/how-the-exploratorium-in-san-francisco-moved-across-town.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 was designed by architecture firm [[EHDD]].&lt;ref name=Breakthrough&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee |first=Lydia |title=Breakthrough at San Francisco's Exploratorium |url=http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=4930 |accessdate=12 June 2013 |newspaper=The Architect's Newspaper |date=October 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517153030/http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=4930 |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nibbi Brothers served as the General Contractor,&lt;ref name="Exploratorium, Designed by EHDD"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gerfen|first=Katie|title=Exploratorium, Designed by EHDD|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/buildings/exploratorium-designed-by-ehdd_o|accessdate=4 August 2015|newspaper=THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS|date=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AGA (Architectural Glass and Aluminum)]] as the Glazing Contractor. The piers had been neglected for decades leading up to the Exploratorium’s move, and extensive renovation and repair was required.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Nearly two thirds of the [[piling]]s under Pier 15 were repaired, including almost every piling needed to provide structural integrity, and new pilings were sunk.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|24}} The removal of the parking lot between the piers was done slowly over the two years of construction, and the debris from the removal was captured and recycled.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|67}} Several pilings were left in the water between the piers, both for aesthetic reasons and to support future exhibits.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|47}}

An effort was made in the construction of the new location to preserve the historic elements of Pier 15.  The Bay Observatory was the only new structure added to the site. The east end of the pier was cleaned of [[lead paint]], revealing historic lettering underneath; designers chose to preserve the lettering rather than paint it over.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|67}} As a result, the traces of the shipping lines that originally frequented the pier can still be seen. Some of the preservation efforts presented challenges in design, however; historic windows created energy losses that had to be offset elsewhere, and the historic interior trusswork was mainly restored rather than removed, meaning that the upper-level staff offices had to be built around them.&lt;ref name="Sustain"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-68-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

Other challenges to the design of the facilities were presented by the museum’s sustainability initiatives. The use of natural light whenever possible challenged exhibit designers relying on carefully controlled light levels; this was solved by using curtains and glare-reducing paint colors.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;{{rp|32}} Other conflicts between construction and energy use included the glass in the Observatory, which would have presented a problem in cooling the building on warm days. This was overcome by adding fritted glass to the windows in thin horizontal lines through the panes to decrease the transparency without affecting the views.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;{{rp|85}} The fritting also makes the reflective surfaces of the Bay Observatory safe for birds.&lt;ref name=TakingFlight&gt;{{cite news|last=Schreiber |first=Dan |title=Bird-safe building standards taking flight in San Francisco |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/06/bird-safe-building-standards-taking-flight |accessdate=May 23, 2013 |newspaper=The San Francisco Examiner |date=June 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908200100/http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/06/bird-safe-building-standards-taking-flight |archivedate=September 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pier 15 incorporated two seismic joints as part of its [[seismic retrofit]], one separating the Bay Observatory from the Pier 15 shed and the other separating the entire pier from the land. This second joint ensures that the entire pier will move independently from the land mass in the event of an earthquake, significantly reducing the potential [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional]] stress.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|83}} The café at the west end of the Exploratorium is named the Seismic Joint in honor of the joint, which cuts through the area of the building where the café is situated.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|80}}

The aesthetic of the project was defined as "industrial naval chic" in keeping with the pier’s history.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|63}}

===Restaurant===
[[File:Seaglass Restaurant at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|The design scheme for the Exploratorium's Seaglass Restaurant was inspired by the exhibit ''Color of Water''.]]
The design aesthetic for both the Seismic Joint and Seaglass Restaurant was created by designer Olle Lundberg and based on the exhibit ''Color of Water''. The bar at Seaglass features a specially designed version of Exploratorium artist Shawn Lani’s exhibit ''Icy Bodies''.&lt;ref name=Feasters&gt;{{cite web|last=Meier-Johnson|first=Pat|title=Seaglass Restaurant at the Exploratorium: A Sense for the Feasters|url=http://connectedtraveler.com/index.php/travel-tech/science/307-san-francisco-exploratorium-has-a-sense-for-the-feast|work=The Connected Traveler|accessdate=12 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204423/http://connectedtraveler.com/index.php/travel-tech/science/307-san-francisco-exploratorium-has-a-sense-for-the-feast|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LorettaKeller&gt;{{cite web|last=Pape|first=Allie|title=Loretta Keller's Exploratorium Duo to Open April 17|url=http://sf.eater.com/archives/2013/03/25/loretta_kellers_exploratorium_restaurants_to_open_april_17.php|work=SF Eater|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
The Exploratorium at Pier 15 has a net-zero energy goal as part of its overall sustainability efforts. Setting this net-zero goal means that, while in operation, The Exploratorium will produce more energy on-site than it will consume on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawley|first1=Drury B.|last2=Torcellini|first2=Paul A., Ph.D., P.E.|title=Understanding Zero-Energy Buildings|journal=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.|date=September 2006|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum highlights its sustainability efforts in visible ways throughout the museum as part of a stated intention to lead by example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|date=2012|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=22|url=http://lmngroup.pikibox.com/pikibox.com/lmngroup/uploads/sustain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TruongEcoFriendly&gt;{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|title=Landmark museum to reopen as most energy-efficient institute on Earth|url=https://news.yahoo.com/landmark-museum-to-reopen-as-most-eco-friendly-institute-on-earth-195905286.html|work=Yahoo!

The Exploratorium, in order to reach its net-zero energy goal, produces energy with a roof-mounted array of [[photovoltaics]].  There are 5,874 PV modules on the roof, totaling {{convert|78,712|sqft|m2}}, with a projected year-1 yield of 1.3 MW-AC/square foot (13.9 MW-AC/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), or a total year-1 yield of 2,113,715 kWh.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ehdd.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainability Fact Sheet: Environmentally Conscious Inside and Out|url=http://www.ehdd.com/sites/ehdd2/images/6275/Exploratorium%20Sustainability%20Project%20Sheet.pdf|website=EHDD Architecture|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any surplus energy generated is intended to be fed back into the utility grid, as the projected annual energy use for the building totals at 1,275,936 kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium's Net-Zero Energy Goal for New Waterfront Home 2013|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/exploratoriums-net-zero-energy-goal-new-waterfront-home-2013|website=Exploratorium|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abellon&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abellon, P.E.|first1=Devin A.|title=Exploratorium's New Waterfront Home Features Innovative Radiant System Using SF Bay Water|url=http://uponor.media-resources-ordp.com/casestudies/exploratorium.shtml|website=Uponor, Inc.|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schematic diagram of bay water heating and cooling system at The Exploratorium, San Francisco.png|thumbnail|right|Diagram of bay water heating and cooling system at The Exploratorium]]
In addition to solar power, the museum makes use of an [[HVAC]] system that takes advantage of the relatively constant, moderate temperature of the bay water under the piers, which is {{convert|50|to|65|F|C}}, to heat and cool the building. The bay water is filtered and sterilized before it is brought into a {{convert|4,000|USgal|m3}} cistern below the pier, where it is held for use.  When needed, the bay water is moved to a titanium [[heat exchanger]], of which the building has two, where it is either used to heat or cool water that is cycled through a system of thermally activated radiant slabs.&lt;ref name="Exploring Every Possibility"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abellon|first1=Devin|title=Exploring Every Possibility|url=http://www.edcmag.com/articles/95153-the-exploratorium-at-pier-15|website=EDC: The Official Magazine for the LEED Professional|publisher=BNP Media|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are {{convert|27|mi|km}} of plastic tubing in the [[radiant heating]] system in the floor, creating 82 different heating and cooling zones with distinct control systems.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt; After the bay water passes through the heat exchangers, it is returned to the San Francisco Bay as allowed by a permit issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ORDER NO. R2-2010-0082|url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/sanfranciscobay/board_decisions/adopted_orders/2010/R2-2010-0082.pdf|website=California Environmental Protection Agency: State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=California Regional Water Quality Control Board: San Francisco Bay Region|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the energy savings are expected to come from using the bay water as a [[heat sink]] for the building’s cooling needs.  When the temperature of the bay water is below that of the chilled water return from the radiant pipes, which is the case for most of the year in the Bay Area’s temperate climate, the system works in waterside [[economizer]] mode.  In this mode, the cooling loads are met either entirely or partially through passive heat exchange between the colder bay water and the warmer return water, greatly reducing the building’s energy needs.&lt;ref name=Abellon /&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 has a separate system for its ventilation needs, pairing a [[dedicated outdoor air system]] (DOAS) with [[displacement ventilation]] distribution to bring outdoor air into the building.  By integrating radiant heating and cooling and displacement ventilation, the Exploratorium has greatly reduced the portion of its HVAC system that relies on forced air.  Reducing the size of a building’s forced air system has the associated benefits of both lower energy loads as well as reduced ductwork, both of which are cost-saving.&lt;ref name="Exploring Every Possibility"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Straube|first1=John|title=The Perfect HVAC|url=http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/insights/bsi-022-the-perfect-hvac|website=Building Science Corporation|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium has multiple features designed to reduce its water consumption.  Two large cisterns under the structural beams connecting the southeast pilings capture up to {{convert|338,000|USgal|m3}} of rainwater and fog runoff for reuse in the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|date=2012|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=17|url=http://lmngroup.pikibox.com/pikibox.com/lmngroup/uploads/sustain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plumbing is designed for water conservation, with [[waterless urinal]]s and [[dual-flush toilet]]s projected to save an annual million gallons of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the bay water heating and cooling system is estimated to save two million gallons of potable water a year by eliminating the need for traditional evaporative cooling towers.&lt;ref name="ehdd.com"/&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 also makes use of natural light in the effort to reduce energy loads.  The existing building had many clerestory windows and an overhead skylight that runs the length of the interior space.  In compliance with historic preservation requirements, the building’s façade was left mostly unchanged, allowing for much of the interior space to benefit from the existing architecture’s ample daylight.  The retrofit did include the addition of high performance glazing to the existing windows.&lt;ref name=Sustain /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerfen|first1=Katie|title=Exploratorium|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/cultural-projects/exploratorium.aspx|website=Architect Magazine: The Magazine of the American Institute of Architects|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Young|first1=Mignon|title=Sustainability Around The Bay|url=http://www.gabreport.com/2014/05/sustainability-around-the-bay|website=GAB: Green Architecture and Building Report|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the Exploratorium was awarded [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum certification.&lt;ref name="USGBC Scorecard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium at Piers 15/17 LEED Scorecard|url=http://www.usgbc.org/projects/exploratorium-piers-1517|website=US Green Building Council|publisher=US Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', "After a two-year post-opening shakedown period of monitoring and adjusting the systems, the Exploratorium hopes to become the largest net-zero-energy-use museum in the United States and possibly the world."&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Christopher|title=A San Francisco Museum, Reborn on the Bay|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/travel/a-san-francisco-museum-reborn-on-the-bay.html|accessdate=2013-08-07|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium is also turning its commitment to sustainability into a learning experience by showcasing elements of the building’s green design on site.&lt;ref name=Sustain /&gt;

==Layout==
The new site contains over 600 exhibits, 25% of which were developed specifically for the Pier 15 site. With the exception of some art installations, all exhibits are developed and made onsite.&lt;ref name=OpensApril10&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium opens April 10 at Pier 15|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/science/article/Exploratorium-opens-April-10-at-Pier-15-4430723.php|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indoor and outdoor spaces are divided into six galleries, each highlighting a specific content group. Many exhibits are mobile, however, and move among different galleries; similarly, not all exhibits fall into distinct categories.

Exhibits cover a range of subject areas, including [[human perception]] (such as vision, hearing, learning and cognition), the life sciences, physical phenomena (such as light, motion, electricity, waves and resonance, and magnetism), local environment (water, wind, fog, rain, sun, and other elements, as well as cityscape, landscape, and the flora and fauna of the Bay) and human behavior (such as cooperation, competition, and sharing).&lt;ref name=MuseumGalleries&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum Galleries|url=http://exploratorium.edu/visit/galleries/|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osher West Gallery: Human Behavior===
[[File:Blowing Smoke.jpg|thumb|right|Visitors collaborate to make a [[smoke ring]] at the Exploratorium's previous location at the Palace of Fine Arts]]
The West Gallery focuses on human behavior.  Its signage and exhibits encourage visitors to play with perception; investigate memory, emotion, and judgment; and experiment with how people cooperate, compete, and share. It holds exhibits such as ''Poker Face'' (partners try to assess when someone is bluffing), ''Trust Fountain'' (an experimental exhibit from the museum’s [[National Science Foundation]]-funded Science of Sharing project, this two-person drinking fountain is based on the [[Prisoner’s dilemma]], a classic scenario centering on negotiation and trust),&lt;ref name=GalleriesExhibits&gt;{{cite web|title=Galleries and Exhibit Highlights|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/galleries-and-exhibit-highlights|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Tactile Dome'', a pitch-black environment visitors explore by touch, which was originally designed by [[August Coppola]].&lt;ref name=Coppola&gt;{{cite web|last=Barmann|first=Jay|title=August Coppola, Brother of Francis, Creator of Tactile Dome, Dies at 75|url=http://sfist.com/2009/11/04/august_coppola_brother_of_francis_c.php|work=SFist.com|accessdate=12 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813044417/http://sfist.com/2009/11/04/august_coppola_brother_of_francis_c.php|archivedate=13 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Gallery also included the temporary exhibition ''The Changing Face of What is Normal: Mental Health'', which showcased the personal artifacts of patients from the now-decommissioned Willard Psychiatric Center,&lt;ref name=Lawlessness /&gt; which was on view through April 2014.

The West Gallery also houses the Kanbar Forum, a cabaret-style theater that will host music events, science lectures, and other programs when it opens in summer 2013.&lt;ref name=sparkling&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Heather|title=San Francisco's Exploratorium opens in sparkling new home|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/16/tech/innovation/new-exploratorium|work=CNN|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Gallery: Tinkering===
The South Gallery is a workshop area where visitors can engage in learning through [[maker movement|hands-on making]], located directly across from the Exploratorium's own internal exhibit workshop, which is also open to their view. Oppenheimer wanted visitors to be able to “smell the oil”, and insisted that the usually hidden exhibit-building activities be on display as an exhibit in its own right.&lt;ref name=shrine&gt;{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|title=Exploratorium Reborn: Inside San Francisco's New Innovation Shrine|url=https://gizmodo.com/5994274/exploratorium-reborn-inside-san-franciscos-new-shrine-to-innovation|work=Gizmodo|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibits in the South Gallery highlight a [[DIY]] aesthetic, and include ''Animation Stations'' where visitors can make their own [[stop motion|stop-motion films]].

Artworks on display include the ''Tinkerer’s Clock'' (a 22-foot-high clock constructed by artist [[Tim Hunkin]], with figurines in his noted cartoon style that can be manipulated by visitors and unfold into a clockface on the hour); and ''Rolling Through The Bay'' (a sculpture made by artist Scott Weaver over the course of 37 years, utilizing over 100,000 toothpicks and depicting many of the Bay Area’s iconic landmarks, through which a ping-pong ball can roll on one of several different "tours").&lt;ref name=rolling&gt;{{cite web|last=Koh|first=Barbara|title=At the Exploratorium – Scott Weaver’s Amazing Toothpick Art|url=http://sanfrancisco.about.com/od/sfevents/p/At-The-Exploratorium-Scott-Weavers-Amazing-Toothpick-Art.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bechtel Central Gallery: Seeing and Listening===
[[File:Giant Mirror at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|A visitor investigates the reflective properties of the Giant Mirror in the Central Gallery of the Exploratorium at Pier 15.]]
The Bechtel Central gallery houses many of the "classic" Exploratorium exhibits, including many of those that have been on display since the very earliest years of the museum.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; It includes a mix of new and old exhibits that investigate physics and the perception of light, color, and sound, such as ''Sound Bite'' (a demonstration of hearing with the jawbone instead of the ears) and ''Bright Black'' (a trick of perception convinces viewers that an object is white when it is almost entirely black).

===East Gallery: Living Systems===
The East Gallery houses a much-expanded selection of life sciences exhibits. Many exhibits relate directly to the immediate local environment, such as the ''Glass Settling Plate'' (barnacles and other creatures are grown on a plate in the Bay, then put live under a mobile microscope to be observed from both above and below) and the ''Algae Chandelier'' (visitors can pump air to nourish overhead tanks of colorful phytoplankton). Other exhibits explore different biological systems and processes, such as the imaging station with mouse stem cells, the live cow’s eye dissections, and the ''Live Chicken Embryo'' (one of the oldest of the Living Systems exhibits, showing live chicken embryos at different stages of development).&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenblatt|first=Seth|title=San Francisco Exploratorium shows off its huge new digs|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57579443-1/san-francisco-exploratorium-shows-off-its-huge-new-digs/|work=CNET|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery===
The Bay Observatory building is the only new building constructed on the Exploratorium’s campus. It holds the Seaglass restaurant on its lower level and exhibits on the upper level relating to the waterfront and the cityscape. The gallery focuses on what visitors can see in real time, including the movement of clouds and tides, the changing waterfront, the movement of ships, and interpretation of oceanographic data. The Observatory has glass walls on all four sides to facilitate observation. Many of the exhibits were developed specifically for the location, such as ''Oculus'' (a circular opening in the ceiling that allows the entire gallery to be used as a timepiece, tracking seasons, solstices, and the sun’s movement), ''Visualizing the Bay'' (a 3-D topographic map of the Bay Area that allows visitors to see real data mapped over the landscape, such as the movement of fog and the salinity of the Bay over the course of days or years), and the ''Map Table'' (an assortment of historic and contemporary maps and atlases displaying different views and perspectives on the landscape).&lt;ref name=eyes&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawkes|first=Alison|title=The Exploratorium’s new eyes on the bay|url=http://baynature.org/2013/04/18/the-exploratoriums-new-eyes-on-the-bay/|work=Bay Nature Magazine|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bay Observatory also houses the Wired Pier project, which consists of more than a dozen sensors on and around the Bay Observatory that stream real-time data about the surrounding environment, such as quality of air and bay water, weather, tides and pollution, and compile it into interactive visualizations.&lt;ref name=Plutchak&gt;{{cite web|last=Plutchak|first=Rochelle|title=NOAA Science Has  Home at the New Exploratorium|url=http://research.noaa.gov/InDepth/Features/CurrentFeature/TabId/728/ArtMID/1884/ArticleID/10044/NOAA-Science-Has-a-Home-at-the-New-Exploratorium.aspx|work=National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Website|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoor Gallery===
[[File:Fog Bridge at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|Mist from Fujiko Nakaya’s Fog Bridge drifts over the water between Piers 15 and 17 at the Exploratorium.]]
The Outdoor Gallery comprises the north, south, and east aprons of Pier 15, and extends through both ticketed and unticketed space. Focus is on direct interaction with the Bay environment, which can be seen in exhibits such as ''Color of Water'' (an installation of 32 distinct [[Textile sample|color swatches]] suspended below the rail surrounding the pier so that visitors can investigate the changing colors of the Bay’s water). Another notable exhibit is ''Remote Rains'', which allows visitors to choose a past rainstorm as profiled by the Hydrometeorology Testbed, which is then recreated by a rain machine that duplicates the frequency, size, and velocity of the raindrops, giving a tangible experience of [[NOAA]] research data on storms.&lt;ref name=Plutchak /&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo&gt;{{cite news|title=SF Exploratorium set to open in new $300M digs|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130410/us-travel-san-francisco-new-exploratorium/|work=Huffington Post|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the publicly accessible bridge connecting Piers 15 and 17, artist [[Fujiko Nakaya]] created an installation called ''Fog Bridge #72494'' that creates bursts of fog for six minutes every half-hour as the first in a series of large-scale temporary installations called ''Over the Water''.&lt;ref name=overthewater&gt;{{cite web|title=Over the Water|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/arts/over-the-water|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Fog Bridge'' is {{convert|150|ft|m}} long and makes use of 800 nozzles to create the fog, which Nakaya hopes will inspire visitors to pay attention to the nature of one of San Francisco’s best-known weather patterns.  Although originally slated to be temporary, it is now on permanent display. A desalination system, located in Pier 17, conditions bay water for use in the artwork. &lt;ref name=Aleta&gt;{{cite web|last=Aleta|first=George|title=An Artist Creates Artificial Fog in San Francisco|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/artscience/2013/04/an-artist-creates-artificial-fog-in-san-francisco|work=Smithsonian Magazine Blog|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miranda" /&gt;

===Public space===
The Exploratorium campus includes {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}} of publicly accessible open space. This includes the plaza facing on the Embarcadero, the connector bridge between Piers 15 and 17 where ''Fog Bridge # 72494'' is installed, the south apron of Pier 17, and the east and south aprons of Pier 15. This public space overlaps with the Outdoor Gallery, and includes some notable exhibits, such as the ''Aeolian Harp'' (an expanded version of the original installation by Doug Hollis on the roof of the Exploratorium at the Palace of Fine Arts, first created in collaboration with Frank Oppenheimer in 1976)&lt;ref name=aeolian&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeolian Harp|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/outdoor-gallery/aeolian-harp|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''Bay Windows'' (visitors spin disks filled with samples of Bay mud, sand, and gravel gathered from five distinct regions of the Bay itself).&lt;ref name=baywindows&gt;{{cite web|title=Bay Windows|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/outdoor-gallery/bay-windows|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restaurant===
The lower level of the Bay Observatory Building houses the Seaglass Restaurant, which, like the Seismic Joint Cafe, is open to unticketed members of the public. Both the Seismic Joint and Seaglass are run by Loretta Keller, chef-owner at Coco500, in partnership with Bon Appetit Management Company.

==Educational programs==
The Exploratorium seeks to bring hands-on inquiry to education, including training teachers in the teaching of science.&lt;ref&gt;

===Teacher Institute===
[[File:Exploratorium teachers.jpg|thumb|right|Teachers from the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute examine the "String Thing" they built]]
The Teacher Institute, founded in 1984, is an Exploratorium-based professional development program geared towards middle and high school science teachers. In addition to providing workshops at the museum that teach hands-on and inquiry-based teaching methods, it provides coaches and support for novice teachers. Studies have shown that while 30 to 50 percent of new teachers leave the profession within five years, the retention rate for teachers who go through the Teacher Institute is 85 to 90 percent.&lt;ref name=Olney&gt;{{cite news|last=Olney|first=Jennifer|title=Teachers participate in intense training program|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/focus_on_solutions&amp;id=8775413|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=KGO-TV|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teacher Institute is also home to the [[Iron Science Teacher]], a national competition that celebrates innovation and creativity in science teaching, which originated at the Exploratorium in San Francisco. Parodying the cult Japanese TV program, ''[[Iron Chef]]'', this competition showcases science teachers as they devise classroom activities using a particular ingredient — an everyday item such as a plastic bag, milk carton, or nail. Contestants are currently or formerly part of the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute and compete before a live audience for the title of "Iron Science Teacher". Shows are also archived on the Exploratorium's website.&lt;ref name=IronScience&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrington|first=Theresa|title='Iron Science Teacher' competitors at Exploratorium use museum paper as secret ingredient in fun demos|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_20993010/iron-science-teacher-competitors-at-exploratorium-use-museum|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Jose Mercury News|date=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two out of three teachers applying were being turned away due to space limitations, by the time the Exploratorium closed at its former location; following the move to the Piers, the Exploratorium has been expanding its professional development for teachers through the Teacher Institute.&lt;ref name=Olney /&gt; {{As of|2013}}, two [[MOOC]] courses were also being made available through MOOC provider [[Coursera]]. One course integrates engineering into middle and high school [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]] classrooms, and the other integrates [[maker movement|making and tinkering activities]] into elementary and middle school classrooms.&lt;ref name=Coursera&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Booker|title=Coursera Online Hub Offers Teachers Development|url=http://www.informationweek.com/education/online-learning/coursera-online-hub-offers-teachers-deve/240153995|work=InformationWeek|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=May 1, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615031051/http://www.informationweek.com/education/online-learning/coursera-online-hub-offers-teachers-deve/240153995|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal learning programs===
The Exploratorium operates several programs centering on informal learning. The Institute for Inquiry (IFI) is a professional development program of the Exploratorium geared towards educators, scientists, administrators, and policymakers. The Institute is a recipient of National Science Foundation funding and designs programs, materials and tools to help leaders in the science education community further the role of inquiry in elementary science education and strengthen reform efforts. It consists of workshops and an online library of resources available to participants in the Institute.&lt;ref name=IFI&gt;{{Cite report |author=Inverness Research Associates |authorlink= |date=June 2001 |title=Report: The Exploratorium's Institute for Inquiry Four Cornerstone Claims|url=http://www.inverness-research.org/reports/2001-11-ExplorIFI-4CornerstnClaims/2001-11-Rpt-ExploratrmIFI_4CornerstnClaims-Execsum.PDF |publisher=Inverness Research |page=ii |docket= |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Inquiry partnered with the [[Sonoma Valley Unified School District]] on a program combining science education with [[English Language Development]] (ELD). Data from the two-year pilot study showed that a professional development program designed to help teachers integrate ELD strategies into science lessons had a significant, measurable impact on the achievement of students in both ELD and in science.&lt;ref name=innovation&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Narrative: Integrating English Language Development and Science: A Professional Development Approach|url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/innovation/2010/narratives/u396c100434.pdf|work=Investing in Innovation Fund Website|publisher=US Department of Education|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Informal Learning and Schools (CILS) is a collaboration between the Exploratorium, the [[University of California Santa Cruz]], and [[King's College London]]. CILS studies the intersection between museums and schools as centers of informal learning with the intention of understanding how informal science learning occurs and how informal educational centers such as the Exploratorium can contribute to science education reform.&lt;ref name=CILS&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Details: Center for Informal Learning and Schools|url=http://informalscience.org/projects/ic-000-000-001-775/Center_for_Informal_Learning_and_Schools|work=Informal Science|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tinkering Studio began in 2008 as an in-house program geared towards [[maker culture]] and a “think with your hands” approach. It is housed within the museum in a dedicated space in the South Gallery, where it runs free do-it-yourself activities for museum visitors; it also shares its work with a larger audience of educators in afterschool programs, schools, museums and other learning environments. It is being cited as a prototype for similar programs across the globe,&lt;ref name=tinkering&gt;{{cite news|last=Guthrie|first=Julian|title=Exploratorium's Tinkering Studio makes science fun|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-s-Tinkering-Studio-makes-science-fun-2295556.php|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including South Korea, Canada, India, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=mideast&gt;{{cite news|last=Raker|first=Silva|title=Exploratorium expanding minds in Mideast|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Exploratorium-expanding-minds-in-Mideast-4395559.php|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium also operates as afterschool tinkering program in partnership with San Francisco chapters of the Boys and Girls Club. In 2012 the Exploratorium was awarded a grant to create the California Tinkering Network, in collaboration with the Community Science Workshops, Techbridge, the [[Discovery Science Center]], the California Afterschool Network, and the California STEM Learning Network. These organizations partner with over 20 local afterschool or summer programs to provide STEM-enriched activities for children in underserved communities. The initiative was designed to test an adaptable model for providing tinkering activities to promote learning and development in an afterschool setting.&lt;ref name=cwsnetwork&gt;{{Cite report |last1=Michalchik |first1=Vera|last2=Remold|first2=Julie|last3=Verdugo |first3=Renato|date=March 2013 |title=California Tinkering Afterschool Network Pilot Year Evaluation Report |url=http://cswnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CA-Tinkering-Afterschool-Network-Evaluation-Report-FINAL.pdf |publisher=SRI International |page=1 |accessdate=17 June 2013}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium also houses a number of other educational resources. These include the Learning Commons, a library and media resource center that houses a collection of print and digital science teaching resources for use by regional educators; a webcast studio, located in the Central Gallery, which produces 75 educational Webcasts from the museum and locations around the world annually, including a live webcast of the Mars [[Curiosity Rover]] launch and landing; and Lifelong Learning, which creates educational programming for children, teens, family groups, and adults. Lifelong Learning programs further the Exploratorium’s stated dedication to informal learning and the museum as teaching tool, and include day camps, workshops for families, the Homeschool Science series (in-house classes geared specifically towards homeschooled students), the Girl’s Science Institute (multi-day workshops geared towards girls 9-11), and excursions for adults. The Exploratorium has also published a number of books, and many of the 50,000 pages on its website are hands-on activity ideas or science experiments in the museums’ signature open-ended style.

===Educational outreach===
The Exploratorium operates several educational outreach programs. The Community Outreach Program works with community organizations to provide exhibit-based educational activities for underserved children and families in the local community.&lt;ref name=tecolote&gt;{{cite news|last=Leibrich|first=Ryan|title=New Exploratorium location opens its doors|url=http://eltecolote.org/content/new-exploratorium-location-opens-its-doors/2013/04/25/|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=El Tecolote|date=April 25, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204600/http://eltecolote.org/content/new-exploratorium-location-opens-its-doors/2013/04/25/|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium is also home to XTech, a science education program for underserved middle school students. Begun in 2006, XTech was primarily funded by a National Science Foundation grant and provided afterschool activities in science, engineering, and technology in partnership with two community-based organizations in the Bay Area. XTech serves over 100 students a year in addition to 10-15 youth facilitators.&lt;ref name=xtech&gt;{{Cite report|last1=Carroll |first1=Becky |last2=Castori |first2=Pam |last3=Smith |first3=Anita |date=September 2009 |title=The Exploratorium's XTech Program: Engaging STEM Experiences for Middle School Youth |url=http://informalscience.org/images/evaluation/2009-09_Rpt_XTECH-SummRpt-final-1019-2009.pdf |publisher=Inverness Research |page=1 |accessdate=17 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133042/http://informalscience.org/images/evaluation/2009-09_Rpt_XTECH-SummRpt-final-1019-2009.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explainers===
The Exploratorium Explainer program, which has been operating since the museum opened, hires and trains high school students and young educators each year. The program tripled its capacity, hiring 300 Explainers, following the relocation to Pier 15 in 2013.&lt;ref name=KTVU&gt;{{cite news|title=SF Exploratorium set to open in new $300 million waterfront facility |url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/sf-exploratorium-set-open-new-300-million-digs/nXHLk |accessdate=18 June 2013 |newspaper=KTVU |date=April 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411173430/http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/sf-exploratorium-set-open-new-300-million-digs/nXHLk/ |archivedate=April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Explainers function essentially as docents. There are two types of Explainers: High School Explainers, who are teenagers, and Field Trip Explainers, who are college students and young educators. The program was conceived by Frank Oppenheimer in the early days of the museum. He wanted to provide a visitor experience that was a learning experience in a museum context&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{Cite thesis|type=PhD |title=Explainers' development of science-learner identities through participation in a community of practice |url=http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=antioch1327711877 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615204432/http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=antioch1327711877 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 2013 |last=Richardson |first=Anne |year=2011 |publisher=Antioch University |accessdate=17 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed for guesswork and the absence of "correct" answers. He felt young people would be more capable than adults at conveying the open-ended experience he was looking for. His plan with the Explainers was to "loosen up the whole feeling of learning." Oppenheimer also intended the program to allow students to experience learning outside the framework of their school systems. The Explainers come from a highly diverse array of socioeconomic backgrounds, and he hoped they would bring families and friends who would not otherwise be likely to visit a museum.&lt;ref name=Cole /&gt;{{rp|169–174}} Both the High School and Field Trip Explainers are paid positions.

The Explainer Program was inspired by the staff demonstrations Frank observed at the Palais de la Decouverte, although the facilitators at the Palais when Oppenheimer visited were either graduate students or practicing scientists. The success of the Exploratorium’s Explainer program led the Palais to eventually hire teenage explainers of their own.&lt;ref name=ASTC&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duensing|first=Sally|title=Exporting the Exploratorium:  Creating a "Culture of Learning"|journal=ASTC Dimensions|date=November–December 1999|url=http://www.astc.org/pubs/dimensions/1999/nov-dec/exporting.htm|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Explainers often cite their experiences at the Exploratorium as defining elements of their success,&lt;ref name=Hamlin&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamlin|first=Jesse|title=Learning From Teaching at the Exploratorium / Student guides' lessons went beyond science|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Learning-From-Teaching-at-the-Exploratorium-2914198.php|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=18 June 2013|date=August 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; including several notable tech CEOs.&lt;ref name=verisign&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Dan|title=Profile of VeriSign chairman, CEO|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=April 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;{{cite web|last=Silver|first=Linda|title=Backyard science today, an innovative workforce tomorrow|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/backyard-science-today-an-innovative-workforce-tomorrow|work=The National|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
[[File:Walter Kitundu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walter Kitundu]] - Artist in Residence and MacArthur Fellow]]
Despite being generally thought of as a science museum, the Exploratorium has always incorporated both science and art. As early as 1966, Frank Oppenheimer presented a paper discussing the connections between art and science, and the role of a museum in appealing to both casual visitors and serious students of all ages.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|142}}

The formal artist in residence program was started in 1974,&lt;ref name=AIR&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist-in-Residence Program|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/arts/artist-residence|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but artworks such as Bob Miller’s ''Sun Painting'' were commissioned shortly after the museum was opened in 1969.&lt;ref name=BobMiller&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Miller|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/collaborations/oshers/bob-miller|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the founding of the artist in residence program, over 250 artworks in various disciplines have been created.

Each year, the museum invites ten to twenty artists to participate in residencies ranging from two weeks to two years. Artists-in-residence work with staff and the visiting public to create original installations, exhibits, or performances. Artists are given a stipend, housing, travel expenses, and technical support, and they have at their disposal the Exploratorium's full array of metal and woodworking shops and materials. Two artists-in-residence who went on to become staff members have been awarded [[MacArthur Fellowship]] "genius" grants: [[Walter Kitundu]] and [[Ned Kahn]].

The new Embarcadero campus opened with more than 40 pieces by prominent artists, including Douglas Hollis, [[Golan Levin]], [[Lucky Dragons]], [[Amy Balkin]], and [[Fujiko Nakaya]]. The Center for Art and Inquiry, a new project at the new location, is an initiative to catalyze and orchestrate art across the museum.&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{cite web|last=Miranda|first=Carolina A.|title=Painting the Sun and Sculpting Fog|url=http://www.artnews.com/2013/03/20/the-new-exploratorium/|work=ARTnews|accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Artful Science from Sunny California |url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13318084.300-review-artful-science-from-sunny-california-.html |author = Peter Turvey|volume = |work= [[New Scientist]] |date = 1992-02-15 |accessdate = 2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium has an equally long history with musical, film and other performances. Participating artists and performers included [[Laurie Anderson]], [[John Cage]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Ali Akbar Khan]], [[Trimpin]], and [[The Mermen]].&lt;ref name=Speakingofmusic&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaking of Music|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/40th/podcasts.php|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the artists in residence, the museum’s Osher Fellows Program hosts 4-8 resident scholars, scientists, educators, and artists every year. Notable Osher Fellows have included [[Walter Murch]], [[James Crutchfield]], [[Christian de Duve]], [[Arthur Ganson]], [[Tim Hunkin]], [[Lewis Hyde]], [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], [[Guillermo Gómez-Peña]], [[Rosamond Wolff Purcell]], [[Oliver Sacks]], [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], and [[Juan Felipe Herrera]].&lt;ref name=Osher&gt;{{cite web|title=Osher Fellows|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/collaborations/oshers|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are hands-on activities for younger visitors (under 14 - needs confirmation).  The pendulum art activity has a youngster picking four different color markers.  The youngster then pushes a large board suspended by 4 wires to develop a pattern.  At the youngster's say so, the attendant places a selected color into an arm and lowers it onto a white paper weighted to the board.  The marker patterns the movement of the board. After 4 markers are done, the project is complete, signed by the 'young artist', and taken home.

In 2007, the Exploratorium was highlighted in the book ''Forces For Good'' as one of the 12 most effective non-profits in the United States, and was the only West Coast institution and only museum to make the list.&lt;ref name="Crutchfield"&gt;{{cite book|title=Forces for Good: The Six Practices of High-Impact Nonprofits|last1=Crutchfield|first1=Leslie R.|last2=McLeod Grant|first2=Heather|date=October 19, 2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|isbn=978-0787986124|page=22}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-06-20 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has inspired science museums worldwide, from the [[Reuben H. Fleet Science Center]] in San Diego to the [[Garden of Archimedes]] in Florence, Italy. In 2003, ''[[The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science]]'' noted that about 400 science centers in 43 countries were established after the example of the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name=Pancaldi&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

===Attendance===
In 2012, 570,000 people visited the Exploratorium; 55% were adults and 45% were children. Geographically, 52% were from the Bay Area, 24% from the rest of California, 14% from other states, and 10% outside the US. Some 36% received free or discounted admission, and 44,000 attended on free admission days. Prior to the relocation, 97,000 students and chaperons visited the museum each year; of these, 67,000 participated in the Field Trip program. It was estimated that 180 million people visited Exploratorium exhibits at science centers and other locations worldwide.&lt;ref name=factsheet /&gt;

Annual attendance at the new Pier 15 location was anticipated to exceed one million.&lt;ref name=Rogers&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=Paul|title=New Exploratorium, with $300 million price tag, to open next week on San Francisco waterfront|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_22982616/gleaming-new-300-million-exploratorium-open-next-wednesday?source=rss|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2013, the ''New York Times'' reported that although attendance had soared, revenues still fell short of goals, forcing the Exploratorium to lay off around 1/5 of its staff.&lt;ref name=ChangCutback&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=Exploratorium Forced to Cut Back|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/science/exploratorium-forced-to-cut-back.html|accessdate=2014-05-15|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum officials had decided not to make a big publicity push upon reopening, fearing the overcrowding experienced by the [[California Academy of Sciences]] in 2008, but this was later viewed as "an opportunity lost".&lt;ref name="ChangCutback" /&gt;  A staffer (expecting himself to be laid off) observed that the Exploratorium seemed to be "moving from visionary, internally developed work to work-for-hire for other museums around the world”, as the management scrambled to earn more money from consulting for other organizations to replace unrealized admissions revenue.&lt;ref name="ChangCutback" /&gt; On April 17, 2014 the Exploratorium announced that attendance in the first year since re-opening was 1.1 million visitors, and that other key statistics had doubled or tripled.&lt;ref name=Fact2014&gt;{{cite web|last=Slafkosky|first=Jenny|title=Fact Sheet: One Year at Pier 15|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/fact-sheet-one-year-pier-15|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website===
[[File:Exploratorium Webcast.jpg|thumb|right|''Solar Eclipse'' webcast at the old Exploratorium.]]
Online since 1993, the Exploratorium was one of the first museums to build a site on the World Wide Web.&lt;ref name=Gnatek&gt;
{{cite news

 |date = 2006-03-29
 |accessdate = 2010-11-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site serves 13 million visitors each year. It has received six [[Webby Award]]s since 1997, including four for Best Science Website and one for Best Education website, and has been an honoree an additional ten times.&lt;ref name=Webby&gt;{{cite web|title=The Webby Awards Gallery and Archive|url=http://winners.webbyawards.com|work=Webby Awards|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium's website is an extension of the experiences on the museum's floor and provides a large number of hands-on activities and exhibits for online-only visitors. The Exploratorium also broadcasts live video and/or audio directly from the museum floor (or from satellite feeds in the field, at such locations as Antarctica or the Belize rainforest) onto the Internet from its Webcast Studio. Webcasts provide access to special events, scientists, and other museum resources for audiences on the Web. Visitors to the website can hear or view interviews with scientists, "meet" interesting people, or tour unique locations from factories to particle accelerators.&lt;ref name=Semper&gt;

The Exploratorium has additionally released two free iPad apps, Sound Uncovered (2013) and Color Uncovered (2011), which assist in making its unique educational model as accessible as possible. Color Uncovered has been downloaded more than a million times.&lt;ref name=iPad&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Rebecca|title=Exploratorium’s new iPad app reveals ‘magic of existing phenomena’|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/12/exploratoriums-new-ipad-app-reveals-magic-of-existing-phenomena/|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===
The Exploratorium has a number of partnerships with other organizations. One notable current partnership is with the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).  NOAA research vessels periodically berth at the end of Pier 15 and use the working biological labs featured in the museum to bring their research and data to the public. A number of exhibits at the Exploratorium, such as ''Remote Rains'', are based on NOAA data. NOAA scientists additionally provided training for the Explainer program to assist Explainers in explaining science to visitors based on the NOAA’s areas of research.&lt;ref name=Plutchak /&gt;

===Global Studios===
The Exploratorium Global Studios initiative is an entrepreneurial endeavor that shares resources, exhibits, and research with foreign governments, universities, partner museums, libraries, hospitals, and other public and private entities around the world. One area of significant current activity for the Global Studios initiative is the Middle East, where it hopes to assist countries that are making long-term investments in education and transitioning to more information-based economies.&lt;ref name=GlobalStudios&gt;{{cite press release |title=Exploratorium Launches Global Studios, an Entrepreneurial Endeavor to Share Knowledge and Services Around the World |language=English |date=15 November 2012 |publisher=The Exploratorium |location= |url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/exploratorium-launches-global-studios-entrepreneurial-endeavor-share |accessdate=2013-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Tinkering Studio visited a science festival in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2012, where they trained a group of teachers to help thousands of festival participants to experience the hands-on learning style favored by the Exploratorium.&lt;ref&gt;

==Visiting the museum==
[[File:Wave Organ 2.jpg|thumb|''Wave Organ'' is an off-site Exploratorium exhibit]]

===Hours and access===
The Exploratorium is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10am-5pm, with adults-only evening hours from 6pm-10pm on Thursdays (for visitors age 18+). The entire museum is wheelchair-accessible.

The Exploratorium is located on the [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]] at Green Street, between [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman’s Wharf]] and the [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]]. The museum is accessible by multiple modes of public transit, including [[BART]], [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|Muni]] streetcar, bus, taxi, and [[pedicab]]. It is located {{convert|0.6|mi|km}} from the [[Embarcadero Station|Embarcadero]] BART and MUNI stations, and has its own stop on the [[F Market &amp; Wharves|F streetcar line]]. The Exploratorium does not own or operate any parking lots, but is located near several publicly accessible lots and on-street parking, including a lot directly across the street, operated by the Port of San Francisco.

===Events===
[[Pi Day|Community π Day]] started at the Exploratorium by [[Larry Shaw (Pi)|Larry Shaw]] and is celebrated annually on 3/14 (March 14). [[Iron Science Teacher]] competition (like [[Iron Chef]]) showcases science teachers as they devise classroom activities using a particular ingredient. Monthly events include "Full-Spectrum Science with Ron Hipschman". Every Thursday is "After Dark" for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/calendar|title=Upcoming Events Calendar {{!}} Exploratorium|date=2014-03-17|work=Exploratorium|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related points of interest===
The Exploratorium maintains exhibits in public Bay Area spaces. The Outdoor Exploratorium consists of 14 different exhibits relating to the local environment, all placed outside in the [[Fort Mason]] area and accessible to the general public.&lt;ref name=FrogMom&gt;{{cite web|title=Outdoor Exploratorium: Cool Science at Fort Mason|url=http://frogmom.com/2009/03/outdoor-exploratorium-cool-science-at-fort-mason|date=12 March 2009|work=FrogMom|accessdate=20 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204459/http://frogmom.com/2009/03/outdoor-exploratorium-cool-science-at-fort-mason|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wave Organ]]'' is another notable public artwork of the Exploratorium. Created by former staff artist Peter Richards, this acoustic sculpture is situated on a point of land jutting into the San Francisco Bay not far from the Exploratorium’s original Palace of Fine Arts location.

[[File:Purple_circle_100%25.svg|thumb| A purple circle is a symbol for gender neutrality, derived from the two [[gender symbols]]' colours mixed together, and without the distinguishing cross or arrow used in the gender symbols (♂ and ♀).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}]]

A '''gender-blind''' (or '''unisex''') person is someone who adheres to not distinguishing people by gender. Gender blind people generally advocate [[gender neutrality]] in society, such as activities undertaken and services provided without regard to the [[gender]] of those who participate. Those who identify as [[pansexual]] may also refer to themselves as 'gender-blind': however, pansexuality emphasizes gender-blindness in [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].

== Choice of words ==
{{Main|Gender neutral language}}

''Unisex'' is an older term, and a [[misnomer]] meaning "one sex". It should not be confused with [[bisexuality]].
''Gender-blind'' however goes against most tenets of [[heteronormativity]] by not looking at gender at all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== The National Student Genderblind Campaign ==

In 2006 the National Student Genderblind Campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genderblind.org|title=Khóa Học Kế Toán Thực Hành Uy Tín Tại TPHCM – Một trang web mới sử dụng WordPress|website=www.genderblind.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created as a collaborative [[grassroots]] organization intended to educate [[college]] students, administrators, and others throughout the United States. The NSGC advocates for the implementation of gender-inclusive [[dormitory|dorm]] room and [[washroom|bathroom]] options.

==Mixed-gender hospital rooms==

The use of mixed-gender hospital rooms has proved controversial in both the United Kingdom and Canada.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John Miner, Shared room sparks rage,London Free Press, June 17, 2010, http://www.lfpress.com/news/london/2010/06/16/14417821.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Manitoba's Health Minister, [[Theresa Oswald]], has campaigned actively against such rooms after receiving complaints from a Winnipeg patient, Ollie Ingram.&lt;ref name = Owen&gt;Bruce Owen, Oswald vows action to stop coed rooms in hospitals, Winnipeg Free Press, May 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Oswald said if humanity can "put somebody on the moon", it can find a way to honor gender requests without leading to delays for patients.&lt;ref name = Owen/&gt;  At the same time, some medical ethicists have been critical of efforts to return to single-sex rooms.&lt;ref name = Owen/&gt;   [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]], an advocate for mixed rooms in the United States, has written that opposition to gender-mixed rooms stems from "old-fashioned prejudice" and argues that: "Because some people have been brought up to fear or dislike sharing a room with a person of the opposite sex, or blush at the prospect of catching a glimpse of an unwelcome body part when a robe slips open, we enshrine and perpetuate this prejudice in social policy."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Appel, Are We Ready for Coed Hospital Rooms? ''Huffington Post'', June 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Great Britain has agreed to phase out such rooms by 2010.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Criticism==

Much as with [[Color blindness (race)|similar approaches to dealing with racism and ethnicity]], not recognising and taking account of participants' sex can be harmful. It posits that it functions in a post-sexism society where women are no longer treated differently than men on the basis of their sex. Meanwhile, gendered treatment prevails all over the world. Of a study of organisations which offered women-only services, 23% said that their reason was based on women's inequality and the desire to address that imbalance; 20% that women-only spaces promote female development and empowerment; 18% that they were providing a service not being met by unisex services and which focused on the specific needs of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Women-only services: making the case. A guide for women’s organisations|date=July 2011|publisher=Women's Resource Centre|page=18|url=https://thewomensresourcecentre.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Making-the-case-for-women-only-July-2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal test of the "reasonable person" has been criticised for being genderblind to be applied in some areas of the law, particularly sexual harassment. Women are subjected to more normalised and endemic sexual harassment than men. On the grounds of this, the American case of ''Ellison v. Brady'' 924 F.2d 872 (1991), the court held that "a sex-blind reasonable person standard tends to be male-based and tends to systematically ignore the experiences of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=McCammon,|editor1-first=Holly J.|editor2-last=Taylor|editor2-first=Verta|editor3-last=Reger|editor3-first=Jo|editor4-last=Einwohner|editor4-first=Rachel L.|title=The Oxford Handbook of U.S. Women's Social Movement Activism|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Studies indicate a broad support for single-sex service options to remain available. Of 1000 women polled by the Women's Resource Centre, 97% stated that women should have the option of accessing female-only services if they were victims of sexual assault. 57% indicated that they would choose a women-only gym over a mixed gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Women-only services: making the case.

[[Image:Germ-band extension.png|thumb|550px|alt=germ-band extension.|Schematic of ''Drosophila'' embryo at the start of germ-band elongation and 30 minutes later.  The germ-band (grey) is posterior to the cephalic furrow (curved-line) and folds dorsally (red arrow) upon cell intercalation.  Each rectangle represents a field of cells before (0 min) and after (30 min) convergent extension.  Colored nuclei arbitrarily mark rows of cells in order to visualize tissue morphogenesis.]]

'''Germ-band extension''' is a [[morphogenesis|morphological]] process widely studied in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' in which the [[germ layer|germ-band]], which develops into the segmented trunk of the embryo, approximately doubles in length along the [[anterior|anterior-posterior]] axis while subsequently narrowing along the dorsal-ventral axis.&lt;ref name="wie94"&gt;Irvine, K., and Wieschaus, E. (1994). Cell intercalation during Drosophila germ-band extension and its regulation by pair-rule segmentation genes. Development 120, 827–841.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germ-band extension begins shortly after [[gastrulation]] and is divided into two phases.  The fast phase, in which most of the extension occurs, takes about 25 minutes. The remaining extension continues during the slow phase and is completed in the following 70 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;da Silva, S. M. &amp; Vincent, J. P. (2007). Oriented cell divisions in the extending germband of Drosophila. Development 134, 3049–3054.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this process the ventral germ-band extends around the posterior end of the embryo, effectively folding over onto the dorsal side of the egg. Multiple individual cells intercalating mediolateral to the anterior-posterior axis drive the resulting global elongation of the embryo. In addition, cell shape changes, and oriented cell divisions in the posterior germ-band are in part required for full elongation.&lt;ref name="Butler, L.C. 2009"&gt;Butler, L.C., et al. (2009). Cell shape changes indicate a role for extrinsic tensile forces in Drosophila germ-band extension. Nature Cell Biology 11, 859-864.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, elongation of the body axis seems to be primarily linked to changes in cell neighbor relations.

This article describes axis elongation in ''Drosophila''.   However, the basis of germ-band elongation is applicable to many organisms including other [[invertebrates]] and [[vertebrates]] alike.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, R. (2006). Mechanisms of elongation in embryogenesis. Development 133, 2291–2302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular basis==
[[Image:T1Junction.png|thumb|550px|alt=T1 Junction Exchange.|Schematic of neighbor exchange or an elementary T1 process involving four cells.  T1-magenta cells are in direct contact.  T2-all cells share a common vertex. T3-resolution results in green cells sharing a common boundary.]]

In order for cells to intercalate between one another the [[adherens junctions]] that maintain the integrity of the [[epithelial]] tissue must be dynamically remodeled. [[Time-lapse microscopy]] has captured this process of cell neighbor exchange, which is schematically represented to the right. In the type 1 configuration, two cells contact each other along the anterior-posterior axis, whereas two dorsal-ventral cells do not directly contact. Next, the cell boundary between the two anterior-posterior neighbors selectively shrinks, resulting in an obligatory intermediate type 2 junction, where the four cells share a vertex. Upon resolution of the type 2 junction, a new type 3 junctions forms perpendicular to the original type 1 configuration. During this process the two dorsal-ventral cells have become neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Bertet, C., Sulak, L. &amp; Lecuit, T. (2004). Myosin-dependent junction remodelling controls planar cell intercalation and axis elongation. Nature 429, 667–671.&lt;/ref&gt; When multiple clusters of cells intercalate in the dorsal-ventral axis, through junctional neighbor exchange, the outcome is an extension of germ-band in the anterior-posterior axis.

In addition to the simple neighbor exchange, higher-ordered rosette formations have been observed in which five or more cells meet at a vertex. Multicellular rosettes form and resolve in a directional fashion that promotes germ-band elongation.&lt;ref&gt;Blankenship, J. T., Backovic, S. T., Sanny, J. S., Weitz, O. and Zallen, J. A. (2006). Multicellular rosette formation links planar cell polarity to tissue morphogenesis. Dev. Cell 11, 459-470.&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbor exchange and multicellular rosette formation involve oriented junctional remodeling, which indicates that the intercalating cells are intrinsically polarized within the plane of the epithelium.

==Molecular basis==
[[Image:planarpolarity.png|thumb|450px|alt=Planar Polarity.|Asymmetric localization of proteins to reciprocal cell borders in the apical plane of a polarized epithelial.]]

The dorsal-ventral intercalation of cells during germ-band extension ultimately arises from the asymmetric localization of proteins within individual cells. [[Immunofluorescence]] reveals that non-muscle [[Myosin II]] localizes to the anterior-posterior boundaries of cells, destabilizing adherens junctions, whereas the Bazooka/Par-3 complex localizes to dorsal-ventral boundaries, stabilizing adherens junctions. Moreover, ''bazooka'' mutants are defective in germ-band extension, which supports the idea that polarized protein localization is critical for cell rearrangements.&lt;ref name="wie04"&gt;Zallen, J., and Wieschaus, E. (2004). Patterned gene expression directs bipolar planar polarity in Drosophila. Dev. Cell 6, 343–355.&lt;/ref&gt; One mechanism by which Myosin II might promote polarized cell remodeling is through contractile activity that creates tension orienting junctional disassembly.&lt;ref&gt;Baum  B. (2004). Animal development: crowd control. Curr Biol. 7;14, 716-718.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the precise mechanism in which asymmetrically localized protein complexes encourage directed intercalation remains disputed.

The source that establishes planar polarity during germ-band extension remains elusive. Polarized intercalation is largely unaffected in mutant embryos that lack dorsal-ventral cell types. Yet, mutations that disrupt segmental patterning along the anterior-posterior axis, such as ''[[pair-rule gene|eve]]'' and ''[[pair-rule gene|runt]]'', decrease cell intercalation and subsequent germ-band elongation.&lt;ref name="wie94"/&gt; Furthermore, [[ectopic expression]] of eve or runt is sufficient to locally reorient the polarity of nearby cells. This evidence argues that planar polarity is established by cell-cell interactions, and not by a [[morphogen|long-range polarizing cue]]. Thus, polarizing information can spread from one cell to the next, downstream of an Eve-dependent signal that remains to be identified.&lt;ref name="wie04"/&gt;

==Tensile forces==
Researchers suggest that [[mesoderm]] [[invagination]] provides an anterior-posterior pulling force that contributes to germ-band extension through passive cell shape changes. Although anterior-posterior patterning mutants fail to fully extend their germ-bands, during the fast phase the elongation length is normal despite defects in polarized cell intercalation. Time-lapse analysis revealed that an increase in cell shape stretching in the anterior-posterior axis was compensating for aberrant cell intercalation, independent of anterior-posterior patterning. Furthermore, during [[wild type]] development, it has been suggested that intercalary cell behavior relaxes the stress imposed on the germ-band, allowing stretched cells to restore to isometric shapes.&lt;ref name="Butler, L.C. 2009"/&gt;

In addition, there is evidence that mechanical tension is necessary and sufficient for the cortical localization of Myosin II. Thus, not only can Myosin II generate tension but it may also be up-regulated by tensile forces, creating a [[positive feedback]] loop that allows cells to dynamically respond to fluctuations in their mechanical environment.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Gonzalez R, Simoes Sde M, Röper JC, Eaton S, Zallen JA.

[[File:SDG Latex Hands.jpg|thumb|Black latex gloves]]
[[File:Disposable gloves 09.JPG|thumb|Latex]]
'''Glove fetishism''' is a [[sexual fetishism]] where an individual is [[sexually stimulated]], often to the point of obsession, by another person or oneself wearing [[glove]]s on their hands. In some cases, the fetish is enhanced by the material of the glove (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[leather]], [[cotton]], [[latex]], [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[satin]] or [[nylon]]). Often, the actions of a gloved hand are as arousing as the glove itself, because the glove provides a second skin, or in other words a fetishistic surrogate for the wearer's own skin. [[Medical gloves]] and [[rubber gloves]] provide not only a safer sex environment, but also give a latex glove fetishist great pleasure. Subtle movements by the gloved fingers or the hand as a whole can provide the individual with a great visual stimulus and ultimately [[sexual arousal]]. The act of putting gloves on, or slipping them off the hands, can also be a source of glove fetish fantasy. Smell is also a factor when it comes to latex, rubber, and leather gloves. 

Medical glove fetishism involves thin latex gloves, which come in many different types. Personal preference ranges from color, smell, size, textured, smooth, powdered, or un-powdered. Fetishists are proud of their collection of medical gloves, as well as rubber gloves. Household rubber gloves tend to be more thick, longer, and are mostly used for cleaning purposes. 

Some glove fetishists prefer certain lengths, for example the [[Evening glove|long opera-style]] or short cuff length. Some also like them as a part of an outfit, such as a [[nurse]], [[police officer|policewoman]] or [[French maid]] uniform.  Some who are of a sexually submissive nature are stimulated by their dominant partner's wearing and use of gloves.  Dominant partners may likewise prefer that their submissives wear gloves.  As with all fetishes however, there need not be a BDSM connection to an affinity for gloves.

Apart from their appearance, some individuals prefer to use them on oneself or others as a form of sexual stimulation. The ones most commonly used for this are made of leather, latex (such as those doctors or nurses use for examination), while others prefer the household rubber glove. The appeal behind the household glove may be due to the colours they come in but also offering what the latex examination gloves cannot; household gloves are thicker, some more than others depending on what their use is. Many enjoy [[erotic spanking]] with gloves donned. It offers a different feeling and sound to the "spankee", which can be a large part of the fetish.

[[File:Ordovician hardground Utah.jpg|thumb|[[Eocrinoidea|Eocrinoid]] holdfasts on an [[Ordovician]] [[Carbonate hardgrounds|hardground]] in [[Utah]].]]
A '''holdfast''' is a [[root]]-like structure that anchors [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] organisms, such as [[seaweed]], other sessile [[algae]], stalked [[crinoid]]s, [[Benthic zone|benthic]] [[cnidaria]]ns, and [[sponge]]s, to the [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=D. N. Thomas |year=2002 |title=Seaweeds |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London |isbn=978-0-565-09175-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holdfasts vary in shape and form depending on both the species and the substrate type.  The holdfasts of organisms that live in muddy substrates often have complex tangles of root-like growths. These projections are called '''[[wikt:haptera|haptera]]''' and similar structures of the same name are found on [[lichen]]s.  The holdfasts of organisms that live in sandy substrates are bulb-like and very flexible, such as those of [[sea pen]]s, thus permitting the organism to pull the entire body into the substrate when the holdfast is contracted.  The holdfasts of organisms that live on smooth surfaces (such as the surface of a boulder) have flattened bases which adhere to the surface. The organism derives no nutrition from this intimate contact with the substrate, as the process of liberating nutrients from the substrate requires [[enzyme|enzymatically]] eroding the substrate away, thereby increasing the risk of organism falling off the substrate.

The claw-like holdfasts of [[kelp]]s and other algae differ from the roots of [[Embryophyte|land plants]], in that they have no absorbent function, instead serving only as an anchor.&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough, D.1984.

[[File:Institutsgebaeude ICBM Univ.Oldenburg OLWechloy.jpg|thumb| The ICBM main building in Oldenburg; Germany]]

The '''Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment''' of the [[University of Oldenburg|Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]] ({{lang-de|Institut für Chemie und Biologie des Meeres der Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg}}, abbreviated ICBM)
is one of the marine science institutes at the German coast and the only [[University of Oldenburg|university-based]] marine research institute in [[Lower Saxony]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-meeresforschung.de/en/icbm Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment ICBM) at the University of Oldenburg], at German Marine Research Consortium, retrieved 2014-07-08&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]].
The ICBM is located on the campus Wechloy in Oldenburg, with locations in Wilhelmshaven  and on the island of Spiekeroog (in relation to the national park centre Wittbülten on the area of the Hermann Lietz School). The ICBM operates the Wadden Sea time series station Spiekeroog (WSS) and several research vessels.

==Mission statement and research==
The ICBM carries out fundamental and applied research in [[Marine Sciences|marine]] and [[Environmental Sciences|environmental]] sciences. Interdisciplinary research will provide understanding of the various interactions of marine environmental systems. 
The research focuses on marine [[biogeochemical cycles]] and energy fluxes, as well as on the functional role of [[marine biodiversity]], especially in coastal zones worldwide, and in the oceans.
The mathematic modelling of different environmental systems is complemented by modern, high-resolution analytics and in-house marine sensor developments.
The institute is composed of three sections covering altogether 18 research groups:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbm.de/en/research-groups-at-the-icbm/ Research Groups at the ICBM], at icbm.de, retrieved 2014-07-08&lt;/ref&gt;
*Section Geochemistry and Analytics
*Section Biology and Ecology
*Section Physics and Modelling
For a better understanding of the complex relations the ICBM aims to foster interdisciplinary research.

==Academic training==
The courses of study are closely related to the research activities to provide interdisciplinary and research-oriented training.
The institute offers a broad bachelor programme with contents of marine, environmental and landscape-ecological sciences as well as four Master Programmes which are: Marine Environmental Sciences, Microbiology (held in English), Environmental Modelling and Marine Sensors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbm.de/en/study-and-teaching/courses-of-study/ Courses of study at the ICBM], at icbm.de, retrieved 2014-07-09&lt;/ref&gt; In cooperation with the ICBM, the Jade University of Applied Sciences offers a Bachelor Programme which is fundamental for marine engineering. The ICBM is ERASMUS exchange partner for students.

==History==
In July 1987, Lower Saxony’s minister of Science and Art approved the establishment of the ICBM as a cooperation of the university departments of mathematics, biology, physics and chemistry. In 1991, the ICBM was approved as a central organisation of the University of Oldenburg. The registered association „Centre for Research on Shallow seas, [[Coast|Coastal Zones]] and the Marine Environment – Research Centre Terramare” (Zentrum für Flachmeer-, Küsten- und Meeresumweltforschung e.V. – Forschungszentrum Terramare) which was founded in 1990 in Wilhelmshaven and financed through federal state resources was incorporated into the ICBM in 2008.
The former directors of the ICBM are Wolfgang Krumbein, Ulrich Kattmann, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Bruno Eckhardt, Wolfgang Ebenhöh, Heribert Cypionka, Meinhard Simon, Hans-Jürgen Brumsack, Ulrike Feudel and Jürgen Rullkötter. At the moment, the institute is headed by Helmut Hillebrand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-meeresforschung.de/en/icbm Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment ICBM) at the University of Oldenburg], at German Marine Research Consortium, retrieved 2014-07-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooperations and Memberships==
The ICBM cooperates closely with the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology und MARUM, both located in Bremen; with the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, as well as with the Senckenberg Institute by the Sea and the Jade University of Applied Sciences, both located in Wilhelmshaven. The ICBM is a member of the German Marine Research Consortium (KDM) and of the Northwest Marine Research Association (NWMV).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbm.de/en/cooperations/scientific-cooperations/ Partnerships] at icbm.de, retrieved 2014-07-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lakeland traces its beginnings to German immigrants who, seeking a new life, traveled to America and settled in the Sheboygan area.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2010/02/22/focus24.html|title=Lakeland College|last=|first=|date=21 February 2010|website=www.bizjournals.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some milestones in the college’s history:
* In 1862, the founders built Missionshaus (Mission House), a combined academy-college-seminary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The school was called Mission House College and Seminary until 1956 when it adopted the name Lakeland College.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fox11online.com/news/local/lakeshore/lakeland-college-to-be-called-lakeland-university|title=Lakeland College to be called Lakeland University|last=News|first=FOX 11|work=WLUK|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1956, the college adopted the name Lakeland and began focusing on a liberal arts education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The seminary combined with the Yankton Theological School to become United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities and relocated to Minneapolis/St. Paul in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS1773|title=Reformed Churches in Wisconsin {{!}} Wisconsin Historical Society|date=2012-08-03|work=Wisconsin Historical Society|access-date=2018-08-23|language=Sheboygan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1978, Lakeland launched the state’s first degree-completion program for working adults by offering evening classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hngnews.com/sun_prairie_star/community/article_5f8032d0-f04e-5a7b-b7a7-7d449426148a.html|title=Lakeland College celebrates 30 years of adult education at Madison Center|work=Hometown News LP|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Lakeland’s Evening, Weekend &amp; Online program enrolls more than 2,000 graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/lcmuskies/docs/lakeland-fall-2016|title=Lakeland Fall 2016|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1991, Lakeland founded a campus in Tokyo, Japan and in 2005 it was recognized as an overseas campus, allowing it to sponsor visas for students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* On July 1, 2016, Lakeland College became Lakeland University. This change resulted in the creation of three schools, a School of Business &amp; Entrepreneurship; a School of Science, Technology &amp; Education; and a School of Humanities and Fine Arts as well as new academic offerings. The change was fueled by many factors, including desire to increase international recruitment and clear up confusion with [[Lakeshore Technical College]], a neighboring institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lakeland.edu/Lakeland-News/lakeland-college-to-become-lakeland-university-on-july-1|title=Lakeland College to become Lakeland University on July 1|website=lakeland.edu|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Lakeland==
Lakeland University is a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and [[master's degree]]-granting liberal arts institution related to the United Church of Christ with nearly 3,500 students (850 traditional undergraduate students and 2,600 evening, weekend and online students) from 24 countries, 10 on-campus residence halls and more than 30 majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lakeland.edu/Admissions/quick-facts-admissions|title=Quick Facts|website=lakeland.edu|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Le Guide musical''''' (English: The Music Guide) was a weekly French-language Belgian and French classical music periodical founded 1 March 1855 in Brussels by Peter Bernhard Schott (1821–1873), of the Brussels music publishing house [[Schott frères]] (Schott brothers).&lt;ref name="Sandrine" /&gt;

==Editors and history==
[[Maurice Kufferath]] (1852–1919) was editor from 1887 to 1891.&lt;ref&gt;''The Music Reviews and Criticism in Wallonia and Brussels in the Nineteenth Century'', by Henri Albert Alexander Vanhulst (born 1943) (Brussels), ''Periodica Musica'' (in French), [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]]: [[University of Maryland]] (publisher), vol. IX (1991), pp. 15–19; {{ISSN|0822-7594}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, the editorial office relocated to Paris and began publishing from both Paris and Brussels. In 1892, Otto Junne, director of [[Schott frères]], sold the periodical to Kufferath, the editor. From 1894 to 1905, Hugues Imbert (1842–1905) became editor-in-chief, then Henri de Curzon (1861–1942). Kufferath preserved the publication's Franco-Belgium character. The publication ceased publication in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Guide musical|url=http://www.ripm.org/?page=JournalInfo&amp;ABB=GMU|publisher=ripm|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9936">'''Memory ordering''' describes the order of accesses to computer memory by a CPU. The term can refer either to the memory ordering generated by the [[compiler]] during [[compile time]], or to the memory ordering generated by a CPU during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime]].

In modern [[microprocessor]]s, memory ordering characterizes the CPUs ability to reorder memory operations - it is a type of [[out-of-order execution]]. Memory reordering can be used to fully utilize the bus-bandwidth of different types of memory such as [[CPU cache#Cache entries|cache]]s and [[memory bank]]s.

On most modern uniprocessors memory operations are not executed in the order specified by the program code. In single threaded programs all operations appear to have been executed in the order specified, with all out-of-order execution hidden to the programmer – however in multi-threaded environments (or when interfacing with other hardware via memory buses) this can lead to problems. To avoid problems [[memory barrier]]s can be used in these cases.

== Compile-time memory ordering ==
The [[compiler]] has some freedom to sort the order of operations during [[compile time]]. However this can lead to problems if the order of memory accesses is of importance.

=== Compile-time memory barrier implementation ===
{{See also|Memory barrier}}
These barriers prevent a compiler from reordering instructions during compile time – they do not  prevent reordering by CPU during runtime.

* The GNU inline assembler statement
 asm volatile("" ::: "memory");

or even
 __asm__ __volatile__ ("" ::: "memory");

forbids [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] compiler to reorder read and write commands around it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.31/include/linux/compiler-gcc.h#L12 GCC compiler-gcc.h] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724181810/http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.31/include/linux/compiler-gcc.h |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The C11/C++11 command
 atomic_signal_fence(memory_order_acq_rel);
forbids the compiler to reorder read and write commands around it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic_signal_fence]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Runtime memory ordering ==

=== In symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) microprocessor systems ===

There are several memory-consistency models for [[symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] systems:
*Sequential consistency (all reads and all writes are in-order)
*Relaxed consistency (some types of reordering are allowed)
** Loads can be reordered after loads (for better working of cache coherency, better scaling)
** Loads can be reordered after stores
** Stores can be reordered after stores
** Stores can be reordered after loads
*Weak consistency (reads and writes are arbitrarily reordered, limited only by explicit [[memory barrier]]s)

On some CPUs
* [[Atomic operation]]s can be reordered with loads and stores.
* There can be incoherent instruction cache pipeline, which prevents [[self-modifying code]] from being executed without special instruction cache flush/reload instructions.
* Dependent loads can be reordered (this is unique for Alpha). If the processor fetches a pointer to some data after this reordering, it might not fetch the data itself but use stale data which it has already cached and not yet invalidated. Allowing this relaxation makes cache hardware simpler and faster but leads to the requirement of memory barriers for readers and writers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/AlphaReordering.html Reordering on an Alpha processor by Kourosh Gharachorloo]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nutrient''' is a [[Chemical substance|substance]] used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce. The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s. Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for [[metabolism|metabolic purposes]] or [[excretion|excreted]] by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as [[hair]], [[scale (anatomy)|scales]], [[feather]]s, or [[exoskeleton]]s. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, such as for [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and [[fermentation]] products ([[ethanol]] or [[vinegar]]), leading to end-products of water and [[carbon dioxide]]. All organisms require water. Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the [[amino acid]]s that are combined to create [[protein]]s, a subset of [[fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s and certain [[mineral (nutrient)|minerals]]. Plants require more diverse minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. [[fungus|Fungi]] live on dead or living organic matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.

Different types of organism have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid ([[vitamin C]]) is essential, meaning it must be consumed in sufficient amounts, to humans and some other animal species, but not to all animals and not to plants, which are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be [[organic compound|organic]] or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as [[iron]], [[selenium]], and [[zinc]], while organic nutrients include, among many others, energy-providing compounds and vitamins.

A classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] and [[micronutrient]]s. Consumed in relatively large amounts ([[gram]]s or [[ounce]]s), macronutrients ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, proteins, water) are used primarily to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts ([[milligram]]s or [[microgram]]s); they have subtle [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] roles in cellular processes, like [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular functions]] or [[action potential|nerve conduction]]. Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary nutrient intakes, such as the United States [[Dietary Reference Intake]], are based on deficiency outcomes{{clarify|date=January 2018}} and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and [[Tolerable upper intake levels|upper limits]] of intake.

In addition to carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulfur]] are also needed in relatively large quantities. Together, the "Big Six" are the elemental '''macronutrients''' for all [[biological life|organisms]].&lt;ref name=wsj20101203&gt;
[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703377504575650840897300342?mod=ITP_pageone_1#printMode New Link in Chain of Life], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 2010-12-03, accessed 2010-12-05. "Until now, however, they were all thought to share the same biochemistry, based on the Big Six, to build proteins, fats and DNA."&lt;/ref&gt;
They are sourced from inorganic matter (for example, [[carbon dioxide]], [[water]], [[nitrate]]s, [[phosphate]]s, [[sulfate]]s, and [[diatomic molecule]]s of nitrogen and, especially, oxygen) and organic matter ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s).

==Types of nutrients==
{{main|Nutrition}}

===Macronutrients===
Macronutrients are defined in several ways.&lt;ref name="Kern2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Kern|title=CRC desk reference on sports  nutrition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOYqeeXWomwC&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=12 October 2010|date=12 May 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-2273-0|pages=117–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[chemical element]]s humans consume in the largest quantities are [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulphur]], summarized as [[CHNOPS]].
* The chemical compounds that humans consume in the largest quantities and provide bulk energy are classified as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[fat]]s. Water must be also consumed in large quantities.
* [[Calcium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[chloride]] ions, along with phosphorus and sulfur, are listed with [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] because they are required in large quantities compared to [[micronutrient]]s, i.e., vitamins and other minerals, the latter often described as trace or ultratrace minerals.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Macronutrients provide energy:

* [[Carbohydrate]]s are compounds made up of types of [[sugar]]. Carbohydrates are classified according to their number of sugar units: [[monosaccharide]]s (such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]), [[disaccharide]]s (such as [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]), [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s (such as [[starch]], [[glycogen]], and [[cellulose]]).
* [[Protein]]s are [[organic compound]]s that consist of [[amino acid]]s joined by [[peptide bond]]s. Since the body cannot manufacture some of the [[amino acid]]s (termed [[essential amino acid]]s), the diet must supply them. Through digestion, [[protein]]s are [[protein catabolism|broken down]] by [[protease]]s back into free amino acids.
* [[Fat]]s consist of a [[glycerin]] molecule with three [[fatty acid]]s attached. Fatty acid molecules contain a -COOH group attached to unbranched [[hydrocarbon]] chains connected by single bonds alone ([[Saturated fat|saturated fatty acids]]) or by both double and single bonds ([[Unsaturated fat|unsaturated fatty acids]]). Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of [[cell membrane]]s, to maintain a stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair. Because the body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed [[essential fatty acid]]s), they must be obtained through one's diet.

Fat has an [[energy]] content of 9{{nbsp}}[[kcal]]/g (~37.7 kJ/g) and proteins and carbohydrates 4{{nbsp}}kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Micronutrients===
Micronutrients support metabolism.

* [[Dietary mineral]]s are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron. Some of these minerals are essential to human metabolism.
* [[Vitamin]]s are organic compounds essential to the body. They usually act as [[coenzyme]]s or [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for various proteins in the body.

== Essentiality ==

=== Essential nutrients ===
An '''essential nutrient''' is a nutrient required for normal physiological function that cannot be synthesized in the body&amp;nbsp;– either at all or in sufficient quantities&amp;nbsp;– and thus must be obtained from a [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://library.med.utah.edu/NetBiochem/nutrition/lect1/2_1.html | title = What is an essential nutrient? | publisher = NetBiochem Nutrition, [[University of Utah]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VaughanGeissler2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Griffith Vaughan|author2=Catherine Geissler|author3=Barbara Nicholson |author4=Elisabeth Dowle |author5=Elizabeth Rice|title=The new Oxford book of food plants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdKxFcen8zgC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=13 October 2010|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-954946-7|pages=212–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[water]], which is universally required for the maintenance of [[homeostasis]] in mammals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jéquier|first1=E|last2=Constant|first2=F|title=Water as an essential nutrient: the physiological basis of hydration|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=2 September 2009|volume=64|issue=2|pages=115–123|doi=10.1038/ejcn.2009.111|url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v64/n2/pdf/ejcn2009111a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; essential nutrients are indispensable for various cellular [[metabolic process]]es and maintaining tissue and organ function.&lt;ref name="AJCN"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chipponi|first1=JX|last2=Bleier|first2=JC|last3=Santi|first3=MT|last4=Rudman|first4=D|title=Deficiencies of essential and conditionally essential nutrients.|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=May 1982|volume=35|issue=5 Suppl|pages=1112–1116|pmid=6805293|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/35/5/1112.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of humans, there are nine [[amino acid]]s, two [[fatty acid]]s, thirteen [[vitamin]]s and fifteen [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]] that are considered essential nutrients.&lt;ref name="AJCN" /&gt; In addition, there are several molecules that are considered conditionally essential nutrients since they are indispensable in certain developmental and pathological states.&lt;ref name="AJCN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carver"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carver|first1=Jane|title=Neonatal Nutrition and Metabolism|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=299–311|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511544712.020|chapter=Conditionally essential nutrients: choline, inositol, taurine, arginine, glutamine and nucleotides}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kendler|first1=BS|title=Supplemental conditionally essential nutrients in cardiovascular disease therapy|journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing|date=2006|volume=21|issue=1|pages=9–16|pmid=16407731|doi=10.1097/00005082-200601000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amino acids====
{{Main|Essential amino acid}}
An essential amino acid is an [[amino acid]] that is required by an organism but cannot be synthesized ''[[de novo synthesis|de novo]]'' by it, and therefore must be supplied in its diet. Out of the twenty standard protein-producing amino acids, nine cannot be [[endogenous]]ly synthesized by humans: [[phenylalanine]], [[valine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], [[methionine]], [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], [[lysine]], and [[histidine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Young VR |title=Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations |journal=J.

====Fatty acids====
{{Main|Essential fatty acid}}
Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are [[fatty acid]]s that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot [[Biosynthesis|synthesize]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | edition = 6th | year = 1980 |author1=Robert S. Goodhart |author2=Maurice E. Shils | publisher = Lea and Febinger | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 0-8121-0645-8 | pages = 134–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans: [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]) and [[linoleic acid]] (an [[omega-6 fatty acid]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whitney Ellie |author2=Rolfes SR | title = Understanding Nutrition | edition = 11th | location = California | publisher = Thomson Wadsworth | year = 2008 | pages = 154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vitamins====
{{Main|Vitamin}}
Vitamins are organic molecules essential for an organism that are not classified as [[amino acid]]s or [[fatty acid]]s. They commonly function as [[enzymatic cofactor]]s, metabolic regulators or [[antioxidant]]s. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules (e.g. [[vitamin E]] includes [[tocopherol]]s and [[tocotrienol]]s):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brigelius-Flohé R, Traber MG | title = Vitamin E: function and metabolism | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 1145–1155 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10385606 | last2 = Traber | doi=10.1096/fasebj.13.10.1145}}&lt;/ref&gt; vitamins A, C, D, E, K, [[thiamine]] (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), [[riboflavin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[niacin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pantothenic acid]] (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] (e.g., [[pyridoxine]]), [[biotin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;), [[folate]] (B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[cobalamin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin.

====Minerals====
{{Main|Mineral (nutrient)}}
Minerals are the [[exogenous]] [[chemical element]]s indispensable for life. Although the four elements: [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. [[Sulfur]] is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.

The essential nutrient elements for humans, listed in order of [[Reference Daily Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (expressed as a mass), are [[potassium]], [[chlorine]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iodine]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[cobalt]] (the last as a component of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as [[boron]] and [[silicon]].

===Conditionally essential nutrients===
Conditionally essential nutrients are certain organic molecules that can normally be synthesized by an organism, but under certain conditions in insufficient quantities. In humans, such conditions include [[Preterm birth|premature birth]], limited nutrient intake, rapid growth, and certain disease states.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt; [[Choline]], [[inositol]], [[taurine]], [[arginine]], [[glutamine]] and [[nucleotides]] are classified as conditionally essential and are particularly important in neonatal diet and metabolism.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;

=== Non-essential nutrients ===
Non-essential nutrients are substances within foods that can have a significant impact on health; these substances can be beneficial or toxic.{{mcn|date=January 2018}} For example, [[dietary fiber]] is not absorbed in the human digestive tract, but is important in maintaining the bulk of a [[bowel movement]] to avoid [[constipation]].{{mcn|date=January 2018}} A subset of dietary fiber, [[soluble fiber]], can be metabolized by bacteria residing in the large intestine.&lt;ref name="Butyrate synthesis pathways" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lupton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prebiotic digestion" /&gt; Soluble fiber is marketed as serving a [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] function{{snd}}promoting "healthy" intestinal bacteria.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Bacterial metabolism of soluble fiber also produces [[short-chain fatty acid]]s like [[butyric acid]], which may be absorbed into intestinal cells as a source of calories.&lt;ref name="Butyrate synthesis pathways"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vital M, Howe AC, Tiedje JM | title = Revealing the bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways by analyzing (meta)genomic data | journal = mBio | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e00889 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24757212 | pmc = 3994512 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00889-14 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lupton"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lupton JR | title = Microbial degradation products influence colon cancer risk: the butyrate controversy | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 2 | pages = 479–482 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14747692 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/134/2/479 | doi=10.1093/jn/134.2.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prebiotic digestion"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cummings JH, Macfarlane GT, Englyst HN | title = Prebiotic digestion and fermentation | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 73 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 415S-420S | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11157351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-nutrients===
[[Ethanol]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH) supplies calories. For spirits (vodka, gin, rum, etc.) a standard serving in the United States is {{convert|1.5|USfloz|ml}}, which at 40%{{nbsp}}ethanol (80{{nbsp}}proof) would be 14 grams and 98 calories. At 50%{{nbsp}}alcohol, 17.5{{nbsp}}grams and 122.5{{nbsp}}calories. Wine and beer contain a similar amount of ethanol in servings of {{convert|5|USfloz|ml}} and {{convert|12|USfloz|ml}}, respectively, but these beverages also contain non-ethanol calories. A 5-ounce serving of wine contains 100 to 130 calories. A 12-ounce serving of beer contains 95 to 200 calories.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based on [[NHANES]] 2013–2014 surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8{{nbsp}}grams of alcohol per day and men consume on average 15.5 grams per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf "What We Eat in America, NHANES 2013-2014"]&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring the non-alcohol contribution of those beverages, the average ethanol calorie contributions are 48 and 108 cal/day, respectively.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Alcoholic beverages are considered [[empty calorie]] foods because, other than calories, they contribute no essential nutrients.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

By definition, [[phytochemical]]s include all nutritional and non-nutritional components of edible plants.&lt;ref name="lpi1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phytochemicals|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included as nutritional constituents are [[provitamin]] A [[carotenoid]]s,&lt;ref name="lpi2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carotenoids|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas those without nutrient status are diverse [[polyphenol]]s, [[flavonoid]]s, [[resveratrol]], and [[lignan]]s &amp;ndash; often claimed to have [[antioxidant]] effects &amp;ndash; that are present in numerous plant foods.&lt;ref name="lpi3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flavonoids|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of phytochemical compounds are under preliminary research for their potential effects on human diseases and health.&lt;ref name="lpi1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lpi2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=lpi3/&gt; However, the qualification for nutrient status of compounds with poorly defined properties ''[[in vivo]]'' is that they must first be defined with a [[Dietary Reference Intake]] level to enable accurate food labeling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrient content claims--general principles; 21CFR101.13|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.13|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a condition not established for most phytochemicals that are claimed to be antioxidant nutrients.&lt;ref name="nutra"&gt;{{cite web |title= New Roles for Polyphenols.

==Deficiencies and toxicity==
''See [[Vitamin]], [[Mineral (nutrient)]], [[Protein (nutrient)]]''

An inadequate amount of a nutrient is a deficiency. Deficiencies can be due to a number of causes including an inadequacy in nutrient intake, called a dietary deficiency, or any of several conditions that interfere with the utilization of a nutrient within an organism.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"/&gt; Some of the conditions that can interfere with nutrient utilization include problems with nutrient absorption, substances that cause a greater than normal need for a nutrient, conditions that cause nutrient destruction, and conditions that cause greater nutrient excretion.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"/&gt; Nutrient toxicity occurs when excess consumption of a nutrient does harm to an organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Nutrient Toxicity|journal=Nutrition Reviews|volume=39|issue=6|pages=249–256|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.1981.tb07453.x|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Canada, recommended dietary intake levels of essential nutrients are based on the minimum level that "will maintain a defined level of nutriture in an individual", a definition somewhat different from that used by the [[World Health Organization]] and [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of a "basal requirement to indicate the level of intake needed to prevent pathologically relevant and clinically detectable signs of a dietary inadequacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Dietary Reference Intakes.

RDAs are set higher than EARs to cover people with higher than average needs. Adequate Intakes (AIs) are set when there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs. Governments are slow to revise information of this nature. For the U.S. values, with the exception of calcium and vitamin D, all of the data date to 1997-2004.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt;

*For niacin and magnesium there appears to be a contradiction inherent in the information in the table, as the amounts recommended for daily consumption can be more than the amounts identified as the safe upper limits. For both nutrients, the ULs identify the amounts which will not increase risk of adverse effects when the nutrients are consumed as a serving of a dietary supplement. Magnesium above the UL may cause diarrhea. Niacin above the UL may cause flushing of the face and a sensation of body warmth. Each country or regional regulatory agency decides on a safety margin below when symptoms may occur, so the ULs can differ.&lt;ref name=DRITable /&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA /&gt;

'''EAR''' U.S. Estimated Average Requirements.

'''RDA''' U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances; higher for adults than for children, and may be even higher for women who are pregnant or lactating.

'''AI'''  U.S. Adequate Intake; AIs established when there is not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs.

'''PRI''' Population Reference Intake is European Union equivalent of RDA; higher for adults than for children, and may be even higher for women who are pregnant or lactating. For Thiamin and Niacin the PRIs are expressed as amounts per MJ of calories consumed. MJ = megajoule = 239 food calories.

'''Upper Limit'''  Tolerable upper intake levels.

'''ND'''  ULs have not been determined.

'''NE'''  EARs, PRIs or AIs have not yet been established or will not be (EU does not consider chromium an essential nutrient).

The university has an extensive student life program, with over 1,000 student organizations; intercollegiate, club and recreational sports programs; student media organizations and publications, [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities and sororities]]; and three student governments. Ohio State athletic teams compete in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] ([[Football Bowl Subdivision]] for football) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and are known as the [[Ohio State Buckeyes]]. Athletes from Ohio State have won 100 Olympic medals ([[List of American universities with Olympic medals|44 gold, 35 silver, and 21 bronze]]). The university is a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]] for the majority of sports. The [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey|Ohio State men's ice hockey]] program competes in the [[Big Ten Conference]], while its [[Ohio State Buckeyes women's ice hockey|women's hockey]] program competes in the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]]. In addition, the OSU men's volleyball team is a member of the [[Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]] (MIVA). OSU is one of only 14 universities that plays Division I FBS football and Division I ice hockey.

==History==
{{Main|History of Ohio State University}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}
The proposal of a manufacturing and agriculture university in central Ohio was initially met in the 1870s with hostility from the state's agricultural interests and competition for resources from [[Ohio University]], which was chartered by the [[Northwest Ordinance]], and [[Miami University]]. Championed by the [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] [[Stalwart (politics)|stalwart]] Governor [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], The Ohio State University was founded in 1870 as a [[land-grant university]] under the [[Morrill Act of 1862]] as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College. The school was originally within a farming community on the northern edge of Columbus. While some interests in the state had hoped the new university would focus on matriculating students of various agricultural and mechanical disciplines, Hayes manipulated both the university's location and its initial board of trustees towards a more comprehensive end.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The university opened its doors to 24 students on September 17, 1873. In 1878, the first class of six men graduated. The first woman graduated the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio State History and Traditions|url=https://news.osu.edu/history.html|publisher=The Ohio State University|accessdate=July 1, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216131558/http://news.osu.edu/history.html|archive-date=February 16, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1878, in light of its expanded focus, the Ohio legislature changed the name to "The Ohio State University", with "The" as part of its official name.&lt;ref name="arl.org"&gt;The government of Ohio, in its official web site listing the state's compiled laws: "3335.01 The Ohio State University. The educational institution originally designated as the Ohio agricultural and mechanical college shall be known as "The Ohio State University." http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3335&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohio State began accepting graduate students in the 1880s, and in 1891, the school saw the founding of its law school, Moritz College of Law. It would later acquire colleges of medicine, dentistry, optometry, veterinary medicine, commerce, and journalism in subsequent years. In 1916, Ohio State was elected into membership in the [[Association of American Universities]].

[[Michael V. Drake]], former chancellor of the [[University of California, Irvine]], became the 15th president of The Ohio State University on June 30, 2014.

==Campus==
[[File:OSU William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library East Atrium.JPG|thumb|The East Atrium at the William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library]]
Ohio State's {{convert|1,764|acre|adj=on}} main campus is about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} north of the city's downtown. The historical center of campus is the Oval, a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quad]] of about {{convert|11|acre|adj=off}}.&lt;ref name="faqs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://library.osu.edu/find/collections/the-ohio-state-university-archives/digitalcontent/faqs#7|title=FAQs|website=University Libraries|publisher=The Ohio State University|access-date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four buildings are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]: Hale Hall (originally Enarson Hall), [[University, Hayes and Orton Halls|Hayes Hall]], [[Ohio Stadium]], and [[University, Hayes and Orton Halls|Orton Hall]].
Unlike earlier public universities such as Ohio University and Miami University, whose campuses have a consistent architectural style, the Ohio State campus is a mix of traditional, modern and post-modern styles.
The [[William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library]], anchoring the Oval's western end, is Ohio State library's main branch and largest repository. The Thompson Library was designed in 1913 by the Boston firm of Allen and Collens in the Italianate Renaissance Revival style, and its placement on the Oval was suggested by the Olmsted brothers who had designed New York City's [[Central Park]]. In 2006, the Thompson Library began a $100 million renovation to maintain the building's classical Italian Renaissance architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2009/08/03/OSU_library.ART_ART_08-03-09_A1_5NEL3IU.html|title=OSU's main library reopens today after three-year, $109 million renovation|work=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohio State operates the North America's 18th-largest university [[research library]] with a combined collection of over 5.8 million volumes. Additionally, the libraries regularly receive about 35,000 serial titles. Its recent acquisitions were 16th among university research libraries in North America.&lt;ref name="arl.org"/&gt; Along with 21 libraries on its Columbus campus, the university has eight branches at off-campus research facilities and regional campuses, and a book storage depository near campus. In all, the Ohio State library system encompasses 55 branches and specialty collections. Some more significant collections include The [[Byrd Polar Research Center]] Archival Program, which has the archives of Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd]] and other polar research materials; The [[Hilandar Research Library]], which has the world's largest collection of [[medieval]] [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] manuscripts on microform; the [[Cartoon Research Library|Ohio State Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]], the world's largest repository of original cartoons; The Lawrence and Lee Theatre Research Institute; and the archives of Senator [[John Glenn]].

[[File:Wexner.jpg|thumb|left|text-top|upright=0.7|Detail of the Wexner Center]]Anchoring the traditional campus gateway at the eastern end of the Oval is the 1989 [[Wexner Center for the Arts]]. Designed by architects [[Peter Eisenman]] of New York and Richard Trott of Columbus, the center was funded in large part by Ohio State alumnus [[Leslie Wexner]]'s gift of $25 million in the 1980s. The center was founded to encompass all aspects of visual and performing arts with a focus on new commissions and artist residencies. Part of its design was to pay tribute to the armory that formerly had the same location. Its groundbreaking [[deconstructivism|deconstructivist]] architecture has resulted in it being lauded as one of the most important buildings of its generation. Its design has also been criticized as proving less than ideal for many of the art installations it has attempted to display. The centerpiece of The Wexner Center's permanent collection is [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Nude on a black armchair|Nude on a Black Armchair]]'', which was purchased by alumnus [[Leslie Wexner]] at auction for $45 million.

To the south of the Oval is another, somewhat smaller, expanse of green space commonly referred to as the South Oval. At its eastern end, it is anchored by the Ohio Union. To the west are Hale Hall, the Kuhn Honors House, Browning Amphitheatre (a traditional stone [[Greek theatre]]) and [[Mirror Lake (Ohio)|Mirror Lake]].

[[Knowlton Hall]], dedicated in October 2004, is at the corner of West Woodruff Avenue and Tuttle Park Place, next to [[Ohio Stadium]]. Knowlton Hall along with the [[Max M. Fisher College of Business|Fisher College of Business]] and Hitchcock Hall form an academic nucleus in the Northwestern corner of North campus. Knowlton Hall is home to the KSA Café, the disciplines of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, City and Regional Planning, and about 550 undergraduate and graduate students. Knowlton Hall stands out from the general reddish-brown brick of Ohio State's campus with distinctive white marble tiles that cover the building's exterior. This unique wall cladding was requested by Austin E. Knowlton, the namesake of and main patron to the creation of Knowlton Hall. Knowlton also requested 5 white marble columns be erected on the site, each column representing one of the classical orders of [[Architecture]].&lt;ref name="herrick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herrick.knowlton.ohio-state.edu/building/knowlton-hall-austin-e|title=Knowlton Hall, Austin E.|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928002321/http://herrick.knowlton.ohio-state.edu/building/knowlton-hall-austin-e|archivedate=September 28, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OSU College of Medicine and Public Health|Ohio State College of Medicine]] is on the southern edge of the central campus. It is home to the [[James Cancer Hospital]], a cancer research institute and one of the [[National Cancer Institute]]'s forty-one [[NCI-designated Cancer Center|comprehensive cancer centers]], along with [[the Richard M. Ross Heart Hospital]], a research institute for cardiovascular disease.

The Konwlton Hall, home of the Architecture School, was designed by Mac Scogin Merril Elam from Atlanta along with WSA Studio from Columbus, Ohio.

Ohio State is one of a select few American universities to offer multiple area studies programs under "Comprehensive National Resource Center" (often called "Title VI") funding from the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]]. The most notable of these is the Center for Slavic and East European Studies founded in 1965 by Professor Leon Twarog. Subsequently, Ohio State's Middle Eastern Studies Center and East Asian Studies Center also achieved Comprehensive National Resource Center status. The university is also home to the [[interdisciplinary]] [[Mershon Center for International Security Studies]], which was founded in 1952 through a bequest of 7 million dollars (54.3 million in 2006 value) from alumnus Colonel Ralph D. Mershon. In 2003, the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]] decided to base the National Academic Consortium for Homeland Security at The Mershon Center.

==== Big Ten Academic Alliance ====
Ohio State is a participant in the [[Big Ten Academic Alliance]]. The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) is the academic consortium of the universities in the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Engaging in $10 billion in research in 2014-2015, BTAA universities provide powerful insight into important issues in medicine, technology, agriculture, and communities. Students at participating schools are also allowed "in-house" borrowing privileges at other schools' libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/projects/library/reciprocal-borrowing/introduction |title=Reciprocal Library Borrowing |publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BTAA uses collective purchasing and licensing, and has saved member institutions $19 million to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/projects/purchasing-and-licensing |title=Purchasing and Licensing |publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Course sharing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/SharedCourses.aspx|title=Sharing Access to Courses|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[professional development]] programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/Leadership.aspx|title=Leadership Development|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[study abroad]] and international collaborations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/GlobalCollaborations.aspx|title=Global Collaborations|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other initiatives are also part of the BTAA.

===Endowment and fundraising===
Ohio State was among the first group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osu.edu/osu/newsrel/Archive/99-02-05_Trustees:_Endowment_Tops_$1_Billion.html |title=Ohio State endowment tops $1 Billion 2–5–99, Ohio State News |publisher=Osu.edu |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720024611/http://www.osu.edu/osu/newsrel/Archive/99-02-05_Trustees:_Endowment_Tops_$1_Billion.html |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; of four public universities to raise a $1 billion [[financial endowment|endowment]] when it passed the $1 billion mark in 1999. At year's end 2005, Ohio State's endowment stood at $1.73 billion, ranking it seventh among public universities and 27th among all American universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacubo.org/documents/research/FY05NESInstitutionsbyTotalAssets.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220074532/http://www.nacubo.org/documents/research/FY05NESInstitutionsbyTotalAssets.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-02-20 |title=National Merit and Achievement Scholars, 1995–2004 |date=2006 |publisher=National Association of College and University Business Officers }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006, the endowment passed the $2 billion mark.

In recent decades, and in response to continually shrinking state funding, Ohio State has conducted two significant multi-year [[fundraising]] campaigns. The first concluded in 1987 and raised $460 million—a record at the time for a public university. The "Affirm Thy Friendship Campaign" took place between 1995 and 2000. With an initial goal of raising $850 million, the campaign's final tally was $1.23 billion, placing Ohio State among the small group of public universities to have successfully conducted a $1 billion campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homepages.indiana.edu/022505/text/iuf.shtml |title=Top 15 Public University Endowments as of June 30, 2004 |publisher=Homepages.indiana.edu |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928181444/http://www.homepages.indiana.edu/022505/text/iuf.shtml |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At his welcoming ceremony, returning President E.

[[File:RPAC1.png|thumb|upright=1.7|right|Recreation and Physical Activity Center (RPAC)]]
The Office of Student Life is responsible for many of the outside-the-classroom aspects of student life at Ohio State. It has more than 30 departments. Among these are student housing; dining services; health, wellness and counseling offices; the [[Ohio Union]], student activities, organizations and leadership development; recreation and intramural sports. The Office of Student Life has partnership affiliations with the [[Jerome Schottenstein Center|Schottenstein Center]], the [[Blackwell Inn]], and the [[Drake Union|Drake Events Center]]. Services supporting student wellness include the Wilce Student Health Center, named for university physician [[John Wilce]], The Mary A. Daniels Student Wellness Center and the Counseling and Consultation Service and the Recreational and Physical Activity Center (RPAC).

The Office of Student Life also oversees the operation of the RPAC. The RPAC is the main recreational facility on campus and offers over half a million square feet of recreation, aquatic, fitness, and meeting space. The RPAC features two on-campus dining locations, a 50-meter competitive pool, 12 wood courts, 10 racquetball courts, 4 squash courts, a four-lane jogging/walking track, five multipurpose rooms, and 27,500 square feet of fitness space. is also inside of the RPAC.

The [[Ohio State University Marching Band|marching band]] is also a longstanding tradition at Ohio State. It is the largest all-brass and percussion band in the world. The traditional school songs from "[[Carmen Ohio]]" to "[[Hang on Sloopy]]" to "Fight the Team Across the Field", are arranged to fit this instrumentation. The band is famous for "[[Script Ohio]]", during which the band marches single-file through the curves of the word "Ohio", much like a pen writes the word, all while playing the French march "[[Le Régiment de Sambre et Meuse|Le Regiment de Sambre et Meuse]]." At the end of the performance, a high-stepping senior [[sousaphone]] player "dots" the "i" in Ohio.

"Across the Field", Ohio State's fight song, and "Buckeye Battle Cry" are commonly played and sung at athletic events, as well as [[Graduation|commencement]] and [[convocation]] exercises.

The tradition of high-quality bands is not limited to the football field. OSU's School of Music contains several high-quality concert bands made up of graduate and undergraduate music majors and non-music majors. The OSU Wind Symphony often receives praise on the national level and was selected to perform at the 2003 College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) Convention and at the Ohio Music Educators Association Conference in 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2008; the OSU Symphonic Band performed in 2007. The OSU Wind Symphony released its newest album, ''Southern Harmony'', on the [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] Label in 2009. The [[Ohio State Jazz Ensemble]] performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 1975, 1978, 1986, 1996, and 2001. It also appeared at the [[Mexico City International Jazz Festival]] in 1990 and the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]] in 1986, 1996, and 2001. There is also an OSU Symphony Orchestra.

In addition to strong bands, the university is recognized for outstanding choral performance. The [[Ohio State University Men's Glee Club]] was formed in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgc.osu.edu |title=OSU Men's Glee Club |publisher=Mgc.osu.edu |date= |access-date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, led by Professor James Gallagher, the Men's Glee Club participated in the International Musical [[Eisteddfod]] in Llangollen, [[Wales]], and won the male chorus competition by an unprecedented 20 points before, in a unanimous decision of the judges, being named "Choir of the World"—the first American [[choir]] to win such an honor. Robert J. Ward directs the Glee Club. The Ohio State Women's [[Glee Club]] was established in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wgc.osu.edu |title=OSU Women's Glee Club |publisher=wgc.osu.edu |date= |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the group's recent past, under the leadership of Dr. Hilary Apfelstadt, the Glee Club has been selected to sing for state and regional conferences of the Ohio Music Education Association and the American Choral Directors Association. Beginning its season under the direction of Dr. Richard Schnipke, the OSU Women's Glee Club was honored to sing for the Ohio Choral Directors Association annual conference in June 2010.

Ohio State's "[[Buckeye Bullet]]" electric car broke the world record for the fastest speed by an electric vehicle on October 3, 2004, with a speed of 271.737&amp;nbsp;mph (437.3&amp;nbsp;km/h) at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedace.info/bonneville_nationals_buckeye_bullet_timing.htm |title=Bonneville Nationals 2004 |accessdate=December 31, 2009 |publisher=Speedace }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle also holds the U.S. record for fastest electric vehicle with a speed of 314.958&amp;nbsp;mph (506.9&amp;nbsp;km/h), and peak timed mile speed of 321.834&amp;nbsp;mph (517.9&amp;nbsp;km/h). A team of engineering students from the university's "Center for Automotive Research-Intelligent Transportation" (CAR-IT) designed, built and managed the vehicle. In 2007, [[Buckeye Bullet|Buckeye Bullet 2]] was launched. This follow-up effort was a collaboration between Ohio State engineering students and engineers from the [[Ford Motor Company]] and will seek to break the land speed record for hydrogen cell powered vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.osu.edu/news/archive/2007/070711a.php|title=Buckeye Bullet 2|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this needs updated - did end up breaking land-speed records --&gt;

A unique aspect to Ohio State's multibillion-dollar endowment is the Student Investment Management Program. Upperclass finance students taking Business Finance 724 are given the opportunity to manage a twenty million dollar investment fund. Returns from the student-managed funds often outperform the [[S&amp;P 500]] and frequently even the university's own professional fund managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fisher.osu.edu/fin/sim.htm|title=Ohio State Student Investment Management Program|publisher=|access-date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, The Ohio State dissolved its Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit and eliminated four positions in the unit due to concerns about mismanagement and a lack of support for survivors of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2018/07/09/ohio-state-universitys-sexual-misconduct-unit-dissolved-wake-harrowing-claims-survivors/|title=You are being redirected...|website=msmagazine.com|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after the unit was suspended in February 2018 and following an external review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.osu.edu/ohio-state-dissolves-sexual-civility-and-empowerment-unit/|title=Ohio State dissolves Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit|work=Ohio State dissolves Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Columbus Dispatch'' and the school newspaper, ''The Lantern'' reported that "[SCE] failed to properly report students’ sexual-assault complaints" and that some victims were told that they were "'lying,' 'delusional,' 'suffering from mental illness,' 'have an active imagination,' that they 'didn’t understand their own experience' and also 'fabricated their story.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/news/20180619/ohio-state-closes-sexual-assault-center-fires-4-after-complaints|title=Ohio State closes sexual-assault center, fires 4 after complaints|last=Smola|first=Jennifer|work=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelantern.com/2018/06/ohio-state-shutting-down-sexual-civility-and-empowerment-unit/|title=Ohio State shuts down its Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit|work=The Lantern|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With help from the Philadelphia law firm Cozen O'Connor, the university will be creating a new framework to handle sexual assault cases and reevaluating its Title IX program.

On July 20, 2018, the ''Associated Press'' reported that over 100 students, including male athletes from 14 sports, had reported sexual misconduct against a deceased university team physician. The reports date back to 1978 and include claims that he groped and took nude photographs of his patients. The investigation is ongoing, and four former wrestlers have filed a lawsuit against Ohio State for ignoring complaints of "rampant sexual misconduct." U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Jim Jordan (American politician)|Jim Jordan]] has been named in the lawsuit and has since denied the former wrestlers' claims that he knew about the abuse while he was an assistant coach for eight years at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jim-jordan-ohio-state-700578/|title=Rep.

===Diversity===
Ohio State's main campus has been lauded for the racial diversity of its student body. In various surveys and rankings, it has been included among the best campuses in the nation for African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-95845140.html |title=Black Enterprise's 50 Best Colleges for African Americans |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |access-date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Ohio State ranked 10th in the nation in 2006 for the numbers of African American doctors graduated. ''The Advocate College Guide for LGBT Students'' lists Ohio State as one of the 20 best campuses in America for [[LGBT]] students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenbloom |first=Stephanie |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E0D71531F937A2575AC0A9609C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Is This Campus Gay-Friendly?|publisher=New York Times |date=September 14, 2006 |access-date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One campus feature that helps aid student diversity is the Multicultural Center.

Ohio State, despite selective admissions, has also maintained a high amount of socio-economic diversity{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} among its students. The 2007 freshman class contained 22.7% of first-generation college students, which far exceeded the national norm on American campuses of 15.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osu.edu/news/newsitem1801|title=Ohio State University Press|publisher=|access-date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University housing===
[[File:SCampusGateway.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|South Campus Gateway]]
Ohio State operates 38 on-campus residence halls divided into three geographic clusters: South Campus (site of the university's original dormitories) (currently include joint dorms known as Smith-Steeb and Park-Stradley), North Campus (largely constructed during the post-war enrollment boom) and West Campus or "The Towers". The residence hall system has 40 smaller living and learning environments defined by social or academic considerations. Ohio State also offers three honors residence halls: Bradley Hall, Lincoln Tower, and Taylor Tower.

Separate housing for graduate and professional students is maintained on the Southern tier of campus within the Gateway Residential Complex and the William H. Hall Student Residential Complex. Family housing is maintained at Buckeye Village at the far northern edge of campus beyond the athletic complex.

Student Life University Housing also administers student residential housing on the OSU Newark, OSU Mansfield, and OSU Agricultural Technical Institute (ATI) campuses.

The Residence Hall Advisory Council (RHAC), which is a representative body of all students living in the University's residence halls, helps evaluate and improve the living conditions of the residence halls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://involvedliving.osu.edu/rhac/about-us/ |title=About Us : Involved Living |publisher=Involvedliving.osu.edu |date= |accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honors programs===
Ohio State offers two distinct honors programs for high ability [[undergraduates]]: Honors and Scholars. The Honors program is open to students in all majors. The Scholars program is centered on thirteen specific programs such as "Architecture Scholars", "Media, Marketing, and Communications Scholars", "Biological Sciences Scholars", "International Affairs Scholars", "Business Scholars" and "Politics, Society and Law Scholars." Students in the Scholars program are expected to live and take select classes with other members of the program. Additionally, Ohio State offers the Honors Collegium with membership extended to ten incoming freshmen and following the Spring of a student's first or second year to the university's top undergraduates. Collegium students try to compete for internships, graduate schools and nationally competitive awards, such as the [[Marshall Scholarship|Marshall]], [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]], or [[Truman Scholarship|Truman]] Scholarships.

Ohio State also administers two large-scale [[scholarship|scholarship programs]] to ensure access to the university to high-ability students from [[low-income]] or traditionally underrepresented groups. The first, The Young Scholars Program, was initiated in 1988. 120 promising minority students from Ohio's nine largest urban public school districts are selected prior to entering high school. The program offers a series of academic camps each summer and counseling throughout the students' high school careers. Upon completion of the program, which also mandates a college preparatory curriculum and minimum grade point average, the students are guaranteed admission to Ohio State as well as any need-based financial aid. The Land Grant Scholarship was initiated in 2005. This program seeks to ensure access to Ohio State to high-ability students from low-income backgrounds. Ohio State has committed to offering a full-ride scholarship each academic year to at least one student from each of [[Ohio county government|Ohio's 88 counties]].

Ohio State maintains an honors center in the Kuhn Honors and Scholars House, which served as the University President's residence until the 1960s. Three residences are designated all or in part as honors residences: Taylor Tower, Bradley Hall, and Lincoln House.

===Activities and organizations===
[[File:EnarsonHall.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Hale Hall (Original Ohio Union)]]
The [[Ohio Union]] was the first student union built by an American public university. The Ohio Union is dedicated to the enrichment of the student experience, on and off the university campus. The first Ohio Union, on the south edge of the South Oval, was constructed in 1909 and was later renamed Enarson Hall. The second Ohio Union was completed in 1950 and was prominently along High Street, southeast of the Oval. It was a center of student life for more than 50 years, providing facilities for student activities, organizations and events and serving as an important meeting place for campus and community interaction. The union also housed many student services and programs, along with dining and recreational facilities. The second Ohio Union was demolished in February 2007 to make way for the new Ohio Union, which was finished in 2010. During this time, student activities were relocated to Ohio Stadium and other academic buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Ohio Union|url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/about_the_union/history|accessdate=December 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203081517/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/about_the_union/history|archive-date=December 3, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student organizations===
[[Student organizations]] at Ohio State provide students with opportunities to get involved in a wide variety of interest areas including [[academic]], [[Social issues|social]], [[religious]], [[artistic]], [[community service|service-based]], [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] and many more.
There are over 1,000 registered student organizations that involve many thousands of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://undergrad.osu.edu/explore/student-activities.html|title=The Ohio State University Undergraduate Admissions and First Year Experience|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816181742/http://undergrad.osu.edu/explore/student-activities.html|archivedate=August 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university's forensics team has won the state [[National Forensics Association]] tournament several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohio.edu/news/00-01/294.html|title=Forensics Team Wins State Champ.|website=www.ohio.edu|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Block O|Block "O"]] is currently the largest student-run organization on the campus of Ohio State. With over 2,400 annual members, Block "O" serves as the official [[student cheering section]] at athletic events for the University. According to the Student Organization Office in the Ohio Union, Agricultural Education Society is the oldest student organization on campus. The Men's Glee Club often disputes the claim, but after consultation with Ohio Union Staff, Agricultural Education Society was named as the university's oldest organization.

Each year, students may sign-up to participate in [http://buckeyethon.osu.edu/ BuckeyeThon], Ohio State's student-led philanthropy. The organization hosts events throughout the year to support the hematology/oncology/bone marrow transplant unit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buckeyethon.osu.edu/aboutus/our_beneficiary|title=BuckeyeThon at The Ohio State University|website=buckeyethon.osu.edu|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Nationwide Children's Hospital]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Although BuckeyeThon is operated entirely by student volunteers, it is embedded within Student Life and the Ohio State University Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/posts/studentorgs/constitutions/2015_4_14_15_46_834.docx|title=Word document of BuckeyeThon Constitution and Bylaws (March 2015)|last=|first=|date=|website=ohiounion.osu.edu|publisher=The Ohio State University Office of Student Life|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927044941/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/posts/studentorgs/constitutions/2015_4_14_15_46_834.docx|archive-date=September 27, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization receives support, advising, and specialized leadership training from the University. Each February, thousands of students and community members attend BuckeyeThon's signature event, a [[Dance marathon|Dance Marathon]] consisting of two separate 12-hour shifts. In the past 15 years, students have raised over $5 million to support treatment, research, and various therapies at the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buckeyethon.osu.edu/events/dance_marathon|title=BuckeyeThon at The Ohio State University|website=buckeyethon.osu.edu|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique to BuckeyeThon is the use of an operational fund separate from the main philanthropic cancer fund. As a registered non-profit, BuckeyeThon is subject to University audit and issues gift receipts through the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.giveto.osu.edu/makeagift/?fund=315502|title=Make your gift|website=www.giveto.osu.edu|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An annual operational fund relies on University grants, outside sponsors, and event registration fees. This allows the entirety of donations made to the cancer fund to solely support patients without hindrance from outside costs.

Ohio State has several student-managed publications and media outlets. ''The Makio'' is the official yearbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/makio/ |title=Makio – Ohio Union |publisher=Ohiounion.osu.edu |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218162454/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/makio/ |archivedate=February 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Makio's'' sales plummeted by 60% during the early 1970s; the organization went bankrupt and stopped publication during the late 1970s. The book was revived from 1985 to 1994 and revived again in 2000 thanks to several student organizations. ''[[The Lantern]]'' is the school's daily newspaper and has operated as a laboratory newspaper in the School of Communication (formerly the School of Journalism) since 1881. ''Mosaic'' is a literary magazine published by Ohio State, which features undergraduate [[fiction]], [[poetry]], and [[art]]. ''The Sundial'' is a student-written and published humor magazine. Founded in 1911 it is one of the oldest humor magazines in the country. After a 17-year hiatus in which no magazine was published it has recently been revived, first in print form, and now in an online humor blog, as well as multiple social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2011/01/23/humor-mag-rises-again-at-ohio-state.html |title=Humor Magazine Lives Again |accessdate=May 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sundial.osu.edu/wordpress/ |title=Homepage of The Sundial |accessdate=May 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530175636/http://sundial.osu.edu/wordpress/ |archive-date=May 30, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio State has two improvisational comedy groups, ''The 8th Floor Improv'' and ''Fishbowl Improv'', who regularly perform long and short-form improv around campus and across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.8thfloorimprov.com |title=The 8th Floor Improv |publisher=The 8th Floor Improv |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/FishbowlImprov|title=8th Floor Improv's Facebook Page|work=Facebook|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two student-run radio stations on campus. [[AROUSE]], the music station, is home to over 100 student DJs, streaming music and independent content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arouseosu.com/about.html|title=About: The Amateur Radio Organization for Student Entertainment|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarlet and Gray Sports Radio broadcasts eleven different Ohio State sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiostatesports.net/ |title=Scarlet and Gray Sports Radio |publisher=Ohiostatesports.net |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both stations broadcast on an Internet audio stream (no broadcast signals are available in Columbus). Students also operate a local [[cable TV]] channel known as Buckeye TV, which airs primarily on the campus closed cable system operated by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).

===Leadership and service===
The Union's vision is to prepare students to be responsible, engaged leaders committed to community participation for social action and change. Programs with which students can get involved include are the Leadership Collaborative, Leadership Ohio State, Residence Halls Advisory Council, LeaderShape, Buckeye Service Council, Community Commitment Day, SERV team, Service Squad, ImpactOSU, and BUCK I SERV alternative break trips. Additionally, the Service-Learning Institute offers courses that educate students while also helping the greater community. All of these programs have the ultimate goal of making students better leaders, people, and citizens of Ohio.&lt;ref name=keithkeycenter&gt;{{cite web|title=The Keith B.

In 1914, with the approval of President William Oxley Thompson and under the watchful eye of Dean Caroline Breyfogle, Ph.D., [[Mortar Board]] Senior Honor Society was established by seven senior women. Four years later, the members of the group then became one of the four founding chapters of Mortar Board National College Senior Honor Society, which now has charters at 231 campuses in the U.S. For more than 100 years at Ohio State, members of Mortar Board have been selected for their significant contributions in scholarship, leadership and service.

===Student government===
At The Ohio State University, three recognized student governments represent their constituents.&lt;ref name=govt&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Governments|url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/get_involved/student_governments|accessdate=December 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208063009/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/get_involved/student_governments|archive-date=December 8, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Undergraduate Student Government (USG), which consists of elected and appointed student [[Representation (politics)|representatives]] who serve as liaisons from the [[undergraduate]] student body to university officials. USG seeks to outreach to and work for the students at Ohio State.
* Council of Graduate Students (CGS), which promotes and provides [[academic]], [[Academic administration|administrative]], and social programs for the university community in general and for [[graduate students]] in particular. The Council provides a forum in which the graduate student body may present, discuss, and set upon issues related to its role in the academic and non-academic aspects of the University community.
* Inter-Professional Council (IPC), which is a representative body of all professional students in the colleges of [[Dentistry]], [[Law]], [[Medicine]], [[Optometry]], [[Pharmacy]], and [[Veterinary Medicine]]. Its purpose is to act as a liaison between these students and the governing bodies of the University.

[[File:Thomas Benjamin Kennington - Orphans.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''Orphans'' by [[Thomas Benjamin Kennington|Thomas Kennington]], [[oil on canvas]], 1885]]

An '''orphan''' (from the {{lang-el|ορφανός|orphanós}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29rfano%2Fs ὀρφανός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; is someone who has lost either or both parents, whose parents are unknown, or have permanently abandoned them.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/orphan Merriam-Webster online dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary, 6th edition "a child bereaved of parents" with bereaved meaning (of death etc) deprived of a relation&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to animals, only the mother's condition is usually relevant (i.e. if the female parent has gone, the offspring is an orphan, regardless of the father's condition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/orphan?s=t |title=orphan |work=Dictionary.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Various groups use different definitions to identify orphans. One legal definition used in the [[United States]] is a [[minor (law)|minor]] bereft through "death or disappearance of, abandonment or desertion by, or separation or loss from, both parents".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/tools/glossary/orphan USCIS definition for immigration purposes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the common use, an orphan does not have any surviving parent to care for them. However, the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS]] (UNAIDS), and other groups label any child that has lost one parent as an orphan. In this approach, a ''maternal orphan'' is a child whose mother has died, a ''paternal orphan'' is a child whose father has died, and a ''double orphan'' is a child who has lost both parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2008/jc1510_2008_global_report_pp11_28_en.pdf UNAIDS Global Report 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with the older use of ''half-orphan'' to describe children that had lost only one parent.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/orphans/society-half-orphan-asylum.shtml this 19th-century news story] about The Society for the Relief of Half-Orphan and Destitute Children, or [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B00E1D9163AE033A25755C1A9649D94669FD7CF this one] about the Protestant Half-Orphan Asylum.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Populations ==
[[Image:Girl in a Kabul orphanage, 01-07-2002.jpg|thumb|upright|An Afghan girl at a [[Kabul|Kabul, Afghanistan]] orphanage in January 2002]]
Orphans are relatively rare in developed countries, because most children can expect both of their parents to survive their childhood. Much higher numbers of orphans exist in war-torn nations such as Afghanistan.

==Notable orphans==
{{main article|List of orphans and foundlings}}
[[List of orphans and foundlings|Famous orphans]] include world leaders such as [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Aaron Burr]], [[Andrew Jackson]]; the Hebrew prophet [[Moses]] and the Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]]; writers such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Leo Tolstoy]]; athletes such as [[Aaron Hernandez]] or [[Jacques Villeneuve]]. The American orphan [[Henry Darger]] portrayed the horrible conditions of his orphanage in his art work. Other notable orphans include entertainment greats such as [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Babe Ruth]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[Frances McDormand]], and innumerable fictional characters in literature and comics.

==History==
Wars and great epidemics, such as AIDS, have created many orphans. The [[Second World War]], with its massive numbers of deaths and population movements, created large numbers of orphans in many countries—with estimates for Europe ranging from 1,000,000 to 13,000,000. Judt (2006) estimates there were 9,000 orphaned children in Czechoslovakia, 60,000 in the Netherlands 300,000 in Poland and 200,000 in Yugoslavia, plus many more in the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;For a high estimate see I.C.B. Dear and M.R.D. Foot, eds. ''The Oxford companion to World War II'' (1995) p 208; for lower Tony Judt, ''Postwar: a history of Europe since 1945'' (2006) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
[[File:Ring36.jpg|right|thumb|Mime offers food to the young Siegfried, an orphan he is raising; Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'']]
Orphaned characters are extremely common as literary protagonists, especially in [[children's literature|children's]] and [[fantasy literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p 16, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of parents leaves the characters to pursue more interesting and adventurous lives, by freeing them from familial obligations and controls, and depriving them of more prosaic lives.  It creates characters that are self-contained and introspective and who strive for affection. Orphans can metaphorically search for self-understanding through attempting to know their roots.  Parents can also be allies and sources of aid for children, and removing the parents makes the character's difficulties more severe.  Parents, furthermore, can be irrelevant to the theme a writer is trying to develop, and orphaning the character frees the writer from the necessity to depict such an irrelevant relationship; if one parent-child relationship is important, removing the other parent prevents complicating the necessary relationship.  All these characteristics make orphans attractive characters for authors.

Orphans are common in fairy tales, such as most variants of ''[[Cinderella]]''.

A number of well-known authors have written books featuring orphans. Examples from classic literature include [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Tom Sawyer]]'', [[L. M. Montgomery]]'s ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', Thomas Hardy's ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'', and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s  ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Among more recent authors, [[A. J. Cronin]], [[Lemony Snicket]], [[Angelo F. Coniglio|A. F. Coniglio]], [[Roald Dahl]] and [[J. K. Rowling]], as well as some less well-known authors of famous orphans like [[Little Orphan Annie]] have used orphans as major characters. One recurring storyline has been the relationship that the orphan can have with an adult from outside their immediate family as seen in Lyle Kessler's play ''[[Orphans (Lyle Kessler play)|Orphans]]''.

Orphans are especially common as characters in comic books. Almost all the most popular heroes are orphans: Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Robin, The Flash, Captain Marvel, Captain America, and Green Arrow were all orphaned. Orphans are also very common among villains: Bane, Catwoman, and Magneto are examples. Lex Luthor, Deadpool, and Carnage can also be included on this list, though they killed one or both of their parents. Supporting characters befriended by the heroes are also often orphans, including the [[Newsboy Legion]] and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]].

==Cartoons==

All of the orphan children from the 1936 ''[[Color Classics|Color Classic]]'', ''[[Christmas Comes But Once a Year]]'' produced by [[Fleischer Studios]], were voiced by [[Mae Questel]].

==In religious texts==
Many religious texts, including the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]], contain the idea that helping and defending orphans is a very important and God-pleasing matter. The religious leaders [[Moses]] and [[Muhammad]] were orphaned as children. Several scriptural citations describe how orphans should be treated:

'''Bible'''

* "Do not take advantage of a widow or an orphan." ([[Hebrew Bible]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:22)
* "Leave your orphans; I will protect their lives. Your widows too can trust in me." (Hebrew Bible, [[Jeremiah]] 49:11)
* "To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress." (Hebrew Bible, [[Psalms]] 10:18)
* "Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world." ([[New Testament]], James 1:27)

'''Qu'ran'''

* "And they feed, for the love of God, the indigent, the orphan, and the captive," - ([[The Quran]], The Human: 8)
* "Therefore, treat not the orphan with harshness," (The Quran, The Morning Hours: 9)
* "Have you not seen those who deny the faith and the Day of Judgment? Those are people who drive orphans away harshly, and do not encourage feeding the indigent. So woe be upon those who do prayer but are neglectful of it or show it off out of vanity, and those who deny even small kindnesses to others." - (The Quran, Small Kindnesses: 1-7)
* "(Be good to) orphans and the very poor. And speak good words to people." (The Quran, The Heifer: 83) 
* "…They will ask you about the property of orphans. Say, 'Managing it in their best interests is best'. If you mix your property with theirs, they are your brothers…" (The Quran, The Heifer: 220)
* "Give orphans their property, and do not substitute bad things for good. Do not assimilate their property into your own. Doing that is a serious crime." (The Quran, The Women: 2)
* "Keep a close check on orphans until they reach a marriageable age, then if you perceive that they have sound judgement hand over their property to them..." (The Quran, The Women: 6)

[[File:LysonsWoodchesterOrpheus-1-.jpg|thumb|The [[Woodchester]] Orpheus mosaic, drawn as found in 1797]]
'''Orpheus mosaics''' are found throughout the [[Roman Empire]], normally in large [[Roman villa]]s. [[Orpheus]] was a popular subject in classical art, and was also used in [[Early Christian art]] as a symbol for [[Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Hachilli, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard depiction in [[Roman mosaic]] scenes (for the Romano-British variant see below) shows him seated and playing a [[lyre]] or [[cithara]], wearing a [[Phyrgian cap]], often beside a tree, and includes many animals drawn and pacified by his playing. The fox was considered Orpheus's special animal and may be placed beside him. In large examples the animals spread to occupy the whole floor of a room.  Titles such as ''Orpheus Charming/Taming the Beasts'' may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Hachilli, 72-74; Henig, 153&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually the whole scene occupies the same space, but sometimes Orpheus and the animals are each in compartments separated by borders with geometrical decoration.

An example of the usual composition with animals in the 6th-century [[Gaza synagogue]] is identified as [[David]] by an inscription in Hebrew, and has added royal attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Hachilli, 72-74&lt;/ref&gt;  Another adaptation is a Christian mosaic of [[Adam]] giving names to the animals ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2: 19-20) in a church of around 486-502 in [[Apamea, Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Hachilli, 74&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the mosaics seem to relate to the rather elusive philosophical or religious doctrines of [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]].&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 152, but see Drijvers, H. J. W., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=69YUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA191 ''Cults and Beliefs at Edessa''], p. 191, 1980, Brill Archive, {{ISBN|9004060502}}, 9789004060500&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Byzantine mosaic]] large scenes with animals tended to be hunting scenes (one of the largest being again at Apamea).  These are, at least initially, drawn from the popular [[venatio]] ("hunting") displays in the [[Roman amphitheatre|amphitheatre]]s, where a variety of exotic beasts were released to fight and be killed.&lt;ref&gt;Kondoleon, 271-314&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the contrast in atmosphere, the Berlin mosaic from a house in [[Miletus]] manages to combine both a ''venatio'' and an Orpheus with animals in its two parts.&lt;ref&gt;Kondoleon, 282&lt;/ref&gt;  A staged scene in the arena recorded by [[Martial]] combined an acted [[Orpheus]] with the punishment of criminals by ''[[damnatio ad bestias]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kondoleon, 310-311&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romano-British composition==
In what appears to be a unique feature of Orpheus mosaics from [[Roman Britain]], the animals may be arranged parading in a circle around him, feet facing out, so that some are the right way up whatever angle the floor is seen from; nine examples are known.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbabin, 92-94; [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-23529098 "Roman Orpheus mosaic to be displayed at Bristol museum"], BBC, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject is found, for example, in [[Woodchester]] in England, the second largest of its kind in Europe and one of the most intricate. It dates to c. AD 325 and was re-discovered by Gloucestershire-born [[antiquarian]] [[Samuel Lysons]] in 1793. It has been uncovered seven times since 1880,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wUuIAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT147 dates]&lt;/ref&gt; the last time in 1973, but there are no plans to reveal it again.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbabin, 92-94; Henig, 152-154; G. Thomas, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Other English examples are at [[Littlecote Roman Villa]],&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 154, and 152-154 generally on British mosaics&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brading Roman Villa]],&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 153&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Corinium Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://coriniummuseum.org/object/2015-71-2/ Corinium Museum page]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another, from [[Newton St Loe]], is now in [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]], but between 1841 and 1851 had been moved to [[Keynsham railway station]], and set in a floor there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-23529098 "Roman Orpheus mosaic to be displayed at Bristol museum"], BBC, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The Corinium (that is, modern [[Cirencester]]) example gives its name to the "Corinium Orpheus School" of Romano-British mosaic artists.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbabin, 92-94&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two other circular Orpheus mosaics, in [[Volubilis]] in present-day [[Morocco]], and [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]] in Spain, but the compositions are different.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbabin, 92, note&lt;/ref&gt;

The Littlecote mosaic in particular, which seems to have been added to a room used as some kind of private space for religious cult, has been suggested as evidencing a syncretic cult of Orpheus, Apollo and Bacchus.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A large example takes up all the floor of a room in the [[Villa Romana del Casale]], [[Piazza Armerina]], Sicily, one of the finest sites for mosaics.  Other notable examples are in [[Leptis Magna]] in [[Libya]] (''in situ''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/articles/place/lepcis-magna/photos/lepcis-magna-villa-of-the-orpheus-mosaic/ "Lepcis Magna, Villa of the Orpheus Mosaic"]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Palermo]], [[Arles]], the Musée gallo-romain in [[Saint-Romain-en-Gal]] [[Vienne]], [[Perugia]] and the [[Bardo National Museum (Tunis)]].  A new Orpheus mosaic has recently been found found in [[Prusias ad Hypium]], near present-day [[Duzce]] in Turkey.

[[File:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Exterior of a [[sex shop]] in [[New York City]] that also provides a peep show]]

A '''peep show''' or '''peepshow''' is an exhibition of pictures, objects or people viewed through a small hole or [[magnifying glass]]. Though historically a peep show was a form of entertainment provided by wandering showmen, nowadays it more commonly refers to a presentation of a [[sex show]] or [[pornographic film]] which is viewed through a viewing slot. Historically the peep hole was intended to control the point of view to allow an illusion of [[depth perception]], while showmen would later use it to charge for access to the view. For sex shows it also became a means to view material that would be objected to if freely displayed.

==History==
[[File:Adolph Glasbrenner Guckkästner.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A boy looks into a peep show device (illustration by [[Theodor Hosemann]], 1835)]]
Peep shows,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weynants, [http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html "From the Rarekiek, 17th. &amp; 18th. Century optical entertainment, to the birth of Television"]
&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''peep box''' or '''raree show''' ("rarity show") can be traced back to the [[early modern period]] (15th century in Europe) and are known in various cultures. 
Around 1437 Italian humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer [[Leon Battista Alberti]] is thought to have created the earliest impressive peep show boxes with painted pictures to be viewed through a small hole. He had two kinds: night scenes with the moon and stars, and day scenes. It is thought these pictures may have been transparent and lit from behind, possibly changing from day to night by changing the lighting. It has also been suggested that it may have been a predecessor of the [[magic lantern]] that could project images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/c/camera_obscura.html|title=Camera Obscura - Encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/peep-show-childrens-toy|title=Peep show - children’s toy|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 17th and 18th century peep shows were exhibited on streets and fairs across Europe by itinerant showmen, competing with other entertainment like dancing bears, jugglers, conjurers, et cetera.&lt;ref name=balzer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickbalzer.com/Peepshows.202.0.html|title=Dick Balzer's Website: Peepshows|first=Richard|last=Balzer|date=|website=www.dickbalzer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their wooden cabinets could have several viewing holes and contain sets of pictures to be set into a viewing position by pulling a corresponding string. The show was accompanied by spoken [[recitation]] that explained or dramatized what was happening inside. The boxes were often decorated inside to resemble theatrical scenes.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} 

Peep shows were most popular in the 17th century in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100313907|title=Peep-show box - Oxford Reference|author=|date=|website=oxfordreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists from the 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], like [[Pieter Janssens Elinga]] and [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] created a type of peep shows with an illusion of depth perception by manipulating the perspective of the view seen inside, usually the interior of a room.
From around 1700 many of these "perspective boxes" or "optica" had a bi-convex lens with a large diameter and small dioptre for an exaggerated perspective, giving a stronger illusion of depth. Most pictures showed architectural and topographical subjects with linear perspectives.&lt;ref name=visualmedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Peepshow|url=http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html|website=visual-media.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dutch Perspectives|last1=Wagenaar|last2=Duller|last3=Wagenaar-Fischer}}&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1745 similar perspective view prints became very popular for the [[zograscope]], which used the same principle with the lens on a stand rather than in a box.   
Peep shows were further developed with translucent painting techniques, perforations and cut-out shapes that provided special effects when lit from behind by candles. Changing the light from the front to the back of the picture could change the scene from day to night, much like the [[dissolving views]] that would later become a popular type of magic lantern show.&lt;ref name=visualmedia/&gt;

In the early 18th century the perspective boxes were very appreciated in Japan, where they were referred to as ''Holland machines''.&lt;ref name=balzer/&gt; They may have been imported from China earlier than from The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TowardAStudentBasedApproachToTranslationTeaching/toward+a+student-based+approach+to+translation+teaching_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Toward A Student Based Approach To Translation Teaching"|author=|date=|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century Chinese peep shows were known by many names including ''la yang p'ien'' ({{zh|c=拉洋片|p=lā yáng piān|l=pulling foreign picture cards}}). Sometimes the showman would perform for a crowd with [[puppet]]s or [[cantastoria|pictures]] outside the box and then charge people extra to look through the holes.
In [[Ottoman Syria]] a form of peep show called ''sanduk al-ajayib'' ("wonder box") existed, which the storyteller carried on his back. The box had six holes through which people could see scenes backlit by a central candle. ''Sanduk al-ajayib'' stories were about contemporary figures and events, or showed scenes of heaven and hell.&lt;ref&gt;* Mair, Victor H. ''Painting and Performance: Chinese Picture Recitation and its Indian Genesis.'' Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other common subjects in peep shows throughout the world have been exotic views and animals, scenes of classical drama or [[masque]]s, [[Noble court|court]] ceremonies, surprise transformations (e.g., of an angel into a devil) and of course, lewd pictures.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
[[File:DonaldsonvillePeepShow1938.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A man peers into the viewer of a peepshow at a State Fair in 1938]]

Raree shows were precursors of [[toy theatre]]s, with movable scenes and paper figurines, popular in the 19th century. They can also be seen as predecessors to [[optical toys]] like [[Chinese fireworks]], the [[diorama]], the [[stereoscope]] and the [[magic lantern]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Some peep shows offer the only accurate representation of the stage design and scenery of the [[masque]]s and pageants of their time.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

==Pornographic shows==
Peep shows have been used for erotic and pornographic pictures, such as ''[[What the Butler Saw (mutoscope)|What the Butler Saw]]'', since before the turn of the twentieth century. 

In contemporary use, a peep show is a piecewise presentation of [[pornographic film]]s or a live [[sex show]] which is viewed through a viewing slot, which shuts after the time paid for has expired. The viewing slots can be operated by a money box device, or paid for at a counter. 
[[File:Peep show Iran.JPG|thumbnail|Peep show in [[Golestan Palace]], [[Tehran]]]]
For live peep shows, booths can surround a stage upon which usually a female performer performs a [[striptease]] and sexually explicit poses. In [[Barcelona]] female performers at times also perform sexual intercourse with male performers on stage. In some cases, booths include [[paper towel dispenser]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Jon Griffin Donlon, "Peep Shows," ''St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture''. According to Dr. Elliot Chiu, "At first, small booths with a seat, a lock, and a roll of paper towels were made available for individual viewing of 8 or 16 mm stag loops or for access to a usually circular 'stage' with living performers."&lt;/ref&gt; for customers who engage in masturbation. A customer and performer can mutually agree on a fee for a "private dance", which can take place in a peep show booth with a clear window and seating space for only one spectator.

Research on peep show establishments in California&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Linz, Bryant Paul, and Mike Z. Yao, "Peep show establishments, police activity, public place, and time: A study of secondary effects in San Diego, California", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; examined the hypothesis that neighborhoods surrounding [[sex business]]es such as peep show establishments and [[X-rated]] movie stores have higher rates of crime. The researchers compared 911 calls in peep show and control neighborhoods in San Diego.  Although peep show neighborhoods had approximately 16 percent more calls, the researchers concluded that the difference was not statistically significant.  Other researchers reanalyzed the data and concluded that the difference was significant.&lt;ref&gt;Richard McCleary and James W. Meeker, "Do peep shows 'cause' crime?", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regal Show World====
Regal Show World was an [[adult entertainment]] business on lower [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company's [[slogan]] was "Where you are king".&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; The business had a peep show and an [[adult video arcade]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson 2012 p. 159"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alta-glamour.com"/&gt; The peep show had performers working in an enclosed round room with viewing booths surrounding it and sometimes had a "double in the bubble" show in which two performers worked simultaneously.&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; During the winter of 1997 to 1998, the business had thirty-five performers.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At this time, over 80% of performers there attempted to [[unionize]] and "signed union authorization cards for representation by the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU), Local 790".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;

The business was owned by Bijou Group, Inc., a [[privately held company]] in San Francisco that was founded in 1990.&lt;ref name="Manta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Find"/&gt; Bijou Group owned similar businesses in San Francisco such as New Century Theater, [[Market Street Cinema]], and the Campus Theater.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; Bijou Group, Inc. filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] reorganization circa 1994.&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; In November 1998, management of Regal Show World announced that the peep show would be closed on November 30th of that month due to "economic reasons".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At the time, some performers in the industry stated that closure of the peep show was done as a retaliative measure against attempts for performers to unionize.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company declared bankruptcy after performers made a second attempt at unionization, whereby the performers "signed cards calling for a union election", and the theater was closed.&lt;ref name="TPOS"/&gt;

===Washington===
The former [[Lusty Lady]] peep show in San Francisco, California, entered the news in 1997, when it became the first U.S. sex business to be [[unionized]]. In 2003 it was bought by the employees and became a [[worker cooperative]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[File:Repair Cafe by Ilvy Njiokiktjien.jpg|thumb|280px|Repair café Amsterdam-West]]
A '''repair café''' is a meeting in which people repair household electrical and mechanical devices, computers, bicycles, clothing, etc. They are organised by and for local residents. Repair cafés are held at a fixed location where tools are available and where they can fix their broken goods with the help of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wackman|first1=John|title='Repair Café' Gets Stuff Fixed|url=http://www.rethinklocal.org/blog/2013/07/repair-cafe-gets-stuff-fixed/|website=Rethink Local website|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its objectives are to reduce waste, to maintain repair skills and to strengthen [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-85913052.html Global Village: Warum eine neue Bewegung aus den Niederlanden Toaster und Bügeleisen repariert ]" [[Der Spiegel]], 26 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www1.wdr.de/themen/ratgeber/repaircafe114.html Mehr reparieren, weniger konsumieren] [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]], 29 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sz-WohLQyQ Repair Cafe nu ook doorgedrongen in Duitsland]" [[heute]], 26 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aljazeera.com/video/europe/2012/07/201271654749156813.html Dutch group mends broken items for free]" [[Al Jazeera]], 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nieuws.vtm.be/binnenland/2013010832354-repareren-weer Repareren is weer in]" [[VTM (TV channel)|VTM]], 1 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.brusselnieuws.be/artikel/repair-cafe-verhuist-naar-elzenhof-opent-cafe-molenbeek Repair Café naar Elzenhof]" Brusselnieuws, 3 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept was devised by Martine Postma in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Sally McGrane, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/world/europe/amsterdam-tries-to-change-culture-with-repair-cafes.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; An Effort to Bury a Throwaway Culture One Repair at a Time]" [[The New York Times]], 8 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October 2009, the first Repair Café was held at Fijnhout Theater, [[Amsterdam-West]]. On 2 March 2010, the Repair Café Foundation was set up. The foundation was formed to support local groups around the world in setting up their own Repair Cafés.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/17/how-to-set-up-your-own-repair-cafe | date = 17 September 2014 | accessdate = 14 November 2016 | first1 = Katherine | last1 = Purvis | first2 = Nell | last2 = Card | first3 = Lucy | last3 = Palmer | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | title = How to set up your own repair café}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the number of Repair Cafés has grown quickly. In March 2016 Postma registered more than 1,000 Repair Cafés worldwide, 327 in the Netherlands, 309 in Germany, 22 in the UK, 21 in the US, 15 in Canada, four Australia and one in India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160319022011/http://repaircafe.org/bezoeken Visit a Repair Café], repaircafe.org captured archive.org on 19 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017 the number of Repair Cafés climbed over 1,200, in March 2018 the number reached 1,500 in 33 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170130020242/https://repaircafe.org/en/visit/ Visit a Repair Café], repaircafe.org captured archive.org on 30 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the first [[International Repair Day]] was announced. It is intended to be an annual event, taking place on the third Saturday of October each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voicemag.uk/blog/3325/dialogues-and-debates-ugo-vallauri|title=Dialogues and Debates: Ugo Vallauri|work=Voice Magazine|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data collection==
In 2017, the Repair Café Foundation developed an online tool - the [http://RepairMonitor.org RepairMonitor] - enabling volunteers to collect and share repair data via a central database. In March 2018, information about almost 4,000 repairs had been entered into this system, aiming to promote reparability and durability of products.   

==3D printing of broken parts==
Some repair cafés have begun to use 3D printers for replicating broken parts.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hbvl.be/cnt/aid1565685/repair-cafe-maakt-onvindbare-wisselstukken-met-3d-printer Repair café maakt onvindbare wisselstukken met 3D-printer]" [[Het Belang van Limburg]]&lt;/ref&gt; Broken pieces of domestic appliances may be able to be pieced or glued back together, after which they can be scanned with a [[3D scanner#Hand-held laser scanners|3D scanner]]. Examples of 3D scanners include David Starter-Kit, [[3D Systems]] Sense, [[MakerBot]] Digitizer, Fuel 3D, Microsoft [[Kinect]], and [[Asus]] Xtion.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Microsoft Kinect and Asus Xtion can be used together with ReconstructMe software for 3D scanning&lt;/ref&gt; Once the physical object is scanned, the 3D model is rendered. It can be converted to a .stl or .obj format and revised using [[geometry processing]] software such as makeprintable, netfabb, [[MeshLab]], Meshmixer, [[Ultimaker|Cura]], or [[Slic3r]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Cura and Slic3r have some fixup tools, despite being mainly a slicer program&lt;/ref&gt; It is printed using a [[3D printer client]], creating a physical part using the 3D printer. The complete process takes some time to complete.

To reduce the time needed in the repair café, people might choose to use a pre-made part from a website with 3D models (skipping the scanning step),&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Examples of such websites are [[Thingiverse]], [[CGTrader]], [[GrabCAD]], and Google [[3D Warehouse]]&lt;/ref&gt; or make the 3D model themselves by taking many photographs of the part and using something like [[Autodesk 123D|123D Catch]], and/or choose (in the event the repair café does not have its own 3D printer) to have the 3D ''model'' made in the repair café, but printed using a 3D printer elsewhere. Alternatively a 3D printing service like [[Ponoko]], [[Shapeways]], and others can be used, and a person then return to the repair café to have the new part fitted to the broken equipment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17206">{{short description|Using wastes as an input material to create valuable products as new outputs}}
'''Resource recovery''' is using [[waste]]s as an input material to create valuable products as new outputs. The aim is to reduce the amount of waste generated, therefore reducing the need for [[landfill]] space and also extracting maximum value from waste. Resource recovery delays the need to use [[raw material]]s in the manufacturing process. Materials found in [[municipal solid waste]] can be used to make new products. [[Plastic]], [[paper]], [[aluminium]], [[glass]] and [[metal]] are examples of where value can be found in waste.

Resource recovery goes further than just the [[Waste management|management of waste]]. [[life cycle analysis|Life-cycle analysis]] (LCA) can be used to compare the resource recovery potential of different treatment technologies. Improvements to administration, [[Source separation (recycling)|source separation]] and collection, [[reuse]] and [[recycling]] are important. For example, organic materials can be treated with [[anaerobic digestion]] and turned into energy, [[compost]] or [[fertilizer]].

Resource recovery can also be an aim in the context of [[sanitation]]. Here, the term refers to approaches to recover the resources that are contained in [[wastewater]] and [[human excreta]] (urine and feces). The term "toilet resources" has come into use recently.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toiletboard.org/sanitation-economy|title="The Sanitation Economy"|last=|first=|date=26 March 2018|website=Toilet Board Coalition|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those resources include: nutrients ([[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]), organic matter, energy and water. This concept is also referred to as [[ecological sanitation]]. Separation of waste flows can help make resource recovery simpler. Examples include keeping urine separate from feces (as in [[urine diversion]] toilets) and keeping [[greywater]] and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] separate in municipal wastewater systems.

== Materials used as a source ==

===Solid waste===
{{main|Recycling}}
[[Image:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|right|Steel crushed and baled for [[recycling]]]]
Recycling is a resource recovery practice that refers to the collection and reuse of disposed materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, or sorted directly from mixed waste streams.

The most common consumer products recycled include [[aluminium]] such as beverage cans, [[copper]] such as wire, [[steel]] food and aerosol cans, old steel furnishings or equipment, [[HDPE|polyethylene]] and [[Recycling of PET Bottles|PET]] bottles, [[glass]] bottles and jars, [[paperboard]] [[cartons]], [[newspapers]], magazines and light paper, and [[corrugated fiberboard]] boxes.

[[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[LDPE]], [[Polypropylene|PP]], and [[Polystyrene|PS]] (see [[resin identification code]]) are also recyclable. These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.

The type of recycling material accepted varies by city and country. Each city and country have different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.

===Wastewater and excreta===
{{main|Reuse of excreta|Wastewater reuse|Ecological sanitation}}
Valuable resources can be recovered from [[wastewater]], [[sewage sludge]], [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] and [[Human waste|human excreta]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/publications/other-publication-types/books-monographs/iwmi-jointly-published/resource-recovery-from-waste/|title=Resource recovery from waste: business models for energy, nutrient and water reuse in low- and middle-income countries|last=Otoo|first=Miriam|last2=Drechsel|first2=Pay|publisher=Routledge - Earthscan|year=2018|isbn=|location=Oxon, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include water, energy, and fertilizing nutrients [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], as well as micro-nutrients such as [[sulphur]] and [[organic matter]]. There is also increasing interest for recovering other raw materials from wastewater, such as [[bioplastic]]s and metals such as silver.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Association of Regional Water Authorities. 2013. [https://www.uvw.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/362awk-VisionBrochure-AWK_def.pdf Vision brochure: Wastewater management roadmap towards 2030].&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, wastewater systems were designed only to remove excreta and wastewater from urban areas. Water was used to flush away the waste, often discharging into nearby waterbodies. Since the 1970s, there has been increasing interest in treating the wastewater to protect the environment, and efforts focused primarily on cleaning the water at the end of the pipe.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Since around the year 2003, the concepts of [[ecological sanitation]] and [[sustainable sanitation]] have emerged with the focus on recovering resources from wastewater.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} As of 2016, the term "toilet resources" came into use, and encouraged more attention to the potential for resource recovery from toilets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The following resources can be recovered: 
*Water: In many water-scarce areas there are increasing pressures to recover water from wastewater.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2006, the [[World Health Organization]], in collaboration with the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) and the [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Program]] (UNEP), developed guidelines for safe use of wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture]. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many national governments have their own regulations regarding the use of recovered water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Singapore for example aims to recover enough water from its wastewater systems to meet the water needs of half the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/singapores-toilet-to-tap-concept/a-16904636|title=Singapore's 'toilet to tap' concept|last=|first=|date=2013-06-25|work=Deutsche Welle|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They call this [[NEWater]]. Another related concept for wastewater reuse is [[sewer mining]].
*Energy: The production of [[biogas]] from [[Sewage sludge|wastewater sludge]] is now common practice at [[Wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment plants]]. In addition, a number for methods have been researched regarding use of wastewater sludge and excreta as fuel sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eawag.ch/fileadmin/Domain1/Abteilungen/sandec/publikationen/EWM/Treatment_Objectives/Production_Pellets_and_Electricity_from_FS.pdf|title=Production of Pellets and Electricity from Faecal Sludge|last=|first=|date=2015|work=SANDEC NEWS|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fertilizing nutrients: Human excreta contains nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other micronutrients that are needed for agricultural production. These can be recovered through [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] or stripping processes, or simply by use of the wastewater or [[sewage sludge]]. However, reuse of sewage sludge poses risks due to high concentrations of undesirable compounds, such as [[heavy metals]], [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s and other chemicals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the majority of fertilizing nutrients are found in excreta, it can be useful to separate the excreta fractions of wastewater (e.g. toilet waste) from the rest of the wastewater flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=juicry4LaRgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Source Separation and Decentralization for Wastewater Management|last=Larsen|first=Tove A.|last2=Udert|first2=Kai M.|last3=Lienert|first3=Judit|date=2013-02-01|publisher=IWA Publishing|isbn=9781843393481|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduces the risk for undesirable compounds and reduces the volume that needs to be treated before applying recovered nutrients in agricultural production.

Other methods are also being developed for transforming wastewater into valuable products. Growing [[Hermetia illucens|Black Soldier Flies]] in excreta or organic waste can produce fly larvae as a protein feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lalander|first=Cecilia|last2=Diener|first2=Stefan|last3=Magri|first3=Maria Elisa|last4=Zurbrügg|first4=Christian|last5=Lindström|first5=Anders|last6=Vinnerås|first6=Björn|title=Faecal sludge management with the larvae of the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) — From a hygiene aspect|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969713004555|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=458-460|pages=312–318|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.04.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers are harvesting [[fatty acid]]s from wastewater to make bioplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wateronline.com/doc/revolutionary-tech-makes-plastic-from-wastewater-0001|title='Revolutionary' Tech Makes Plastic From Wastewater|last=|first=|date=2015-04-07|work=Water Online|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic matter===
{{main|Composting|Home composting|Anaerobic digestion|Microbial fuel cell}}
[[Image:Compost Heap.jpg|thumb|right|An active [[compost]] heap.]]
Disposed materials that are organic in nature, such as plant material, food scraps, and paper products, can be recycled using biological composting and digestion processes to [[decompose]] the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as [[mulch]] or [[compost]] for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as [[methane]]) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/[[cogeneration]]) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter.

There is a large variety of composting and digestion methods and technologies varying in complexity from simple home compost heaps, to small town scale batch digesters, industrial-scale enclosed-vessel digestion of mixed domestic waste (see [[mechanical biological treatment]]). Methods of biological decomposition are differentiated as being [[Aerobic decomposition|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] methods, though hybrids of the two methods also exist.

Anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) has been found to be more environmentally effective, than landfill, incineration or [[pyrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idosi.org/gjer/gjer3(3)09/4.pdf Life Cycle Environmental Assessment of Municipal Solid Waste to Energy Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurojournals.com/ejsr_34_3_11.pdf Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Municipal Solid Waste Management in the State of Kuwait]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Life-cycle assessment|Life cycle analysis]] (LCA) was used to compare different technologies. The resulting biogas (methane) though must be used for cogeneration (electricity and heat preferably on or close to the site of production) and can be used with a little upgrading in gas combustion engines or turbines. With further upgrading to synthetic natural gas it can be injected into the natural gas network or further refined to [[hydrogen]] for use in stationary cogeneration fuel cells. Its use in fuel cells eliminates the pollution from products of combustion. There is a large variety of composting and digestion methods and technologies varying in complexity from simple home compost heaps, to small town scale batch digesters, industrial-scale, enclosed-vessel digestion of mixed domestic waste (see [[mechanical biological treatment]]). Methods of biological decomposition are differentiated as being [[Aerobic decomposition|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] methods, though hybrids of the two methods also exist.

==Recovery methods==
In many countries, source-separated [[curbside collection]] is one method of resource recovery.

=== Australia ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In Australia, every urban domestic household is provided with three bins: one for [[recycling]]; another for general waste; and another for garden materials, this bin is provided by the municipality if requested. To encourage recycling, municipalities provide large recycle bins, which are larger than general waste bins. Many American localities have [[dual-stream recycling]], with paper collected in bags or boxes and all other materials in a recycling bin. In either case, the recovered materials are trucked to a [[materials recovery facility]] for further processing.

Municipal, commercial and industrial, construction and demolition debris is dumped at landfills and some is recycled. Household disposal materials are segregated: recyclables sorted and made into new products, and unusable material is dumped in landfill areas. According to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] (ABS), the recycling rate is high and is "increasing, with 99% of households reporting that they had recycled or reused within the past year (2003 survey), up from 85% in 1992". In 2002–03 "30% of materials from municipalities, 45% from commercial and industrial generators and 57% from construction and demolition debris" was recycled. Energy is produced is part of resource recovery as well: some [[landfill gas]] is captured for fuel or electricity generation, although this is considered the last resort, as the point of resource recovery is avoidance of landfill disposal altogether.

==Sustainability==
Resource recovery is a key component in a business' ability to maintaining [[ISO14001]] accreditation. Companies are encouraged to improve their environmental efficiencies each year. One way to do this is by changing a company from a system of managing wastes to a resource recovery system (such as recycling: glass, food waste, paper and cardboard, plastic bottles etc.)

[[Education]] and [[awareness]] in the area of  resource recovery is increasingly important from a global perspective of [[resource management]]. The [[Talloires Declaration]] is a declaration for [[sustainability]] concerned about the unprecedented scale and speed of environmental [[pollution]] and [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]], and the [[Resource depletion|depletion]] of [[natural resources]]. Local, regional, and global [[air]] pollution; accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes; destruction and depletion of forests, [[soil]], and [[water]]; depletion of the [[ozone layer]] and emission of "green house" gases threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species, the integrity of the earth and its [[biodiversity]], the security of nations, and the heritage of future generations. Several universities have implemented the Talloires Declaration by establishing [[environmental management]] and resource recovery programs. [[University]] and [[vocational]] education are promoted by various organizations, e.g., [[WAMITAB]] and [[Chartered Institution of Wastes Management]]. Many supermarkets encourage customers to use their [[reverse vending machines]] to deposit used purchased containers and receive a refund from the recycling fees. Brands that manufacture such machines include [[Tomra]] and [[Envipco]].

In 2010, CNBC aired the documentary ''[[Trash Inc: The Secret Life of Garbage]]'' about waste, what happens to it when it's "thrown away", and its impact on the world.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-secret-garbage-20100929,0,2134032.story Television review: 'Trash Inc.'], [[Susan Carpenter]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 29 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extended producer responsibility===
[[Extended producer responsibility]] (EPR) is a  pricing strategy that promotes integrating all costs associated with a given product throughout its life cycle. Having the market price also reflect the "end-of-life disposal costs" encourages more accuracy in pricing. Extended producer responsibility is meant to impose accountability over the entire lifecycle of products, from production, to packaging, to transport and disposal or reuse. EPR requires firms that manufacture, import and/or sell products to be responsible for those products throughout the life and disposal or reuse of products.

[[Image:God by eyck.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure of Christ from the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] (1432).]]
In many historical societies, the position of [[kingship]] carries a [[Sacred|sacral]] meaning, that is, it is identical with that of a [[high priest]] and [[judge]]. The concept of [[theocracy]] is related, although a '''sacred king''' need not necessarily rule through his religious authority; rather, the temporal position has a religious significance.

== History ==
[[Sir James George Frazer]] identified - or invented - the concept of the sacred king in his study ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915), the title of which refers to the myth of the [[Rex Nemorensis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.bartleby.com/196/|title= The Golden Bough|last= Frazer|first= James George, Sir|publisher= New York: The Macmillan Co|year= 1922|isbn= |location= Bartleby.com|pages= |at= http://www.bartleby.com/196/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer gives numerous examples, cited below, and was an inspiration for the [[myth and ritual school]].&lt;ref&gt;R Fraser ed., ''The Golden Bough'' (Oxford 2009) p. 651&lt;/ref&gt; However, "the [[myth and ritual]], or myth-ritualist, theory" is disputed;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Myth: A Very Short Introduction|last= Segal|first= Robert A.|publisher= Oxford UP|year= 2004|isbn= |location= Oxford|pages= 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; many scholars now believe that myth and ritual share common [[paradigms]], but not that one developed from the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Poetics of Myth|last= Meletinsky|first= Eleazar Moiseevich|publisher= Routledge|year= 2000|isbn= 0-415-92898-2|location= |pages= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Frazer, the notion has [[prehistoric religion|prehistoric roots]] and occurs worldwide, on [[Java]] as in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], with [[shaman]]-kings credited with [[Rainmaking (ritual)|rainmaking]] and assuring [[Fertile (disambiguation) | fertility]] and good fortune. The king might also be designated to suffer and atone for his people, meaning that the sacral king could be the pre-ordained victim in a [[human sacrifice]], either killed at the end of his term in the position, or sacrificed in a time of crisis (e.g. the [[Blót]] of [[Domalde]]).

The [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] flogged a newly-selected king (''[[Ashantehene]]'') before [[enthronement|enthroning]] him.

From the [[Ancient Near Eastern religion|Bronze Age in the Near East]], the enthronement and [[anointment]] of a [[Monarchy|monarch]] is a central religious ritual, reflected in the titles "[[Messiah]]" or "[[Christ]]", which became separated from worldly kingship. Thus [[Sargon of Akkad]] described himself as "deputy of [[Ishtar]]",{{cn|date=August 2017}} just as the modern [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Pope]] takes the role of the "[[Vicar of Christ]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Vicar of Christ|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kings are styled as [[shepherd]]s from earliest times, e.g., the term applied to [[Ensí|Sumerian princes]] such as [[Lugalbanda]] in the 3rd millennium BCE. The image of the shepherd combines the themes of [[leadership]] and the responsibility to supply food and protection, as well as superiority.

As the mediator between the people and the divine, the sacral king was credited with special wisdom (e.g. [[Solomon]] or [[Gilgamesh]]) or vision (e.g. via [[oneiromancy]]).

== Study ==
Study of the concept was introduced by [[Sir James George Frazer]] in his influential book ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915); sacral kingship plays a role in [[Romanticism]] and [[Esotericism]] (e.g. [[Julius Evola]]) and some currents of [[Neopaganism]] ([[Theodism]]).
The school of [[Pan-Babylonianism]] derived much of the religion described in the [[Hebrew Bible]] from cults of sacral kingship in ancient [[Babylonia]].

The so-called British and Scandinavian cult-historical schools maintained that the king personified a god and stood at the center of the national or tribal religion. The English "myth and ritual school" concentrated on anthropology and folklore, while the Scandinavian "Uppsala school" emphasized Semitological study.

=== Frazer's interpretation ===
A sacred king, according to the systematic interpretation of [[mythology]] developed by Frazer in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (published 1890), was a [[monarch|king]] who represented a [[solar deity]] in a periodically re-enacted [[fertility rite]]. Frazer seized upon the notion of a substitute king and made him the keystone of his theory of a universal, pan-[[Europe]]an, and indeed worldwide fertility myth, in which a consort for the [[Goddess]] was annually replaced. According to Frazer, the sacred king represented the spirit of vegetation, a divine [[John Barleycorn]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} He came into being in the spring, reigned during the summer, and ritually died at harvest time, only to be reborn at the [[winter solstice]] to wax and rule again. The spirit of vegetation was therefore a "[[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and reviving god]]". [[Osiris]], [[Adonis]], [[Dionysus]], [[Attis]] and many other familiar figures from [[Greek mythology]] and [[classical antiquity]] were re-interpreted in this mold. The sacred king, the human embodiment of the dying and reviving vegetation god, was supposed to have originally been an individual chosen to rule for a time, but whose fate was to suffer as a [[sacrifice]], to be offered back to the earth so that a new king could rule for a time in his stead.

Especially in Europe during Frazer's early twentieth century heyday, it launched a [[cottage industry]] of amateurs looking for "[[paganism|pagan]] survivals" in such things as traditional [[fair]]s, [[maypole]]s, and folk arts like [[Morris dance|morris dancing]]. It was widely influential in [[literature]], being alluded to by [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[James Joyce]], [[Ezra Pound]], and in [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'', among other works.

[[Robert Graves]] used Frazer's work in ''The Greek Myths'' and made it one of the foundations of his own personal mythology in ''[[The White Goddess]]'', and in the fictional ''[[Seven Days in New Crete]]'' he depicted a future in which the institution of a sacrificial sacred King is revived. [[Margaret Murray]], the principal theorist of [[witchcraft]] as a "pagan survival," used Frazer's work to propose the thesis that many [[Kings of England]] who died as kings, most notably [[William II of England|William Rufus]], were secret pagans and [[witch]]es, whose deaths were the re-enactment of the [[human sacrifice]] that stood at the centre of Frazer's myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Divine King in England: a study in anthropology|last=Murray|first=Margaret Alice|publisher=London, Faber &amp; Faber|year=1954|isbn=9780404184285|location=British Library|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An idea used by [[fantasy writer]] [[Katherine Kurtz]] in her novel ''Lammas Night''.

{{Continuum mechanics|cTopic=[[Solid mechanics]]}}
'''Sandwich theory'''&lt;ref name=Plantema&gt;Plantema, F, J., 1966, '''Sandwich Construction: The Bending and Buckling of Sandwich Beams, Plates, and Shells''', Jon Wiley and Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zenkert&gt;Zenkert, D., 1995, '''An Introduction to Sandwich Construction''', Engineering Materials Advisory Services Ltd, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the behaviour of a [[beam theory|beam]], [[plate theory|plate]], or [[Theory of plates and shells|shell]] which consists of three layers—two facesheets and one core.  The most commonly used sandwich theory is [[linear]] and is an extension of first order [[beam theory]].  Linear sandwich theory is of importance for the design and analysis of [[Sandwich Panel|sandwich panels]], which are of use in building construction, vehicle construction, airplane construction and refrigeration engineering.

Some advantages of sandwich construction are:
* Sandwich cross sections are [[Composite material|composite]]. They usually consist of a low to moderate [[stiffness]] core which is connected with two stiff exterior face-sheets.  The composite has a considerably higher shear stiffness to weight ratio than an equivalent beam made of only the core material or the face-sheet material.  The composite also has a high tensile strength to weight ratio.
* The high stiffness of the face-sheet leads to a high [[bending|bending stiffness]] to weight ratio for the composite.

The behavior of a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] with sandwich cross-section under a load differs from a beam with a constant [[linear elasticity|elastic]] cross section.  If the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] during bending is large compared to the thickness of the sandwich beam and the strains in the component materials are small, the [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of a sandwich composite beam can be separated into two parts
* deformations due to bending moments or bending deformation, and
* deformations due to transverse forces, also called shear deformation.

Sandwich beam, [[plate theory|plate]], and [[Theory of plates and shells|shell]] theories usually assume that the reference stress state is one of zero stress.  However, during curing, differences of temperature between the face-sheets persist because of the thermal separation by the core material. These temperature differences, coupled with different linear expansions of the face-sheets, can lead to a bending of the sandwich beam in the direction of the warmer face-sheet.  If the bending is constrained during the manufacturing process, [[residual stress]]es can develop in the components of a sandwich composite.  The [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of a reference stress state on the solutions provided by sandwich theory is possible when the problem is [[linear]].  However, when large elastic deformations and rotations are expected, the initial stress state has to be incorporated directly into the sandwich theory.

==Engineering sandwich beam theory==
[[Image:SandwichBendEng.svg|thumb|450px|Bending of a sandwich beam without extra deformation due to core shear.]]
In the engineering theory of sandwich beams,&lt;ref name=Zenkert/&gt; the axial strain is assumed to vary linearly over the cross-section of the beam as in [[beam theory|Euler-Bernoulli theory]], i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{xx}(x,z) = -z~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the axial stress in the sandwich beam is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{xx}(x,z) = -z~E(z)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Young's modulus]] which is a function of the location along the thickness of the beam.  The [[bending moment]] in the beam is then given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_x(x) = \int\int z~\sigma_{xx}~\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}y = -\left(\int\int z^2 E(z)~\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}y\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} =: -D~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
The quantity &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''' flexural stiffness''' of the sandwich beam.  The [[shear force]] &lt;math&gt;Q_x&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
    Q_x = \frac{\mathrm{d} M_x}{\mathrm{d} x}~.
&lt;/math&gt;

Using these relations, we can show that the stresses in a sandwich beam with a core of thickness &lt;math&gt;2h&lt;/math&gt; and modulus &lt;math&gt;E^c&lt;/math&gt; and two facesheets each of thickness &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and modulus &lt;math&gt;E^f&lt;/math&gt;, are given by
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:650px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; = \cfrac{z E^{\mathrm{f}} M_x}{D} ~;~~ &amp;
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; = \cfrac{z E^{\mathrm{c}} M_x}{D} \\
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; = \cfrac{Q_x E^{\mathrm{f}}}{2D}\left[(h+f)^2-z^2\right] ~;~~ &amp;
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; = \cfrac{Q_x}{2D}\left[ E^{\mathrm{c}}\left(h^2-z^2\right) + E^{\mathrm{f}} f(f+2h)\right]
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

!Derivation of engineering sandwich beam stresses
|-
|Since
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{d^2 w}{d x^2}= -\cfrac{M_x(x)}{D}
&lt;/math&gt;
we can write the axial stress as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma_{xx}(x,z) = \cfrac{z~E(z)~M_x(x)}{D}
&lt;/math&gt;
The equation of equilibrium for a two-dimensional solid is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial \sigma_{xx}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \tau_{xz}}{\partial z} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tau_{xz}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[shear stress]].  Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau_{xz}(x,z) = \int \frac{\partial \sigma_{xx}}{\partial x}~\mathrm{d}z + C(x)
       = \int \cfrac{z~E(z)}{D}~\frac{\mathrm{d} M_{x}}{\mathrm{d} x}~\mathrm{d}z + C(x)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of integration.  
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau_{xz}(x,z) = \cfrac{Q_x}{D}\int z~E(z)~\mathrm{d}z + C(x)
&lt;/math&gt;
Let us assume that there are no shear tractions applied to the top face of the sandwich beam.  The shear stress in the top facesheet is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau^{\mathrm{face}}_{xz}(x,z) = \cfrac{Q_xE^f}{D}\int_z^{h+f} z~\mathrm{d}z + C(x)
                  = \cfrac{Q_x E^f}{2D}\left[(h+f)^2-z^2\right] + C(x)
&lt;/math&gt;
At &lt;math&gt;z = h+f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tau_{xz}(x,h+f) = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;C(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the shear stress at the top of the core, &lt;math&gt;z = h&lt;/math&gt;, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau_{xz}(x,h) = \cfrac{Q_x E^f f(f+2h)}{2D}
&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the shear stress in the core can be calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau^{\mathrm{core}}_{xz}(x,z) = \cfrac{Q_xE^c}{D}\int_z^{h} z~\mathrm{d}z + C(x)
                  = \cfrac{Q_x E^c}{2D}\left(h^2-z^2\right) + C(x)
&lt;/math&gt;
The integration constant &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is determined from the continuity of shear stress at the interface of the core and the facesheet.  Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   C(x) =  \cfrac{Q_x E^f f(f+2h)}{2D}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau^{\mathrm{core}}_{xz}(x,z) 
                  = \cfrac{Q_x}{2D}\left[ E^c\left(h^2-z^2\right) + E^f f(f+2h)\right]
&lt;/math&gt;
|}
For a sandwich beam with identical facesheets and unit width, the value of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   D &amp; = E^f\int_w\int_{-h-f}^{-h} z^2~\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}y + E^c\int_w\int_{-h}^{h} z^2~\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}y + 
     E^f\int_w\int_{h}^{h+f} z^2~\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}y  \\
     &amp; = \frac{2}{3}E^ff^3 + \frac{2}{3}E^ch^3 + 2E^ffh(f+h)~.
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;E^f \gg E^c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; can be approximated as
:&lt;math&gt;
   D \approx \frac{2}{3}E^ff^3 + 2E^ffh(f+h) = 2fE^f\left(\frac{1}{3}f^2+h(f+h)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
and the stresses in the sandwich beam can be approximated as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{z M_x}{\frac{2}{3}f^3 +2fh(f+h)} ~;~~ &amp;
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; \approx 0 \\
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{Q_x}{\frac{4}{3}f^3+4fh(f+h)}\left[(h+f)^2-z^2\right] ~;~~ &amp;
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{Q_x(f+2h)}{\frac{2}{3}f^2+h(f+h)}
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
If, in addition, &lt;math&gt;f \ll 2h&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;
   D \approx 2E^ffh(f+h)
&lt;/math&gt;
and the approximate stresses in the beam are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{zM_x}{2fh(f+h)} ~;~~&amp;
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; \approx 0 \\
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{Q_x}{4fh(f+h)}\left[(h+f)^2-z^2\right] ~;~~&amp;
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{Q_x(f+2h)}{4h(f+h)} \approx \cfrac{Q_x}{2h}
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
If we assume that the facesheets are thin enough that the stresses may be assumed to be constant through the thickness, we have the approximation
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:300px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; \approx \pm \cfrac{M_x}{2fh} ~;~~&amp;
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; \approx 0 \\
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; \approx 0 ~;~~ &amp;
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{Q_x}{2h}
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hence the problem can be split into two parts, one involving only core shear and the other involving only bending stresses in the facesheets.

== Linear sandwich theory ==

=== Bending of a sandwich beam with thin facesheets ===
[[Image:SandwichBendInit.svg|thumb|450px|Bending of a sandwich beam after incorporating shear of the core into the deformation.]]
The main assumptions of linear sandwich theories of beams with thin facesheets are:
* the transverse normal stiffness of the core is infinite, i.e., the core thickness in the z-direction does not change during bending
* the in-plane normal stiffness of the core is small compared to that of the facesheets, i.e., the core does not lengthen or compress in the x-direction
* the facesheets behave according to the [[Beam theory|Euler-Bernoulli]] assumptions, i.e., there is no xz-shear in the facesheets and the z-direction thickness of the facesheets does not change
However, the xz shear-stresses in the core are not neglected.

==== Constitutive assumptions ====
The constitutive relations for two-dimensional orthotropic [[linear elasticity|linear elastic]] materials are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{xx} \\ \sigma_{zz} \\ \sigma_{zx} \end{bmatrix} = 
   \begin{bmatrix} C_{11} &amp; C_{13} &amp; 0 \\ C_{13} &amp; C_{33} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; C_{55} \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon_{xx} \\ \varepsilon_{zz} \\ \varepsilon_{zx} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The assumptions of sandwich theory lead to the simplified relations
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}} = C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}} ~;~~
   \sigma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}~\varepsilon_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} ~;~~
   \sigma_{zz}^{\mathrm{face}} = \sigma_{xz}^{\mathrm{face}} = 0 ~;~~ \sigma_{zz}^{\mathrm{core}} = \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{core}} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{zz}^{\mathrm{face}} = \varepsilon_{xz}^{\mathrm{face}} = 0 ~;~~ \varepsilon_{zz}^{\mathrm{core}} = \varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{core}} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;

The equilibrium equations in two dimensions are
:&lt;math&gt;
      \cfrac{\partial \sigma_{xx}}{\partial x} + \cfrac{\partial \sigma_{zx}}{\partial z} = 0 ~;~~
      \cfrac{\partial \sigma_{zx}}{\partial x} + \cfrac{\partial \sigma_{zz}}{\partial z} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
The assumptions for a sandwich beam and the equilibrium equation imply that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}} \equiv \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}}(z) ~;~~
   \sigma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \mathrm{constant}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, for homogeneous facesheets and core, the strains also have the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}} \equiv \varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}}(z) ~;~~
   \varepsilon_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \mathrm{constant}
 &lt;/math&gt;

==== Kinematics ====
[[Image:SandwichBend.svg|thumb|450px|Bending of a sandwich beam. The total deflection is the sum of a bending part w&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and a shear part w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;]]
[[Image:SandwichBendInPlane.svg|thumb|450px|Shear strains during the bending of a sandwich beam.]]

Let the sandwich beam be subjected to a bending moment &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and a shear force &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Let the total deflection of the beam due to these loads be &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.  The adjacent figure shows that, for small displacements, the total deflection of the mid-surface of the beam can be expressed as the sum of two deflections, a pure bending deflection &lt;math&gt;w_b&lt;/math&gt; and a pure shear deflection &lt;math&gt;w_s&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
  w(x) = w_b(x) + w_s(x)
&lt;/math&gt;

From the geometry of the deformation we observe that the engineering shear strain (&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;) in the core is related the effective shear strain in the composite by the relation
:&lt;math&gt;
   \gamma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \tfrac{2h + f}{2h}~\gamma_{zx}^{\mathrm{beam}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Note the shear strain in the core is larger than the effective shear strain in the composite and that small deformations (&lt;math&gt;\tan \gamma = \gamma&lt;/math&gt;) are assumed in deriving the above relation.  The effective shear strain in the beam is related to the shear displacement by the relation
:&lt;math&gt;
    \gamma_{zx}^{\mathrm{beam}} = \cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x}
 &lt;/math&gt;

The facesheets are assumed to deform in accordance with the assumptions of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.  The total deflection of the facesheets is assumed to be the superposition of the deflections due to bending and that due to core shear.   The &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-direction displacements of the facesheets due to bending are given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   u_b^{\mathrm{face}}(x,z) = -z~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_b}{\mathrm{d} x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The displacement of the top facesheet due to shear in the core is
:&lt;math&gt;
   u_s^{\mathrm{topface}}(x,z) = -\left(z - h - \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
and that of the bottom facesheet is
:&lt;math&gt;
   u_s^{\mathrm{botface}}(x,z) = -\left(z + h + \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The normal strains in the two facesheets are given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{xx} = \cfrac{\partial u_b}{\partial x} + \cfrac{\partial u_s}{\partial x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
     \varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{topface}}  = -z~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} -\left(z - h - \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2} ~;~~
     \varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{botface}}  = -z~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} -\left(z + h + \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;

==== Stress-displacement relations ====
The shear stress in the core is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = C^{\mathrm{core}}_{55}~\varepsilon_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \cfrac{C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}}{2}~\gamma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \tfrac{2h + f}{4h}~C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}~\gamma_{zx}^{\mathrm{beam}} 
&lt;/math&gt;
or,
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:250px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \tfrac{2h + f}{4h}~C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The normal stresses in the facesheets are given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}} = C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:800px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{topface}} &amp; = -z~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} -\left(z - h - \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2} 
     &amp; = &amp; -z~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} + \left(\tfrac{2h+f}{2}\right)~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\\
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{botface}} &amp; = -z~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} -\left(z + h + \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2} 
     &amp; = &amp; -z~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - \left(\tfrac{2h+f}{2}\right)~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Resultant forces and moments ====
The resultant normal force in a face sheet is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   N^{\mathrm{face}}_{xx} := \int_{-f/2}^{f/2} \sigma^{\mathrm{face}}_{xx}~\mathrm{d}z_f
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the resultant moments are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   M^{\mathrm{face}}_{xx} := \int_{-f/2}^{f/2} z_f~\sigma^{\mathrm{face}}_{xx}~\mathrm{d}z_f 
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
   z_f^{\mathrm{topface}} := z - h - \tfrac{f}{2} ~;~~ z_f^{\mathrm{botface}} := z + h + \tfrac{f}{2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Using the expressions for the normal stress in the two facesheets gives
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:600px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   N^{\mathrm{topface}}_{xx} &amp; = -f\left(h + \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} = - N^{\mathrm{botface}}_{xx} \\
   M^{\mathrm{topface}}_{xx} &amp; = -\cfrac{f^3~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}}{12}\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} + \cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\right) = -\cfrac{f^3~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}}{12}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} = M^{\mathrm{botface}}_{xx} 
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the core, the resultant moment is
:&lt;math&gt;
   M^{\mathrm{core}}_{xx} := \int_{-h}^{h} z~\sigma^{\mathrm{core}}_{xx}~\mathrm{d}z = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
The total bending moment in the beam is
:&lt;math&gt;
   M = N_{xx}^{\mathrm{topface}}~(2h+f) + 2~M^{\mathrm{topface}}_{xx}
 &lt;/math&gt;
or,
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:450px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   M = -\cfrac{f(2h+f)^2}{2}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - \cfrac{f^3}{6}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The shear force &lt;math&gt;Q_x&lt;/math&gt; in the core is defined as
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:400px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   Q_x^{\mathrm{core}} = \kappa\int_{-h}^h \sigma_{xz}~dz = \tfrac{\kappa(2h+f)}{2}~C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_s}{\mathrm{d}x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is a shear correction coefficient.  The shear force in the facesheets can be computed from the bending moments using the relation
:&lt;math&gt;
   Q_x^{\mathrm{face}} = \cfrac{\mathrm{d}M_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}}}{\mathrm{d}x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
or,
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:250px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   Q_x^{\mathrm{face}} = -\cfrac{f^3~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}}{12}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3 w}{\mathrm{d} x^3}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For thin facesheets, the shear force in the facesheets is usually ignored.&lt;ref name=Zenkert/&gt;

==== Bending and shear stiffness ====
The bending stiffness of the sandwich beam is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   D^{\mathrm{beam}} = -M/\tfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d}x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
From the expression for the total bending moment in the beam, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   M = -\cfrac{f(2h+f)^2}{2}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - \cfrac{f^3}{6}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
For small shear deformations, the above expression can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   M \approx -\cfrac{f[3(2h+f)^2+f^2]}{6}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the bending stiffness of the sandwich beam (with &lt;math&gt;f \ll 2h&lt;/math&gt;) is given by
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:500px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  D^{\mathrm{beam}} \approx \cfrac{f[3(2h+f)^2+f^2]}{6}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}} \approx  \cfrac{f(2h+f)^2}{2}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and that of the facesheets is
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:250px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  D^{\mathrm{face}} = \cfrac{f^3}{12}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The shear stiffness of the beam is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   S^{\mathrm{beam}} = Q_x/\tfrac{\mathrm{d}w_s}{\mathrm{d}x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the shear stiffness of the beam, which is equal to the shear stiffness of the core, is
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:350px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  S^{\mathrm{beam}} = S^{\mathrm{core}} = \cfrac{\kappa(2h+f)}{2}~C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Relation between bending and shear deflections ====
A relation can be obtained between the bending and shear deflections by using the continuity of [[stress (mechanics)|traction]]s between the core and the facesheets.  If we equate the tractions directly we get
:&lt;math&gt;
   n_x~\sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}} = n_z~\sigma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
At both the facesheet-core interfaces &lt;math&gt;n_x = 1&lt;/math&gt; but at the top of the core &lt;math&gt; n_z = 1&lt;/math&gt;  and at the bottom of the core &lt;math&gt;n_z = -1&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, traction continuity at &lt;math&gt; z = \pm h&lt;/math&gt; leads to
:&lt;math&gt;
   2fh~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - (2h+f)~C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x} = 4h^2~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The above relation is rarely used because of the presence of second derivatives of the shear deflection.  Instead it is assumed that 
:&lt;math&gt;
   n_z~\sigma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \cfrac{\mathrm{d} N_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}}}{\mathrm{d}x}
&lt;/math&gt;
which implies that
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:300px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x} = -2fh~\left(\cfrac{C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}}{C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^3}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Governing equations ====
Using the above definitions, the governing balance equations for the bending moment and shear force are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   M &amp; = D^{\mathrm{beam}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - \left(D^{\mathrm{beam}}+2D^{\mathrm{face}}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\\
   Q &amp; = S^{\mathrm{core}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x} - 2D^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3 w}{\mathrm{d} x^3}
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
We can alternatively express the above as two equations that can be solved for &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_s&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left(\frac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} - \left(1+\frac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} + \left(\cfrac{1}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} Q}{\mathrm{d} x} = \frac{M}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}} \\
&amp; \left(\frac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^3} - \left(1+\frac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x} - \cfrac{1}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} M}{\mathrm{d} x} = -\left(1+\cfrac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}\right)\frac{Q}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Using the approximations
:&lt;math&gt;
   Q \approx \cfrac{\mathrm{d} M}{\mathrm{d} x} ~;~~ q \approx \cfrac{\mathrm{d} Q}{\mathrm{d} x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the intensity of the applied load on the beam, we have
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:550px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left(\frac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} - \left(1+\frac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} =  \frac{M}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}- \cfrac{q}{S^{\mathrm{core}}} \\
&amp; \left(\frac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^3} - \left(1+\frac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x}  = -\left(\cfrac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}\right)\frac{Q}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Several techniques may be used to solve this system of two coupled ordinary differential equations given the applied load and the applied bending moment and displacement boundary conditions.

==== Temperature dependent alternative form of governing equations ====
Assuming that each partial cross section fulfills [[beam theory|Bernoulli's hypothesis]], the balance of forces and moments on the deformed sandwich beam element can be used to deduce the bending equation for the sandwich beam.

[[Image:Verformung und Schnittgroessen am Sandwichquerschnitt.svg|thumb|300px|Figure 1 - Equilibration of a deflected sandwich beam under temperature load and burden in comparison with the undeflected cross section]]
The stress resultants and the corresponding deformations of the beam and of the cross section can be seen in Figure 1. The following relationships can be derived using the theory of [[linear elasticity]]:&lt;ref&gt;K. Stamm, H. Witte: ''Sandwichkonstruktionen - Berechnung, Fertigung, Ausführung''.

Superposition of the equations for the facesheets and the core leads to the following equations for the total shear force &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and the total bending moment &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{3}
&amp; S^{\mathrm{core}}\gamma - D^{\mathrm{face}} \cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3 w}{\mathrm{d} x^3} = Q            &amp;\quad\quad&amp; (1)\\
&amp; D^{\mathrm{beam}}\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d} \gamma}{\mathrm{d} x}+\vartheta\right) - \left(D^{\mathrm{beam}}+D^{\mathrm{face}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} = M &amp;\quad\quad&amp; (2)\,
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;
We can alternatively express the above as two equations that can be solved for &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left(\frac{D^{\mathrm{face}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} - \left(1+\frac{D^{\mathrm{face}}}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} =  \frac{M}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}-\cfrac{q}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}-\vartheta \\
&amp; \left(\frac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 \gamma}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - \left(1+\frac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{D^{\mathrm{face}}}\right)\gamma = -\left(\cfrac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{D^{\mathrm{face}}}\right)\frac{Q}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Solution approaches ==
[[Image:sandwich bending.jpg|thumb|Shear and bending deformation of a sandwich composite beam.]]
The bending behavior and stresses in a continuous sandwich beam can be computed by solving the two governing differential equations.

=== Analytical approach ===
For simple geometries such as double span beams under uniformly distributed loads, the governing equations can be solved by using appropriate boundary conditions and using the superposition principle. Such results are listed in the standard DIN EN 14509:2006&lt;ref name="EN14509"&gt;EN 14509 (D):''Self-supporting double skin metal faced insulating panels''. November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;(Table E10.1).  Energy methods may also be used to compute solutions directly.

=== Numerical approach ===
The differential equation of sandwich continuous beams can be solved by the use of numerical methods such as [[finite difference method|finite differences]] and [[finite element method|finite elements]].  For finite differences Berner&lt;ref  name=Berner&gt;Klaus Berner: ''Erarbeitung vollständiger Bemessungsgrundlagen im Rahmen bautechnischer Zulassungen für Sandwichbauteile''.Fraunhofer IRB Verlag, Stuttgart 2000 (Teil 1).&lt;/ref&gt;  recommends a two-stage approach.  After solving the differential equation for the normal forces in the cover sheets for a single span beam under a given load, the energy method can be used to expand the approach for the calculation of multi-span beams. Sandwich continuous beam with flexible cover sheets can also be laid on top of each other when using this technique.   However, the cross-section of the beam has to be constant across the spans.

A more specialized approach recommended by Schwarze&lt;ref name="Schwarze"/&gt; involves solving for the homogeneous part of the governing equation exactly and for the particular part approximately.  Recall that the governing equation for a sandwich beam is
:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} - \left(1+\frac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} =  \frac{M}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}-\cfrac{q}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}
&lt;/math&gt;
If we define
:&lt;math&gt;
   \alpha := \cfrac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}} ~;~~ \beta := \cfrac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}} ~;~~ W(x) :=  \cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
we get
:&lt;math&gt;
 \cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 W}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - \left(\cfrac{1+\alpha}{\beta}\right)~W  =  \frac{M}{\beta D^{\mathrm{beam}}} - \cfrac{q}{D^{\mathrm{face}}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Schwarze uses the general solution for the homogeneous part of the above equation and a polynomial approximation for the particular solution for sections of a sandwich beam.   Interfaces between sections are tied together by matching boundary conditions.  This approach has been used in the [[Open Source|open source]] code [http://www.swe2.com swe2].

== Practical Importance ==
Results predicted by linear sandwich theory correlate well with the experimentally determined results.  The theory is used as a basis for the [[structural analysis|structural report]] which is needed for the construction of large industrial and commercial buildings which are clad with [[Sandwich Panel|sandwich panels]] . Its use is explicitly demanded for approvals and in the relevant engineering standards.&lt;ref name="EN14509"/&gt;

[[Mohammed Rahif Hakmi]] and others conducted researches into numerical, experimental behavior of materials and fire and blast behavior of [[Composite material]]. He published multiple research articles:

The '''Skystone''' is an [[andesite]] [[glacial erratic]] boulder in [[Bonney Lake, Washington|Bonney Lake]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The boulder was deposited approximately 13,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-S3xJHop87cC&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=Bonney Lake's Plateau|last=Jacobsen|first=Winona|date=2011-01-01|publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]]|isbn=9780738582085|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone's height and width are {{convert|4.5|×|12|ft}}.&lt;ref name=blch2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap2004/&gt;

==Uses==
The stone may have astronomical significance to the [[Puyallup tribe]] of Native Americans. It has over 20 pits pounded into its surface that appear to be man-made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The holes seem to point towards both astronomical and geographic features. The holes point in the direction of Polaris, Sirius, the Little Dipper, and Orion. The stone may have also been used to predict lunar standstills.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/chinook/2000-April/002096.html|title=[Dipity] ~ Mystery Of The Skystone ~|last=webster|first=peter|date=2017-04-17|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the holes align with the sun's position on the solstices,&lt;ref name="blch2009" /&gt;  which may have allowed Native Americans to predict the changing of seasons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pits in the surface of the boulder also appear to point towards Mt. Rainier, the peak of Mt. St. Helens (before it erupted), and potentially Mt. Adams, all of which have significance for local Native tribes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The stone is about one mile south of the former [[Naches Trail]], and was apparently rediscovered when a suburban housing development was begun in 1999.&lt;ref name="Beauchamp2013" /&gt; It is listed and preserved as an archaeological site by the [[Washington State Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref name="Beauchamp2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tnt2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ap2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blch2012" /&gt;

'''Space vector modulation''' ('''SVM''') is an algorithm for the control of [[pulse width modulation]] (PWM).&lt;ref name=control&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for the creation of [[alternating current]] (AC) [[waveform]]s; most commonly to drive [[3 phase]] AC powered motors at varying speeds from DC using multiple [[Switching amplifier|class-D amplifiers]]. There are variations of SVM that result in different quality and computational requirements. One active area of development is in the reduction of [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD) created by the rapid switching inherent to these algorithms.

==Principle==

[[File:Three leg inverter.gif|240px|thumb|right|Topology of a basic three phase inverter.]]

A three-phase inverter as shown to the right converts a DC supply, via a series of switches, to three output legs which could be connected to a three-phase motor.

The switches must be controlled so that at no time are both switches in the same leg turned on or else the DC supply would be shorted. This requirement may be met by the complementary operation of the switches within a leg. i.e. if A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is on then A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is off and vice versa. This leads to eight possible switching vectors for the inverter, V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; through V&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; with six active switching vectors and two zero vectors.

The reference signal may be generated from three separate phase references using the [[Alpha beta gamma transform|&lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transform]]. The reference vector is then synthesized using a combination of the two adjacent active switching vectors and one or both of the zero vectors. Various strategies of selecting the order of the vectors and which zero vector(s) to use exist. Strategy selection will affect the harmonic content and the switching losses.

{{Network science}}
A '''telecommunications network''' is a collection of terminal nodes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Link (telecommunications)|links]]  are connected so as to enable [[telecommunication]] between the terminals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |title=Design Elements - Telecommunication networks|url=https://conceptdraw.com/a915c3/preview--Design%20Elements%20-%20Telecommunication%20networks
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] links connect the nodes together. The nodes use circuit switching, message switching or packet switching to pass the signal through the correct links and nodes to reach the correct destination terminal.

Each terminal in the network usually has a unique [[network address|address]] so messages or connections can be routed to the correct recipients. The collection of addresses in the network is called the [[Address space layout randomization|address space]].

Examples of telecommunications networks are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telecommunication Network - Types of Telecommunication Networks|url=http://www.wifinotes.com/computer-networks/telecommunication-network.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the [[telephone network]]
* the global [[Telex]] network
* the aeronautical [[ACARS]] network

== Benefits of telecommunications and networking ==


Telecommunications facilitates interaction and information transfer over large distances. Businesses use telecommunications to expand and grow their networks. With Internet, computer, and telephone networks, businesses can allocate their resources efficiently. These core types of networks will be discussed below:

Computer network: a computer network consists of computers and devices connected to one another. Information can be transferred from one device to the next. For example, an office filled with computers can share files together on each separate device. Computer networks can range from a [[local area network (LAN)]] to a [[Wide area network|wide area network (WAN)]]. The difference between the types of networks is the size. These types of computer networks work at certain speeds, also known as broadband. The Internet network connects computers worldwide.

Internet network: access to the network allows users to use many resources. Over time the Internet network will replace books. This will enable users to discover information almost instantly and apply concepts to different situations. The Internet can be used for recreational, governmental, educational, and other purposes. Businesses in particular use the Internet network for research or to service customers and clients.

Telephone network: the telephone network connects people to one another. This network can be used in a variety of ways. Many businesses use the telephone network to route calls and/or service their customers. Some businesses use a telephone network on a greater scale through a private branch exchange. It is a system where a specific business focuses on routing and servicing calls for another business. Majority of the time, the telephone network is used around the world for recreational purposes.

== Network structure ==
In general, every telecommunications network conceptually consists of three parts, or planes (so called because they can be thought of as being, and often are, separate [[overlay network]]s):

* The [[data plane]] (also user plane, bearer plane, or forwarding plane) carries the network's users' traffic, the actual payload.
* The [[control plane]] carries control information (also known as [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signaling]]).
* The [[management plane]] carries the operations and administration traffic required for network management. The management plane is sometimes considered a part of the control plane.

== Example: the TCP/IP data network ==
The data network is used extensively throughout the world to connect individuals and organizations. Data networks can be connected to allow users seamless access to resources that are hosted outside of the particular provider they are connected to. The [[Internet]]&lt;ref name="gorry_MAN" /&gt; is the best example of many data networks&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;from different organizations all operating under a single address space.

Terminals attached to [[TCP/IP port number|TCP/IP]] networks are addressed using [[IP address management|IP addresses]]. There are different types of IP address, but the most common is [[IP Version 4]]. Each unique address consists of 4 integers between 0 and 255, usually separated by dots when written down, e.g. 82.131.34.56.

TCP/IP are the fundamental protocols that provide the control and routing of messages across the data network.  There are many different network structures that TCP/IP can be used across to efficiently route messages, for example:
* [[wide area network]]s (WAN)
* [[metropolitan area network]]s (MAN)
* [[local area network]]s (LAN)
* [[Internet area network]]s (IAN)
* [[campus area network]]s (CAN)
* [[Virtual private network|virtual private networks]] (VPN)

There are three features that differentiate MANs from LANs or WANs:

# The area of the network size is between LANs and WANs. The MAN will have a physical area between 5 and 50&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.&lt;ref name=gorry_MAN/&gt;
# MANs do not generally belong to a single organization. The equipment that interconnects the network, the links, and the MAN itself are often owned by an association or a network provider that provides or leases the service to others.&lt;ref name=gorry_MAN/&gt;
# A MAN is a means for sharing resources at high speeds within the network. It often provide connections to WAN networks for access to resources outside the scope of the MAN.&lt;ref name=gorry_MAN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/intro-pages/man.html |title=Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) |publisher=Erg.abdn.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Datacenter networks also rely highly on TCP/IP for communication across machines. They connect thousands of servers, are designed to be highly robust, provide low latency that is typically up to hundreds of microseconds, and high bandwidth. Datacenter network topology plays a significant role in determining the level of failure resiliency, ease of incremental expansion, communication bandwidth and latency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noormohammadpour|first1=Mohammad|last2=Raghavendra|first2=Cauligi|title=Datacenter Traffic Control: Understanding Techniques and Tradeoffs|journal=Communications Surveys &amp; Tutorials, IEEE|date=28 July 2018|volume=20|issue=2|page=1492-1525|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8207422/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3550">{{Semiotics}}
'''Urban semiotics''' is the study of meaning in urban form as generated by signs, symbols, and their social connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keller, Suzanne |title=Review |journal=Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 17, No. 3. (May, 1988), pp. 346-348 |jstor=2069642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most urban semiotic theory is based on [[social semiotics]], which considers social connotations, including meanings related to ideology and power structures, in addition to denotative meanings of signs.  As such, urban semiotics focuses on material objects of the built environment, such as streets, squares, parks, and buildings, but also unbuilt cultural products such as building codes, planning documents, unbuilt designs, real estate advertising, and popular discourse about the city,&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.5&lt;/ref&gt; such as architectural criticism and real estate blogs.

Theorists who take a social semiotic approach to urban semiotics define their discipline in opposition to the methods of [[behavioral geography]], beginning with the work of [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] in ''The Image of the City'', which they criticize for being limited by its exclusive focus on the denotative level of communication (recognition of spatial elements, such as paths, as conceptual objects), ignoring the connotative meanings associated with urban forms; instead, urban semioticians argue that urban structures often become recognizable because they have symbolic meaning beyond their functional meanings.  The social semiotic approach to urban semiotics also grew out of a critique of architectural semiotics, which was perceived to be overly attached to linguistic models of semiosis and thus unable to adequately consider the social connotations of signs.&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener and Lagopoulos, 1986. p.6-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theorists have used semiotic models in empirical studies of the construction of meaning in urban environments.  Raymond Ledrut has used questionnaires and interviews about viewers' responses to sets of photographs in order to examine the role of class in shaping mental models of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ledrut, Raymond.  “The Images of the City,” in ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', Gottdienier, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.219-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Martin Krampen]] conducted studies of photograph recognition in order to discover the level of facade detail required to identify building types, and to examine the role of socioeconomic status in shaping preference for building styles.&lt;ref&gt;Krampen, M.

[[File:Usine Bret MG 1638.jpg|thumb|Control room and schematics of the water purification plant to [[Lac de Bret]], Switzerland]]

'''Water purification''' is the process of removing undesirable chemicals, biological contaminants, suspended solids and gases from water. The goal is to produce water fit for a specific purpose. Most water is disinfected for human consumption ([[drinking water]]), but water purification may also be designed for a variety of other purposes, including fulfilling the requirements of medical, pharmacological, chemical and industrial applications. The methods used include physical processes such as [[filtration]], [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]], and [[distillation]]; biological processes such as [[slow sand filters]] or [[activated carbon|biologically active carbon]]; chemical processes such as [[flocculation]] and [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and the use of electromagnetic radiation such as [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|ultraviolet light]].

Purifying water may reduce the concentration of particulate matter including [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] [[Particle (ecology)|particle]]s, [[parasite]]s, [[bacteria]], [[algae]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], as well as reducing the concentration of a range of dissolved and particulate matter.

The standards for drinking [[water quality]] are typically set by governments or by international standards. These standards usually include minimum and maximum concentrations of contaminants, depending on the intended purpose of water use.

Visual inspection cannot determine if water is of appropriate quality. Simple procedures such as [[boiling]] or the use of a household [[activated carbon]] filter are not sufficient for treating all the possible contaminants that may be present in water from an unknown source. Even natural [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring water]] – considered safe for all practical purposes in the 19th century – must now be tested before determining what kind of treatment, if any, is needed. [[Analytical chemistry|Chemical]] and [[Bacteriological water analysis|microbiological analysis]], while expensive, are the only way to obtain the information necessary for deciding on the appropriate method of purification.

According to a 2007 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) report, 1.1 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] people lack access to an improved drinking water supply; 88% of the 4 billion annual cases of [[diarrhea|diarrheal disease]] are attributed to unsafe water and inadequate [[sanitation]] and hygiene, while 1.8 million people die from diarrheal disease each year. The WHO estimates that 94% of these diarrheal disease cases are preventable through modifications to the environment, including access to safe water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/combating_diseasepart1lowres.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |title=Combating Waterborne Diseases at the Household Level |at=Part 1 |year=2007|isbn=978-92-4-159522-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple techniques for treating water at home, such as chlorination, filters, and solar disinfection, and storing it in safe containers could save a huge number of lives each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/waterforlife.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=World Health Organization and [[UNICEF]] |title=Water for Life: Making it Happen |year=2005 |isbn=978-92-4-156293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing deaths from [[waterborne diseases]] is a major [[public health]] goal in developing countries.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Sources of water==
{{further|Water supply}}
#[[Groundwater]]: The water emerging from some deep ground water may have fallen as rain many tens, hundreds, or thousands of years ago. [[Soil]] and rock layers naturally filter the ground water to a high degree of clarity and often, it does not require additional treatment besides adding [[chlorine]] or [[chloramines]] as secondary disinfectants. Such water may emerge as springs, [[Artesian aquifer|artesian spring]]s, or may be extracted from boreholes or wells. Deep ground water is generally of very high [[bacteria|bacteriological]] quality (i.e., pathogenic bacteria or the pathogenic protozoa are typically absent), but the water may be rich in dissolved solids, especially [[carbonate]]s and [[sulfate]]s of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]]. Depending on the [[Stratum|strata]] through which the water has flowed, other ions may also be present including [[chloride]], and [[bicarbonate]]. There may be a requirement to reduce the [[iron]] or [[manganese]] content of this water to make it acceptable for drinking, cooking, and laundry use. Primary [[disinfection]] may also be required. Where [[groundwater recharge]] is practiced (a process in which river water is injected into an aquifer to store the water in times of plenty so that it is available in times of drought), the groundwater may require additional treatment depending on applicable state and federal regulations.
#Upland [[lake]]s and [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]]: Typically located in the headwaters of river systems, upland reservoirs are usually sited above any human habitation and may be surrounded by a protective zone to restrict the opportunities for contamination. Bacteria and pathogen levels are usually low, but some bacteria, [[protozoa]] or [[algae]] will be present. Where uplands are forested or peaty, [[humic acid]]s can colour the water. Many upland sources have low [[pH]] which require adjustment.
#[[River]]s, [[canal]]s and low land reservoirs: Low land surface waters will have a significant bacterial load and may also contain algae, suspended solids and a variety of dissolved constituents.
#[[Atmospheric water generator|Atmospheric water generation]] is a new technology that can provide high quality drinking water by extracting water from the air by cooling the air and thus condensing water vapor.
#[[Rainwater harvesting]] or [[fog collection]] which collect water from the atmosphere can be used especially in areas with significant dry seasons and in areas which experience fog even when there is little rain.
#[[Desalination]] of [[seawater]] by [[distillation]] or [[reverse osmosis]].
#[[Surface Water]]:  Freshwater bodies that are open to the atmosphere and are not designated as groundwater are termed surface waters.

==Treatment==

=== Goals ===
The goals of the treatment are to remove unwanted constituents in the water and to make it safe to drink or fit for a specific purpose in industry or medical applications. Widely varied techniques are available to remove contaminants like fine solids, micro-organisms and some dissolved inorganic and organic materials, or [[Environmental Persistent Pharmaceutical Pollutant|environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants]]. The choice of method will depend on the quality of the water being treated, the cost of the treatment process and the quality standards expected of the processed water.

The processes below are the ones commonly used in water purification plants. Some or most may not be used depending on the scale of the plant and quality of the raw (source) water.

===Pretreatment===
#Pumping and containment – The majority of water must be pumped from its source or directed into pipes or holding tanks. To avoid adding contaminants to the water, this physical infrastructure must be made from appropriate materials and constructed so that accidental contamination does not occur.
#Screening (''see also [[screen filter]]'') – The first step in purifying surface water is to remove large debris such as sticks, leaves, rubbish and other large particles which may interfere with subsequent purification steps. Most deep groundwater does not need screening before other purification steps.
#Storage – Water from rivers may also be stored in [[bankside reservoirs]] for periods between a few days and many months to allow natural biological purification to take place. This is especially important if treatment is by [[slow sand filter]]s. Storage reservoirs also provide a buffer against short periods of drought or to allow water supply to be maintained during transitory [[Water pollution|pollution]] incidents in the source river.
#Pre-chlorination – In many plants the incoming water was chlorinated to minimize the growth of fouling organisms on the pipe-work and tanks. Because of the potential adverse quality effects (see chlorine below), this has largely been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGuire|first1=Michael J.|last2=McLain|first2=Jennifer Lara|last3=Obolensky|first3=Alexa|title=Information Collection Rule Data Analysis|date=2002|publisher=AWWA Research Foundation and American Water Works Association|location=Denver|isbn=9781583212738|pages=376–378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQhSAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====pH adjustment====
Pure water has a [[pH]] close to 7 (neither [[alkaline]] nor [[acidic]]). [[Sea water]] can have  pH values that range from 7.5 to 8.4 (moderately alkaline). Fresh water can have widely ranging pH values depending on the geology of the [[drainage basin]] or [[aquifer]] and the influence of contaminant inputs ([[acid rain]]). If the water is acidic (lower than 7), [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[soda ash]], or [[sodium hydroxide]] can be added to raise the pH during water purification processes. Lime addition increases the calcium ion concentration, thus raising the water hardness. For highly acidic waters, forced draft [[Degasification|degasifiers]] can be an effective way to raise the pH, by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeration and gas stripping|url=https://ocw.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/ocw/courses/DrinkingWaterTreatment1/res00071/embedded/!4165726174696f6e20616e642047617320537472697070696e6732303037.pdf|accessdate=29 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712085937/https://ocw.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/ocw/courses/DrinkingWaterTreatment1/res00071/embedded/!4165726174696f6e20616e642047617320537472697070696e6732303037.pdf|archivedate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making the water alkaline helps [[Coagulation (water treatment)|coagulation]] and [[flocculation]] processes work effectively and also helps to minimize the risk of [[lead]] being dissolved from lead pipes and from lead [[solder]] in pipe fittings.  Sufficient alkalinity also reduces the corrosiveness of water to iron pipes. Acid ([[carbonic acid gas|carbonic acid]], [[hydrochloric acid]] or [[sulfuric acid]]) may be added to alkaline waters in some circumstances to lower the pH. Alkaline water (above pH 7.0) does not necessarily mean that lead or copper from the plumbing system will not be dissolved into the water.  The ability of water to precipitate calcium carbonate to protect metal surfaces and reduce the likelihood of toxic metals being dissolved in water is a function of pH, mineral content, temperature, alkalinity and calcium concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Knowledge|url=https://www.awwa.org/resources-tools/water-knowledge.aspx|website=American Water Works Association|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coagulation and flocculation===
{{See also|particle aggregation}}

One of the first steps in most conventional water purification processes is the addition of chemicals to assist in the removal of particles suspended in water.  Particles can be inorganic such as [[clay]] and [[silt]] or organic such as [[algae]], [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[protozoa]] and [[natural organic matter]].  Inorganic and organic particles contribute to the [[turbidity]] and color of water.

The addition of inorganic coagulants such as [[aluminum sulfate]] (or [[alum#industrial|alum]]) or iron (III) salts such as [[iron(III) chloride]] cause several simultaneous chemical and physical interactions on and among the particles.  Within seconds, negative charges on the particles are neutralized by inorganic coagulants.  Also within seconds, metal hydroxide precipitates of the iron and aluminium ions begin to form.  These precipitates combine into larger particles under natural processes such as [[Brownian motion]] and through induced mixing which is sometimes referred to as [[flocculation]].  Amorphous metal hydroxides are known as "floc". Large, amorphous aluminum and iron (III) hydroxides adsorb and enmesh particles in suspension and facilitate the removal of particles by subsequent processes of [[sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] and [[water filter|filtration]].&lt;ref name=Edzwald&gt;Edzwald, James K., ed. (2011). ''Water Quality and Treatment.'' 6th Edition. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-163011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8.2–8.3}}

Aluminum hydroxides are formed within a fairly narrow pH range, typically:  5.5 to about 7.7.  Iron (III) hydroxides can form over a larger pH range including pH levels lower than are effective for alum, typically:  5.0 to 8.5.&lt;ref name=Crittenden&gt;Crittenden, John C., et al., eds. (2005). ''Water Treatment:  Principles and Design.'' 2nd Edition. Hoboken, NJ:Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-11018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|679}}

In the literature, there is much debate and confusion over the usage of the terms coagulation and flocculation: Where does coagulation end and flocculation begin?  In water purification plants, there is usually a high energy, rapid mix unit process (detention time in seconds) whereby the coagulant chemicals are added followed by flocculation basins (detention times range from 15 to 45 minutes) where low energy inputs turn large paddles or other gentle mixing devices to enhance the formation of floc.  In fact, coagulation and flocculation processes are ongoing once the metal salt coagulants are added.&lt;ref name=Kawamura&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kawamura|first1=Susumu|title=Integrated Design and Operation of Water Treatment Facilities|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471350934|pages=74–75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cOQKKRUNGrwC|date=2000-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74–5}}

Organic polymers were developed in the 1960s as aids to coagulants and, in some cases, as replacements for the inorganic metal salt coagulants.  Synthetic organic polymers are high molecular weight compounds that carry negative, positive or neutral charges.  When organic polymers are added to water with particulates, the high molecular weight compounds adsorb onto particle surfaces and through interparticle bridging coalesce with other particles to form floc.  [[PolyDADMAC]] is a popular cationic (positively charged) organic polymer used in water purification plants.&lt;ref name=Crittenden/&gt;{{rp|667–8}}

===Sedimentation===
Waters exiting the flocculation basin may enter the [[settling basin|sedimentation basin]], also called a clarifier or settling basin. It is a large tank with low water velocities, allowing floc to settle to the bottom. The sedimentation basin is best located close to the flocculation basin so the transit between the two processes does not permit settlement or floc break up. Sedimentation basins may be rectangular, where water flows from end to end, or circular where flow is from the centre outward. Sedimentation basin outflow is typically over a weir so only a thin top layer of water—that furthest from the sludge—exits.

In 1904, [[Allen Hazen]] showed that the efficiency of a sedimentation process was a function of the particle settling velocity, the flow through the tank and the surface area of tank. Sedimentation tanks are typically designed within a range of overflow rates of 0.5 to 1.0 gallons per minute per square foot (or 1.25 to 2.5 meters per hour).  In general, sedimentation basin efficiency is not a function of detention time or depth of the basin.  Although, basin depth must be sufficient so that water currents do not disturb the sludge and settled particle interactions are promoted.  As particle concentrations in the settled water increase near the sludge surface on the bottom of the tank, settling velocities can increase due to collisions and agglomeration of particles.  Typical detention times for sedimentation vary from 1.5 to 4 hours and basin depths vary from 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 meters).&lt;ref name=Edzwald /&gt;{{rp|9.39–9.40}}&lt;ref name=Crittenden/&gt;{{rp|790–1}}&lt;ref name=Kawamura/&gt;{{rp|140–2, 171}}

Inclined flat plates or tubes can be added to traditional sedimentation basins to improve particle removal performance.  Inclined plates and tubes drastically increase the surface area available for particles to be removed in concert with Hazen's original theory.  The amount of ground surface area occupied by a sedimentation basin with inclined plates or tubes can be far smaller than a conventional sedimentation basin.

====Sludge storage and removal====

As particles settle to the bottom of a sedimentation basin, a layer of [[sludge]] is formed on the floor of the tank which must be removed and treated. The amount of sludge generated is significant, often 3 to 5 percent of the total volume of water to be treated. The cost of treating and disposing of the sludge can impact the operating cost of a water treatment plant. The sedimentation basin may be equipped with mechanical cleaning devices that continually clean its bottom,  or the basin can be periodically taken out of service and cleaned manually.

====Floc blanket clarifiers====

A subcategory of sedimentation is the removal of particulates by entrapment in a layer of suspended floc as the water is forced upward.  The major advantage of floc blanket clarifiers is that they occupy a smaller footprint than conventional sedimentation.  Disadvantages are that particle removal efficiency can be highly variable depending on changes in influent water quality and influent water flow rate.&lt;ref name=Crittenden/&gt;{{rp|835–6}}

===Dissolved air flotation===
When particles to be removed do not settle out of solution easily, dissolved air flotation (DAF) is often used.   After coagulation and flocculation processes, water flows to DAF tanks where air diffusers on the tank bottom create fine bubbles that attach to floc resulting in a floating mass of concentrated floc.  The floating floc blanket is removed from the surface and clarified water is withdrawn from the bottom of the DAF tank.
Water supplies that are particularly vulnerable to unicellular algae blooms and supplies with low turbidity and high colour often employ DAF.
&lt;ref name=Edzwald /&gt;{{rp|9.46}}

===Filtration===
After separating most floc, the water is filtered as the final step to remove remaining suspended particles and unsettled floc.

====Rapid sand filters====
[[File:Rapid sand filter EPA.jpg|thumb|right|Cutaway view of a typical rapid sand filter]]
The most common type of filter is a [[rapid sand filter]]. Water moves vertically through sand which often has a layer of [[activated carbon]] or [[anthracite coal]] above the sand. The top layer removes organic compounds, which contribute to taste and odour. The space between sand particles is larger than the smallest suspended particles, so simple filtration is not enough. Most particles pass through surface layers but are trapped in pore spaces or adhere to sand particles. Effective filtration extends into the depth of the filter. This property of the filter is key to its operation: if the top layer of sand were to block all the particles, the filter would quickly clog.&lt;ref name="EPA1990"&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(1990). Cincinnati, OH. [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=300048WU.txt "Technologies for Upgrading Existing or Designing New Drinking Water Treatment Facilities."] Document no. EPA/625/4-89/023.&lt;/ref&gt;

To clean the filter, water is passed quickly upward through the filter, opposite the normal direction (called ''backflushing'' or ''[[Backwashing (water treatment)|backwashing]]'') to remove embedded or unwanted particles. Prior to this step, compressed air may be blown up through the bottom of the filter to break up the compacted filter media to aid the backwashing process; this is known as ''air scouring''. This contaminated water can be disposed of, along with the sludge from the sedimentation basin, or it can be recycled by mixing with the raw water entering the plant although this is often considered poor practice since it re-introduces an elevated concentration of bacteria into the raw water.

Some water treatment plants employ pressure filters. These work on the same principle as rapid gravity filters, differing in that the filter medium is enclosed in a steel vessel and the water is forced through it under pressure.

Advantages:

* Filters out much smaller particles than paper and sand filters can.
* Filters out virtually all particles larger than their specified pore sizes.
* They are quite thin and so liquids flow through them fairly rapidly.
* They are reasonably strong and so can withstand pressure differences across them of typically 2–5 atmospheres.
* They can be cleaned (back flushed) and reused.

====Slow sand filters====
[[File:Vsakovací nádrže umělé infiltrace v ÚV Káraný.jpg|thumb|Slow "artificial" filtration (a variation of [[bank filtration]]) to the ground, Water purification plant Káraný, Czech Republic]]
[[File:Slow sand filter profile.jpg|thumb|A profile of layers of gravel, sand and fine sand used in a slow sand filter plant.]]

[[Slow sand filter]]s may be used where there is sufficient land and space, as the water must be passed very slowly through the filters. These filters rely on biological treatment processes for their action rather than physical filtration. The filters are carefully constructed using graded layers of sand, with the coarsest sand, along with some gravel, at the bottom and finest sand at the top. Drains at the base convey treated water away for disinfection. Filtration depends on the development of a thin biological layer, called the zoogleal layer or [[Schmutzdecke]], on the surface of the filter. An effective slow sand filter may remain in service for many weeks or even months if the pretreatment is well designed and produces water with a very low available nutrient level which physical methods of treatment rarely achieve. Very low nutrient levels allow water to be safely sent through distribution systems with very low disinfectant levels, thereby reducing consumer irritation over offensive levels of chlorine and chlorine by-products. Slow sand filters are not backwashed; they are maintained by having the top layer of sand scraped off when flow is eventually obstructed by biological growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nair|first=Abhilash T.|last2=Ahammed|first2=M. Mansoor|last3=Davra|first3=Komal|date=2014-08-01|title=Influence of operating parameters on the performance of a household slow sand filter|journal=Water Science and Technology: Water Supply|volume=14|issue=4|pages=643–649|doi=10.2166/ws.2014.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific "large-scale" form of slow sand filter is the process of [[bank filtration]], in which natural sediments in a riverbank are used to provide a first stage of contaminant filtration. While typically not clean enough to be used directly for drinking water, the water gained from the associated extraction wells is much less problematic than river water taken directly from the major streams where bank filtration is often used.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Membrane filtration===
[[Membrane technology|Membrane filters]] are widely used for filtering both drinking water and [[sewage]]. For drinking water, membrane filters can remove virtually all particles larger than 0.2&amp;nbsp;μm—including ''[[giardia]]'' and ''[[cryptosporidium]].'' Membrane filters are an effective form of tertiary treatment when it is desired to reuse the water for industry, for limited domestic purposes, or before discharging the water into a river that is used by towns further downstream. They are widely used in industry, particularly for beverage preparation (including [[bottled water]]). However no filtration can remove substances that are actually dissolved in the water such as [[phosphates]], [[nitrate]]s and [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] ions.

===Removal of ions and other dissolved substances===
[[Ultrafiltration]] [[artificial membrane|membranes]] use polymer membranes with chemically formed microscopic pores that can be used to filter out dissolved substances avoiding the use of coagulants. The type of membrane media determines how much pressure is needed to drive the water through and what sizes of micro-organisms can be filtered out.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[Ion exchange]]:&lt;ref name="Zagorodni"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zagorodni, Andrei A. |title=Ion exchange materials: properties and applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfDFKl3I74MC|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-044552-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ion exchange systems use [[ion exchange resin]]- or [[zeolite]]-packed columns to replace unwanted ions. The most common case is [[water softening]] consisting of removal of [[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[ion]]s replacing them with benign (soap friendly) [[sodium|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] or [[potassium|K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ions. Ion exchange resins are also used to remove toxic ions such as [[nitrite]], [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]] and many others.

[[Lime softening|Precipitative softening]]:&lt;ref name=Edzwald /&gt;{{rp|13.12–13.58}}  Water rich in [[hard water|hardness]] ([[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] ions) is treated with lime ([[calcium oxide]]) and/or soda-ash ([[sodium carbonate]]) to precipitate [[calcium carbonate]] out of solution utilizing the [[common-ion effect]].

[[Electrodeionization]]:&lt;ref name="Zagorodni"/&gt; Water is passed between a positive [[electrode]] and a negative electrode. Ion exchange [[Membrane (selective barrier)|membranes]] allow only positive ions to migrate from the treated water toward the negative electrode and only negative ions toward the positive electrode. High purity deionized water is produced continuously, similar to ion exchange treatment. Complete removal of ions from water is possible if the right conditions are met. The water is normally pre-treated with a [[reverse osmosis]] unit to remove non-ionic [[organic contaminants]], and with gas transfer membranes to remove [[carbon dioxide]]. A water recovery of 99% is possible if the concentrate stream is fed to the RO inlet.

===Disinfection===
[[File:Chemical pumps at water purification plant.JPG|thumb|Pumps used to add required amount of chemicals to the clear water at the water purification plant before the distribution. From left to right: sodium hypochlorite for disinfection, zinc orthophosphate as a corrosion inhibitor, sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment, and fluoride for tooth decay prevention.]]

Disinfection is accomplished both by filtering out harmful micro-organisms and also by adding disinfectant chemicals. Water is disinfected to kill any [[pathogens]] which pass through the filters and to  provide a residual dose of disinfectant to kill or inactivate potentially harmful micro-organisms in the storage and distribution systems.  Possible pathogens include [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], including  ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Cholera]]'',  ''[[Campylobacter]]'' and ''[[Shigella]]'', and [[protozoa]], including ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' and other ''[[cryptosporidia]]''.  Following the introduction of any chemical disinfecting agent, the water is usually held in temporary storage – often called a contact tank or [[clear well]] to allow the disinfecting action to complete.

====Chlorine disinfection====
{{Main|Water chlorination}}
The most common disinfection method involves some form of [[chlorine]] or its compounds such as [[chloramine]] or [[chlorine dioxide]]. Chlorine is a strong [[oxidizer|oxidant]] that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms. Because chlorine is a toxic gas, there is a danger of a release associated with its use. This problem is avoided by the use of [[sodium hypochlorite]], which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in household bleach that releases free chlorine when dissolved in water. Chlorine solutions can be generated on site by electrolyzing common salt solutions. A solid form, [[calcium hypochlorite]], releases chlorine on contact with water. Handling the solid, however, requires greater routine human contact through opening bags and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach which are more easily automated. The generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is both inexpensive and safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine. Chlorine levels up to 4 milligrams per liter (4 parts per million) are considered safe in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/chlorine-disinfection.html|publisher=CDC|accessdate=11 February 2018|title=Disinfection with Chlorine &amp;#124; Public Water Systems &amp;#124; Drinking Water &amp;#124; Healthy Water }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All forms of chlorine are widely used, despite their respective drawbacks. One drawback is that chlorine from any source reacts with natural organic compounds in the water to form potentially harmful chemical by-products. These by-products, [[trihalomethane]]s (THMs) and [[haloacetic acid]]s (HAAs), are both [[carcinogenic]] in large quantities and are regulated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[Drinking Water Inspectorate]] in the UK. The formation of THMs and haloacetic acids may be minimized by effective removal of as many organics from the water as possible prior to chlorine addition. Although chlorine is effective in killing bacteria, it has limited effectiveness against pathogenic protozoa that form cysts in water such as ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' and ''[[Cryptosporidium]]''.

====Chlorine dioxide disinfection====
[[Chlorine dioxide]] is a faster-acting disinfectant than elemental chlorine. It is relatively rarely used, because in some circumstances it may create excessive amounts of [[chlorite]], which is a by-product regulated to low allowable levels in the United States. Chlorine dioxide can be supplied as an aqueous solution and added to water to avoid gas handling problems; chlorine dioxide gas accumulations may spontaneously detonate.

====Chloramine disinfection====
The use of chloramine is becoming more common as a disinfectant. Although chloramine is not as strong an oxidant, it does provide a longer-lasting residual than free chlorine and it will not readily form THMs or haloacetic acids. It is possible to convert chlorine to chloramine by adding [[ammonia]] to the water after addition of chlorine. The chlorine and ammonia react to form chloramine. Water distribution systems disinfected with chloramines may experience [[nitrification]], as ammonia is a nutrient for bacterial growth, with nitrates being generated as a by-product.

====Ozone disinfection====
[[Ozone]] is an unstable molecule which readily gives up one atom of oxygen providing a powerful oxidizing agent which is toxic to most waterborne organisms. It is a very strong, broad spectrum disinfectant that is widely used in Europe. It is an effective method to inactivate harmful protozoa that form cysts. It also works well against almost all other pathogens. Ozone is made by passing oxygen through ultraviolet light or a "cold" electrical discharge. To use ozone as a disinfectant, it must be created on-site and added to the water by bubble contact. Some of the advantages of ozone include the production of fewer dangerous by-products and the absence of taste and odour problems (in comparison to [[Water chlorination|chlorination]]). Another advantage of ozone is that it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water. Ozone has been used in drinking water plants since 1906 where the first industrial ozonation plant was built in [[Nice]], France. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] has accepted ozone as being safe; and it is applied as an anti-microbiological agent for the treatment, storage, and processing of foods. However, although fewer by-products are formed by ozonation, it has been discovered that ozone reacts with bromide ions in water to produce concentrations of the suspected carcinogen [[bromate]].  Bromide can be found in fresh water supplies in sufficient concentrations to produce (after ozonation) more than 10 parts per billion (ppb) of bromate — the maximum contaminant level established by the USEPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Neemann, Jeff |author2=Hulsey, Robert |author3=Rexing, David |author4=Wert, Eric |year=2004|title=Controlling Bromate Formation During Ozonation with Chlorine and Ammonia|journal=Journal American Water Works Association|volume= 96|issue=2 |pages=26–29|doi=10.1002/j.1551-8833.2004.tb10542.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ultraviolet disinfection====
{{main|Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation}}[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|Ultraviolet light]] (UV) is very effective at inactivating cysts, in low turbidity water. UV light's disinfection effectiveness decreases as turbidity increases, a result of the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[scattering]], and shadowing caused by the suspended solids. The main disadvantage to the use of UV radiation is that, like ozone treatment, it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water; therefore, it is sometimes necessary to add a residual disinfectant after the primary disinfection process. This is often done through the addition of chloramines, discussed above as a primary disinfectant. When used in this manner, chloramines provide an effective residual disinfectant with very few of the negative effects of chlorination.

===Portable water purification===
{{main|Portable water purification}}
Potable water purification devices and methods are available for disinfection and treatment in emergencies or in remote locations. Disinfection is the primary goal, since aesthetic considerations such as taste, odour, appearance, and trace chemical contamination do not affect the short-term safety of drinking water.

===Additional treatment options===
#[[Water fluoridation]]: in many areas [[fluoride]] is added to water with the goal of preventing [[tooth decay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Recommendations for using fluoride to prevent and control dental decay caries in the United States |author= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |journal= MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=50 |issue=RR-14 |pages=1–42 |year=2001 |pmid=11521913 |url=http://cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm |laysummary=http://cdc.gov/fluoridation/guidelines/tooth_decay.htm |laysource=CDC |laydate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluoride is usually added after the disinfection process.

#Water conditioning: This is a method of reducing the effects of hard water. In water systems subject to heating hardness salts can be deposited as the decomposition of bicarbonate ions creates carbonate ions that precipitate out of  solution. Water with high concentrations of hardness salts can be treated with soda ash (sodium carbonate) which precipitates out the excess salts, through the [[common-ion effect]], producing calcium carbonate of very high purity. The precipitated calcium carbonate is traditionally sold to the manufacturers of [[toothpaste]]. Several other methods of industrial and residential water treatment are claimed (without general scientific acceptance) to include the use of magnetic and/or electrical fields reducing the effects of hard water.&lt;ref&gt;Penn State Extension [http://extension.psu.edu/natural-resources/water/drinking-water/water-testing/water-treatment/magnetic-water-treatment-devices "Magnetic Water Treatment Devices"] Accessed 15.08.2017&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Plumbosolvency]] reduction: In areas with naturally acidic waters of low conductivity (i.e. surface rainfall in upland mountains of [[igneous]] rocks), the water may be capable of dissolving [[lead]] from any lead pipes that it is carried in. The addition of small quantities of [[phosphate]] ion and increasing the [[pH]] slightly both assist in greatly reducing plumbo-solvency by creating insoluble lead salts on the inner surfaces of the pipes.
#Radium Removal: Some groundwater sources contain [[radium]], a radioactive chemical element. Typical sources include many groundwater sources north of the [[Illinois River]] in [[Illinois]]. Radium can be removed by ion exchange, or by water conditioning. The back flush or sludge that is produced is, however, a low-level [[radioactive waste]].
#Fluoride Removal: Although fluoride is added to water in many areas, some areas of the world have excessive levels of natural fluoride in the source water. Excessive levels can be [[Fluoride toxicity|toxic]] or cause undesirable cosmetic effects such as staining of teeth. Methods of reducing fluoride levels is through treatment with [[activated alumina]] and [[bone char]] filter media.

==Other water purification techniques==
Other popular methods for purifying water, especially for local private supplies are listed below. In some countries some of these methods are also used for large scale municipal supplies. Particularly important are distillation (de-salination of seawater) and reverse osmosis.

# [[Boiled Water|Boiling]]: Bringing water to its [[boiling point]] (about 100&amp;nbsp;°C or 212 F at sea level), is the oldest and most effective way since it eliminates most [[microbes]] causing [[intestine]] related diseases,&lt;ref name=Oxfordjournals&gt;{{cite journal|title=Water Disinfection for International and Wilderness Travelers|author=Backer, Howard |pages=355–364|doi=10.1086/324747|year=2002| journal=Clin Infect Dis |volume= 34 |issue=3 |pmid=11774083}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it cannot remove [[toxins|chemical toxins]] or impurities.&lt;ref name="backpackers field manual"&gt;Curtis, Rick (1998) [http://www.princeton.edu/~oa/manual/water.shtml OA Guide to Water Purification, The Backpacker's Field Manual], Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; For human health, complete [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] of water is not required, since the heat resistant microbes are not intestine affecting.&lt;ref name="Oxfordjournals"/&gt; The traditional advice of boiling water for ten minutes is mainly for additional safety, since microbes start getting eliminated at temperatures greater than {{convert|60|°C}}. Though the [[Atmospheric pressure boiling point|boiling point decreases]] with increasing altitude, it is not enough to affect the disinfecting process.&lt;ref name="Oxfordjournals"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it true that you can't make a decent cup of tea up a mountain?|url=http://www.physics.org/facts/air-tea.asp|publisher=physics.org| accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where the water is "hard" (that is, containing significant dissolved calcium salts), boiling decomposes the [[bicarbonate]] ions, resulting in partial precipitation as [[calcium carbonate]]. This is the "fur" that builds up on kettle elements, etc., in hard water areas. With the exception of calcium, boiling does not remove solutes of higher boiling point than water and in fact increases their concentration (due to some water being lost as vapour). Boiling does not leave a residual disinfectant in the water. Therefore, water that is boiled and then stored for any length of time may acquire new pathogens.
# Granular Activated Carbon adsorption: a form of [[activated carbon]] with a high surface area, adsorbs many compounds including many toxic compounds. Water passing through [[activated carbon]] is commonly used in municipal regions with organic contamination, taste or odors. Many household water filters and fish tanks use activated carbon filters to further purify the water. Household filters for drinking water sometimes contain [[silver]] as metallic [[silver nanoparticle]]. If water is held in the carbon block for longer periods, microorganisms can grow inside which results in fouling and contamination. Silver nanoparticles are excellent anti-bacterial material and they can decompose toxic halo-organic compounds such as pesticides into non-toxic organic products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Savage|first=Nora|author2=Mamadou S.

#[[Distillation]] involves boiling the water to produce water [[vapour]]. The vapour contacts a cool surface where it condenses as a liquid. Because the solutes are not normally vaporised, they remain in the boiling solution. Even distillation does not completely purify water, because of contaminants with similar boiling points and droplets of unvapourised liquid carried with the steam. However, 99.9% pure water can be obtained by distillation.
#[[Reverse osmosis]]: Mechanical pressure is applied to an impure solution to force pure water through a [[semi-permeable membrane]]. Reverse osmosis is theoretically the most thorough method of large scale water purification available, although perfect semi-permeable membranes are difficult to create. Unless membranes are well-maintained, [[algae]] and other life forms can colonize the membranes.

# Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). Applicable to desalination. Heated seawater is passed along the surface of a [[hydrophobic]] [[polymer]] membrane. Evaporated water passes from the hot side through pores in the membrane into a stream of cold pure water on the other side. The difference in vapour pressure between the hot and cold side helps to push water molecules through.
#[[Desalination]] –  is a process by which saline water (generally sea water) is converted to fresh water. The most common desalination processes are distillation and reverse osmosis. Desalination is currently expensive compared to most alternative sources of water, and only a very small fraction of total human use is satisfied by desalination. It is only economically practical for high-valued uses (such as household and industrial uses) in arid areas.  
# Gas hydrate crystals centrifuge method.

Many municipalities have moved from free chlorine to chloramine as a disinfection agent. However, chloramine appears to be a corrosive agent in some water systems. Chloramine can dissolve the "protective" film inside older service lines, leading to the leaching of lead into residential spigots. This can result in harmful exposure, including elevated [[blood lead levels]]. Lead is a known [[neurotoxin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Demineralized water===
Distillation removes all minerals from water, and the membrane methods of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most to all minerals. This results in demineralized water which is not considered ideal [[drinking water]]. The World Health Organization has investigated the health effects of demineralized water since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutdemineralized.pdf Health risks from drinking demineralised water]. (PDF) . Rolling revision of the WHO Guidelines for
drinking-water quality. World Health Organization, Geneva, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased [[Fluid balance|diuresis]] and the elimination of [[electrolyte]]s, with decreased [[blood serum]] [[potassium]] concentration. [[Magnesium]], [[calcium]], and other minerals in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Demineralized water may also increase the risk from toxic metals because it more readily leaches materials from piping like lead and cadmium, which is prevented by dissolved minerals such as calcium and magnesium. Low-mineral water has been implicated in specific cases of lead poisoning in infants, when lead from pipes leached at especially high rates into the water. Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10&amp;nbsp;[[milligram|mg]]/[[liter|L]] with 20–30&amp;nbsp;mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20&amp;nbsp;mg/L minimum and a 40–80&amp;nbsp;mg/L optimum, and a total [[water hardness]] (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2 to 4&amp;nbsp;[[millimole|mmol]]/L. At water hardness above 5&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, higher incidence of gallstones, kidney stones, urinary stones, arthrosis, and arthropathies have been observed.&lt;ref name=Demineralized2004&gt;Kozisek F.

WHO.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, desalination processes can increase the risk of bacterial contamination.&lt;ref name=Demineralized2004/&gt;

Manufacturers of home water distillers claim the opposite—that minerals in water are the cause of many diseases, and that most beneficial minerals come from food, not water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalsolutions1.com/ecodist2.htm Water Distillers – Water Distillation – Myths, Facts, etc].

==History==
{{Further|History of water supply and sanitation}}
[[File:Jakob Ziegler 1799 Bemerkungen über gemeines Wasser detail.jpg | thumb|Drawing of an apparatus for studying the chemical analysis of mineral waters in a book from 1799.]]
The first experiments into water filtration were made in the 17th century. Sir [[Francis Bacon]] attempted to [[desalination|desalinate]] sea water by passing the flow through a [[sand filter]]. Although his experiment did not succeed, it marked the beginning of a new interest in the field. The fathers of [[microscopy]], [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] and [[Robert Hooke]], used the newly invented [[microscope]] to observe for the first time small material particles that lay suspended in the water, laying the groundwork for the future understanding of waterborne pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofwaterfilters.com/microscope-in-water.html|title=The Use of the Microscope in Water Filter History|work=History of Water Filters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sand filter===
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|Original map by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of [[cholera]] cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|London epidemic of 1854]].]]
The first documented use of [[sand filter]]s to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in [[Paisley, Scotland]], John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssf2.pdf|title=Filtration of water supplies|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was refined in the following two decades by engineers working for private water companies, and it culminated in the first treated public water supply in the world, installed by engineer [[James Simpson (engineer)|James Simpson]] for the [[Chelsea Waterworks Company]] in London in 1829.&lt;ref name="History of the Chelsea Waterworks"&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/chelsea_waterworks_a2.html History of the Chelsea Waterworks]. ucla.edu&lt;/ref&gt; This installation provided filtered water for every resident of the area, and the network design was widely copied throughout the [[United Kingdom]] in the ensuing decades.

The practice of water treatment soon became mainstream and common, and the virtues of the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] during the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Snow was sceptical of the then-dominant [[miasma theory]] that stated that diseases were caused by noxious "bad airs". Although the [[germ theory of disease]] had not yet been developed, Snow's observations led him to discount the prevailing theory. His 1855 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'' conclusively demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic in [[Soho]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gunn, S. William A.  |author2=Masellis, Michele  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Concepts and Practice of Humanitarian Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87|date=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-72264-1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bazin, Hervé |title=L'histoire des vaccinations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSHXLkgFBBQC&amp;pg=PA290|year=2008|publisher=John Libbey Eurotext|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the use of a [[dot distribution map]] and statistical proof to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. His data convinced the local council to disable the water pump, which promptly ended the outbreak.

The [[Metropolis Water Act 1852|Metropolis Water Act]] introduced the regulation of the [[water supply]] companies in [[London]], including minimum standards of water quality for the first time. The Act "made provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water", and required that all water be "effectually filtered" from 31 December 1855.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to make better Provision respecting the Supply of Water to the Metropolis'', (15 &amp; 16 Vict. C.84)&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up with legislation for the mandatory inspection of water quality, including comprehensive chemical analyses, in 1858. This legislation set a worldwide precedent for similar state public health interventions across [[Europe]]. The [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] was formed at the same time, water filtration was adopted throughout the country, and new water intakes on the [[Thames]] were established above [[Teddington Lock]]. Automatic pressure filters, where the water is forced under pressure through the filtration system, were innovated in 1899 in England.&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt;

===Water chlorination===
[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] was the first to successfully use [[chlorine]] to [[water chlorination|disinfect the water supply]] in [[Soho]] that had helped spread the cholera outbreak. William Soper also used chlorinated lime to treat the sewage produced by [[typhoid]] patients in 1879.

In a paper published in 1894, [[Moritz Traube]] formally proposed the addition of chloride of lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) to water to render it "germ-free."  Two other investigators confirmed Traube's findings and published their papers in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Turneaure, F.E. |author2=H.L. Russell  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1901 | title = Public Water-Supplies:  Requirements, Resources, and the Construction of Works | edition = 1st | location = New York | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | page = 493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts at implementing water chlorination at a water treatment plant were made in 1893 in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] and in 1897 the city of [[Maidstone]] [[England]] was the first to have its entire water supply treated with chlorine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Typhoid Epidemic at Maidstone|date=October 1897|journal=Journal of the Sanitary Institute|volume=18|pages=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent water chlorination began in 1905, when a faulty [[slow sand filter]] and a contaminated water supply led to a serious typhoid fever epidemic in [[Lincoln, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2008/08/25/9150211/chlorine-cleans-water-for-millions-but-comes-under-attack-after-health.html|title=A miracle for public health?|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stem the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride of lime to the water being treated. The chlorination of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution, the chlorination was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Reece, R.J. (1907). "Report on the Epidemic of Enteric Fever in the City of Lincoln, 1904-5." In Thirty-Fifth Annual Report of the Local Government Board, 1905-6:  Supplement Containing the Report of the Medical Officer for 1905-6. London:Local Government Board.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manual Control Chlorinator.jpg|thumb|Manual-control chlorinator for the liquefaction of chlorine for water purification, early 20th century. From ''Chlorination of Water'' by Joseph Race, 1918.]]
The first continuous use of chlorine in the [[United States]] for disinfection took place in 1908 at Boonton Reservoir (on the [[Rockaway River]]), which served as the supply for [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Leal, John L. (1909). "The Sterilization Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company at Boonton, N.J." ''Proceedings'' American Water Works Association. pp. 100–9.&lt;/ref&gt;   Chlorination was achieved by controlled additions of dilute solutions of chloride of lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) at doses of 0.2 to 0.35 ppm.  The treatment process was conceived by Dr. John L. Leal and the chlorination plant was designed by [[George W. Fuller|George Warren Fuller.]]&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, George W. (1909). "Description of the Process and Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company for the Sterilization of the Water of the Boonton Reservoir." ''Proceedings'' AWWA. pp. 110–34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next few years, chlorine disinfection using chloride of lime were rapidly installed in drinking water systems around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, Allen. (1916). ''Clean Water and How to Get It.'' New York:Wiley. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the [[Indian Medical Service]], Vincent B. Nesfield, in 1903. According to his own account: {{quote|It occurred to me that chlorine gas might be found satisfactory ... if suitable means could be found for using it.... The next important question was how to render the gas portable. This might be accomplished in two ways: By liquefying it, and storing it in lead-lined iron vessels, having a jet with a very fine capillary canal, and fitted with a tap or a screw cap. The tap is turned on, and the cylinder placed in the amount of water required. The chlorine bubbles out, and in ten to fifteen minutes the water is absolutely safe. This method would be of use on a large scale, as for service water carts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Nesfield, V. B. |title=A Chemical Method of Sterilizing Water Without Affecting its Potability|url=http://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506%2802%2980142-1/abstract|journal=Public Health|volume=15|year=1902|pages=601–3|doi=10.1016/s0033-3506(02)80142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

U.S. Army Major [[Carl Rogers Darnall]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[Army Medical School]], gave the first practical demonstration of this in 1910. Shortly thereafter, Major William J. L. Lyster of the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Army Medical Department]] used a solution of [[calcium hypochlorite]] in a linen bag to treat water. For many decades, Lyster's method remained the standard for U.S. ground forces in the field and in camps, implemented in the form of the familiar Lyster Bag (also spelled Lister Bag). This work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water ''purification''.

'''Wireless Engineering''' is the branch of [[engineering]] which addresses the design, application, and research of wireless communication systems and technologies.

==Overview==
Wireless engineering is an engineering subject dealing with engineering problems using wireless technology such as radio communications and radar, but it is more general than the conventional radio engineering. It may include using other techniques such as acoustic, infrared, and optical technologies.

==History==
Wireless technologies have skyrocketed since their late 19th Century advancements. With the invention of the [[FM Radio]] in 1935, wireless communications have become a concentrated focus of both private and government sectors.

===In Education===
[[Auburn University]]'s Samuel Ginn College of Engineering was the first in the [[United States]] to offer a formalized undergraduate degree in such a field. The program was initiated by Samuel Ginn, an Auburn Alumni, in 2001.&lt;ref name="Auburn University"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macquarie University]] in [[Sydney]], was the first University to offer Wireless Engineering in [[Australia]]. The university works closely with nearby industries in research and teaching development in wireless engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.research.mq.edu.au/excellence/wireless_communications,&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka]] in [[Malacca]], was the first University to offer Wireless Communication Engineering in [[Malaysia]].

==Applications==
Wireless engineering contains a wide spectrum of application, most notably [[cellular networks]]. The recent popularity of cellular networks has created a vast career demand with a large repository. The popularity has also sparked many wireless innovations, such as increased network capacity, [[3G]], cryptology and network security technologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6773">'''Zoosadism''' is [[pleasure]] derived from [[cruelty to animals]]. It is part of the [[Macdonald triad]], a set of three behaviors that are considered a precursor to [[Psychopathy|psychopathic behavior]].&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. M. MacDonald|title=The Threat to Kill|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=120|issue=2|pages=125–130|year=1963|doi=10.1176/ajp.120.2.125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Some studies have suggested that individuals who are [[cruel to animals]] are more likely to be violent to humans. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'':

{{cquote|The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has found that a history of cruelty to animals is one of the traits that regularly appear in its computer records of [[Serial rape|serial rapists]] and [[Serial killer|murderers]], and the standard diagnostic and treatment manual for psychiatric and emotional disorders lists cruelty to animals as a diagnostic criterion for [[conduct disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Goleman | first = Daniel | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Child's Love of Cruelty May Hint at the Future Killer | newspaper = New York Times | pages = | year = | date = 7 August 1991 | url = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Helen Gavin wrote however in ''Criminological and Forensic Psychology'' (2013):

{{cquote|This is not a universal trait, though. [[Dennis Nilsen]] had difficulty initiating social contact with people, but loved his faithful companion, Bleep, a mongrel bitch. After his arrest, he was very concerned for her welfare, as she was taken to the police station too.&lt;ref name="Helen Gavin 2013 120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Gavin|title=Criminological and Forensic Psychology|pages=120|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alan R. Felthous reported in his paper "Aggression Against Cats, Dogs, and People" (1980):

{{cquote|A survey of psychiatric patients who had repeatedly tortured dogs and cats found all of them had high levels of aggression toward people as well, including one patient who had murdered a boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Felthous | first = Alan R. | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Aggression Against Cats, Dogs, and People | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = 10 | pages = 169–177 | date = | year = 1980 | url = | doi = 10.1007/bf01433629| id = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is a commonly reported finding, and for this reason, [[cruelty to animals]] is often considered a warning sign of potential violence towards humans.

==Legal status==
In the [[United States]], since 2010, it has been a federal offense to create or distribute "obscene" depictions of "living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians ... subjected to serious bodily injury".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruthann Robson|Robson, Ruthann]] (2010-12-14) [http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2010/12/animal-porn-criminalized-by-federal-law-again.html Animal Porn - Criminalized by Federal Law Again] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415045939/http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2010/12/animal-porn-criminalized-by-federal-law-again.html |date=2011-04-15 }}, ''Constitutional Law Prof Blog''&lt;/ref&gt; This statute replaced an overly broad 1999 statute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/48.html|title=18 U.S. Code § 48 - Animal crush videos|author=|date=|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121143325/http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/48.html|archivedate=21 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was found unconstitutional in ''[[United States v. Stevens]]''.

==Criticism of alleged link to violence against humans==
Critics of the concept of a propensity for cruelty to humans cite the fact that animals can be cruel to some animals yet caring to other animals, combined with [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s studies using metronomes at different rates to test conditioned learning showing that humans can discriminate in fine ways that animals cannot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Catania, A.C.|year=1994|title=Query: Did Pavlov's research ring a bell?|journal=Psycoloquy Newsletter, June 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conclude that there is no such general basis. The exact way these critics explain studies that seems to show links varies, but most of them state that psychiatric and criminological studies are subject to [[institutional bias]] and [[self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]].&lt;ref&gt;Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill, 2002 RobertWhitaker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Unpredictable Species: What Makes Humans Unique by Lieberman, P 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is also pointed out that [[correlation does not prove causation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTfNH3cScKAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QKcllSdfAA&amp;sig=826Am1ASKt9YyAHmMsyIsm_2ZS0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwial8TV5ZHYAhUUWmMKHeCCBncQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;f=false|title=The Case for Animal Experimentation: An Evolutionary and Ethical Perspective|first=Michael Allen|last=Fox|date=23 April 1986|publisher=University of California Press|accessdate=23 April 2018|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605032616/https://books.google.com/books?id=yTfNH3cScKAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QKcllSdfAA&amp;sig=826Am1ASKt9YyAHmMsyIsm_2ZS0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwial8TV5ZHYAhUUWmMKHeCCBncQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;f=false|archivedate=5 June 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Piers Beirne]], a professor of [[criminology]] at the [[University of Southern Maine]], has criticized existing studies for ignoring socially accepted practices of violence against animals, such as [[animal slaughter]] and [[vivisection]], that might be linked to violence against humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=criminology |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021521/http://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=criminology |archivedate=2017-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
