[[File:Kvindernes Udstilling 1895.gif|thumb|Sketch of the Women's Exhibition from ''Illustreret Tidende'']]
The '''Women's Exhibition from the Past and Present''' ({{lang-da|'''Kvindernes Udstilling fra Fortid og Nutid'''}}) held in [[Copenhagen]] in 1895 was an art and culture exhibition for women from the [[Nordic countries]]. Inspired by the [[1893 Chicago's World's Fair|1893 World's Fair]] in [[Chicago]], it was designed to demonstrate how far Nordic women had advanced in the areas of education, employment and art. The first of its kind in Europe, it was considered a great success.&lt;ref name=eg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmagad.dk/udstillinger/1895-kvindernes-udstilling-iii.html|title=Kvindernes Udstilling 1895|author=Hald, Tonny|publisher=Emma Gad|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/170/bio/1294/%20-/|title=Emma Gad (1852 - 1921)|author=Ludvigsen, Christian|publisher=Kvinfo|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Kvindeudstillingens-gamle-og-nye-koekken.jpg|thumb|Old and new kitchen exhibit]]
The Chicago World's Fair in 1893 had impressed Danish visitors with its [[The Woman's Building (Chicago)|Woman's Building]] containing presentations of art and literature. [[Sophie Oxholm]] (1848–1935), who had visited the exhibition, was obviously impressed by the exhibition, especially the show of Danish needlework. On her return to Denmark, she immediately brought a number of influential women together with a view to arranging a Nordic women's exhibition in Copenhagen the following year. Despite initial enthusiasm, as a result of budgetary and management problems, it was announced in February 1894 that the exhibition would not be held until 1895.&lt;ref name=eg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmagad.dk/eg-omtale/omtale/2004-eva-lous.html|title=Eva Lous: Kvindernes Udstilling 1895|publisher=Emma Gad|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxholm, who experienced difficulty in managing the arrangements, gave up her position as head of the coordinating committee in early 1895. She was replaced by Bertha Buch of the [[Danish Women's Society|Women's Society]] but it was [[Emma Gad]] (1852–1921) who proved to be the most effective member. Appointed deputy chair, Gad managed to complete all the arrangements on time. These included selecting the site of the exhibition which was ultimately shared between the Industrial Association building (''Industriforeningen''), which had been built in connection with the 1872 Nordic Exhibition, and the premises of [[Den Frie Udstilling]]. It was therefore possible for the exhibition to open on 22 June 1895 in the presence of [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise]].&lt;ref name=eg/&gt;

==Exhibition==
[[File:Den-groenlandske-Afdeling-paa-Kvindeudstillingen enhanced.jpg|thumb|The Greenland exhibit]]
In addition to exhibits from Denmark, the exhibition contained areas specifically dedicated to the Danish provinces and overseas territories ([[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Danish West Indies]]) as well as to Norway and Sweden. There are records of the 2,415 exhibits covering painting, curiosities (including items associated with celebrated women), arts and crafts, costumes, jewellery (including gold- and silverware), literature (manuscripts, journals and books) and appliances. There were also separate listings of exhibits relating to housekeeping, philanthropy, hygiene, education, household crafts (spinning and weaving, leather, wood, embroidery, silk painting, and [[whitework]]), music and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kb.dk/e-mat/dod/112308017118.pdf|title=Fortegnelse over Kvindernes Udstilling 1895|publisher=Nielsen &amp; Lydiche|year=1895|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Den Frie Udstilling building, there was a separate inventory of 301 artworks, paintings and sculptures, listed by artist.&lt;ref name=frie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunstbib.dk/samlinger/udstillingskataloger/samlingen/000084459|title=Kunst: Den frie Udstillings bygning|publisher=Nielsen &amp; Lydiche|year=1895|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key organizers==
The two women who were instrumental in organizing the exhibition were Sophie Oxholm and, above all, Emma Gad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/49591|title=Kvinnornas utställning i Köpenhamn|publisher=''Idun'' (Årg. 8, N:r 26)|date=28 June 1895|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
The Women's Exhibition was a great success. Not only was it appreciated in Denmark and beyond, it made a substantial profit. Gad had hoped the money could be used for an independent "Women's Building" (''Kvindernes Bygning'') with a meeting room, reading room, restaurant and accommodation for women from the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvindernesbygning.dk/|title=Kvindernes Bygning|publisher=Kvindernes Bygning|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work did not begin on the building until 1929. It was completed in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvindernesbygning.dk/historie|title=Kvindernes Bygnings historie|publisher=Kvindernes Bygning|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Albertina''' is a [[museum]] in the [[Innere Stadt]] (First District) of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. It houses one of the largest and most important [[print room]]s in the world with approximately 65,000 [[drawing]]s and approximately 1 million [[old master print]]s, as well as more modern graphic works, photographs and architectural drawings.  Apart from the graphics collection the museum has recently acquired on permanent loan two significant collections of [[Impressionist]] and early 20th-century art, some of which will be on permanent display. The museum also houses temporary exhibitions.

== History==
The Albertina was erected on one of the last remaining sections of the [[fortification]]s of Vienna, the Augustinian [[Bastion]]. Originally, the Hofbauamt (Court Construction Office), which had been built in the second half of the 17th century, stood in that location. In 1744 it was refurbished by the director of the Hofbauamt, [[Emanuel Teles Count Silva-Tarouca]], to become his [[palace]]; it was therefore also known as ''Palais Taroucca''. The building was later taken over by [[Albert of Saxe-Teschen|Duke Albert of Saxen-Teschen]] who used it as his residence. He later brought his graphics collection there from [[Brussels]], where he had acted as the [[Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|governor of the Habsburg Netherlands]]. He had the building extended by [[Louis Montoyer]]. Since then, the palace has immediately bordered the [[Hofburg]]. The collection was expanded by Albert's successors.

The collection was created by Duke Albert with the Genoese count [[Giacomo Durazzo]], the Austrian ambassador in Venice. In 1776 the count presented nearly 1,000 pieces of art to the duke and his wife [[Archduchess Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen|Maria Christina]] ([[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]'s daughter). Count Durazzo, who was the brother of [[Marcello Durazzo]], the [[Doge of Genoa]] – "wanted to create a collection for posterity that served higher purposes than all others: education and the power of morality should distinguish his collection...." 
In the 1820s [[Archduke Charles of Austria|Archduke Charles]], Duke Albert and Maria Christina's foster son, initiated further modifications to the building by [[Joseph Kornhäusel]], which affected mostly its interior decoration. After Archduke Charles, his son [[Archduke Albert (1817-1895)|Archduke Albrecht]] then Albrecht's nephew [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen]] lived in the building.

In early 1919, ownership of both the building and the collection passed from the [[Habsburg]]s to the newly founded Republic of [[Austria]]. In 1920 the collection of prints and drawings was united with the collection of the former imperial court library. The name Albertina was established in 1921. 

In March 1945, the Albertina was heavily damaged by Allied [[bomb]] attacks. The building was rebuilt in the years after the war and was completely refurbished and modernized from 1998 to 2003. Modifications of the exterior entrance sequence, including a signature roof by [[Hans Hollein]] were completed 2008, when also the graphics collection finally reopened.

'''''Alpine Pool''''' is a 1907 painting by [[John Singer Sargent]]. It is part of the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/50.130.15/|title=Alpine Pool - John Singer Sargent - 50.130.15 - Work of Art - Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is one of a series of paintings of a small Alpine stream that Sargent executed while staying in the small village of Purtud in the Val d’Aosta, Northern Italy. In this painting, the artist was attempting to record in close-up the effect of sunlight on still clear water lying between a border of rocks and foliage.

It is on view at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Fifth Avenue, New York in Gallery 770.

'''''And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic''''' is a 1987 book by ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' journalist [[Randy Shilts]]. The book chronicles the discovery and spread of the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) and [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically [[gay]] disease. Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease is caused by a biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.

The book is an extensive work of investigative journalism, written in the form of an encompassing time line; the events that shaped the [[epidemic]] are presented as sequential matter-of-fact summaries. Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals in the gay, medical, and political communities. Shilts begins his discussion in 1977 with the first confirmed case of AIDS, that of [[Grethe Rask]], a Danish doctor working in [[Africa]]. He ends with the announcement by actor [[Rock Hudson]] in 1985 that he was dying of AIDS, when international attention on the disease exploded.

''And the Band Played On'' was critically acclaimed and became a best-seller. Judith Eannarino of the ''[[Library Journal]]'' called it "one of the most important books of the year", upon its release.&lt;ref name="eannarino"&gt;Eannarino, Judith (November 15, 1987). "And the Band Played On (book review)." ''Library Journal'' '''112''' (19) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community. He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, "Any good reporter could have done this story, but I think the reason I did it, and no one else did, is because I am gay. It was happening to people I cared about and loved."&lt;ref name="geiger"&gt;{{cite news | first=H Jack | last=Geiger | title= Plenty of Blame to Go Around | date= 1987-11-08 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/books/plenty-of-blame-to-go-around.html | work =The New York Times Book Review | page = 9 | accessdate = 2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was later adapted into an [[And the Band Played On (film)|HBO film of the same name]] in 1993. Shilts was tested for HIV while he was writing the book; he died of complications from AIDS in 1994.

Shilts decided to write ''And the Band Played On'' after attending an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer [[Bill Kurtis]] gave the keynote address and told a joke: "What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you're [[Haiti]]an."&lt;ref&gt;p. 384, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it "says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go in front of a journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they were gay, they wouldn't talk about it and that nobody would take offense at that. To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that, to me, it was never something that happened to those other people."&lt;ref name="geiger"/&gt;

After publication of the book, Shilts explained his use of the title: "''And the Band Played On'' is simply a snappier way of saying 'business as usual'. Everyone responded with an ordinary pace to an extraordinary situation."&lt;ref name="engel"&gt;Engel, Margaret. "AIDS and Prejudice: One Reporter's Account of the Nation's Response." ''The Washington Post'', December 1, 1987, p. Z10.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase itself is originally from [[The Temptations]]' popular 1970 song about encroaching chaos, ''[[Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)]]''; in the song, the phrase repeatedly signals that no one is paying proper attention to world problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/The-temptations-ball-of-confusion-thats-what-the-world-is-today-lyrics|title=Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today) (lyrics by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong|website=Genius.com|date=2 April 2017|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Shilts focuses on several organizations and communities that were either hit hardest by AIDS—and were given the task of finding the cause of the disease—or begging the government for money to fund research and provide social services to people who were dying. He often uses an [[Third-person omniscient narrative|omniscient point of view]] to portray individuals' thoughts and feelings.

===Gay community===
AIDS in the United States first struck gay men and [[intravenous drug use (recreational)|IV drug users]] in Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco due to unsafe sexual and drug-taking practices. Shilts' sources in the gay community tried to remember the last time everyone they knew was healthy, which was the [[United States Bicentennial]] celebration in 1976, when sailors came from all over the world to New York.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 142–143 ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them carried [[sexually transmitted disease]]s and rare tropical fevers. A marked difference in these cities arose in two phases of consciousness in the gay community: "Before" in 1980, and "After" by 1985. "Before", according to Shilts, was characterized by a care-free innocence, preceding the period when gay men were aware of a deadly infectious disease.&lt;ref&gt;p. 12, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; "After" signified the realization that gay men knew most or all of their friends were infected with AIDS, and the syndrome became pervasive throughout the media.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 585–590, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

In San Francisco, particularly in the Castro District, gay community activists such as [[Bill Kraus]] and [[Cleve Jones]] found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men to avoid getting sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro, and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 38–40, 154–155 ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 152–154, 167, 180, 200, 209–210, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York City, men like [[Larry Kramer]] and [[Paul Popham]], who had previously shown no desire for leadership, were forced by bureaucratic apathy into forming the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] to raise money for medical research and to provide social services for scores of gay men who began getting sick with [[opportunistic infections]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 133–134, 166–167, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts describes the desperate actions of the group to get recognition by Mayor [[Ed Koch]] and assistance from the city's Public Health Department to provide social services and [[sex education|preventive education]] about AIDS and [[unsafe sex]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 309–311, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

In these cities, however, the sizable gay communities in most instances were responsible for raising the most money for research, providing the money for and subsequently the social services for the dying, and educating themselves and other high-risk groups. Kramer would go on to form [[ACT UP|AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] (ACT-UP), a political activist organization that forced government and media to pay attention to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;"Larry Kramer."

===Medical community===
Doctors were the first to deal with the toll that AIDS would take in the United States. Some—like [[Marcus Conant]], James Curran, [[Arye Rubenstein]], [[Michael S. Gottlieb]], and [[Mathilde Krim]]—would also realize their professional life's courses in dealing with patient after patient who showed up in their offices with baffling illnesses, most notably [[lymphadenopathy]], [[pneumocystis carinii pneumonia]], [[Kaposi's Sarcoma]], [[toxoplasmosis]], [[cytomegalovirus]], [[cryptosporidia]], and other opportunistic infections that caused death by a grisly combination of ailments overtaxing a compromised [[immune system]]. With no information on how the disease was spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients, and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 150, 321–322, 374–375 ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts praised the Public Health Department of San Francisco's handling of the new communicable disease as they tracked down people who were sick and linked them to other people who had symptoms, although some of them were living in different parts of the country. He criticized the New York City Public Health Department for doing very little, specifically when Public Health Director [[David Sencer]] refused to call AIDS an emergency and stated that the Public Health Department need not do anything because the gay community was handling it sufficiently.&lt;ref&gt;p. 310, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time gay men were getting sick in the United States, doctors in Paris were receiving patients who were African or who had lived in Africa with the same symptoms as the Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi|Françoise Barre]], [[Luc Montagnier]], and doctor [[Willy Rozenbaum]] began taking biopsies of HIV-infected [[lymph nodes]] and discovered a new [[retrovirus]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 219, 229, 237–238, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the [[Pasteur Institute]] sent a colleague to the [[National Cancer Institute]], where [[Robert Gallo]] was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 238, 239–240, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 264, 386–388, 401, 409, 418–420 ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

Departmental ego and pride, according to Shilts, also confounded research as the [[Centers for Disease Control]] and the [[National Cancer Institute]]s battled over funding and who might get credit for medical discoveries that were to come from the isolation of HIV, blood tests to find HIV, or any possible [[vaccine]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 429–430, 434–435, 444–445, 447–448, 450–452, 460–462, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Once AIDS became known as a "gay disease" there was particular difficulty for many doctors in different specialties to get other medical professionals to acknowledge that AIDS could be transmitted to people who were not gay, such as infants born from drug-using mothers,&lt;ref&gt;pp. 103–104, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; children and adults who had [[hemophilia]] (and later, their wives),&lt;ref&gt;pp.115–116, 160–161, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haiti]]ans,&lt;ref&gt;pp. 124, 135–136, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; and people who had received [[blood transfusions]].

The discovery of AIDS in the nation's blood supply and subsequent lack of response by [[blood bank]] leadership occurred as early as 1982,&lt;ref&gt;pp. 195, 220–223, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; yet it was not until 1985, when AIDS antibody testing was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), that blood bank industry leaders acknowledged that HIV could be transmitted through blood transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 307–309, 332–333, 344–346, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts' coverage revealed the feeling among blood bank industry leaders that screening donors for [[hepatitis]] alone might offend the donors, and that the cost of screening all the blood donations provided across the country every year was too high to be feasible.&lt;ref&gt;p. 223, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and governmental agencies===
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the agency responsible for tracking down and reporting all communicable diseases in the U.S., faced governmental apathy in the face of mounting crisis. Shilts reported how CDC epidemiologists forged ahead blindly after being denied funding for researching the disease repeatedly. Shilts expressed particular frustration describing instances of the CDC fighting with itself over how much time and attention was being paid to AIDS issues.&lt;ref&gt;pp.292–293, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Reagan Administration officials like [[Health and Human Services]] Secretary [[Margaret Heckler]] and Assistant Secretary [[Edward Brandt]] spoke publicly about the epidemic, calling it in 1983 its "Number One Health Priority" no extra funding was given to the Centers for Disease Control or the National Institutes of Health for research.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 293–4 ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; What the U.S. Congress pushed through was highly politicized and embattled, and a fraction of what was spent on similar public health problems.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 294–298, 363–364, 455–456, 471–472, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts made comparisons to the government's disparate reaction to the [[Chicago Tylenol murders]], and the recent emergence of [[Legionnaire's Disease]] in 1977. In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting [[cyanide]]-laced [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] capsules. The ''New York Times'' wrote a front-page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] employees worked on the case. [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] disclosed they spent $100&amp;nbsp;million attempting to uncover who had tampered with the bottles. In October 1982, 634 people were reported having AIDS, and of those, 260 had died. The ''New York Times'' wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 about AIDS, none on the front page.&lt;ref&gt;p. 191 ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tylenol Crisis was a criminal act of product-tampering; Legionnaire's Disease was a public health emergency. Twenty-nine members of the [[American Legion]] died in 1976 at a convention in [[Philadelphia]]. The [[National Institute of Health]] spent $34,841 per death of Legionnaire's Disease. In contrast, the NIH spent $3,225 in 1981 and about $8,991 in 1982 for each person who died of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;p. 186 And the Band Played On.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts accused Ronald Reagan of neglecting to address AIDS to the American people until 1987—calling his behavior "ritualistic silence"—even after Reagan called friend Rock Hudson to tell him to get well.&lt;ref&gt;p. 588, ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; After Hudson's death and in the face of increasing public anxiety, Reagan directed [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[C. Everett Koop]] to provide a report on the epidemic. Though Koop was a political conservative, his report was nevertheless clear about what causes AIDS and what people and the U.S. government should do to stop it, including sex and AIDS education provided for all people.&lt;ref&gt;587–598, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

On a civic level, the closure of [[gay bathhouse]]s in San Francisco became a bitter political fight in the gay community. Activists put pressure on the San Francisco Public Health director to educate people about how AIDS is transmitted, and demanded he close bathhouses as a matter of public health.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 153–154, 305–307, 314–317, 413–418, 436–439, 440–443, 481–482, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

===News media===
Shilts was assigned to AIDS full-time at ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' in 1982. It was from this unique vantage point that he repeatedly criticized the U.S. [[news media]] for ignoring the medical crisis because it did not affect people who mattered, only gays and drug addicts.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name='Story in Closet'&gt;Shilts, Randy (August 3, 1985). [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/04/MNAIDS04SHILTS1.DTL&amp;hw=The+Story+in+the+Closet&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 "The Story in the Closet"] ''San Francisco Chronicle'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Shilts noted most newspapers would print stories about AIDS only when it affected heterosexuals, sometimes taking particular interest in stories about AIDS in [[prostitutes]]. AIDS was not reported in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' until it involved heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;p. 137, ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; Many stories called AIDS a "gay plague" or "homosexual disease" in articles that pointed to it showing up in new populations, like [[hemophiliacs]] or people who had received blood transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 353–354, ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts recounted the irony of a reporter commenting on how little was reported about the disease, then linking it once more to rarer instances of transmission to non-drug-using heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 110, 183, 213, 267–268, 320 ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other end of the extreme, a general [[phobia]] of AIDS was exacerbated by the news media who erroneously reported that AIDS could be contracted by household contact, without checking any facts in their stories, which prompted mass hysteria across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 299–301, 320–321, ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The book became a commercial success, contrary to Shilts' own expectations.&lt;ref name="grimes"/&gt; It remained on the ''[[New York Times Bestseller List]]'' for five weeks, was translated into seven languages, nominated for a [[National Book Award]], and made Shilts an "AIDS celebrity".&lt;ref name="grimes"&gt;Grimes, William (February 18, 1994). [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/18/obituaries/randy-shilts-author-dies-at-42-one-of-first-to-write-about-aids.html "Randy Shilts, Author, Dies at 42; One of First to Write About AIDS"] ''The New York Times'', p. D.17.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Shilts is compared to great American writers whose careers were made by the circumstances surrounding them, such as [[Thomas Paine]] in the [[American Revolution]], [[Edward R. Murrow]] during [[the Blitz]], and [[David Halberstam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. Writer Jon Katz explains, "No other mainstream journalist has sounded the alarm so frantically, caught the dimensions of the AIDS tragedy so poignantly or focused so much attention on government delay, the nitpickings of research funding and institutional intrigue".&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;Katz, Jon (May 27, 1993). "AIDS and the Media: Shifting Out of Neutral", ''Rolling Stone'', Issue 657, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', Howard Merkel characterizes ''And the Band Played On'' as the first volume of the [[historiography]] of AIDS.&lt;ref name="merkel"&gt;Merkel, Howard (July 2001). "Journals of the Plague Years: Documenting the History of the AIDS Epidemic in the United States", ''American Journal of Public Health'', '''91''' (7), p. 1025.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the content expanded into law and science, reviews were published not only in literary sources but legal and medical journals as well.

===Literary===
Literary reviews of the work were generally positive, with reviewers commenting on the "hypnotic" and "thriller-like" qualities of the book. Shilts' investigative and journalistic endeavors were praised, and reviewers seemed genuinely moved by the personal stories of the major players.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Judith Eannarino noted, "Shilts has the ability to draw the reader hypnotically into the personal lives of his characters. That, and his monumental investigative effort, would have made this a best-selling novel—if the contents weren't so horribly true."(Eannarino, Judith (November 15, 1987). "And the Band Played On (book review)." ''Library Journal'' '''112''' (19) p. 71.) A reviewer with the feminist magazine ''Hera'' agreed, saying, "''And the Band Played On'' reads like a mystery thriller. The fact that it is non-fiction adds to the intensity but also increases the rage the reader is left with."(Johnston, Peg. "And The Band Played On: Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic; A Review of the book by Randy Shilts." ''Hera''. March 31, 1989. '''9''' (2), p. 3.) Elena Brunet in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "An important, masterful piece of investigative reporting".(Brunet, Elena. "And the Band Played On: Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic by Randy Shilts." ''Los Angeles Times'': October 2, 1988. p. 14.) Anthony Clare in ''[[The Times]]'' stated in a review, "''And the Band Played On'' is a formidable chronicle of wasted time, petty intrigue, bigoted posturing, blind faith and suffering", before warning the United Kingdom their response to AIDS was drawing too close a parallel to the United States'.(Clare, Anthony. "Chronicle of many deaths foretold: Review of 'And The Band Played On' by Randy Shilts", ''The Times'', February 28, 1988.) Joan Breckenridge in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' gave the book high praise for "an excellent piece of both investigative and political journalism", and for the style of writing, although cautioning that at more than 600 pages casual readers might be overwhelmed.(Breckenridge, Joan. "The awful epidemic that was allowed to happen: And the Band Played On: Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic." ''The Globe and Mail (Canada)'', December 5, 1987.) Nan Goldberg in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' characterized it as a, "groundbreaking book on the history of the AIDS epidemic...every element of a thriller." (Goldeberg, Nan. "''Science Big Shot: Passion, Politics, and the Struggle for an AIDS Vaccine'' (book review)." ''The Boston Globe'', January 6, 2002.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''And the Band Played On'' won the [[Stonewall Book Award]] for 1988.&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association. {{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/glbtrt/stonewall/stonewallbook.htm |title=The Stonewall Book Award website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407193541/http://www.ala.org/ala/glbtrt/stonewall/stonewallbook.htm |archivedate=2007-04-07 }} Retrieved on December 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It earned the 10th spot on "100 Lesbian and Gay Books That Changed Our Lives", compiled by the ''Lambda Book Report''.&lt;ref&gt;Monteagudo, Jesse. "100 lesbian and gay books that changed our lives." '' Lambda Book Report''; January 2000. Vol. 8, Iss. 6; p. 12, 2 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, The [[New York City Public Library]] topped its list of "21 New Classics for the 21st Century" with ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Michael. "NY Librarians Pick 21 New Classics." ''Library Journal'', 10/01/99, Vol. 124 Issue 16, p18, 2p&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after it was published however, Shilts remained "fundamentally disappointed" when a radical response to the AIDS crisis did not materialize, despite the reaction to his book.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1988 book review, Jack Geiger of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the detail in Shilts' work was too confusing, being told "in five simultaneous but disjointed chronologies, making them all less coherent", and notes that Shilts neglected to dedicate as much detail to black and Hispanic intravenous drug users, their partners and their children as to gay men. Geiger also expressed doubts that a swifter response by the government would have stemmed the spread of AIDS as quickly as Shilts was implying.&lt;ref name="geiger"/&gt; Woodrow Myers from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was frustrated by Shilts not asking the right questions: "Shilts fails to probe the broader questions and stops where far too many of us stop: We don't ask why the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the entitlements like [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] are getting all the money when the homosexuals and the IV drug abusers with AIDS and the [[multiple sclerosis]] patients are not."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Woodrow. "AIDS: A Reporter's Journey Into the Maelstrom AND THE BAND PLAYED ON by Randy Shilts." ''Los Angeles Times''. Los Angeles, California: December 6, 1987. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gay Community News'' in [[Boston]] also criticized the book's implications that a diagnosis of HIV indicated that death was sure and imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Kyper, John. "Stories from the epidemic: Two important books about the impact of AIDS." ''Gay Community News''. Boston: September 21, 1991. Vol. 19, Iss. 9; p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Rouilard, editor of ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' in 1992 criticized Shilts for being out of touch with the contemporary style of activism and its sexual overtones.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, David. "Gay Journalists Hold First Conference Media: Delegates assess progress being made against newsroom hostility and the battles that remain." ''Los Angeles Times'': June 28, 1992. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and law===
Shilts' book has been used as a standard by the lay press when reviewing books chronicling subsequent medical crises including [[breast cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;Bolotin, Susan. "Slash, Burn and Poison (book review).'' The New York Times'', April 13, 1997, Sunday, Section 7; Page 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[chronic fatigue syndrome]],&lt;ref&gt;"A Chronic Fatigue Cover-Up?" ''Newsweek'', April 22, 1996, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agent Orange]],&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Charles. "Waiting for an Army to Die: The Tragedy of Agent Orange by Fred A. Wilcox." ''Los Angeles Times'': December 17, 1989. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and continued response to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;Biemiller, Lawrence. "Book World; A Clinical Look at Life With AIDS." ''The Washington Post'': April 2, 1993. p. D.02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randal, Judith. "Reality Check; Fighting AIDS in the Trenches." ''The Washington Post'': February 9, 1993. p. Z.19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the academic and scientific communities have been somewhat more critical. Howard Merkel, in the ''American Journal of Public Health'', notes Shilts' tendency to assign blame, writing "A requirement of the journalist, and certainly the historian, however, is to explain human society rather than to point fingers".&lt;ref name="merkel"/&gt; Jon Katz in ''Rolling Stone'' refutes this by stating "[Shilts] fused strong belief with the gathering of factual information and the marshaling of arguments, the way the founders of the modern press did. In doing so, he has exposed the notion of objectivity as bankrupt, ineffective, even lethal".&lt;ref name="katz"/&gt;

Although Sandra Panem in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' praised Shilts' efforts and the attention the book brought to AIDS, she criticized his simplistic interpretation of science and the ways research is fostered and accomplished in the U.S. Panem furthermore believes Shilts gives appropriate weight to the issue of [[homophobia]] hampering attention on the disease, but remarks that even if AIDS had struck a more socially acceptable group of people, similar delays and confusion would have slowed medical progress.&lt;ref name="panem"&gt;Panem, Sandra (February 26, 1988).

Wendy Parmet, a professor at [[Northeastern University Law School]], highlights the greatest strengths of ''And the Band Played On'' to be "the pain and courage of individual confronted with AIDS" and how it "eloquently portrays the human side of the crisis" and believes the blame others criticized to be justified; but Parmet considers his technique of assigning an omniscient point of view a weakness, suggesting that it blurs the lines between fact and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Parmet, Wendy (1986). "AIDS and the Law/And the Band Played on (Book)", ''[[American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine]]'', '''12''' (3/4), p. 503–510.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Contemporary Sociology]]'', Peter Manning and Terry Stein also call Shilts' narrative method into question, and ask why, for a syndrome that affects people beyond race, class, and sexual orientation, that Shilts focuses so narrowly on AIDS as it is related to homosexuality. The writers, however, were mostly impressed with the book, calling it an "informative, often brilliant, overview of the emergent meanings of the AIDS epidemic".&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Peter and Stein, Terry (May 1989). "On the Social Meanings of AIDS", Contemporary Sociology '''18''' (3), p. 422–424.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts is often quoted as claiming that Ronald Reagan neglected to mention AIDS publicly until 1987. However, Reagan briefly mentioned AIDS research in questions and answers during a news conference on September 17, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=1985 |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1985/91785c.htm |title=The President's News Conference: September 17, 1985, Federal Support for AIDS Research |publisher=www.reagan.utexas.edu/ |accessdate=2009-01-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221094807/http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1985/91785c.htm| archivedate= 21 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaëtan Dugas as "Patient Zero"===
The book includes extensive discussion of [[Gaëtan Dugas]], a Canadian flight attendant who died in 1984.&lt;ref name="lrb"/&gt; Dugas was labeled [[Index case|Patient Zero]] of AIDS, because he was linked directly or indirectly with 40 of the first 248 reported cases of AIDS in the United States, and after he was told of his ability to infect others, defiantly continued to have unprotected sex. Many book reviews concentrated their material on Dugas, or led their assessment of the book with discussion of his behavior. Some reviewers interpreted Shilts' naming Dugas "Patient Zero" to mean that Dugas brought AIDS to North America; the ''[[National Review]]'' called Dugas the "Columbus of AIDS" and in their review of ''And the Band Played On'' states, "[Dugas] picked up the disease in Europe through sexual contact with Africans. Traveling on his airline-employee privileges, he spread it here from coast to coast."&lt;ref&gt;"The Columbus of AIDS", ''The National Review'' (November 6, 1987), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts never stated this in the book, instead writing, "Whether Gaëtan Dugas actually was the person who brought AIDS to North America remains a question of debate and is ultimately unanswerable&amp;nbsp;... there's no doubt that Gaëtan played a key role in spreading the new virus from one end of the United States to the other."&lt;ref&gt;p. 439, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' titled its review of ''And the Band Played On'' "The Appalling Saga of Patient Zero", erroneously restating the claim that Dugas had brought AIDS to the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Henry III, William A. (October 19, 1987). "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965791,00.html The Appalling Saga of Patient Zero]", ''Time''. Retrieved on May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Even a press release by St. Martin's Press made the connection between Dugas and the introduction of AIDS to the Western World in its title, but not its text.&lt;ref name="crimp"&gt;Crimp, Douglas (Winter, 1987). "How to Have Promiscuity in an Epidemic." ''AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism'' '''43''' pp. 237–271&lt;/ref&gt;

When the book was released, Dugas' story became a controversial subject in the Canadian media. Shilts claimed that "the Canadian press went crazy over the story" and that "Canadians... saw it as an offense to their nationhood."&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt; The original study identifying Dugas as the index case had been completed by [[William Darrow]], but it was called into question by [[University of California San Francisco]] epidemiologist Andrew Moss. Moss wrote in a letter to the editor of ''The New York Review of Books'', "There is very little evidence that Gaetan was 'patient zero' for the US or for California," while also stating that Shilts did not overstress Dugas' lack of personal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Moss AR |year=1988 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4227 |title= 'AIDS without end' |journal= New York Review of Books |volume=35 |issue=19 |accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandra Panem in ''Science'' uses Shilts' approach toward Dugas' behavior as an example of his "glib" treatment of the science involved in the epidemic.&lt;ref name="panem"/&gt; Author [[Douglas Crimp]] suggests that Shilts' representation of Dugas as "murderously irresponsible" is in actuality "Shilts' homophobic nightmare of himself", and that Dugas is offered as a "scapegoat for his heterosexual colleagues, in order to prove that [Shilts], like them, is horrified by such creatures."&lt;ref name="crimp"/&gt; Many years later, in the 2000s, it was shown, by tracing the roots of the virus, that it had spread from Africa to Haiti, and then to the U.S. in the mid 1960s, before Dugas would have been very sexually active, if at all, and before he was working as a flight attendant.&lt;ref name=patzer&gt;[http://www.radiolab.org/story/169885-aids/ The Cell That Started a Pandemic], ''Radiolab.org'', with guests and research from: [[Nathan Wolf]] author of ''[[The Viral Storm]]''; [[Carl Zimmer]], author of ''[[A Planet of Viruses]]''; [[Michael Worobey]], [[MicrobeWorld.org]]'s "Meet the Scientist Podcast"; [[David Quammen]], author of ''[[Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic|Spillover]]''; [[Beatrice H. Hahn]] of [[Penn Center for AIDS Research]].&lt;/ref&gt; Even the labelling of Dugas as "Patient Zero" was due to an misunderstanding of the study of sexual contacts amongst a group of men indicating how the disease was transmitted – he was identified in the study as ‘Patient [letter] O’, for "Out of California" – but people reading and discussing the research began referring to and thinking about a "Patient Zero" as the origin of the disease.&lt;ref name="lrb"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crewe |first1=Tom |title=Here was a plague |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n18/tom-crewe/here-was-a-plague |accessdate=29 September 2018 |publisher=London Review of Books |date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study of early AIDS cases demonstrated that Dugas could not have been "Patient Zero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature19827.epdf?ttreferrer_access_token=z0xXoLXHonkirkD_hU1jk9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Mz5UkminhxQD8O3RqOtslw0uWnC8Yne3mUv32VmwjGPypGuqJT0TZeiLtsZb49IGRJf6V-wefqs5PWP2Zmz2neUNsKL8cH6Lgl4duhbwVFyGFyS_SpnROTz0ii2YbTD4zpYNY1EMUO0FYZn3LyRxi7Fe0SDLem4hpc01XbTdxF3DGYFAjTFX9jLdruf-bmalV8a5l6t-H_6eyTj_nm19jRIZfwaNR5Mx_RBGKhkHJUzg_Q5pw84M70ucJLf_WneW0=&amp;tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com|title=1970s and ‘Patient 0’ HIV-1 genomes illuminate early HIV/AIDS history in North America|first1=Michael|last1=Worobey|first2=Thomas D.|last2=Watts|first3=Richard A.|last3=McKay|first4=Marc A.|last4=Suchard|first5=Timothy|last5=Granade|first6=Dirk E.|last6=Teuwen|first7=Beryl A.|last7=Koblin|first8=Walid|last8=Heneine|first9=Philippe|last9=Lemey|first10=Harold W.|last10=Jaffe|date=26 October 2016|publisher=|journal=Nature|volume=539|issue=7627|pages=98–101|accessdate=23 July 2018|doi=10.1038/nature19827|pmc=5257289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After publication==
While Shilts was writing the book he was tested for HIV but insisted his doctor not tell him the results until the book was finished so it would not affect his journalistic integrity and judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Bettijane (February 17, 1993). "Shilts Confirms He Is HIV-Positive", ''Los Angeles Times'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lrb"/&gt; On the day he sent the final manuscript to the publisher, he learned he was HIV-positive. He also revealed that he received abuse from gays for the articles he wrote for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' supporting the bathhouse closures, as well as for ''And the Band Played On'', saying it was common for him to be spat upon in the Castro District.&lt;ref&gt;Kirka, Danica. "Randy Shilts Fighting Against the Rules Restricting Gays in the Military;" ''Los Angeles Times'': July 25, 1993. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He was openly booed when he attended the premiere of ''[[The Times of Harvey Milk]]''—based on his book ''The Mayor of Castro Street''—at the [[Castro Theatre]]. Footage he had shot as a television reporter was included in the film, but during the construction of the documentary he was so controversial that the film's editors removed him from footage showing him with Milk.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of ''And the Band Played On'', however, he was "worshipped" by many in the gay community for writing the book, but also seen as someone who pandered to publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Schmalz, Jeffrey. "At Home With: Randy Shilts; Writing Against Time, Valiantly;" ''New York Times'' April 22, 1993. p. C1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts declared while promoting the book in Australia in 1988 that AIDS in the western world could be eradicated, and by 1994, "AIDS could be as manageable as [[diabetes]]". However, in reference to Africa, Shilts noted, "At this point it's inconceivable that there will be an AIDS-free world in Central Africa, as we're looking at a death rate on the scale of the Holocaust."&lt;ref&gt;"West 'AIDS-free within 30&amp;nbsp;years.'" ''Sunday Mail'' (South Africa), September 4, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts gave an interview in 1991 where he noticed, "the stellar AIDS reporters in the early years...the people who did the best job—and the reporters who wanted to cover AIDS but their male editors wouldn't let them—tended to be women", and made a connection that if more women were allowed to write about the epidemic, media coverage would have been vastly different.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, David. "Gender of Editors Affects Coverage of Stories on Sex Media: Women tend to favor more candor in reports on rape, AIDS and the private lives of politicians. Series: THE PRESS AND SEX: Assessing media's coverage when private matters become public. Second in a two-part series." ''Los Angeles Times'': August 19, 1991. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts died from complications of AIDS in 1994, age 42.&lt;ref name="lrb"/&gt; Upon his death he was eulogized by [[Cleve Jones]], who said "Randy's contribution was so crucial. He broke through society's denial and was absolutely critical to communicating the reality of AIDS."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Jennifer. "Randy Shilts, Chronicler of AIDS Epidemic, Dies at 42 Journalism: Author of 'And the Band Played On' is credited with awakening nation to the health crisis."'' Los Angeles Times'' February 18, 1994. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Kramer said of him, "He single-handedly probably did more to educate the world about AIDS than any single person."&lt;ref&gt;"Randy Shilts, journalist, 42, of AIDS." ''Telegram &amp; Gazette''. (Worcester, Massachusetts): February 18, 1994. p. B.7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
{{main article|And the Band Played On (film)}}

''And the Band Played On'' was used as the basis for a 1993 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]-winning [[HBO]] [[television film]] of the same name. It was produced by [[Aaron Spelling]], directed by [[Roger Spottiswoode]], and starred [[Matthew Modine]] as epidemiologist [[Don Francis]] and [[Richard Masur]] as [[William Darrow]] at the Centers for Disease Control. [[Alan Alda]] portrayed controversial viral researcher Robert Gallo, and many other stars appeared in supporting and cameo roles, who agreed to appear in the film for [[Screen Actors Guild|union-scale]] pay. The film was released the same year as ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'', and the play ''[[Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes]]'' premiered, which prompted one reviewer to note it a triumph and a loss: 12 years after the epidemic had begun, such works of art were necessary still to draw attention to it.&lt;ref&gt;Brelsauer, Jan "1993&amp;nbsp;year in Review AIDS The Year the Plague Went Mainstream." Los Angeles Times; December 26, 1993. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of the film were mixed, claiming that it was a noble try, but failed to be comprehensive enough to cover all the intricacies of the response to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;Roush, Matt. "'Band': Noble, but slightly out of sync." ''USA TODAY'', September 10, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''And the Band Played On'', along with other well-received films at the time, was noted for raising the standards of HBO-produced films.&lt;ref&gt;Natale, Richard. "HBO filmmaker gives TV movies a new image." ''The Washington Times'', May 1, 1994, p. D1.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30966">'''Arts and entertainment in India'''  have had their course shaped by a synthesis of indigenous and foreign influences that have consequently shaped the course of the arts of the rest of Asia,  since ancient times.  Arts refer to [[Indian art|paintings]], [[Indian architecture|architecture]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Music of India|music]], [[Indian classical dance|dance]], [[languages of India|languages]] and [[Cinema of India|cinema]]. In early India, most of the arts were derived [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] influences. After the birth of contemporary [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sikhism]] arts flourished under the patronage of kings and emperors. The coming of [[Islam]] spawned a whole new era of Indian architecture and art. Finally the British brought their own Gothic and Roman influences and fused it with the Indian style. They have a culture infusion in their art.

==Architecture==
{{Main|Architecture of India}}
{{Peacock|date=October 2009}}
[[File:Taj Mahal, Agra, India.jpg|thumb|The [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]] is widely considered to be the best example of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] and is one of the most well-known monuments in the world.]]
Indian architecture consists of production of the [[Indian subcontinent]] which encompasses a multitude of expressions over space and time, transformed by the forces of history considered unique to the sub-continent, sometimes destroying, but most of the time absorbing. The result is an evolving range of architectural production that nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history.

The earliest production in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] was characterised by well planned cities and houses where religion did not seem to play an active role. The Buddhist period is primarily represented by three important building types- the Chaitya Hall (place of worship), the [[Vihara]] (monastery) and the [[Stupa]] (hemispherical mound for worship/ memory) - exemplified by the extraordinary caves of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] and the monumental [[Sanchi]] [[Stupa]]. The [[Jainism|Jaina]] temples are characterised by a richness of detail that can be seen in the [[Dilwara Temples]] in [[Mt.Abu]]. Early beginnings of Hindu temple architecture have been traced to the remains at [[Aihole]] and [[Pattadakal]] in present-day [[Karnataka]], and have [[Vedic altars]] and late Vedic temples as described by [[Pāṇini]] as models. Later, as more differentiation took place, the Dravidian/ Southern style and or the Indo-Aryan/ Northern/ Nagara style of temple architecture emerged as dominant modes, epitomized in productions such as the magnificent [[Brihadeeswara Temple]], [[Thanjavur]], and the [[Sun Temple]], [[Konark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/240|title=Khajuraho Group of Monuments|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/246|title=Sun Temple, Konârak|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the arrival of [[Islam]], a new style of architecture known as [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] emerged combining traditional Indian and Islamic elements. The earliest examples include the [[Qutb Minar complex|Qutb complex]], a series of monuments built by successive sultans of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/233|title=Qutb Minar and its Monuments, Delhi|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mughal architecture|architecture]] of the [[Mughal Empire]] includes the [[Red Fort]], [[Taj Mahal]], [[Agra Fort]], [[Humayun's Tomb|Humayun's tomb]], [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] and [[Fatehpur Sikri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/232|title=Humayun's Tomb, Delhi|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/252|title=Taj Mahal|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With colonization, a new chapter began. Though the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and the French made substantial forays, it was the English who had a lasting impact. The architecture of the colonial period varied from the beginning attempts at creating authority through classical prototypes to the later approach of producing a supposedly more responsive image through what is now termed [[Indo-Saracenic]] architecture- a mixture of Hindu, Islamic and Western elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/945|title=Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus)|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the introduction of [[Modern Architecture]] into India and later with Independence, the quest was more towards progress as a paradigm fuelled by [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]]vian visions. The planning of [[Chandigarh]]- a city most architects hate/love- by [[Le Corbusier]] was considered a step towards this. Later as modernism exhausted itself in the West and new directions were sought for, in India too there was a search for a more meaningful architecture rooted in the Indian context. This direction called [[Critical Regionalism]] is exemplified in the works of architects such as [[B. V. Doshi]], [[Charles Correa]], etc. Apart from this, the advent of globalisation and economic development since the 90s, has spawned an impressive collection of modern IT campuses and skyscrapers, and as economic reform accelerates, metropolitan areas are gaining futuristic skylines.

==Literature==
{{Main|Indian literature}}
[[Image:Rabindranath Tagore in 1909.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Rabindranath Tagore]] won the [[Nobel prize]] for literature. It is the first Nobel prize won by Asia.]]
Indian literature is generally acknowledged, but not wholly established, as the oldest in the world. India has 22 officially recognized [[Languages of India|languages]], and a huge variety of literature has been produced in these languages over the years. In Indian literature, [[Oral literature|oral]] and written forms are both important. [[Hindu]] literary traditions dominate a large part of Indian culture. Apart from the [[Vedas]] which are a sacred form of knowledge, there are other works such as the Hindu epics ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', treatises such as [[Vaastu Shastra]] in architecture and town planning, and [[Arthashastra]] in political science. Devotional Hindu drama, poetry and songs span the subcontinent. Among the best known are the works of [[Kalidasa]] (writer of the famed Sanskrit play [[Shakuntala]]) and [[Tulsidas]] (who wrote an epic Hindi poem based on the Ramayana, called [[Raamcharitmaanas]]).

[[Tamil language|Tamil]] literature has been in existence for more than 2500 years. [[Tolkaappiyam]] has been credited as its oldest work, whereas the exact origins of [[Thirukkural]] is unknown. The golden age of Tamil literature was during the [[Sangam period]], roughly 1800 years ago. The classic works of this period are [[Cilappatikaram]], [[Manimekalai]], and Sivakasinthamani. Tamil literature is known for its secular traditions, although its authors had strong religious beliefs. [[Thirukkural]] is considered to be the greatest of Tamil works. [[Kannada]] literature is probably the third oldest in Indian literature next to [[Sanskrit literature]] and [[Tamil literature]]. The earliest reported work in Kannada literature dates back to the fifth century. The first available literary in Kannada is [[Kavirajamarga]], written in the eighth century by Amoghavarsha Nrpatunga. [[Hindi literature]] started as religious and philosophical poetry in medieval periods in dialects like [[Avadhi]] and [[Brij]]. The most famous figures from this period are [[Kabir]] and [[Tulsidas]]. In modern times, the ''Khadi'' dialect became more prominent and a variety of literature was produced in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]].

The most renowned Bengali writer is Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]], who received the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. In the last century, several Indian writers have distinguished themselves not only in traditional [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] but also in English. India's only native-born Nobel laureate in literature was the [[Bengal]]i writer [[Rabindranath Tagore]], but VS Naipaul, a diaspora Indian novelist born in Trinidad, also won the Nobel in 2001. Other major writers who are either Indian or of Indian origin and derive much inspiration from Indian themes are [[R. K. Narayan]], [[Vikram Seth]], [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Arundhati Roy]], [[Raja Rao]], [[Amitav Ghosh]], [[Vikram Chandra (novelist)|Vikram Chandra]], [[Mukul Kesavan]], [[Shashi Tharoor]], [[Nayantara Sehgal]], [[Anita Desai]], [[Ashok Banker]], [[Shashi Deshpande]], [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], and [[Bharati Mukherjee]].

==Music==
{{Main|Music of India}}
Indian music includes multiple varieties of [[folk music|folk]], [[popular music|popular]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[Indian classical music|classical music]]. India's classical music tradition, including [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] and [[Hindustani music]], has a history spanning millennia and, developed over several eras, remains fundamental to the lives of Indians today as sources of religious inspiration, cultural expression and pure entertainment. India is made up of several dozen [[ethnic group]]s, speaking their own [[language]]s and [[dialect]]s. Alongside distinctly [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinental]] forms there are major influences from [[Persian traditional music|Persian]], [[Arab music|Arab]] and [[Music of the United Kingdom|British music]]. Indian genres like [[filmi]] and [[Bhangra (music)|bhangra]] have become popular throughout the United Kingdom, [[South Asia|South]] and [[East Asia]], and around the world.

Indian stars now sell records in many countries, while [[world music]] fans listen to the roots music of India's diverse nations. American [[soul music|soul]], [[rock and roll|rock]] and [[hip hop music]] have also made a large impact, primarily on Indian pop and filmi music. Other highly popular forms are [[ghazal]], [[qawwali]], [[thumri]], [[dhrupad]], [[dadra]], [[bhajan]], [[kirtan]], [[Shabda|shabad]], and [[gurbani]].
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:ravi-shankar.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Pandit [[Ravi Shankar (musician)|Ravi Shankar]] and his daughter performing with [[sitar]]s a Hindustani Concert]] --&gt;
[[Filmi]] music is often said to have begun in 1931, with the release of Ardeshir M. Irani's [[Alam Ara]] and its popular soundtrack. In the earliest years of the Indian cinema, filming was generally Indian (classical and folk) in inspiration, with some Western elements. Over the years, the Western elements have increased, but without completely destroying the Indian flavour.  Most of the Indian movies are musicals and feature elaborate song and dance numbers.  There is constant work for pop music composers — or music directors, to use the Indian term.  Movie soundtracks are released as tapes and CDs, sometimes even before the movie is released.

==Dance==
{{Main|Indian classical dance|Indian folk dances}}
Indian classical dance is performed in different styles. Its theory can be traced back to the [[Natya Shastra]] of [[Bharata Muni]], a sage from Tamil Nadu (400 BC). The Natya Shastra is the most important ancient treatise on [[classical Indian dance]]. It is also called the fifth [[Veda]] in reference to the foundation of Hindu religion and philosophy, from which sprang the related South Indian musical tradition of [[Carnatic music]]. Its various current forms include [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Odissi]], [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Mohiniaattam]], [[Kathak]] and [[Sattriya dance|Sattriya]].

'''Bharatanatyam''' is a classical [[dance]] form originating in [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is thought to have been created by Bharata Muni. In ancient times Bharatanatyam was performed by [[mandir]] (Hindu temple) [[Devadasi]]s. Many of the ancient sculptures in Hindu temples are based on Bharatanatyam dance postures [[karana dance|karana]]s.

'''Odissi''' is one of the oldest surviving forms of dance, with depictions of Odissi dancing dating back as far as the 1st century BC. Like other forms of Indian classical dance, the Odissi style traces its origins back to antiquity. Dancers are found depicted in bas-relief in the hills of Udaygiri (near [[Bhubaneswar]]) dating back to the 1st century BC. The [[Natya Shastra]] speaks of the dance from this region and refers to it as Odra-Magadhi.

'''Kathakali''' (''katha'' for [[Narrative|story]], ''kali'' for [[performance]] or [[Play (theatre)|play]]) is a form of dance-[[drama]]. It originated in the [[South India]]n state of [[Kerala]] over 500 years ago. It is a spectacular combination of drama, dance, music and ritual. Characters with vividly painted faces and elaborate costumes re-enact stories from the [[Hindu]] epics, [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]].

'''Kuchipudi''' is a classical dance form from [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Telangana]], a state of [[South India]]. Kuchipudi is the name of a small village in the Divi Taluq of [[Krishna district]] that borders the [[Bay of Bengal]] and with resident [[Brahmin]]s practising this traditional dance form, it acquired the present name.

'''Mohiniaattam''' is a traditional dance from the South Indian state of Kerala. [[Mohini]] is an [[Apsaras]] in the Hindu mythology and aattam in [[Malayalam]] means dance. So Mohiniaattam essentially means "dance of the enchantress". The theme of Mohiniaattam is love and devotion to god. The costume worn by the dancers are typically white coloured kasavu [[saree]] with golden borders.

The '''Kathak''' dance form arose from the [[Vaishnava]] devotees dancing to the episodes from [[Krishna]]'s life. Originally a Northern Indian temple dance, it was transformed to a court dance in the [[Mughal era]]. The new Muslim influence brought with it certain changes to the dance form: what had been a largely devotional practice now became more a courtly entertainment.

The '''Sattriya''' dance is believed to be a creation of the great [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] ([[bhakti]]) guru [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] considered the lead architect of Assamese [[literature]] and [[culture]]. He created this magnificent Sattriya dance to accompany the ''Ankiya Naat'' (a form of Assamese one-act play, another creation of Sankardeva) which was usually performed in ''Satras'' (Assamese monasteries). Since the dance developed and grew within the ''Satras'', it is named after these religious institutions.

'''Folk dances''' are performed for every possible occasion, to celebrate the arrival of seasons, birth of a child, a wedding and festivals. The dances are very focused on gestures, postures, and expressions. The dances burst with verve and vitality. Men and women perform some dances exclusively, while in some performances men and women dance together. On most occasions artists sing the main lyrics and are accompanied by instruments. Each form of dance has a specific costume. Most costumes are flamboyant with extensive jewels.

'''Bhangra''' is a form of music and dance that originated in the [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] region of [[India]]. [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]] dance began as a folk dance conducted by [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] farmers to celebrate the coming of [[Vaisakhi]], a [[sikh]] festival. The specific moves reflect the manner in which villagers farmed their land. This musical art further became synthesized after the partition of India, when refugees from different parts of the Punjab shared their folk dances with individuals who resided in the regions they settled in. This hybrid dance became Bhangra. The dance started from just one move and evolved later on. It has been popularized by Punjabi artists from the [[Sikh]] communities, with which it is now commonly associated.[1] Today, [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]] dance survives in different forms and styles all over the globe – including pop music, film soundtracks, collegiate competitions and even talent shows.

'''Thirayattam''' is a ritual performing  dance  of south malabar region (kozhikode and malappuram Dt:) in [[Kerala]] state.In [[Malayalam]] language, the word "Thirayattam" refers to a 'colourful dance'  This vibrant Ethnic art form blend of dance,instrumental music, drama, facial and body makeup, martial art and ritualistic  Function. [[Thirayattam]] enacted in courtyards of sacred groves and village shrines, during Thirayattam festival.&lt;ref&gt; "Thirayattam" ( Folklore Text- malayalam, Moorkkanad peethambaran),State Institute of language, Kerala. {{ISBN|978-81-200-4294-0}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Sculpture ==
{{main|Sculpture in India}}
 first sculptures in India date back to the [[Indus Valley civilization]], where stone and bronze carvings have been discovered. This is one of the earliest instances of sculpture in the world. Later, as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] developed further, India produced some of the most intricate bronzes in the world, as well as unriveled temple carvings. Some huge shrines, such as the one at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] were not actually constructed using blocks, but instead carved out of solid rock, making them perhaps the largest and most intricate sculptures in the world.

During the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far northern India, in what is now southern [[Afghanistan]] and northern Pakistan, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha's life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because [[Gandhara]]n Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Persia]]n artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc.

The pink sandstone sculptures of Mathura evolved during the Gupta period (4th to 6th century) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. Newer sculptures in [[Afghanistan]], in stucco, schist or clay, display very strong blending of Indian post-Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman. Meanwhile, elsewhere in India, less anatomically accurate styles of human representation evolved, leading to the classical art that the world is now familiar with, and contributing to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Asia.

== Painting ==
{{Main|Indian painting}}
The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[pre-historic]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]], [[Maharashtra]] [[States and territories of India|state]] present an example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals. Thereafter, frescoes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and Ellora caves appeared. India's [[Buddhist]] literature is replete with examples of texts which describe that palaces of kings and aristocratic class were embellished with paintings, but they have not survived. But, it is believed that some form of art painting was practiced in that time.

Indian Art was given a new lease of life by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in early 19th century when the new [[government]] required painters to document Indian life and times. The English School paintings, as these new art were called had seen the emergence of India's greatest artists of all times [[Raja Ravi Verma]]. Other important artists of the Colonial period include [[Jamini Roy]], Amrita Shergil, Ramkinker Baij and [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. After independence, Indian art became more diverse and artists like [[Maqbool Fida Hussain]], Francis Newton Souza, [[Subodh Gupta]], [[Devajyoti Ray]], Sudip Roy,&lt;ref name=dna12&gt;{{cite news |title=Florence Biennale: Sudip Roy wins award for Christ, Gandhi, Teresa-Trilogy |url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/plumage/florence-biennale-sudip-roy-s-wins-award-for-for-christ-gandhi-teresa-trilogy |publisher=[[The Times of India]] |date=Dec 27, 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paresh Maity]] and Bose Krishnamachari earned international recognition.

==Cinema==
{{Peacock|date=October 2009}}
{{Main|Cinema of India}}
India is a major regional center for [[film|cinema]]. The Indian film industry is the second largest in the world (1200 movies released in the year 2002). Each of the larger jrods supports its own film industry: [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]. The Hindi/Urdu film industry, based in [[Mumbai]], formerly ''Bombay'', is called [[Bollywood]] (a melding of [[Hollywood]] and Bombay). Similar neologisms have been coined for the Kannada (Karnataka State) film industry ([[Sandalwood]]) based on Karnataka being known for Sandalwood, Tamil film industry ([[Kollywood]], from the Kodambakkam district of [[Chennai]]) and the Telugu film industry ([[Cinema of Andhra Pradesh|Tollywood]]). Tollygunge is a [[metonym]] for the Bengali film industry, long centered in the Tollygunge district of [[Kolkata]]. The Bengali language industry is notable as having nurtured the director [[Satyajit Ray]], an internationally renowned filmmaker and a winner of many awards, among them the yo yorat Ratna (India's highest civilian award), the [[Légion d'honneur]] (France), and the Lifetime achievement [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. The Bollywood industry is usually the largest in terms of films produced and box office receipts, just as Urdu/Hindi speakers outnumber speakers of other Indian languages within India. (Tollywood is close on Bollywood's heels, and sometimes will turn out more films in a year.)

== Radio ==
Radio broadcasting was, until recently a government monopoly under the Directorate General of [[All India Radio]]—established in 1936 and since 1957 also known as Akashvani—a government-owned, semicommercial operation of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. From only six stations at the time of independence, All India Radio's network had expanded by the mid-1990s to 146 AM stations plus a National Channel, the Integrated North-East Service (aimed at tribal groups in northeast India), and the External Service. There are five regional headquarters for All India Radio: the North Zone in New Delhi; the North-East Zone in Guwahati, Assam; the East Zone in Calcutta; the West Zone in Bombay; and the South Zone in Madras. All India Radio covers 99.37% of India's populace.

The government-owned network provides both national and local programs in Hindi, English, and sixteen regional languages. Commercial services, which were inaugurated in 1957, are provided by [[Vividh Bharati]] Service, headquartered in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/go-gaga-with-vividh-bharatis-golden-year/49854-8.html|title=Go gaga with Vividh Bharati's golden year|date=Oct 3, 2007|publisher=CNN-IBN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vividh Bharati]], which accepts advertisements, broadcasts from thirty-one AM and FM stations in the mid-1990s.

India has an extensive network of medium wave and shortwave stations. In 1994 there were eighty-five FM stations and seventy-three shortwave stations that covered the entire country. The broadcasting equipment is mostly Indian made and reaches special audiences, such as farmers needing agroclimatic, plant protection, and other agriculture-related information. The number of radio receivers increased almost fivefold between 1970 and 1994, from around 14 million to nearly 65 million. Most radios are also produced within India.

The foreign broadcast service is a function of the External Services Division of All India Radio. In 1994 seventy hours of news, features, and entertainment programs were broadcast daily in twenty-five languages using thirty-two shortwave transmitters. The principal target audiences are listeners in neighbouring countries and the large overseas Indian community.

Satellite Radio was introduced to the Indian market in 2000 by [[WorldSpace]], a Washington-DC based company. Currently WorldSpace beams 30 channels comprising music, news, and regional channels, a subscriber in India pays {{Indian Rupee}} 1,200 per annum. In addition, some premium channels are available at an extra cost. This service requires special receivers which are often subsidized by world space.

Recently The Department of Space (DoS) indicated it is exploring the possibility of setting up a multi-media satellite platform that would include satellite radio, video and data channels.

== Television ==
{{Main|Television in India}}
Television service is available throughout the country. [[Doordarshan]] is a government-owned broadcaster established in 1959 and a part of All India Radio until 1976. It operates of one national network and seven regional networks. In 1992 there were sixty-three high-power television transmitters, 369 medium-power transmitters, seventy-six low-power transmitters, and twenty-three transposers. Regular satellite transmissions began in 1982 (the same year colour transmission began).
By 1994 some 6 million people were receiving television broadcasts via satellite, and the number was expected to increase rapidly throughout the rest of the decade. Cable television was even more prolific, with an estimated 12 to 15 million subscribers in 1994. Besides Doordarshan, [[Zee TV]]—an independent station broadcasting from Mumbai since 1992—uses satellite transmissions. In fact, because Doordarshan is the only network that is permitted to broadcast television signals domestically, [[Zee TV]] and other entrepreneurs broadcast their Indian-made videotapes via foreign transmitters. Other networks joining the fray are [[Cable News Network]] (1990); Asia Television Network (1991); Hong Kong-based [[STAR TV (Asia)|Star TV]] (1991); Jain TV, near Bombay (1994); EL TV, a spin-off of Zee TV in Bombay (1994); HTV, an affiliate of the [[Hindustan Times]] in New Delhi (1994); and [[Sun TV (India)|Sun TV]], a [[Tamil language]] service in Chennai (1994). In a communications breakthrough in July 1995, Doordarshan agreed, for a US$1.5 million annual fee and 50 percent of advertising revenue when it exceeds US$1.5 million, to allow CNN to broadcast twenty-four hours a day via an Indian satellite. regional, and local service. The number of television sets increased from around 500,000 in 1976 to 9 million in early 1987 and to around 47 million in 1994; increases are expected to continue at around 6 million sets per year. More than 75 percent of television sets were black and white models in 1992, but the proportion of colour sets is increasing annually. Most television sets are produced in India.

'''Church frescos''' or '''church wall paintings''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''kalkmalerier'') are to be found in some 600 churches across Denmark, no doubt representing the highest concentration of surviving church murals anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitkolding.dk/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/oplevelser/historiskeattraktioner/kirkerogbygningsvaerker/kalkmalerieridedanskelandsbykirker.htm Kalkmalerier i de danske landsbykirker from VisitDenmark] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132945/http://www.visitkolding.dk/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/oplevelser/historiskeattraktioner/kirkerogbygningsvaerker/kalkmalerieridedanskelandsbykirker.htm |date=19 July 2011 }}. In Danish. Retrieved 15 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them date back to the [[Middle Ages]] and were uncovered by [[Jacob Kornerup]] (1825–1913) who carried out restoration work in 80 churches across the country towards the end of the 19th century. They lay hidden for centuries as after the [[Reformation in Denmark|reformation]], they were covered with [[whitewash|limewash]] (Danish: ''kalk'') only to be revealed and restored during the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. In most of Europe medieval [[fresco]]s, extremely common in the Middle Ages, were more likely to be removed completely during the Reformation or in subsequent rebuildings, or merely as they aged. The oldest [[fresco]]s, dating back to the 12th century, were painted in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque style]] by artists from elsewhere in Europe but those from the 14th century and thereafter are in the [[Gothic art|Gothic style]] which was used by native Danish painters. It is these that are considered to be the most important for [[Danish art]] and [[Danish culture|culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ Wall Paintings in Danish Churches from Panoramas.dk]. Retrieved 12 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction is to be made between these church wall paintings or ''kalkmalerier'' and the generic term "fresco" (Danish: ''fresko'') which refers to all types of painting on plastered walls or ceilings.

==Historical background==
[[File:Groenbaek Kalkmaleri detalje.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Grønbæk: Romanesque frescos]]
The murals in Danish churches can be divided very roughly into two main periods: Romanesque, beginning in the 12th century, and Gothic, from the middle of the 13th century. As in most of Europe the transition in painting styles was less abrupt than in architecture. Painting styles are closely related to those of the neighbouring areas of North Germany and South Sweden, especially the province of [[Scania]], which was Danish territory in the Middle Ages.

===Romanesque period===
With the development of [[Christianity]] and the construction of stone churches, Romanesque art came to Denmark from the rest of Europe, with influences mostly from North Germany and the Anglo-Norman English Channel area, and possibly even some from Spain and Italy. Some of this no doubt came from imported manuscripts; there are no surviving "indigenous illuminated manuscripts of significance" from Scandinavia in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 317-8&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the churches in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Sealand]], especially those in Måløv, [[Jørlunde church|Jørlunde]], Slaglille, Sæby and Kirke Hyllinge, have highly artistic murals dating back to the 12th century. The colours were often imported at considerable cost and the paintings, usually of figures, were true frescos, completed on wet plaster in traditionally geometrical compositions with a blue or green background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.um.dk/publikationer/um/english/denmark/kap4/4-4-2.asp#4-4-3 Denmark Culture - Visual Arts from the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]. Retrieved 14 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several Sealand church [[apse]]s have a variant of the usual [[Christ in Majesty]] subject, where Christ is surrounded by the [[Evangelists' symbols]], flanked by the Virgin and Saint John with archangels or other figures (Alsted shown above).&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 317&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gothic period===
There was a lengthy but smooth transition towards [[Gothic art]], beginning in the middle of the 13th century but extending well into the 15th when many of the flat wooden church ceilings were replaced by [[Groin vault|brick vaulting]]. The curvature of the vaults called for new techniques rather than simply following pictures from [[illuminated manuscript]]s. The figures no longer stand in a coloured background but are painted directly on the white limewash. Increasingly, the white areas between the figures are filled with stars, flowers, plants and other ornaments. The figures often appear more conventional than in the Romanesque murals. Gothic church murals are found throughout Denmark and in the [[Scania|south of Sweden]], and can often be identified as coming from workshops such as the ones in [[Elmelunde Church|Elmelunde]] on the island of [[Møn]] and [[Isefjord]] in northwestern Sealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Billedkunst,_gotisk/Isefjordsv%C3%A6rkstedet Isefjordsværkstedet from Den Store Danske]. In Danish. Retrieved 14 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Knights in combat became regarded as a suitable subject for church walls.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 318&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Reformation===
The Reformation essentially ended the traditions of church wall-paintings in all Protestant counties. The large anti-Catholic fresco, following a print of 1525 by [[Sebald Beham]], in the parish church of [[Brøns]] is one of few such works in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Brøns kirke - Wandmalerei - Jesus weist Papst zurück.jpg]] and other images are in [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Frescos_in_Br%C3%B8ns_Kirke the Commons category]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples of wall paintings==
In many of Denmark's churches, wall paintings have been restored. Listed below are some of the most interesting examples:

===Aarhus Cathedral===
[[File:Aarhus Cathedral StGeorge.jpg|right|thumb|200px|St. George in Aarhus Cathedral]]
The murals in [[Aarhus Cathedral]] date from 1470 to 1520. Until the Reformation, most of the church's walls were covered in frescos but many were lost. The cathedral still has 220 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of frescoes, more than any other church in Denmark. One pre-1470 painting was saved from the first [[Romanesque art|Romanesque-style]] cathedral in the northwest corner, the so-called ''Lazarus Window'', painted about 1300.

The paintings of [[St Christopher]] and [[Clement of Metz|St Clement]] are the tallest in the country. Other figures include [[St Michael]] and [[St George]] with the dragon (pictured).
[[File:Bebudd.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Fresco in Sulsted Church]]

===Sulsted Church===
[[Sulsted]] is a small Danish town just north of [[Aalborg]] in [[Jutland]]. The [[Sulsted Church|church]], built during the second half of the 12th century, is richly decorated with late-Gothic frescos, all painted by Hans Maler from [[Randers]] in 1548.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fc.nrsbgym.dk/~lf/F000159A1/kalk.html Sengotiske kalkmalerier i Sulsted kirke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719130211/http://fc.nrsbgym.dk/~lf/F000159A1/kalk.html |date=19 July 2011 }}. In Danish. Retrieved 13 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other frescos in Danish churches, these were not concealed with limewash after the reformation and have survived to this day.

The frescos, which decorate the ceiling of the nave, depict the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' starting with his birth in the first section at the west end of the nave, continue with the beginning of his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] in the second or central section and end with his death on the cross in the third most easterly section. Those in the choir are of other [[New Testament]] images related to the creed and to the [[Life of the Virgin]].
[[File:Fanefjord church interior.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Fanefjord: the crossvaults]]

===Fanefjord Church===
[[Fanefjord Church]] on the island of [[Møn]] in southeastern Denmark is richly decorated with frescos which were uncovered from 1932 to 1934 under the guidance of the [[National Museum of Denmark|National Museum]]. In 2009, major restoration work was completed on the frescos, revealing their original colours and impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv2east.dk/artikler/kalkmalerier-i-fanefjord-kirke-video Kalkmalerier i Fanefjord Kirke (VIDEO) from TV2]. In Danish. Retrieved 2 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest paintings, on the triumphal arch, were created around 1350. They depict the [[Four Evangelists]], as well as [[St Christopher]] and [[St George]]. The most famous frescos are however those dating back to about 1500 which cover large areas of the church's ceiling and upper walls. In the so-called [[Biblia pauperum]] style, they present many of the most popular stories from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s in [[Typology (theology)|typological]] juxtapositions. The artist, who can be identified by his emblem, is known simply as the [[Elmelunde Master]] as it was he who also painted the frescos in Møn's [[Elmelunde Church]]. The warm colours ranging from dark red and russet to yellow, green, grey and black are distinctive.
[[File:Keldby kirke.jpg|200px|left|thumbnail|Keldby Church: the nave]]

===Keldby Church===
[[Keldby Church]], 4&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Stege, Denmark|Stege]], is one of the three churches on Møn decorated by the [[Elmelunde Master]], probably towards the end of the 15th century. In the so-called [[Biblia pauperum]] style, the paintings present many of the most popular stories from the Old and New Testaments. There are also a number of earlier frescos in the church dating back to about 1275.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insula-moenia.dk/keldby_church.html Keldby Church from Insula Moenia.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309175128/http://www.insula-moenia.dk/keldby_church.html |date=9 March 2008 }} Retrieved 12 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scania]], in the south of [[Sweden]], was a Danish province until 1658. Many of its churches are decorated with frescos, very similar in style to those of Denmark.

===Vittskövle Church===
The [[Vittskövle Church|church in Vittskövle]], a small village near [[Kristianstad]], has a wide variety of wall paintings dating back to the 15th century. They are contained principally in the cross vaults above the nave. The most notable examples are those of the [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]] and the [[fall of man|Fall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordenskirker.dk/Tidligere/Vitskovle_kirke/Vitskovle_kirke.htm Vittskövle kirke from Nordens Kirker (in Danish)].

The vaults in St Anne's chapel also have wall paintings. On the eastern side, we see the [[four evangelists]] while on the western side there are three female saints: [[St Barbara]], [[St Ursula]], [[Gertrude the Great|St Gertrude]] and [[Catherine of Alexandria|St Catherine]].

==Other churches with wall paintings==
[[File:Højby odsherred church dragonfresco.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Højby: Dragon with St George]]
There are hundreds of Danish churches where wall paintings have been discovered, often in a very poor state. Indeed, in some cases they have been limewashed once again as it was not worthwhile restoring them. On the other hand, many have been uncovered and restored and can be seen today. Listed below are a number of churches, region by region, where wall paintings are of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Henning Dehn-Nielsen. Kirker og Klostre i Danmark.

*[[Tuse Church]] near [[Holbæk]] in northwestern Zealand is richly decorated with both Romanesque and late Gothic murals. It is however the latter which are regarded as possibly the finest works of the [[Isefjord]] artists who were most active from 1460 to 1480. The pictures depict stories from the Old and New Testaments but the life of Jesus is particularly interesting as it combines the biblical accounts with images of kings, devils and women brewing beer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dac.dk/visKanonVaerk.asp?artikelID=2584 Tuse Kirke from DAC's Værkleksikon.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719123654/http://www.dac.dk/visKanonVaerk.asp?artikelID=2584 |date=19 July 2011 }} In Danish.

===Southern Jutland===
[[File:Brøns kirke - Wandmalerei - Leere Bulle 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Brøns: Pope with an empty [[papal bull|bull]]]]
*Brøns Church, located in [[Southern Jutland]], south of [[Ribe]], contains two [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] frescos, dating from c. 1530, which are probably Denmark's only examples of church frescos with distinctly Lutheran messages. One shows a heavenly castle under siege. An army led by pope and bishops try to gain access to it by force, while [[Christ]] — guarding its [[city gate]] — rejects them. Another image shows the pope and a number of bishops presenting a large [[papal bull]], carrying a total of 11 ecclesiastic [[seal (device)|seal]]s but no text. It is unknown whether this has always been the case, but the presence of two [[Jester|fools]], one of them holding a pair of [[reading glasses]], indicates that this is the intention; the Catholic Church is presented as without content. Below, a monk, standing a front of a group of men holding [[letter of indulgence|letters of indulgence]] is confronted by another group of people holding similar letters.&lt;ref&gt;Saxtorph, Niels M. (1967), ''Jeg ser på kalkmalerier'', Politikens Forlag, pp. 349-351&lt;/ref&gt; This protest scene against the sale of indulgences is inspired by a contemporary woodcarving by [[Nuremberg]] artist, [[Hans Sebald Beham]], who was staunchly anti-Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broensvodder.dk/page2/ H.

==Problems of restoration==
While restoration techniques are constantly improving, the frescos are increasingly endangered by the heating systems installed in churches and by other activities such as concerts which now take place in the churches. Unless alternative solutions are found, the only secure way to preserve the paintings would be to cover them with limewash once again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natmus.dk/cons/walls/chrchpnt.htm Introduction to Danish wall paintings - Conservation ethics and methods of treatment from the National Museum of Denmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124021603/http://www.natmus.dk/cons/walls/chrchpnt.htm |date=24 November 2009 }}.

They consist of a [[wikt:concave|concave]] depression, no more than a few centimetres across, pecked into a rock surface and often surrounded by concentric circles also etched into the stone. Sometimes a linear channel called a [[wikt:Special:Search/gutter|gutter]] leads out from the middle.  
The decoration occurs as a [[petroglyph]] on natural boulders and outcrops and also as an element of [[megalithic art]] on purposely worked [[megalith]]s such as the slab [[cist]]s of the [[Food Vessel culture]], some [[stone circle]]s and [[passage grave]]s such as the [[clava tomb]]s and on the [[Coping (architecture)|capstones]] at [[Newgrange]].

Similar patterns are known in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/11655/1/1995_Proceedings%20Prehistoric%20Society%2061_BradleyCriadoFabregas_Rock%20art%20Galicia.pdf|title=R.

Precisely dating megalithic art is difficult: even if the megalithic monument can be dated, the art may be a later addition. The [[Hunterheugh Crags]] cup and ring marks near [[Alnwick]] in [[Northumberland]] have recently been demonstrated to date back into the [[Early Neolithic]] era through their [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] relationship with other, datable features. Some cup marks have been found in [[Iron Age]] contexts but these may represent re-used stones.

Where they are etched onto natural, flat stone it has been observed that they seem to incorporate the natural surface of the rock. Those at Hunterheugh are mostly connected to one another by gutters that can channel rainwater from one to the next, down the sloping top of the stone.
It has been suggested by [[archaeologist]] [[Clive Waddington]] that the initial Early Neolithic impetus to create the marks was forgotten and that the practice fell into abeyance until a second phase of creation continued the basic tradition but with less precision and more variability in design. The markers of this second phase moved the art from natural stones to megaliths as its symbolism was reinterpreted by Later Neolithic and Early Bronze Age people.

Their purpose is unknown although some may be connected with natural stone outcrops exploited by Neolithic peoples to make polished stone axes. A religious purpose has been suggested.
[[Alexander Thom]] suggested in a [[BBC]] [[television]] documentary, ''Cracking the Stone Age Code'', in 1970, "I have an idea, entirely nebulous at the moment, that the cup and ring markings were a method of recording, of writing, and that they may indicate, once we can read them, what a particular stone was for. We have seen the cup and ring markings on the stone at [[Kilmartin Glen|Temple Wood]], and that's on the main stone but we can't interpret them ...yet."&lt;ref name="The Spectator"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spectator, p. 608|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oBw-AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 April 2011|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created diagrams and carried out analysis of over 50 of the cup and ring markings from which he determined a length he termed the [[Megalithic Yard|Megalithic Inch]] (MI).&lt;ref&gt;Systematics: The Journal of the Institute for the comparative study of History, Philosophy and the Sciences, Vol. 6, Number 3, Coombe Spring Press., December 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

This whole idea has been ignored almost completely apart from a critical analysis carried out by Alan Davis in the 1980s, who tested Thom's hypothesis on cup and ring sites in England by examining the separations of neighbouring cupmark centres. He found some weak evidence for the "Megalithic Inch" but it was not statistically significant, and he suggested "strongest indications...towards the use of a quantum close in value to 5 MI at certain sites" and that "the apparent quantum seems strongly associated with ringed cups."&lt;ref name="Ruggles2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Davis in Clive Ruggles|title=Records in Stone: Papers in Memory of Alexander Thom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZ3JGYd1kJoC&amp;pg=PA422|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=13 February 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53130-6|pages=392–422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis made an initial effort to build on Thom's start, and to answer the question he posed: "Why should a man spend hours – or rather days – cutting cups in a random fashion on a rock? It would indeed be a breakthrough if someone could crack the code of the cups."&lt;ref name="Ruggles2003"/&gt;

Subsequently, Davis investigated the idea that the prehistoric carvers used an elementary method of diameter-construction in laying out the carvings. This investigation (incorporating both Scottish and English sites) suggested a possible explanation for many of the characteristic shapes of carved rings, and also produced evidence in the ring diameters for the use of a unit of measurement close to Thom's MI (and 5 MI) that was of high statistical significance. The evidence is consistent with the use of rough measures such as hand- and finger-widths (rather than the formal, accurate system proposed by Thom), but the important conclusion is that a similar design ritual, apparently involving a consistent measurement system of some kind, was in use over a wide geographical area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacKie|first1=E.

'''Daniel Thomas O'Bannon''' (September 30, 1946 – December 17, 2009) was an American film [[screenwriter]], [[film director|director]], [[visual effects supervisor]], and occasional actor, usually in the [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] genres.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

O'Bannon is best known for having written the screenplay for ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', adapted from a story he wrote with [[Ronald Shusett]], and writing and directing the horror comedy ''[[The Return of the Living Dead]]''. He also contributed computer animation to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' and worked on cult classics such as ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'', ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', and ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]''.

==Early life==
O'Bannon was born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], the son of Bertha ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Lowenthal) and Thomas Sidney O'Bannon, a carpenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/40/Dan-O-Bannon.html |title=Dan O'Bannon Biography (1946-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the art school of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], where he did stand-up comedy routines, did make-up for campus theater productions, and provided illustrations for Student Life, the student newspaper.  While there he roomed with future movie producer [[Michael Shamberg]]. O'Bannon moved home briefly after [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] and attended [[St. Louis Community College–Florissant Valley|Florissant Valley Junior College]] where he wrote and directed a short science fiction satire titled "The Attack of the 50-foot Chicken." O'Bannon also attended MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Illinois.  He then attended the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) film school, where he met [[John Carpenter]] and collaborated with him on the science fiction student film ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974).

==Career==

===Early work===
Carpenter expanded the ''Dark Star'' short into a feature which was released in 1974 with a final budget of only US$60,000. O'Bannon served in a number of capacities, including scripting, editing and acting in one of the leading roles ("Pinback"). In 1975, ''Dark Star'' won the [[Saturn Award|Golden Scroll]] award (the Saturn Awards' original name) for [[Saturn Award for Best Special Effects|Best Special Effects]].

O'Bannon, growing up a science-fiction and horror enthusiast, abandoned technical work (including a stint as a computer animator on [[George Lucas]]' classic ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'') for screenwriting.

===1970s===
O'Bannon attended USC Film School and lived near the Los Angeles Campus in an old two-story house affectionately called the "Menlo Manor" which he shared with other USC students (Don Jakoby, who collaborated on several screenplays with Dan including ''Blue Thunder''; and Jeffrey J. Lee, who became a well-known artist in Europe). Part of his student film ''Dark Star'' was filmed there, with O'Bannon co-starring as Sgt. Pinback. He spent many late nights in old Hollywood editing his and other student films. His wish was to become a director. ''Dark Star'' was edited by O'Bannon using a 1940s Moviola.

He was attached to supervise special effects for an [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] production of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', but this fell apart in 1975 and the movie was never made as the major Hollywood studios were wary of financing the picture with Jodorowsky as director.  O'Bannon's role is prominently featured in the 2013 documentary ''[[Jodorowsky's Dune]]''.  The collapse of ''Dune'' left O'Bannon broke, homeless, and dependent on friends for his survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18438 |title=R.I.P. Dan O'Bannon}}&lt;/ref&gt; While living with his friend [[Ronald Shusett]], they came up with the story for O'Bannon's career-making film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), for which he wrote the screenplay and supervised visuals.

===1980s===
In 1981, O'Bannon helped create the animated feature ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', writing two of its segments ("Soft Landing" and "B-17").  O'Bannon voiced his displeasure with his next big-budget outing, [[John Badham]]'s ''[[Blue Thunder]]'' (1983), an action film about a Los Angeles [[helicopter]] surveillance team. Originally written with Don Jakoby, ''Blue Thunder'' also underwent extensive rewriting, losing some of its political content.  He and Jakoby also scripted ''[[Lifeforce (film)|Lifeforce]]'' (1985), a movie based on [[Colin Wilson]]'s novel ''[[The Space Vampires]]'' and directed by [[Tobe Hooper]] that veers from [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] visitation to [[Vampire|vampirism]] and an [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] ending. It was not well received at the time, and was considered a [[box office]] [[box office bomb|flop]].  O'Bannon would again collaborate with Jakoby and Hooper for the 1986 remake ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]''. Purists considered it inferior to the 1950s original and it also performed poorly at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=Invaders from Mars|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=invadersfrommars.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Bannon also worked as a consultant for ''[[C.H.U.D.]]'', helping to create the design concept for the title creatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chudfacts.com/#financing C.H.U.D. Facts]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, O'Bannon moved into the director's chair with ''[[Return of the Living Dead]]''. Like ''Alien'', the film met with success, spawned numerous sequels, and became a cult classic.

===1990s===
In 1990, O'Bannon and Shusett re-teamed to make ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'', an adaptation of the short story "[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]" by [[Philip K. Dick]]. This was a project the two had been working on since collaborating on ''Alien''. The film earned well over US$100 million.  An earlier screenplay by the duo titled ''Hemoglobin'' was also produced as the low budget feature ''[[Bleeders (film)|Bleeders]]'' (1997).

O'Bannon's second directorial feature, ''[[The Resurrected]]'' (1991), was a low-budget horror effort released direct-to-video. Based on the writings of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], it focused on a family's ancient rituals that awaken the dead. In 1995, O'Bannon received a co-writing credit for the sci-fi film ''[[Screamers (1995 film)|Screamers]]'' adapted from the Philip K. Dick story "[[Second Variety]]", having written the initial version of the screenplay with [[Michael Campus]] in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35037/rest-peace-dan-obannon |title=Rest in Peace: Dan O'Bannon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

In 2001, O'Bannon was the [[artist-in-residence|filmmaker-in-residence]] at [[Chapman University]]'s [[Dodge College of Film and Media Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scriptmag.com/features/screenwriting-the-dan-obannon-way |title=Screenwriting the Dan O’Bannon Way |author=Script Magazine |date=13 February 2013 |website=Script |publisher=F+W |access-date=19 September 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De strijkster''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The Ironer'') is a painting by [[Rik Wouters]] in the [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp]]  ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen''). It is one of many scenes from daily life from which the painter found inspiration and took as a subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rik Wouters 1882-1926.

The picture shows a woman in a comfortable domestic setting bending over a table ironing a blue garment. She wears a pink dress over a white shirt and is looking up from her work at the viewer.

== Style ==
The colours in the work are strong; the brushwork is loose and expressive. In style it has links to [[Impressionism]], [[Fauvism]] and [[Expressionism]] and all these approaches have been referenced in regard to this work. In 1912, the time of this painting, Wouters had been staying in Paris, where he discovered the colours of [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]] and [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Claude Monet|Monet]]'s landscapes, and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]'s women. His own palette became brighter and more vibrant; its intensity and the turbulence of the surface recalling Fauvism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kunstbus.nl/kunst/rik+wouters.html|title=Rik Wouters|last=|first=|date=15 October 2008|website=Kunstbus (Dutch)|publisher=|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he also travelled to Cologne and Düsseldorf where he admired the works of [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] and [[German Expressionism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Subject and precedents ==

The subject of laundresses and washerwomen attracted the French Impressionist painters who had begun to take an interest in the working lives of ordinary people. Both contemporary social concerns as well as themes of industrial modernity had informed such works in the decades preceding Wouter's ''The Ironer''.&lt;ref name="Repasseuses" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Impressionism and the modern Landscape: productivity, technology, and urbanization from Manet to Van Gogh|last=Rubin|first=James|publisher=University of California Press|year=2008|isbn=9780520248014|location=Berkeley|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among painters who produced notable works on this theme were [[Edgar Degas]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Berthe Morisot]]. Morisot had done ''Hanging the Laundry out to Dry'' in 1875 and ''The Farmer Hanging Laundry.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.artsy.net/artwork/berthe-morisot-hanging-the-laundry-out-to-dry Morisot (1875) ''Hanging the Laundry out to Dry'']&lt;/ref&gt; The former uses softer pinks and blues than Wouter's, and the latter has a pale, subtle palette in contrast to Wouter's vibrant one.

Washerwomen had become one of Degas's favourite subjects between 1869 and 1895. His ''Repasseuses'', the third of a series of four, shows one woman yawning and another leaning heavily on her iron.&lt;ref name="Repasseuses"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edgar Degas ''Repasseuses'' (''Women Ironing'')|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/women-ironing-2236.html?tx_commentaire_pi1[pidLi]=509&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1[from]=841&amp;cHash=e1121cba6c|website=Musee d'Orsay|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with Wouter's ''Ironer'', the French artists' laundresses are shown in a more commercial/industrial context.

[[George Washington Lambert]] had also produced ''The Laundresses'' about 1901&lt;ref name="QAGOMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collection.qagoma.qld.gov.au/qag/imu.php?request=display&amp;port=45001&amp;id=6dea&amp;flag=start&amp;offset=0&amp;count=20&amp;view=list&amp;PublishOnIMuInternet=Y&amp;CreCreatorLocal_tab=LAMBERT,%20George%20W|title=Lambert, George W|publisher=Queensland Art Gallery Gallery of Modern Art|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''La Blanchisseuse (The French Landlady)'' in the same year but without the expressive use of colour. The latter in particular was a formal group composition concerned with unity of effect in tones of black and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=George W.

In the same year as ''De strijkster,'' Australian [[Vida Lahey]] produced a narrative painting of the domestic weekly washing routine which at the time, was normally done on Mondays. It showed the physicality of the work. She gave it the title &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Monday morning".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tv.qagoma.qld.gov.au/2014/04/09/vida-lahey-australian-art-collection-cc/|title=Monday morning|last=|first=|date=1 January 2013|website=QAGOMA TV|publisher=Queensland Art Gallery/Gallery of Modern Art|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Educating Rita''''' is a stage comedy by British playwright [[Willy Russell]]. It is a play for two actors set entirely in the office of an [[Open University]] lecturer.

Commissioned by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], ''Educating Rita'' premièred at [[Donmar Warehouse|The Warehouse]], London, in June 1980 starring [[Julie Walters]] and [[Mark Kingston]]. The play was directed by [[Mike Ockrent]].

==Plot summary==
The plays follows the relationship between a 26-year-old [[Liverpudlian]] [[working class]] hairdresser and Frank, a middle-aged university lecturer, during the course of a year.&lt;ref&gt;Act 1 consists of seven scenes running from January to May, and Act 2 a further seven running from September to December. Source: Programme for run at [[Liverpool Playhouse]], 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In the play Frank has no surname, but when the film was made he became Dr. Frank Bryant.

Susan (who initially calls herself Rita), dissatisfied with the routine of her work and social life, seeks inner growth by signing up for and attending an Open University course in English Literature. The play opens as 'Rita' meets her tutor, Frank, for the first time. Frank is a middle-aged, alcoholic career academic who has taken on the tutorship to pay for his drink. The two have an immediate and profound effect on one another; Frank is impressed by Susan's verve and earnestness and is forced to re-examine his attitudes and position in life; Susan finds Frank's tutelage opens doors to a bohemian lifestyle and a new self-confidence. However, Frank's bitterness and cynicism return as he notices Susan beginning to adopt the pretensions of the university culture he despises. Susan becomes disillusioned by a friend's attempted suicide and realises that her new social niche is rife with the same dishonesty and superficiality she had previously sought to escape. The play ends as Frank, sent to Australia on a sabbatical, welcomes the possibilities of the change.

==Themes==
The play deals with the concept of freedom, change, England's class system, the shortcomings of institutional education, and the nature of self-development and of personal relationships. The play borrows from the [[George Bernard Shaw]] play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', itself based upon [[Pygmalion (mythology)|archetypes from Greek myth]].

==Film adaptation==
[[File:Educating rita uk.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for the film.]]
{{main|Educating Rita (film)}}

The play was adapted by Russell for a 1983 film with [[Michael Caine]] and [[Julie Walters]], directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]].

==Radio adaptation==
The play was adapted by Russell for radio in 2009 – see ''[[Kirsty Williams (drama)#Educating Rita|Educating Rita (radio play)]]''. It starred [[Bill Nighy]] and Laura Dos Santos directed by [[Kirsty Williams (drama)|Kirsty Williams]], and was a 90-minute play broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] on [[Boxing Day]] 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00pdkqx BBC – Saturday Play – ''Educating Rita'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revivals==
From June–July 2001, the [[Williamstown Theatre Festival]] mounted a production of Educating Rita at the Nikos Stage starring [[Jacqueline McKenzie]] as Rita and [[Edward Herrmann]] as Frank. The production was directed by [[Bruce Paltrow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wtfestival.org/main-events/educating-rita/|title=Educating Rita {{!}} Williamstown Theatre Festival|website=wtfestival.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was critically acclaim with critics touting McKenzie's performance as "wonderfully beguiling and irrepressible...one of the best performances of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iberkshires.com/story/15506/WTF-after-50-years-a-personal-recollection.html|title=WTF after 50 years: a personal recollection|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 26 March-8 May 2010, as part of the Willy Russell season at the [[Menier Chocolate Factory]], Laura Dos Santos reprised her radio performance on stage as Rita alongside [[Larry Lamb]] as Frank. This was the production's first London West End revival.
This production transferred to the [[Trafalgar Studios]] in London's West End from 8 July-30 October 2010, produced by [[Sonia Friedman]]. Laura Dos Santos reprised her radio and Menier Chocolate Factory performance as Rita, and Frank was played by renowned actor [[Tim Pigott-Smith]]. Like the Willy Russell season at the Menier Chocolate Factory, the production ran in [[repertory]] alongside ''[[Shirley Valentine]]'' starring [[Meera Syal]]. A UK tour played in 2012, starring [[Claire Sweeney]] and [[Matthew Kelly]] as Rita and Frank respectively. A 35th anniversary production was staged at [[Liverpool Playhouse]] from 6 February to 7 March 2015, starring Leanne Best as Rita and Con O'Neill as Frank, directed by Gemma Bodinetz.  The same year the Chichester Festival staged a production with Lenny Henry and Lashana Lynch as Frank and Rita.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2015/jun/24/lenny-henry-educating-rita-minerva-chichester&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''electronic registration mark''' is a proposed category of '''[[trademark]]''' that would restrict the use of trademarked words and phrases in online advertising.

The State of [[Utah]] proposed this in response to trademark owners' claims that online advertisers have abused trademarked terms. Some online advertisers, particularly [[search engine]]s, allow trademarked keywords to generate advertisements for a trademark holder’s competitors.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://www.google.com/tm_complaint_adwords.html#1|title=Adwords Trademark Complaint Procedure| work=Google|accessdate=2007-04-19}} &lt;/ref&gt; Several corporations have sued search engines to stop this practice, claiming that it violates United States trademark law. In most of these cases, courts have ruled that traditional trademark law, as currently written, does not restrict advertisers’ ability to use trademarked terms to trigger advertisements. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/geicogoogleaug2005.pdf|title=Government Employees Insurance Co. v.

The [http://le.utah.gov/~2007/bills/sbillamd/sb0236.htm Utah Trademark Protection Act] created the electronic registration mark. Under this now defunct law, trademark holders could have restricted the use of its registered trademarks to generate advertisements for products that compete directly with the trademarked product. The owner of the mark could have sought redress from two parties: The competitor that purchased the advertisement, and the website that displayed the keyword-generated advertisement. This law applied only to internet pages viewed within the State of Utah. The law had instructed the state to create a searchable database of electronic registration marks and to provide access to this database free of charge. This became Utah law in 2007 but was repealed in 2008 before implementation. 

No other states have established electronic registration mark laws, and the federal government's trademark law does not clearly address how it applies to online keyword searching. Judges in [[France]] have consistently upheld rulings that French trademark law bans the sale of trademarked search terms in keyword advertising for any website viewed from within France. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/03/17/HNgooglefranceadwords_1.html |title=Google France loses appeal in AdWords trademark dispute, March 17, 2005 |work=Infoworld |accessdate=2007-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915060913/http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/03/17/HNgooglefranceadwords_1.html |archivedate=2007-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Critics find several flaws with electronic registration marks. They argue that restricting the keywords that advertisers can use violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Another issue concerns an advertiser’s ability to determine whether a web page is being viewed in Utah or elsewhere: Because of this ambiguity, the law may be vulnerable to [[Dormant Commerce Clause]] challenges. Critics also assert that the law worsens the quality of online search results by restricting the search results that users can view. Supporters respond that trademark law has always considered trademark infringement to be a form of theft that is not protected speech, that search engines have demonstrated that they can pinpoint Internet users’ locations, and that paid advertisements are not a core component of an Internet user's experience. &lt;ref&gt; Glen Warchol . {{cite web| url= http://www.sltrib.com/search/ci_5684545

'''''From Darkness, the Light''''' ({{lang-hu|Borura derü!}}) or '''''Allegory of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences''''' ({{lang-hu|A Magyar Tudományos Akadémia allegóriája}}) is a monumental painting by [[Johann Ender]] in the Art Collection of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Budapest]]. It is also the official symbol of the institution, the main motif constituting its [[logo]].

==History==

The painting was made by Johann Ender in 1831 and it was signed by the artist on the lower right corner: Johann Ender pinx 1831. The allegorical painting was commissioned by the founder of the academy, Count [[István Széchenyi]] who donated the full annual income of his estates to establish the Hungarian Society of Learning in 1825. The scientific society came into being in 1830. There was a strong personal connection between the client and the artist who went on long journey together in the Mediterranean in 1818. Széchenyi gave many commissions to Ender in the next decades.&lt;ref&gt;Az Ender-ikrek magyar képei, Barátság, 8/3, 2001, p. 3230&lt;/ref&gt;

Ender had to implement the visual program of Széchenyi who closely followed the preparations. The artist made several preparatory drawings. When a serious disagreement broke out, Széchenyi consulted [[Friedrich von Amerling]], the most acclaimed painter in [[Vienna]] at the time. Amerling created an alternative draft but in the end Ender retained the assignment. The same composition was used on the coat of arms and the seal of the society.

On 4 June 1834 Széchenyi announced that he donated the "allegorical painting that constitutes the coat of arms of the society" to the institution. This is commemorated by the inscription in the lower left corner: "A' M. Accademiának emlékül G. Széchenyi István, 1834".

==Description==

The painting shows a young goddess wearing a white [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] and a purple cloak; there is a laurel wreath on her head. In her right hand she is holding up a gold cup, her other hand is resting on a large shield. The goddess is set in a dark landscape, where heavy clouds are gathering on the sky, but the first rays of the light are bursting through the gloom. Two eagles are coming, the first one is approaching the gold cup.

The painting supposedly portrays Count Széchenyi's lover, his later wife, Crescence Seilern. At time of its creation the goddess was identified as [[Minerva]] or [[Amphitrite]] but the composition originated in the very popular subject of Goddess [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] accompanied by the eagle of [[Jupiter]].

In the center of the shield the Hungarian coat-of-arms is flanked by Minerva and Hungaria, the latter woman is veiled but the goddess lifts up her shroud. This is another visual reference to the enlightenment that science could bring to the country. The reliefs of the shield depict a famous episode from ancient history, the meeting of [[Attila]], the ruler of the [[Huns]] with [[Pope Leo I]]. The inspiration for this scene was the famous painting by [[Raphael]] in the [[Apostolic Palace]], [[The Meeting of Leo the Great and Attila]]. At the time the Huns were generally considered the forefathers of the Hungarians.

The painting has the same elaborate [[Rococo]] frame as the contemporary monumental [[Count István Széchenyi (Friedrich von Amerling)|portrait of Count István Széchenyi]] by [[Friedrich von Amerling]].

Garima 2, the earlier of the two, is believed to be the earliest surviving complete [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] Christian manuscript.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/unearthed-the-ancient-texts-that-tell-story-of-christianity-2019188.html|title=Unearthed, the ancient texts that tell story of Christianity|first1=Jerome|last1=Taylor|date=6 July 2010|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/discovery-of-earliest-illuminated.html#st1U6cLh0CFTupQh.97|title=Discovery of earliest illustrated manuscript|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501030359/0http://ethiopianheritagefund.org/artsNewspaper.html|archivedate=May 1, 2012|first1=Martin|last1=Bailey|work=The Art Newspaper|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monastic tradition holds that they were composed at the turn of the sixth century, a date supported by recent [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon analysis]]; samples from Garima 2 proposed a date of {{c.}} 390-570, while counterpart dating of samples from Garima 1 proposed a date of {{c.}} 530-660.&lt;ref name="Bausi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bausi|first1=Alessandro|title=Ethiopia and the Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity: The Garimā Gospels in Context |url=http://www.ethiopianheritagefund.org/document-page-2|publisher=Ethiopian Heritage Fund|accessdate=3 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503173517/http://www.ethiopianheritagefund.org/document-page-2|archivedate=1 May 2017|page=2|format=Summary of conference proceedings|date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the two manuscripts provide the major witness to the Ethiopic version of the [[Gospel]]s and have been applied as proof texts for the creation of critical editions of the Ethiopic Gospels by Rochus Zuurmond ([[Gospel of Mark]], 1989; [[Gospel of Matthew]], 2001) and Michael G Wechsler ([[Gospel of John]], 2005). As such, they represent amongst the earliest versional witnesses to the early [[Byzantine text-type]] of the Gospels, and are the oldest surviving Ethiopian manuscripts of any kind known to modern scholars. Western scholarship had previously believed both gospels to date from {{c.}} 1100 or later on the basis of [[palaeography|palaeographic]] analysis.&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Quedlinburg Itala fragment]] is dated to the 420s to 430s.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gospels are housed in [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Abba Garima Monastery]]. They are not known ever to have left the monastery;&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt; although, as the surrounding area was occupied by Muslims from the ninth to the fourteenth centuries, it is possible that they may have remained hidden in a cave for centuries, and then rediscovered.&lt;ref name=Bailey2&gt;[http://www.ethiopianheritagefund.org/ArtsnewsReport_Garima%20Gospels.pdf "Research uncovers lost African school of painting"] Martin Bailey, The Art Newspaper, December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gospels were included in the catalog of an American museum exhibition that toured from 1993–96, ''African Zion: the Sacred Art of Ethiopia'', but were never actually lent to the exhibition.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;

==Tradition==

Monastic tradition ascribes the gospel books to Saint [[Abba Garima]], said to have arrived in Ethiopia in 494.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt; Abba Garima is one of the [[Nine Saints]] traditionally said to have come from '[[Rome]]' (often thought to refer to [[Syria]]), and to have Christianized the rural populations of the ancient Ethiopian kingdom of [[Axum]] in the sixth century; and the monks regard the Gospels less as significant antiquities than as sacred relics of Abba Garima.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt; According to tradition, Abba Garima wrote and illustrated the complete Gospels in a single day: God stopped the sun from setting until the Saint completed his work.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Definitive radiocarbon tests have indeed supported the dating  Abba Garima 2, the earlier of the two books, to the sixth century,&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt; but otherwise recent research tends to contra-indicate many aspects of the traditional account, proposing instead that the text-base for the Garima gospels is Greek, not Syriac, that the iconography and palaeography look to Egyptian not Syrian sources, and that the gospel translation witnessed in the Garima gospels had been completed over a century before the traditional dates for the Nine Saints. Furthermore, the supposed Syrian origin of the Nine Saints is no longer maintained in most recent scholarship.&lt;ref name=Niccum&gt;Rochus Zuurmond and Curt Niccum, "The Ethiopic Version of the New Testament", in "The Text of the New Testament in Contemporary Research" 2nd edn, Bart D Ehrman and Michael W Holmes eds, Brill, 2013, pp 231-252&lt;/ref&gt;

==The manuscripts==
[[File:Garima Gospels.jpg|thumb|Two pages with illuminated [[Eusebian Canons]] from Garima 1, likely the later of the two Garima Gospels]]
There are two manuscripts, Garima 1 and Garima 2, of which Garima 2 is likely to be the earlier. In older reference works, Garima 1 is designated Garima I, while Garima 2 is designated Garima III. Before recent restoration, a third, probably 14th century, gospel book had been bound with Garima 2, and this later gospel was then denoted Garima II.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Donald M Davies,'The Dating of Ethiopic Manuscripts' in Journal of Near Eastern Studies 46:4, 1987, p 293 .&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent restoration has separated the three books, and repaginated in the original order and volumes; relocating a number of folios and miniatures which over the centuries had been displaced between the three manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Lester Capon, [http://www.hewit.com/skin_deep/?volume=26&amp;article=1#article] "Extreme Bookbinding; A Fascinating Preservation Project in Ethiopia, Skin Deep 46, Autumn 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Garima 1 has 348 surviving pages, opening with eleven illuminated [[canon tables]] in arcades, followed by the Gospel texts in [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]]; the Ethiopic language of the Kingdom of Axum from the 4th to the 7th centuries, which  became and remains the religious language of the Ethiopian Church. Garima 2, also in Ge'ez, is a 322-page folio written by a different scribe. It has seventeen illuminated pages, including four fine [[Evangelist portrait]]s preceding their respective gospels, and a separate portrait of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] preceding his canon tables.&lt;ref name=Bailey2/&gt;  The portraits of Matthew, Luke and John are all presented frontally and scarcely differentiated; but that of Mark presents him in profile on the episcopal throne of [[Alexandria]]. A further illuminated page depicts the [[Temple of Solomon]], or perhaps the [[Fountain of Life]], with a staircase of unusual form unique in  Christian [[iconography]].&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mercier&gt;Jacques Mercier,[http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/121872/garima_conference_oxford.pdf], Flyer for the Oxford Conference, Ethiopian Heritage Fund, November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The miniatures are in a broadly [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] style, and are stylistically consistent with a sixth century date. While the text was certainly written in Ethiopia, some scholars such as Marilyn Heldman, had maintained that the illuminated pages might have been imported ready-made from [[ancient Syria]] or [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]]; whereas Jacques Mercier now argues that both text and illuminations were produced within Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt; Some of the illustrations can be seen at [http://www.hewit.com/skin_deep/?volume=26&amp;article=1#article].

The texts of the two manuscripts differ such that Garima 1 does not appear to descend directly from Garima 2, implying that the common translation from which they derive is likely to be substantially earlier still; and that consequently the Ethiopian Gospel translation may be older than previously believed.&lt;ref name=Mercier/&gt;

Neither manuscript has a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]. However, in Garima II (the 14th century gospel book formerly bound with Garima 2) there is a historical note on two intruded leaves at the end of the [[Gospel of Luke]], referring to the repair of churches undertaken by a King Armeho. Armeho may be identified with the King [[Armah]] of Axum, who issued coins between 600 and 640.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt; Getatchew Haile, in translating the notes of the manuscripts, leaves open the possibility that this note may be attributed to the period of the king's reign.&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt;

The two front covers are also very old; that of Garima 1 possibly contemporary with the manuscript, which would probably make it the oldest book cover still attached to its book in the world (the 7th century [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] is the oldest European one). It is in gilt-copper with a wooden backing boards and its decoration centres on a large cross. Holes that may have been settings for gems are now empty. The cover for Garima 2 is silver and from the 10th to 12th centuries.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;

A 19th-century church for female [[pilgrim]]s at the edge of the monastery is being renovated to house the precious manuscripts. It has small windows, which will help prevent fading. Steel bars are being inserted and the building will be protected by armed guards.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;

==Expert opinion==

The Garima Gospels first became known outside Ethiopia in 1950, when [[Beatrice Playne]], a  British [[art historian]] visited the monastery. Since women are not allowed inside the monastery, the monks courteously carried several manuscripts outside for her to view. She wrote that, "there were several [[illuminated manuscripts]] whose ornamental headings struck me as Syrian in style."&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Playne, ''St. George for Ethiopia'' (London: Constable, 1954), p. 103. In a footnote, Playne adds that the ornamental headings "closely resembled the canonical headings in the [[Rabbula Gospels|Gospels of Rabula]] ([[Laurentian Library]], Florence)."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s Frenchman [[Jules Leroy]] examined the manuscripts and proposed that they dated from c. 1100.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;  Until recently, few other outside scholars had seen the manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;

The two Garima Gospels became known to bibilical scholars through microfilm photographs collected by Donald M Davies; who realised that they represented a much earlier text than that of any other surviving Ethiopian manuscript. He dated all three Garima gospel books (including Garima II then bound with Garima 2) to the 8th-10th centuries.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt; Following Davies, and using his photographs, the Garima Gospels formed the base text used by Rochus Zuurmond in his preparation of a critical text for the Ethiopic Gospels; choosing Garima 1 as his primary proof text. Garima 1 and Garima 2 form together Zuurmond's class 'Aa' text or ''Versio Antiqua'', which he states as being "a type which might be more or less the original", in that no later Ethiopic manuscript could be envisaged as conveying substantial information about the original translation except in those passages where neither Garima text survives or is readable.  Zuurmond dated all three Garima gospel books later than Davies had done "In my opinion they cannot be safely dated later than the 13th century, but are probably one or two centuries earlier". In categorising the text witnessed in Garima 1 and Garima 2, Zuurmond states that it has the characteristics of a "free translation" retaining idiomatic Ge'ez syntax and grammar; while often betraying a limited expertise in Greek grammar, vocabulary and orthography. Later Ethiopic manuscripts (and following them, all previous printed Ethiopic editions) commonly descend from an extensive revision undertaken in the 13th century, by which the Gospel texts were corrected to convey more literal and accurate renderings of Greek word order and terminology, and also to conform more closely to [[Bible translations into Arabic|Egyptian Arabic]] versions. Stripping away these later changes, Zuurmond classifies the Garima texts as "early Byzantine"; while emphasising that, especially in the Gospel of John, its readings often appear to witness a version of the Byzantine Text that differs from the later [[Majority Text]]; "In about half my sample cases [in John] Eth goes against the Ethiopic equivalent of the Greek Majority Text".&lt;ref&gt;Rochus Zuurmond, "The Ethiopic Version of the New Testament", in "The Text of the New Testament in Contemporary Research", Bart D Ehrman and Michael W Holmes eds, Eeerdmans, 1995, pp 142-156&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Mercier a French expert in [[Ethiopian art]], examined the manuscripts at the monastery; and, because the manuscripts were deteriorating to the point where they crumbled every time they were examined, he was permitted in 2000 to take two small detached fragments of [[parchment]] to the Oxford University Research Laboratory for Archaeology. One sample from an evangelist page in Garima 2 was dated to 330–540; and the other, from a different canon table page but not definitely a different manuscript, to 430–650.&lt;ref name=Bausi2&gt;Alessandro Bausi, [https://www.academia.edu/1231740/The_True_Story_of_the_Abba_Garima_Gospels], "The True Story of the Abba Garima Gospels", Comparative Oriental Manuscript Studies Newsletter, January 2011, pp 17-19&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on stylistic aspects of the work, Mercier then estimated that the two gospels dated from c. 600.&lt;ref name=Bausi2/&gt; This accords with the date proposed by Marilyn Heldman in the catalog to the 1993 Exhibition ''African Zion: the Sacred Art of Ethiopia''.  Marilyn Heldman had previously contributed notes on the illuminated pages of Garima 1 and Garima 2 to Donald Davies's study of dating Ethiopic manuscripts, in which she had argued that the correct depiction of classical architectural forms in the Garima canon tables precluded a date later than the sixth century; while the nearest parallels to the evangelist portraits (especially the forms of furniture depicted in the portrait of Mark) were also of that century.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;

Mercier's proposal of a much earlier date for the Garima Gospels was taken into account in the revision of Zuurmond's work undertaken by Curt Niccum in 2013.  Niccum accepts Mercier's carbon-dating of the Garima Gospels to the sixth century, noting that this is consistent with the observation by Michael Knibb that the text of surviving '[[Kaleb of Axum|Kaleb]]' Ge'ez Gospel inscriptions dating from around 525 conform with the form of text in the Garima Gospels, rather than with that found in later Ethiopic manuscripts and editions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Knibb, "Translating the Bible: The Ethiopic Version of the Old Testament", OUP, 1999, pp 46-54&lt;/ref&gt;  He concludes that "more and more evidence points to a considerably earlier period of translation"; arguing that most of the work of translating the New Testament into [[Ge'ez]] must have been completed in Axum before the end of the fourth century. In particular. Niccum noted the recent identification in surviving manuscripts of an 'Aksumite Collection' of church canons and patristic extracts, whose translation into Ge'ez can be confidently dated to the fifth century; and which presupposes the Gospels in a Ge'ez version.&lt;ref name=Niccum/&gt;

In November 2013, a two-day conference was held at the [[Ioannou Centre for Classical and Byzantine Studies]] at Oxford, sponsored by the [[Ethiopian Heritage Fund]], with the title "Ethiopia and the Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity: The Garima Gospels in Context".&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt; During restoration work further sample fragments had been collected under controlled conditions from text and illustrated pages of both manuscripts; as a result of which Jacques Mercier was able to report definitive radio-carbon datings of the two Garima Gospels; 390 to 570 for Garima 2, and 530 to 660 for Garima 1.&lt;ref name=Bailey2/&gt; These dating ranges would suggest that the Garima 2 manuscript is highly likely to be earlier than the Syriac illustrated [[Rabbula Gospels]] now in the collection of the Laurentian Library in [[Florence, Italy]] and explicitly dated to 586.&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt; Mercier proposed the [[Cotton Genesis]], [[Vienna Genesis]] and [[Rossano Gospels]] as comparable (though undated) illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Bailey2/&gt; Otherwise papers presented at the conference included the first full published translation by Getatchew Haile of the various historical notes found in the two gospel books; together with various iconographic and palaeographic studies, including a paper from Jacques Mercier arguing that the common grid of scored lines underlying both illustrations and text demonstrates that both were executed in Ethiopia, and that consequently a school of painting and a workshop for the production of manuscripts must have been active in the Kingdom of Axum in [[Late Antiquity]].&lt;ref name=Bailey2/&gt; Alessandro Bausi presented a paper comparing the Ge'ez language and palaeography of the Garima gospels with those found in a recently identified manuscript witness to the 'Aksumite Collection' or 'Synod of Qefrya'; an edited compendium of selected Greek synodical texts, which is believed to have been translated into Ge'ez in the later fifth century.&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt;

'''Glasgow Print Studio''' is an arts organisation situated in [[Glasgow, Scotland]].  Founded in 1972, Glasgow Print Studio is an organisation with charitable status that exists to encourage and promote the art of printmaking; it is supported by the [[Creative Scotland]] and [[Glasgow City Council]].

Providing facilities for the production of [[etchings]], [[relief prints]] and [[screenprints]], Glasgow Print Studio has a membership of over 300 artists who use the custom-built printmakers workshop.  The Studio also has two exhibition spaces hosting an exhibitions programme.  It also runs a learning programme focused on teaching and developing understanding of fine art [[printmaking]].

As well as providing subsidised printmaking facilities to artists, the Studio also supports its artist members by promoting and selling their art work in the gallery, on its web site and at international art fairs.

The Studio also has a print publishing programme, where an artist is invited to the studio to work with a master printmaker to make an edition of original prints.  It has worked with a range of Scottish and international artists, including [[Elizabeth Blackadder]], [[John Byrne (playwright)|John Byrne]], [[Peter Howson]], [[Christine Borland]], [[Alasdair Gray]]. These publications can be seen in the gallery and on the Studio's web site. 

History: 

In 1972 a group of graduates from Glasgow School of Art set up Glasgow Print Studio in a flat in [[Finnieston]]. Finding nowhere that they could continue printmaking after graduation, they were supported by the [[Glasgow School of Art]]'s Head of Printmaking, Philip Reeves, to establish their own workshop.

As membership of the organisation increased, the 1976 move to Ingram Street in the city centre provided a larger workshop plus a gallery. Here, artists had a space to sell their work and the programme ranged from contemporary print to the popular Scottish Cartoonists exhibition and a retrospective by [[L. S. Lowry|LS Lowry]]. At Ingram Street, the Print Studio was at the centre of a social and artistic whirl. Bands played and plays were performed in the gallery, while the Print Studio Press published books by Scottish writers including [[Liz Lochhead|Liz Lochead]] and [[Alasdair Gray]]. The Studio also organised an annual Midsummer Ball, which became a key event in Glasgow’s social calendar.

Fruitful relationships have developed with established artists such as [[Elizabeth Blackadder]], [[Adrian Wiszniewski]], Scott Myles, [[Jim Lambie]], [[Claire Barclay]], [[Ciara Phillips|Ciara Philips]] and [[John Byrne (playwright)|John Byrne]], who work collaboratively with the Studio’s master printers. The Studio offers both traditional and digital printing facilities and uses its expertise to work with contemporary galleries like [[The Modern Institute]]. Over forty years after its establishment, Glasgow Print Studio continues to play a vital role in encouraging and supporting a vibrant artistic community.

Unique to Scotland’s cultural landscape and central to the development of Glasgow’s [[Merchant City]] as the city's vibrant cultural quarter, the studio's workshop, galleries, archive, education space and other facilities now span three floors of Glasgow’s centre for art and creativity, [[Trongate 103.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5498">[[File:Konstantinsmedaillon.jpg|thumb|Silver [[medallion]] of 315; Constantine with a [[chi-rho]] symbol as the crest of his helmet]]
The '''Helmet of Constantine''' was a helmet or form of helmet worn by the Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great]], now lost, which featured in his imperial [[iconography]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Alföldi]], "The Helmet of Constantine with the Christian Monogram", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 22, Part 1: Papers Dedicated to Sir George Macdonald K.C.B. (1932), pp. 9-23, Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/297083 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a story recorded by [[Ambrose]] and others, it included [[relic]]s gathered in the [[Holy Land]] by his mother, empress [[Helena (empress)|Helena]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qQsA7gE6UoC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq ''Ambrose Of Milan: Political Letters And Speeches''], pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine’s conversion to [[Christianity]], which happened around AD 300, was of great importance. In this period it was believed that touching the body of the deceased or even something that came in contact with the person who had died, was said to have special powers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell]], ''Relics of Christ''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=various&gt;''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities''.&lt;/ref&gt;  This belief started a huge obsession with finding these [[relics]] to protect churches, cities, and even people.

==History==
Constantine I was one of these people who was, as they thought, protected because he had a relic in his possession. The helmet that he wore had a piece of the [[True Cross]] that [[Jesus]] was crucified on. After Constantine was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]], he issued the [[Edict of Milan]] (313), sending his mother Helena to find the True Cross and to send back what she found. Helena found the cross and sent three nails that were used in the crucifixion of Jesus back to Rome and her son Constantine.

The helmet that Constantine wore included one of the [[Holy Nails]] that Saint Helena found at the crucifixion site. By making the helmet with one of the nails, it was supposed to protect him from any harm. Not only was it a sign of protection, but it was also said to fulfill the prophecy of [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]].&lt;ref name=various /&gt; The prophecy located in the fourteenth chapter of the [[Book of Zechariah]] said that one would come who engraved “Holiness to the Lord” on both the bells of the horses and head piece of the man.&lt;ref name=various /&gt; At this time, the [[Roman emperor]] had the holiest relics known to man.&lt;ref name=various /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2016}}

A rare silver [[medallion]] of 315 shows Constantine with a [[chi-rho]] symbol as the crest of his helmet, and [[Eusebius]]' ''[[Life of Constantine]]'' records that he often wore such a helmet in later life, although it is not visible in other bronze coins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constantinethegreatcoins.com/ Constantine the Great coins], thesis, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine was very aware of this, and let the entire [[Roman Empire]] know that he was the owner of this holy helmet. The emperor had coins made with the image of him wearing his helmet on the front. On every VLLP coin that was made, Constantine was shown wearing his helmet. This was one way that Constantine moved the Roman Empire away from the [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan religion]] and towards [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=coins /&gt; The coins that were made after Constantine acquired his helmet showed that the nail was not the only thing that made his helmet religious. Constantine also had the [[Christogram]] inscribed on the helmet.&lt;ref name=various&gt;''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities''.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also a few religious symbols that were placed on the helmet. The  Christogram was placed on the helmet, which usually represented the cross, but at times it was interpreted as Jesus [[Christ (title)|Christ]] himself. Another one of these symbols was a [[labarum]] piercing a [[dragon]], a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]. This was significant because the serpent was represented as the [[Devil]]. But it was also the symbol for any enemy that the Roman Empire had. Constantine’s helmet stood for the strength that the [[Roman Empire]] had through military force, and God. The helmet was put on the coins to let everyone know of this.&lt;ref name=coins&gt;[http://www.constantinethegreatcoins.com/ Constantine the Great coins]&lt;/ref&gt;
Constantine’s helmet was mainly a crown that was fastened to the head by two clamps. The majority of the helmet was made out of iron and gold.&lt;ref name=various /&gt; Constantine thought having the chi-roh symbol on the helmet would give him added protection to that of the relic that was already in the helmet.&lt;ref name=Alfoldi&gt;[[Andreas Alfoldi]], ''The Helmet of Constantine With the Christian Monogram''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The crown that was made with the nail was placed around a full helmet when the Emperor went into battle, but could easily be taken off.&lt;ref name=Alfoldi /&gt; It was called a helmet however he wore it though. This is because of the two clamps that held it in place. If these two clamps were not on the original crown it would not be called a helmet at all.&lt;ref name=Alfoldi /&gt; --&gt;

A '''human video''' is a form of [[theater]] combining [[music]], [[Modern Dance]] and [[drama]], along with [[interpretive dance]], [[American Sign Language]], [[pantomime]], and [[Mime artistry|classic mime]]. A human video consists of a [[song]] or [[Medley (music)|medley]] played over loudspeakers while actors use rhythmic physical movement (gestures and other movements of the limbs and body) to communicate emotions to a given audience.

The performance is presented in a form similar to a [[music video]]. It presents a story that illuminates a particular artistic intent through [[Proxemics|spatial relationships]], meaningful [[gesture]]s, and artistic [[Kinesics|movement]]. 

The story told within the video can be either implicit in the words of the song or a story written independently of the original artist's meaning.

Just as more "traditional" forms of theater can be situated on different types of [[Stage (theater)|stages]], so too can these dramatic acts. This particular form of drama can perform the same text in many different venues without disrupting its meaning. Because it typically has no [[Set construction|set]] and limited [[costume]]s, it can be performed in nearly any location.

[[Theatrical property|Props]] are sometimes used, but are forbidden in some competitive venues. In this instance, props are restricted in an effort to force creativity—because in the ideal Human Video, all actors on stage should be used to represent objects like [[Crucifix|crosses]], thrones, trees or giants. Actors movements demonstrate a [[narrative|story]] and the [[Theme (literature)|theme]] of the [[song]] being played.

In the [[United States]], one example of how human videos have permeated the [[Culture of the United States|culture]] is the inclusion of human videos in Fine Arts Festivals and church ministry groups ([[Assemblies of God]], [[Pentecostal]] Holiness Church, [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]], etc.) in a variety of [[Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]]. The Fine Arts Festival in the Assemblies of God denomination is the largest and most intense of all competitions and categories. Churches spend many months and countless hours practicing in order to receive recognition at the National Fine Arts Festival.

==History==
The name "human video" was coined by Randy Phillips. He is reported to have performed the first "human video" in a chapel service at Central Bible College, with several elements used from the then quite popular Deaf Ministry Team. It was used more formally in the early 1990s at Phoenix First Assembly of God led by Pastor Tommy Barnett.

Although elements of the form have existed in theatre for centuries and no one can actually claim to have invented it, Mr. Phillips began to use it as a ministry tool first at church services and then for outreach and missions with the help of Pastor Lloyd Ziegler and the ministry training program called Master's Commission.

'''''Hurricane''''' is a 1944 [[oil painting]] by American artist [[John Marin]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. He used quick brushstrokes and thickly daubed paint to depict a turbulent ocean such as he experienced near his summer home in [[Maine]].&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Although Marin is best known for his [[watercolor]]s, beginning in the 1930s he developed an interest in the more expressive brushwork and rugged quality of oil paint. Marin was influenced by [[Cubism]], with its flattened spaces and angularity. He honed a style of frenetic brushwork to create this dynamic image of water, wind, and clouds. He was so successful in his recreation of nature that a sailor purportedly declared it the first time he had "really seen a sea painted as the sea really is."&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

===Historical information===
''Hurricane'' was painted the same year the [[1944 Great Atlantic hurricane|Great Atlantic hurricane]] smashed into Maine.&lt;ref name=green&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Tyler|title=John Marin: Painter with a syringe|url=http://blogs.artinfo.com/modernartnotes/2011/11/john-marin-painter-with-a-syringe/|work=Modern Art Notes|accessdate=26 May 2013|date=30 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location history===
''Hurricane'' was first displayed in 1944 in the famous [[Alfred Stieglitz#The Intimate Gallery and An American Place (1925–1937)|An American Place]] gallery. It was borrowed from the IMA to be part of a 1987 retrospective of Marin's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=John Marin's Hurricane: "Certainly a Masterpiece"|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, ''Hurricane'' was loaned out again for a traveling exhibit called "John Marin: Modernism at Midcentury," of which it was a highlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Rita|title=Art review: John Marin: Modernism at Midcentury at the Amon Carter in Fort Worth|url=http://www.pegasusnews.com/news/2011/nov/09/art-review-john-marin-modernism-amon-carter-fort/|publisher=The Assignment Desk, DFW|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibition took it to the [[Portland Museum of Art]] in [[Portland, Maine]]; the [[Amon Carter Museum]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and the [[Addison Gallery of American Art]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Marin Modernism at Midcentury|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300149937|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
[[Caroline Marmon Fesler]] acquired ''Hurricane'' the same year it was painted, from Marin's long-time friend and art dealer, [[Alfred Stieglitz]]. He congratulated Fesler on her purchase, writing "The ''Hurricane'' is certainly a masterpiece, Every one agrees with every one else as to that." It was donated to the IMA as part of her estate in 1961, and was given the accession number 61.42.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Hurricane|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/hurricane-marin-john|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iberian schematic art''' is the name given to a series of prehistoric representations (almost always cave paintings) that appear in the [[Iberian peninsula]], which are associated with the first metallurgical cultures (the [[Copper Age]], the [[Bronze Age]] and even the start of the [[Iron Age]]). Its [[chronology]] is still a matter for debate, but it could span from the [[4th millennium BC|fourth]] up to the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium BC]], overlapping, at its start, with [[Levantine Art]] and surviving marginally in some isolated regions during much later stages.

Its main characteristic, and that which gives it its name, is the [[schematic]], that is, a figurative style in which only the basic fragments of each figure are represented (eliminating all the rest); what's more, the representation is so basic that the graphic elements are converted into mere outlines, but without losing the minimal identifying features. In fact, the schematic phenomenon is considered somewhat more precise and problematic, and it is integrated in a wide movement which affects almost all of Europe and the [[Mediterranean]].

It could be said that the schematic phenomenon has global dimensions, although each region, including the Hispanic, has its own, differentiating aspects.

==The schematic phenomenon in the Iberian peninsula==
Schematics in art is a concept linked to [[Realism (arts)|realism]] (a figurative representation more or less faithful to nature, with concrete details which allow the easy identification of the figures), stylization (also figurative, but which accentuates certain details considered arbitrarily important, repeating and distorting them until they lose their real shapes), and [[abstract art|abstraction]] (representations completely unconnected with reality which are associated with a philosophical symbolism and which, although they may unconsciously contain some real elements, such a link is not possible to prove).

Even if one only takes the peninsular ambit into account, schematic art lacks uniformity, it spans quite a wide chronology and its geography is too wide, which makes its study difficult and makes it almost impossible to establish cultural phases or regions.

'''Jo Hanson''' (1918–2007) was an environmental artist and activist based in San Francisco.

== Biography ==
Jo Hanson was born on August 1, 1918 in [[Carbondale, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite web | access-date=April 28, 2015 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Jo-Hanson-green-activism-inspired-artwork-and-2608790.php | title=Jo Hanson -- green activism inspired artwork and life | publisher=SFGate | date=March 21, 2007 | last=Baker | first=Jo | website=sfgate.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to California in 1955, first living in Marin County, before settling in San Francisco in the early 1970s where she purchased and restored [[Nightingale House]], located on Buchanan Street to landmark status.&lt;ref name="Steinman"&gt;{{cite web | access-date=April 28, 2015 | url=http://weadartists.org/artist/hansonj | title=JO HANSON: Pioneering Environmental Artist Dies in San Francisco | publisher=Women Environmental Artists Directory | last=Steinman | first=Susan Leibovitz | website=weadartists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Recology&gt;{{cite web |url=http://recologysf.com/index.php/jo-hanson |title=Jo Hanson |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=recologysf.com |publisher=[[Recology]] |access-date=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson obtained a [[Master of Education]] from the [[University of Illinois]] and a [[Master of Fine Arts]] from [[San Francisco State University]].

Hanson died at her home, of cancer, on March 13, 2007.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

== Career ==
As an extension of her work on the Nightingale House, Hanson set out to address the litter on her street. Her commitment to sweeping the sidewalk outside her home evolved into a public art project and citywide initiative against littering. Hanson's work was known for incorporating the detritus she collected while sweeping. She analyzed and classified what she found as a way of documenting daily life in her district and felt that it reflected a disconnect between the consumption and production of goods and the natural world.&lt;ref name=WAAW&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cla.purdue.edu/waaw/cohn/Artists/Hansonbio.html |title=Biography Jo Hanson |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.cla.purdue.edu/ |publisher=Women Artists of the American West |access-date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ponte"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ponte|first1=Alessandra|title=Garbage Art and Garbage Housing|journal=Log|date=2006|volume=8|pages=99–111|jstor=41765594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For six years during the 1980s Hanson was a vocal member of the San Francisco Arts Commission pushing for the inclusion of underrepresented artists of in the city's art collections, specifically women and people of colour. She also played a key role in saving the [[Coit Tower#Murals|murals of Coit Tower]] and the restoration of the murals at Golden Gate Park's [[Golden Gate Park#Beach Chalet|Beach Chalet]].&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Steinman/&gt;

In 1990 Hanson conceived of and initiated the establishment of the Artist in Residence Program at [[Recology]]. The residency assists artists who use discarded materials in their art and raises public awareness about recycling.&lt;ref name=Recology/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zanardi/&gt; Its launch coincided with the introduction of curbside recycling in San Francisco due to state legislation passed in 1989. To date more than 100 artists have participated in the program including Estelle Akamine, Jim Growden, Susan Leibovitz Steinman and William Wareham. Recology has also influenced the development of similar programs such in Philadelphia and Portland.&lt;ref name="Spain"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spain|first1=Sharon|title=Nexus for art &amp; environmental activism: Recology S.F. artist residency Program|url=http://weadartists.org/ca-dump-nexus-for-ecoart|website=WEAD|publisher=Women Environmental Artist Director|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 1997 Hanson was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Northern California [[Women's Caucus for Art]].&lt;ref name=NCWCA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncwca.org/lifetime-achievement-awardees-northern-ca.html |title=WCA Lifetime Achievement Awardees from Northern California |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=www.ncwca.org |publisher=Northern California Women's Caucus for Art |access-date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
One of Hanson's best known works was ''Crab Orchard Cemetery'', a recreation of her ancestral cemetery in Illinois, which opened at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1974.&lt;ref name="Zanardi"&gt;{{cite web | access-date=April 28, 2015 | url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/theater-and-arts/ci_12762798?nclick_check=1 | title=Peninsula museum revisits 'Crab Orchard Cemetery | publisher=Contra Costa Times | date=April 28, 2015 | last=Zanardi | first=Bonny | website=www.contracostatimes.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khosrow and Shirin''' ({{lang-fa|خسرو و شیرین}}) is the title of a famous [[Persian people|Persian]] tragic romance by the poet [[Nizami Ganjavi]] (1141–1209), who also wrote [[Layla and Majnun]]. It tells a highly elaborated fictional version of the story of the love of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Khosrau II|Khosrow II]] for the [[Armenians|Armenian]] princess [[Shirin]], who becomes queen of [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'' ([http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kosrow-o-sirin "Ḵosrow o Širin"] ''Encyclopædia Iranica'', Paola Orsatti)"'''''Two traditions''' soon formed around the figure of Širin: one in her favor, '''with its roots in Armenia and in the Christian regions of the Caucasus, where, as we have seen, Neẓāmi found his source;''' and the second, represented in the Šāh-nāma, where Širin is shown as a woman of humble origin and ill repute, who makes merciless use of poison (in Ferdowsi, Širin, wrought with jealousy, poisons Maryam).''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'' ([http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhad%20(1) "Farhad"] ''Encyclopædia Iranica'', Heshmat Moayyad)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Khuzistan Chronicle'', written by a Syriac Christian from Khuzistan (Beth Huzaye in Aramaic/Syriac) [Iran], probably in 680, is described as the Syriac counterpart of the Armenian work of Sebeos. We read about the relationship between the bishop Isho Yahb and the Persian king Khosrau II Parvez (590–628): "Isho Yahb was treated respectfully throughout his life, by the king himself and his two Christian wives Shirin the Aramean and Mary the Roman". (Theodor. Nöldeke: ''Die von Guidi herausgegebene syrische Chronik'', Wien 1893, p. 10.) The ''Chronicle of Séert'' (Siirt) is an anonymously authored historiographical text written by the Nestorian Church in Persia and the Middle East, possibly as early as the 9th century AD. The text deals with ecclesiastical, social, and political issues of the Christian church giving a history of its leaders and notable members. LVIII.&amp;nbsp;– History of Khosrau Parvez, son of Hormizd "Khosrau, by gratitude for Maurice, ordered to rebuild churches and to honor the Christians. He built himself two churches for Marie (Maryam) and a large church and a castle in the country of Beth Lashpar for his wife Shirin, the Aramean." (''Patrologia Orientalis'', Tome VII.&amp;nbsp;– Fascicule 2, Histoire Nestorienne (Chronique de Séert), Seconde Partie (1), publiée et traduite par Mgr Addai Scher, Paris 1911, Published Paris : Firmin-Didot 1950 p. 467.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johan Christoph Burgel &amp; Christine van Ruyuymbeke, "Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of the Hakim ", Amsterdam University Press, 2011. pg 145: "Shirin is presented as an Armenian princess&lt;/ref&gt; The essential narrative is a love story of [[Persian people|Persian]] origin which was already well-known from the great epico-historical poem the [[Shahnameh]] and other Persian writers and popular tales, and other works have the same title.&lt;ref&gt;Chelkowski, P. "Nezami's Iskandarnameh:"in Colloquio sul poeta persiano Nizami e la leggenda iranica di Alessandro magno, Roma,1977). pp 10: "The Persian legend of Alexander the Great seems to overshadow all of the other fantastic Alexander stories not only in the tale of the successful accomplishment of many a "mission-impossible" but especially concerning the nature of his career. In Iran he rose from the stature of a damned evil conqueror of the country, to that of a national Iranian hero king, and even more, to that of the great prophet of God, preparing all the nations for the true religion. Yet the Persian legend of Alexander is very little known in the Western world."" pp 13: "Nizami was a typical product of the Iranian culture. He created a bridge between Islamic Iran and pre-Islamic Iran and also between Iran and the whole ancient world. His great humanism, strong character, sensibility, drama, colorful description of nature, rich language, and the poetic genius created a new standard of literary achievements and captured the imagination of countless imitators". pg 17: "In the case of previous romances of Khosraw and Bahram, Nizami dealt with national Iranian heroes, though from pre-Islamic times. In the tale of Layla and Majnun, the Arab nationality of the lover is of no importance since the story is based on a simple Arab folktale which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians". pp 19: "Alexander was glorified by the Muslims as a divine agent, a prophet-king and the blessed conqueror of the lands that were to become the stronghold of Islam. To some Muslims, Islam was a realization of Alexander's "koine" --- a commonwealth where people could live in harmony and in peace of heart and mind. In this atmosphere attempts were made to make out of Alexander not only a Muslim but a Persian as well". pg 21: "However, it was not Tabari directly, but Ferdowsi who was Nizami's source of inspiration and material in composing Iskandarnameh. Nizami constantly alludes to the Shahnameh in his writing, especially in the prologue to the Iskandarnameh. It seems that he was always fascinated by the work of Firdawsi and made it a goal of his life to write an heroic epic of the same stature. pg22: "It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading Firdawsi's monumental epic Shahnameh (The book of Kings)". pg 22: "In fact, although Alexander conquered Iran, he was soon conquered by Persian customs and ways of life. In many aspects he was so overwhelmed by Persian civilization that he became more Persian than the Persians. He tried to make a blend of the Greek and Persian civilization --- even genetically, when he sponsored mass marriages between his troops and Persian women. He himself married Roxane (Rowshanak) the daughter of the Sogdian prince&amp;nbsp;– not the daughter of Darius the Third, as both Firdawsi and Nizami believed. Like Alexander, Arabs, Turks, Mongols and other people who overran the Iranian plateau also came under the spell of Persian culture. Foreign invaders remained to become contributors and patrons of Persian art and culture. To give one example, some of Nizami's benefactors were of Turkic stock."&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of the story were also told under the titles '''"Shirin and Farhad"''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: شیرین و فرهاد).

==Plot==
Nezami's version begins with an account of Khosrow's birth and his education. This is followed by an account of Khosrow's feast in a farmer's house; for which Khosrow is severely chastised by his father. Khosrow asks forgiveness and repents his offence. [[Hormizd IV]], who is now pleased with his son, forgives him. That very night, Khosrow sees his grandfather [[Khosrau I|Anushirvan]] in a dream and Anushirvan gives him glad tidings of a wife named [[Shirin]], a steed named [[Shabdiz]], a musician named [[Barbad]], and a great kingdom, that is [[Persia]].

Shapur, Khosrow's close friend and a painter, tells Khosrow of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] queen [[Mahin Banu]] and her niece Shirin. Hearing Shapur's descriptions of Shirin's flawless features, the young prince falls in love with Shirin, the Armenian princess. Shapur travels to [[Persian Armenia|Armenia]] to look for Shirin. Shapur finds Shirin and shows the image of Khosrow to Shirin. Shirin falls in love with Khosrow and escapes from Armenia to Khosrow's capital [[Mada'in]]; but meanwhile, Khosrow also flees from his father's anger and sets out for Armenia in search of Shirin.

On the way, he finds Shirin unclothed bathing and washing her flowing hair; Shirin also sees him; but since Khosrow was traveling in peasant clothes, they do not recognize one another. Khosrow arrives in Armenia and is welcomed by [[Shamira]] the queen of Armenia - yet he finds out that Shirin is in Mada'in. Again, Shapur is sent to bring Shirin. When Shirin reached Armenia again, Khosrow&amp;nbsp;– because of his father's death- has to return to Mada'in. The two lovers keep going to opposite places till finally Khosrow is overthrown by a general named [[Bahrām Chobin]] and flees to Armenia.

In Armenia, Khosrow finally meets Shirin and is welcomed by her. Shirin, however, does not agree to marry Khosrow; unless Khosrow first claims his country back from Bahram Chobin. Thus, Khosrow leaves Shirin in Armenia and goes to [[Constantinople]]. The Caesar agrees to assist him against Bahram Chobin on condition that he marry his daughter Mariam. Khosrow is also forced to promise not to marry as long as Mariam is alive. Khosrow succeeds in defeating his enemy and reclaims his throne. Mariam, due to her jealousy, keeps Khosrow away from Shirin.

Meanwhile, a sculptor named [[Farhad (Persian literature)|Farhad]] falls in love with Shirin and becomes Khosrow's love-rival. Khosrow cannot abide Farhad, so he sends him as an exile to [[Behistun]] mountain with the impossible task of carving stairs out of the cliff rocks. Farhad begins his task hoping that Khosrow will allow him to marry Shirin. Yet, Khosrow sends a messenger to Farhad and gives him false news of Shirin's death. Hearing this false news, Farhad throws himself from the mountaintop and dies. Khosrow writes a letter to Shirin, expressing his regret for Farhad's death. Soon after this incident, Mariam also dies. According to [[Ferdowsi]]'s version, it was Shirin who secretly poisoned Mariam. Shirin replies to Khosrow's letter with another satirical letter of condolences.

Khosrow, before proposing marriage to Shirin, tries to have intimacy with another woman named Shekar in [[Isfahan]], which further delays the lovers' union. Finally, Khosrow goes to Shirin's castle to see her. Shirin, seeing that Khosrow is drunk, does not let him in the castle. She particularly reproaches Khosrow for his intimacy with Shekar. Khosrow, sad and rejected, returns to his palace.

Shirin eventually consents to marry Khosrow after several romantic and heroic episodes. Yet, [[Kavadh II|Shiroyeh]], Khosrow's son from his wife Mariam, is also in love with Shirin. Shiroyeh finally murders his father Khosrow and sends a messenger to Shirin conveying that after one week, she would have to marry him. Shirin, in order to avoid marrying Shiroy, kills herself. Khosrow and Shirin were buried together in one grave.

==Popularity in Persian literature==
[[File:Khosrow and Shirin-page0085.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|[[Khosrau II|Khosrow Parviz]] and [[Shirin]] in an 18th-century miniature]]
There are many references to the legend throughout the poetry of other Persian poets including Farrokhi, Qatran, Mas'ud-e Sa'd-e Salman, Othman Mokhtari, Naser Khusraw, Anwari and Sanai. [[Nizam al-Mulk]] mentioned that the legend was a popular story in his era.&lt;ref name="iranica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhad%20(1)|author=Heshmat Moayyad|title=Farhad |work=Encyclopedia Iranica |date=1999-12-15 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nizami's version===

Although the story was known before [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], it was brought to its greatest romantic height by him. Unlike the ''Shahnameh'', which focuses on the history, kingship and battles of Khosrow, Nizami decided to focus on the romantic aspect of the story.

When the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] Sultan Arsalan Shah requested a love epic from the poet without specifying the subject further, Nizami picked on the story of lovers Khosrow and Shirin, a theme set in his own region and based on at least partly historical facts, though an aura of legend already surrounded it.

[[Nizami Ganjavi]] (1141–1209) himself considered it the sweetest story in the world:

{{cquote|The tale of Khosraw and Shirin is well known&lt;br /&gt;
And by Truth, there is no sweeter story than it.}}

It is believed to be one of the best works of Nizami. His first wife Afaq died after it was completed. Many versions of Nizami's work have been retold. The story has a constant forward drive with exposition, challenge, mystery, crisis, climax, resolution, and finally, catastrophe.

Besides Ferdowsi, Nizami's poem was influenced by [[Asad Gorgani]] and his "[[Vis and Rāmin]]".&lt;ref name="DavisIranica"&gt;{{cite web |author=Dick Davis |date=2005-01-06 |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/vis-o-ramin |title=Vis o Rāmin |work=Encyclopaedia Iranica  |accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is of the same meter and has similar scenes. Nizami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in the elaborate astrological description of the night sky in ''Vis and Ramin''. Nizami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the [[Sufi]] influences, which are seen in Nizami's epic poetry.

==Influence==
According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'': "The influence of the legend of Farhad is not limited to literature, but permeates the whole of Persian culture, including folklore and the fine arts. Farhad's helve supposedly grew into a tree with medicinal qualities, and there are popular laments for Farhad, especially among the Kurds (Mokri)."&lt;ref name="iranica.com"/&gt;

In 2011, the Iranian government's censors refused permission for a publishing house to reprint the centuries-old classic poem that had been a much-loved component of Persian literature for 831 years. While the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance offered no immediate official explanation for refusing to permit the firm to publish their eighth edition of the classic, the Islamic government's concerns reportedly centered on the "indecent" act of the heroine, Shirin, in embracing her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/iranian_censors_heavy_hand_falls_on_a_persian_classic/24299532.html|title=Iranian Censors' Heavy Hand Falls On A Persian Classic|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orhan Pamuk]]'s novel ''[[My Name Is Red]]'' (1998) has a plot line between two characters, Shekure and Black, which echoes the Khosrow and Shirin story, which is also retold in the book. The novel uses the Turkish spelling of Khosrow's name, Hüsrev.

==Other versions==

The tale has been retold by countless [[Sufi]] poets and writers in areas which were previously part of the Persian Empire or had Persian influences, such as the northern parts of the neighboring [[Indian subcontinent]]. In Europe, the story was told by Hungarian novelist [[Mór Jókai]]. However, the story is usually told under the name of "Shirin Farhad". It is a standard tale used in [[Punjabi Qisse]]. The story has been filmed five times:
1926,&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0239979|Shirin Farhad (1926)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1931,&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0234717|Shirin Farhad (1931)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0387590|Shirin Farhad (1945)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1956 starring [[Madhubala]] and [[Pradeep Kumar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0129370|Shirin Farhad (1956)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0318690|Shirin Farhad (1975)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale was used as the inspiration for a 2008 Iranian film, ''[[Shirin (film)|Shirin]]'', made by [[Abbas Kiarostami]]. In this formally unusual film, the story is told via the reactions of an audience of Iranian women as they sit watching the film in a cinema. The viewer has to divine the story by only ever seeing these emoting faces and listening to the film's soundtrack.

The story was also referenced in the [[Jonathan Richman]] song "Shirin and Farhad"

The tale was also an inspiration for the 2012 Bollywood romantic comedy ''[[Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">'''Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology, and Religious Belief''' ({{lang-de|Vorlesungen und Gespräche über Ästhetik, Psychoanalyse und religiösen Glauben}}) is a series of notes transcribed by [[Yorick Smythies]], [[Rush Rhees]], and James Taylor from assorted lectures by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and published in 1967.&lt;ref name="springerlink"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n254782t5l634186/|title=Lectures and conversations on aesthetics, psychology and religious belief - Springer|accessdate=2014-10-14 | doi=10.1007/BF00137674|volume=3|journal=The Journal of Value Inquiry|pages=63–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lectures, at which [[Casimir Lewy]] was present, contain Wittgenstein's thoughts about [[aesthetics]] and [[religion]], alongside a critique of [[psychoanalysis]]. [[Wittgensteinian fideism]] originates from the remarks in the ''Lectures''. It is noteworthy that Eberhard Bubser in the introduction of the German edition states that: ″Wittgenstein would surely have not approved this release [...]″ (″Wittgenstein hätte diese Ausgabe bestimmt nicht gebilligt [...]″).&lt;ref name = "LWGer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vorlesungen und Gespräche über Ästhetik, Psychologie und Religion.|author1=Wittgenstein, L.| date=1966|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|location=Göttingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lectures on Aesthetics ==
One question Wittgenstein raises in his ''Lectures on Aesthetics'' is how we learn to use and recognize the words used to make an aesthetic judgment, such as ″beautiful″ (″schön″) or ″nice″ or (″fein″).&lt;ref name="LWGer" /&gt; He suggests that these words are firstly and often used like [[interjection]]s or gestures. Wittgenstein also notes that we seldom use these words in everyday language to make aesthetic judgments, but rather use words like ″right″ (″richtig″) or ″correct″ (″korrekt″).&lt;ref name="LWGer" /&gt; With regard to aesthetic pleasures, he also names a question that is recently under debate in aesthetics: How are distinctly aesthetic pleasures different from more ordinary pleasures? He makes a point in stating that ″One uses the same term in both cases [...]″ (″ Man gebraucht in beiden Fällen [...] dasselbe Wort″).&lt;ref name="LWGer" /&gt;

A recurring theme in these lectures is also Wittgenstein's firm rejection of the possibility that [[psychology]] may explain aesthetic experiences or judgments. This opinion is based on Wittgenstein's view that psychological ([[behaviorism|behaviorist]]) experiments would generate results based on mere descriptions of behavior and generalizations across large numbers of observers.

== Lectures on Religious Belief ==
In his Lectures on Religious Belief (''Vorlesungen über den religiösen Glauben''), Wittgenstein argues, among other things, that superficial grammatical similarities in the ''forms'' of both religious and factual statements mislead us into believing that they are fundamentally identical states of "belief."  This grammatical similarity, Wittgenstein argues, is merely a parallel ''expression'' of drastically different processes. "The '''expression''' of belief", Wittgenstein notes, "may play an absolutely minor role."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology, and Religious Belief|author1=Wittgenstein, L.|author2=Barrett, C.|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520251816|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njMBZkDSjk0C|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lion of Al-lāt''' ([[Arabic]] اللات) is an ancient statue that adorned the [[Temple of Al-Lat]] in [[Palmyra]], [[Syria]]. On 27 June 2015, it was [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|severely damaged]] by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] after it had [[Palmyra offensive (2015)|captured Palmyra]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/02/isis-militants-destroy-palmyra-stone-lion-al-lat|title=Isis militants destroy 2,000-year-old statue of lion at Palmyra|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was removed to the [[National Museum of Damascus]] and underwent reconstruction work, and now stands again.&lt;ref name="restored"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sana.sy/en/?p=114930|title=Restoration works of Palmyra’s famous ancient statue of Lion of Allat completed – Syrian Arab News Agency|website=sana.sy|language=en-US|access-date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The statue, of a lion holding a crouching gazelle, was made from [[limestone]] [[ashlar]]s in the early first century A.D. and measured {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height,&lt;ref name="Butcher"&gt;{{cite book|title=Roman Syria and the Near East|author=Kevin Butcher|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2003|isbn=0892367156|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; weighing 15 tonnes.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The lion was regarded as the consort of Al-lāt.&lt;ref name="Butcher" /&gt; The gazelle symbolized Al-lāt's tender and loving traits, as bloodshed was not permitted under penalty of Al-lāt's retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Commemorative Figures|author=Theodorus Petrus van Baaren|publisher=Brill Archive|year=1982|isbn=9004067795|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lion's left paw had a partially damaged [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]] inscription (PAT 1122) which reads: ''tbrk ʾ''[''lt''] (Al-lāt will bless) ''mn dy lʾyšd'' (whoever will not shed) ''dm ʿl ḥgbʾ'' (blood in the sanctuary).&lt;ref&gt;Van Baaren (1982), p. 65 and Reinhard G.

== History ==
[[File:Damascus Museum lion.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Statue look before 2005 restoration.]]
The statue was discovered in 1977 by a group of Polish archeologists working under Dr. Michał Gawlikowski.&lt;ref name="Markowski"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.pcma.uw.edu.pl/fileadmin/pam/PAM_2004_XVI/248.pdf|title=The Lion of Allat in Palmyra New Museum Display Project|publisher=[[Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology]]| author=Bartosz Markowski| accessdate =3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was
found in pieces, having been reused in antiquity for the temple's foundation.&lt;ref name="Markowski"/&gt; Subsequently, it was decided to reassemble the pieces in front of the entrance to the Palmyra Museum. The task was undertaken by restorer [[Józef Gazy]]. In 2005, it underwent restoration to eliminate problems from assemblage.&lt;ref name="Markowski"/&gt; Ultimately, the piece was restored in imitation of its original intended appearance – a relief jumping out from a wall.&lt;ref name="Markowski"/&gt; During the [[Syrian Civil War]] the statue was shielded with a metal plate and sandbags to protect it from fighting.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

On 27 June 2015, it was severely damaged by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] after it had [[Palmyra offensive (2015)|captured Palmyra]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; After the liberation of Palmyra by the Syrian army, Syria’s director-general of antiquities and museums Maamoun Abdulkarim declared that the pieces were still in place and it should be possible to put them back together, giving hopes for reconstruction.&lt;ref name="PostItalian"&gt;{{cite web | date=28 March 2016|url =http://www.ilpost.it/2016/03/28/palmira-prima-e-dopo-lisis/|title=Palmira prima e dopo l'ISIS|work=Il Post|language=Italian|access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was moved to Damascus in 2016, where it underwent complete restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://tishreen.news.sy/?p=39218|title=تمثال أسد اللات.. من تدمر إلى المتحف الوطني في دمشق استعداداً لترميمه (In Arabic)|accessdate =21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 2017, it was fully restored and is currently on display in the [[National Museum of Damascus]], until safety is assured in Palmyra to move it there again.&lt;ref name="restored" /&gt;

'''''Marmotinto''''' is the art of creating pictures using coloured [[sand]] or [[marble]] dust and otherwise known as [[sand painting]].

Originating in Europe, and probably based on the Japanese craft of ''[[bonseki]]'' (aka 'tray-painting'), ''marmotinto'' was fleetingly popular in England following a 1783 dinner party given by [[George III]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E88AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=marmotinto&amp;source=web&amp;ots=dtO9Gcevrf&amp;sig=TMGohrLQRBZTcaqs7F7cM2o4MFM The Mechanics' Magazine, Museum, Register, Journal, and Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt; at Windsor Castle who was taken with a display of unfixed coloured sands, sugars and marble dust arranged under glass upon the surface of the dinner table in decorative patterns and including fruit and flowers, and exotic birds which was executed by the Bavarian table-decker [[Benjamin Zobel]] (Memmingen, 21 September 1762 - London, 24 October 1830),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G3WN9sqAOHYC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=marmotinto&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ijXm-X-VQd&amp;sig=B3uXbIeAhwrM0vZdOEQiDGKbT7I Dictionary of artists]&lt;/ref&gt; a friend of [[George Morland]], a painter prominent in the "Isle of Wight School". The King and his courtiers was so impressed with the resulting picture, it was suggested that Zobel find a way to make his compositions permanent and hence the craft of ''marmotinto'' or sandpainting was born and proved most successful under the patronage of various members of the royal household including the then Duke of York. 

[[Woburn Abbey]] in Bedford, England possesses a fine example of the table deckers' craft in the form of an ornate folding room screen with three panels, decorated with sand pictures protected by glass. The centre one has five spaces for sweetmeat pyramid dishes while the two side leaves of the screen have three spaces for fruit trays. There are four sand pictures in each corner of the side panels of the screen, featuring 18th-century pastoral scenes, while the remaining areas of the screen are decorated with butterflies, doves, fruit, flowers, etc.  The screen would be laid upon the surface of a side table where it doubled as a serving base for elaborate porcelain dishes and glass trays containing fruits, bonbons and sweetmeats, from which the hosts and their guests could help themselves while socializing or stretching their legs between the multiple courses being served on the main table in the dining hall. This screen is believed to be the work of F. Schweikhardt, Zobel's predecessor at Windsor who specialised in still-life studies in the style of the Dutch painter Jan van Huysum.


Later the craft became popular in the early 19th century as the tourist industry began to develop on the [[Isle of Wight]] particularly at [[Alum Bay]] where coloured sands were readily available to the visitors should they wish to try their hand at creating their own souvenirs when they disembarked directly onto the beach from the decks of mainland steamers. The locals soon realised an opportunity to develop and market small framed sand pictures and also compressed sand patterns inside glass jars to supplement their meagre income. There are some examples of Alum Bay sand pictures at [[Osborne House]] and [[Carisbrook Castle]] while at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the late Queen Mary's collection of Georgian sandpaintings may be viewed by request.

Although ''marmotinto'' using coloured sands and marble dust was popular across England and on the continent for a while, it declined after an initial fashionable period. The art saw a comeback in the 20th century using natural coloured sands, supplemented by discarded, recycled and found materials.

{{History of printing}}

'''Movable type''' (US English; '''moveable type''' in British English) is the system and [[technology]] of [[printing]] and [[typography]] that uses movable [[Sort (typesetting)|components]] to reproduce the elements of a document (usually individual [[alphanumeric characters]] or [[punctuation marks]]) usually on the medium of [[paper]].

The world's first movable type printing press technology for printing [[paper]] [[books]] was made of [[porcelain]] materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] by the inventor [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051).&lt;ref name="needhamb"&gt;{{cite book |last = Needham |first = Joseph |title = The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 4 |year = 1994 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |page = 14 |isbn = 9780521329958 |quote = Bi Sheng... who first devised, about 1045, the art of printing with movable type}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently in 1377, the world's oldest extant movable metal print book, [[Jikji]], was printed in Korea during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty. 

Because of this, the diffusion of both movable-type systems was, to some degree, limited to primarily [[East Asia]], although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries, traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years; and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe. Some of these [[medieval European]] accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] and [[Bodleian Library|Oxford University]] among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = He | first1 = Zhou | year = 1994 | title = Diffusion of Movable Type in China and Europe: Why Were There Two Fates? | journal = International Communication Gazette | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 153–173 | doi = 10.1177/001654929405300301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced the metal movable-type [[printing press]] in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a [[matrix (printing)|matrix]] and [[hand mould]]. The small number of [[alphabet|alphabetic]] characters needed for European languages was an important factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |title=Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-691-15034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of [[lead]], [[tin]], and [[antimony]]—and these materials remained standard for 550 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|477017|Printing (publishing)}} Retrieved &lt;/ref&gt;

For [[alphabetic script|alphabetic scripts]], movable-type [[page setting]] was quicker than [[woodblock printing]]. The metal type pieces were more durable and the lettering was more uniform, leading to typography and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type in Europe and the use of [[printing presses]] spread rapidly. The printing press may be regarded as one of the key factors fostering the [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, Elizabeth L., ''The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe'', Cambridge University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and due to its effectiveness, its [[Global spread of the printing press|use spread around the globe]].

The 19th-century invention of [[hot metal typesetting]] and its successors caused movable type to decline in the 20th century.

== Precursors to movable type ==
=== Letter punch and coins ===
[[File:Tetradrachm 5th century BC athens detail.jpg|right|thumb|Movable type traces its origins to the punches used to make [[coin]]s: the reverse face of a [[Tetradrachm]] [[Ancient Greek coinage|Greek coin]] from [[Athens]], 5th century BC, featuring various letters and the owl symbol of [[Athena]].]]

The technique of imprinting multiple copies of [[symbol]]s or [[glyph]]s with a master ''type'' punch made of hard metal first developed around 3000 BC in [[Sumer|ancient Sumer]]. These metal punch types can be seen as precursors of the letter punches adapted in later millennia to printing with movable metal type. [[Cylinder seal]]s were used in [[Mesopotamia]] to create an impression on a surface by rolling the seal on wet clay.&lt;ref name="Clair"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clair|first1=Kate|last2=Busic-Snyder|first2=Cynthia |title=A Typographic Workbook: A Primer to History, Techniques, and Artistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lf0iDYCr6w0C|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-39988-0|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used to "sign" documents and mark objects as the owner's property. Cylinder seals were a related form of early typography capable of printing small page designs in relief (''[[cameo (carving)|cameo]]'') on wax or clay—a miniature forerunner of [[rotogravure|rotogravure printing]] used by wealthy individuals to seal and certify documents. By 650 BC the ancient Greeks were using larger diameter punches to imprint small page images onto [[coin]]s and [[token coin|tokens]].

The [[graphic design|designs]] of the artists who made the first coin punches were stylized with a degree of skill that could not be mistaken for common handiwork—salient and very specific types designed to be reproduced ''ad infinitum''. Unlike the first typefaces used to print books in the 13th century, coin types were neither combined nor printed with [[ink]] on [[paper]], but "published" in metal—a more durable medium—and survived in substantial numbers. As the portable face of ruling authority, coins were a compact form of standardized knowledge issued in large editions, an early mass medium that stabilized trade and civilization throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] world of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].

=== Seals and stamps ===
{{Main|Mudbrick stamp|Cylinder seal|Phaistos Disc}}
[[File:Stamp Lasha Louvre AO27586.jpg|thumb|right|Brick "stamp mold" for the King of [[Larsa]], [[Sin-Iddinam]]. (for Sun God, Utu, [[foundation deposit]] of temple) ]]
[[File:PhaistosDiskLarge.jpg|thumb|right|A replica of the [[Phaistos Disc]]]]

Seals and stamps may have been precursors to movable type. The uneven spacing of the impressions on brick stamps found in the [[Mesopotamia]]n cities of [[Uruk]] and [[Larsa]], dating from the [[2nd millennium BC]], has been conjectured by some archaeologists as evidence that the stamps were made using movable type.&lt;ref name="brickstamps"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sass|first=Benjamin|last2=Marzahn|first2=Joachim |title=Aramaic and Figural Stamp Impressions on Bricks of the Sixth Century B.C. from Babylon|year=2010|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-06184-1|pages=11, 20, 160|quote="the latter has cuneiform signs that look as if made with a movable type, and impressions from Assur display the same phenomenon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enigmatic [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Phaistos Disc of 1800–1600 BC has been considered by one scholar as an early example of a body of text being reproduced with reusable characters: it may have been produced by pressing pre-formed hieroglyphic "seals" into the soft clay. A few authors even view the disc as technically meeting all definitional criteria to represent an early incidence of movable-type printing.&lt;ref name="Herbert E. Brekle"&gt;Herbert E. Brekle, "Das typographische Prinzip", ''Gutenberg-Jahrbuch'', Vol. 72 (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;58–63 (60f.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes |first = C. Michael |last=Hogan |title=Knossos Fieldnotes |website=The Modern Antiquarian |date=29 December 2007 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently it has been alleged by Jerome Eisenberg that the disk is a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article4318911.ece |title = Phaistos Disc declared as fake by scholar |last=Alberge |first=Dalya |date=2008-07-12 |work=[[Times Online]]|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prüfening dedicatory inscription]] is medieval example of movable type stamps being used.

===Woodblock printing===
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' from [[Tang Dynasty]] China, an early woodblock-printed book, AD 868 ([[British Museum]])]]

Following the [[Cai Lun|invention of paper]] in the 2nd century AD during the Chinese [[Han Dynasty]], writing materials became more portable and economical than the bones, shells, bamboo slips, metal or stone tablets, silk, etc. previously used. Yet copying books by hand was still labour-consuming. Not until the Xiping Era (172–178 AD), towards the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty did sealing print and [[monotype]] appear. It was soon used for printing designs on fabrics, and later for printing texts.

[[Woodblock printing]], invented by about the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]], worked as follows. First, the neat hand-copied script was stuck on a relatively thick and smooth board, with the front of the paper, which was so thin that it was nearly transparent, sticking to the board, and characters showing in reverse, but distinctly, so that every stroke could be easily recognized. Then carvers cut away the parts of the board that were not part of the character, so that the characters were cut in relief, completely differently from those cut intaglio. When printing, the bulging characters would have some ink spread on them and be covered by paper. With workers' hands moving on the back of paper gently, characters would be printed on the paper. By the [[Song Dynasty]], woodblock printing came to its heyday. Although woodblock printing played an influential role in spreading culture, there remained some apparent drawbacks. Firstly, carving the printing plate required considerable time, labour and materials; secondly, it was not convenient to store these plates; and finally, it was difficult to correct mistakes.

With woodblock printing, one printing plate could be used for tens of hundreds of books, playing a magnificent role in spreading culture. Yet carving the plate was time and labour consuming. Huge books cost years of effort. The plates needed a lot of storage space, and were often damaged by deformation, worms and corrosion. If books had a small print run, and were not reprinted, the printing plates would become nothing but waste; and worse, if a mistake was found, it was difficult to correct it without discarding the whole plate.

=== Ceramic movable type ===
[[Bi Sheng]] (毕昇/畢昇) (990–1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the [[Northern Song]] dynasty, using ceramic materials.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;{{cite book |last=Man |first=John |title=The Gutenberg Revolution: The story of a genius that changed the world |year=2002 |publisher=Headline Book Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-7472-4504-5}} A detailed examination of Gutenberg's life and invention, interwoven with the underlying social and religious upheaval of [[Medieval Europe]] on the eve of the Renaissance.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (沈括) (1031–1095):

{{quote|When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.

For each character there were several types, and for certain common characters there were twenty or more types each, in order to be prepared for the repetition of characters on the same page. When the characters were not in use he had them arranged with paper labels, one label for each rhyme-group, and kept them in wooden cases.

If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.&lt;ref name="tsien"&gt;{{cite book |last = Tsien |first = Tsuen-Hsuin |authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |title = Paper and Printing |volume = vol. 5 part 1 |series = Needham, Joseph ''Science and Civilization in China'' |publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1985 |ISBN = 0-521-08690-6 |pages = 201–217}}; also published in Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd., 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1193, [[Zhou Bida]], an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', and printed his book ''Notes of The Jade Hall'' (《玉堂雜記》).&lt;ref name="Yinong"&gt;Xu Yinong, ''Moveable Type Books'' (徐憶農《活字本》) {{ISBN|7-80643-795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim that Bi Sheng's clay types were "fragile" and "not practical for large-scale printing" and "short lived"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sohn |first=Pow-Key |title=Early Korean Printing |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=79 |issue=2 |year=1959 |pages=96–103 |jstor=595851 |doi=10.2307/595851}}&lt;/ref&gt; was refuted by facts and experiments. Bao Shicheng (1775–1885) wrote that baked clay moveable type was "as hard and tough as horn"; experiments show that clay type, after being baked in an oven, becomes hard and difficult to break, such that it remains intact after being dropped from a height of two metres onto a marble floor. The length of clay movable types in China was 1 to 2 centimetres, not 2mm, thus hard as horn.

There has been an ongoing debate regarding the success of ceramic printing technology as there have been no printed materials found with ceramic movable types. However, it is historically recorded to have been used as late as 1844 in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref name="Yinong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jixing"&gt;Pan Jixing, A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}}

=== Wooden movable type ===
[[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051) also pioneered the use of wooden movable type around 1040 AD, as described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095). However, this technology was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Shen Kuo]] |title = [[Dream Pool Essays]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese movable type 1313-ce.png|thumb|A revolving typecase for wooden type in China, from [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s book published in 1313]]
In 1298, [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (王祯/王禎), a [[Yuan dynasty]] governmental official of [[Jingde County]], [[Anhui|Anhui Province]], China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of ''Records of Jingde County'' (《旌德縣志》), a book of more than 60,000 [[Chinese characters]]. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book ''A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books''. Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper.&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; In 1322，a [[Fenghua|Fenghua county]] officer Ma Chengde (馬称德) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed the 43-volume ''Daxue Yanyi'' (《大學衍義》). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume ''Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition'' (《武英殿聚珍版叢書》) was printed with 253,500 wooden movable types on order of the [[Qianlong Emperor]], and completed in one year.

A number of books printed in [[Tangut script]] during the [[Western Xia]] (1038–1227) period are known, of which the [[Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union]] that was discovered in the ruins of [[Baisigou Square Pagoda]] in 1991 is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Western Xia]] (1139–1193).&lt;ref name="zhang-yuzhen-2003"&gt;{{Cite journal |author = Zhang Yuzhen (張玉珍) |title = 世界上現存最早的木活字印本—宁夏贺兰山方塔出土西夏文佛經《吉祥遍至口和本讀》介紹 |trans-title=The world's oldest extant book printed with wooden movable type |journal = Library and Information (《書與情报》) |year = 2003 |issue = 1 |url = http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |issn = 1003-6938 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150528/http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |archivedate = 2012-04-02 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type.&lt;ref name="beijing-daily"&gt;{{Cite news |author1 = Hou Jianmei (侯健美) |author2 = Tong Shuquan (童曙泉) |title = 《大夏寻踪》今展國博 |trans-title='In the Footsteps of the Great Xia' now exhibiting at the National Museum |newspaper = [[Beijing Daily]] (《北京日报》) |date = 20 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logistical problems of handling the several thousand [[logograph]]s (required for full literacy in [[Middle Chinese|Chinese language]]) posed a particular difficulty. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a page from so many different types. However, if one used movable type to produce multiple copies of the same document, the speed of printing would increase relatively.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;{{rp|201}}

=== Metal movable type in China ===
At least 13 material finds in China indicate the invention of bronze movable type printing in China no later than the 12th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/history/zhongguogudaishi/special/huoziyinshua/|title=韩国剽窃活字印刷发明权只是第一步|website=news.ifeng.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the country producing large-scale bronze-plate-printed paper money and formal official documents issued by the [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] (1115–1234) and [[Southern Song]] (1127–1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti-counterfeit markers. Such paper-money printing might date back to the 11th-century [[jiaozi (currency)|''jiaozi'']] of [[Northern Song]] (960–1127).&lt;ref name="Jixing" /&gt;{{rp|41–54}}

[[File:五贯宝卷.jpg|thumb|right|Copperplate of 1215–1216 5000-[[Chinese cash (currency unit)|cash]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] [[paper money]] with bronze movable type counterfeit markers]]
The typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed "check" of the Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable-type characters, each selected from 1,000 different characters, such that each printed paper note has a different combination of markers. A copper-block printed note dated between 1215–1216 in the collection of [[Luo Zhenyu]]'s ''Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties'', 1914, shows two special characters – one called ''Ziliao'', the other called ''Zihao'' – for the purpose of preventing counterfeiting; over the ''Ziliao'' there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the ''Zihao'' there is an empty square hole – apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of [[Song dynasty]] money of the same period in the collection of the [[Shanghai Museum]] has two empty square holes above ''Ziliao'' as well as ''Zihou'', due to the loss of the two copper movable types. Song dynasty bronze block embedded with bronze metal movable type printed paper money was issued on a large scale and remained in circulation for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Moveable Type Printing in China'', by Pan Jixing, Professor of the Institute for History of Science, Academy of Science, Beijing, China, English Abstract, p.&amp;nbsp;273.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1298 book ''Zao Huozi Yinshufa'' (《造活字印书法》/《造活字印書法》) by the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368) official [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] mentions [[tin]] movable type, used probably since the [[Southern Song]] dynasty (1127–1279), but this was largely experimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] |year = 1298 |title = Zao Huozi Yinshufa (《造活字印書法》) |quote = 近世又铸锡作字, 以铁条贯之 (rendering: In the modern times, there's melten Tin Movable type, and linked them with iron bar)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unsatisfactory due to its incompatibility with the [[ink]]ing process.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;{{rp|217}}

During the [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1405), printing using movable type spread from China to Central Asia.{{clarify |reason = which others? names of cultures please. It beats saying "among others..." |date = February 2012}} The [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of Central Asia used movable type, their script type adopted from the Mongol language, some with Chinese words printed between the pages – strong evidence that the books were printed in China.&lt;ref name="TsienACH"&gt;''Chinese Paper and Printing, A Cultural History'', by Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Removeable type book.jpg|thumb|A page from bronze movable-type book by [[Hua Sui]], printed in 1490]]

During the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), [[Hua Sui]] in 1490 used bronze type in printing books.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;{{rp|212}} In 1574 the massive 1000-volume encyclopedia ''[[Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]]'' (《太平御览》/《太平御覧》) was printed with bronze movable type.

In 1725 the [[Qing Dynasty]] government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (《古今图书集成》/《古今圖書集成》, ''Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times''). Each set consisted of 5,040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.&lt;ref name="TsienACH" /&gt;

=== Metal movable type in Korea ===

In 1234 the first books known to have been printed in metallic type set were published in [[Goryeo Dynasty]] [[Korea]]. They form a set of ritual books, ''Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun'', compiled by [[Choe Yun-ui]].

The Asian Reading Room of the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C. displays examples of this metal type.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/world/world-record.html World Treasures of the Library of Congress]. Retrieved 26 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Commenting on the invention of metallic types by Koreans, French scholar Henri-Jean Martin described this as "[extremely similar] to Gutenberg's".&lt;ref name="Briggs 2002 pp.15-23"&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) ''A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet'', Polity, Cambridge, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. The [[Joseon dynasty]] scholar Seong Hyeon (성현, 成俔, 1439–1504) records the following description of the Korean font-casting process:

{{quote|At first, one cuts letters in beech wood. One fills a trough level with fine sandy [clay] of the reed-growing seashore. Wood-cut letters are pressed into the sand, then the impressions become negative and form letters [moulds]. At this step, placing one trough together with another, one pours the molten bronze down into an opening. The fluid flows in, filling these negative moulds, one by one becoming type. Lastly, one scrapes and files off the irregularities, and piles them up to be arranged.&lt;ref name="christensen" /&gt;}}

A potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for 200 years appeared in the early 15th century—a generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable-type invention in Europe—when [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|Sejong the Great]] devised a simplified [[alphabet]] of 24 characters ([[hangul]]) for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible. But Korea's cultural elite, "appalled at the idea of losing [[hanja]], the badge of their elitism", stifled the adoption of the new alphabet.&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt;

A "[[Confucianism|Confucian]] prohibition on the commercialization of printing" also obstructed the proliferation of movable type, restricting the distribution of books produced using the new method to the government.&lt;ref name="Burke" /&gt; The technique was restricted to use by the royal foundry for official state publications only, where the focus was on reprinting Chinese classics lost in 1126 when Korea's libraries and palaces had perished in a conflict between dynasties.&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;Burke&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly debate and speculation has occurred as to whether Eastern movable type spread to Europe between the late 14th century and early 15th centuries.&lt;ref name="christensen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;{{cite book | last = von Polenz | first = Peter | title = Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart: I.

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] of [[Mainz]], Germany is acknowledged as the first to invent a metal movable-type printing system in Europe, the [[printing press]]. Gutenberg was a [[goldsmith]] familiar with techniques of [[punchcutting|cutting punches]] for making coins from moulds. Between 1436 and 1450 he developed hardware and techniques for casting letters from [[matrix (printing)|matrices]] using a device called the [[hand mould]].&lt;ref name="meggs58-69" /&gt; Gutenberg's key invention and contribution to movable-type printing in Europe, the hand mould, was the first practical means of making cheap copies of letterpunches in the vast quantities needed to print complete books, making the movable-type printing process a viable enterprise.

Before Gutenberg, books were copied out by hand on scrolls and paper, or printed from hand-carved wooden blocks. It was extremely time-consuming; even a small book could take months to complete, and because the carved letters or blocks were flimsy and the wood susceptible to ink the blocks had a limited lifespan.

Gutenberg and his associates developed oil-based inks ideally suited to printing with a [[printing press|press]] on paper, and the first Latin [[typeface]]s. His method of casting type may have been different from the hand mould used in subsequent decades. Detailed analysis of the type used in his 42-line Bible has revealed irregularities in some of the characters that cannot be attributed to ink spread or type wear under the pressure of the press. Scholars conjecture that the type pieces may have been cast from a series of matrices made with a series of individual stroke punches, producing many different versions of the same glyph.[[File:Miklós Andor in the page-setting room of Athenaeum Printing House - cca. 1920 (1).tiff|thumb|Editing with movable metal – cca. 1920]]

&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the method used by Gutenberg involved using a single punch to make a mould, but the mould was such that the process of taking the type out disturbed the casting, creating variants and anomalies, and that the punch-matrix system came into use possibly around the 1470s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open2.net/home/view?entityID=15599&amp;jsp=themed_learning%2Fexpanding_viewer&amp;sessionID=-1161756493749&amp;entityName=object |title=What Did Gutenberg Invent?—Discovery |accessdate=2006-10-25 |year=2006 |publisher=BBC / [[Open University]] }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This raises the possibility that the development of movable type in the West may have been progressive rather than a single innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Gutenberg's movable-type printing system spread rapidly across Europe, from the single Mainz printing press in 1457 to 110 presses by 1480, of which 50 were in [[Italy]]. [[Venice]] quickly became the center of typographic and printing activity. Significant were the contributions of [[Nicolas Jenson]], [[Francesco Griffo]], [[Aldus Manutius]], and other printers of late 15th-century Europe.

== Type-founding ==
[[File:Long S-I Garamond sort 001.png|thumb|upright|A piece of cast metal type, [[Garamond]] style [[long s]] [[i]] [[Ligature (typography)|ligature]]. See also: [[Sort (typesetting)|Sort]].]]

Type-founding as practiced in Europe and the west consists of three stages.

; [[Punchcutting]]: If the glyph design includes enclosed spaces ([[counter (typography)|counters]]) then a counterpunch is made. The counter shapes are transferred in relief ([[cameo (carving)|cameo]]) onto the end of a rectangular bar of [[mild steel]] using a specialized [[engraving]] tool called a [[Burin (engraving)|graver]]. The finished counterpunch is hardened by heating and quenching ([[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]]), or exposure to a cyanide solution ([[case hardening]]). The counterpunch is then struck against the end of a similar rectangular steel bar—the letterpunch—to impress the counter shapes as recessed spaces ([[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]]). The outer profile of the glyph is completed by scraping away with a graver the material outside the counter spaces, leaving only the stroke or lines of the glyph. Progress toward the finished design is checked by successive ''smoke proofs''; temporary prints made from a thin coating of carbon deposited on the punch surface by a candle flame. The finished letter punch is finally hardened to withstand the rigors of reproduction by striking. One counterpunch and one letterpunch are produced for every letter or glyph making up a complete font.
; [[Matrix (printing)|Matrix]]: The letterpunch is used to strike a blank die of soft metal to make a negative letter mould, called a matrix.
; Casting: The matrix is inserted into the bottom of a device called a ''hand mould''. The mould is clamped shut and molten type metal alloy consisting mostly of [[lead]] and [[tin]], with a small amount of [[antimony]] for hardening, is poured into a cavity from the top. Antimony has the rare property of expanding as it cools, giving the casting sharp edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Answers.com page on antimony | work = McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology | publisher = McGraw-Hill | date = 2005-01-01 | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/antimony | accessdate = 2009-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the type metal has sufficiently cooled, the mould is unlocked and a rectangular block approximately 4 centimeters long, called a ''[[sort (typesetting)|sort]]'', is extracted. Excess casting on the end of the sort, called the ''tang'', is later removed to make the sort the precise height required for printing, known as "type height".

The type-height was quite different in different countries. The Monotype Corporation Limited in London UK produced moulds in various heights:

* {{convert|0.918|in|mm}} : United Kingdom, Canada, U.S.
* {{convert|0.928|in|mm}} : France, Germany, Switzerland and most other European countries
* {{convert|0.933|in|mm}} : Belgium height
* {{convert|0.9785|in|mm}} : Dutch height

A Dutch printers manual mentions a tiny difference between French and German Height:&lt;ref&gt;Blankenstein A.H.G., Wetser Ad: ''Zetten, uitgebreide leerstof, deel 1'', p.&amp;nbsp;26, Edecea, Hoorn, The Netherlands, 5th edition, (~1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

* 62.027 points Didot = {{convert|23.30|mm}} = English height
* 62.666 points Didot = {{convert|23.55|mm}} = French height
* 62.685 points Didot = {{convert|23.56|mm}} = German height
* 66.047 points Didot = {{convert|24.85|mm}} = Dutch Height
 
Tiny differences in type-height will cause quite bold images of characters.

At the end of the 19th century there were only two typefoundries left in the Netherlands: [[Joh. Enschedé|Johan Enschedé &amp; Zonen]], at [[Haarlem]], and [[Amsterdam Type foundry|Lettergieterij Amsterdam, voorheen Tetterode]]. They both had their own type-height: Enschedé: 65 23/24 points Didot, and Amsterdam: 66 1/24 points Didot. Enough difference to prevent a combined use of fonts of both typefoundries: Enschede would be to light, or otherwise the Amsterdam-font would print rather bold. A perfect way of binding clients.&lt;ref&gt;P.J.W.Oly, de grondslag van het bedrijf der lettergieterij Amsterdam, formerly N.Tetterode, edition: Stichting Lettergieten 1983, Westzaan, pag. 82-88&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 the Dutch governmental "Algemeene Landsdrukkerij", later: "State-printery" (Staatsdrukkerij) decided during a reorganisation to use a standard type-height of 63 points Didot. "Staatsdrukkerij-hoogte", actually Belgium-height, but this fact was not widely known.

== Typesetting ==
[[File:Metal movable type.jpg|right|thumb|A case of cast metal type pieces and typeset matter in a [[composing stick]]]]
{{Main|Typesetting|Type case}}

Modern, factory-produced movable type was available in the late 19th century. It was held in the printing shop in a ''job case'', a drawer about 2&amp;nbsp;inches high, a yard wide, and about two feet deep, with many small compartments for the various letters and ligatures. The most popular and accepted of the job case designs in America was the [[California Job Case]], which took its name from the Pacific coast location of the foundries that made the case popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amateurpress.org/bundle/camp194.htm National Amateur Press Association], Monthly Bundle Sample, Campane 194, ''The California Typecase'' by Lewis A. Pryor (Edited)&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate drawer or case that was located above the case that held the other letters; this is why capital letters are called "upper case" characters while the non-capitals are "lower case".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ewSglB2f7qYC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=capital+uppercase+typesetting+term&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6tr9ttWJM7&amp;sig=XVBi9LMycbrSTaYzeK4fPI7r8ZI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result Glossary of Typesetting Terms], by Richard Eckersley, Charles Ellerston, Richard Hendel, Page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Compartments also held spacers, which are blocks of blank type used to separate words and fill out a line of type, such as ''em'' and ''en'' quads (''quadrats'', or spaces. A ''quadrat'' is a block of type whose face is lower than the printing letters so that it does not itself print.). An em space was the width of a capital letter "M" – as wide as it was high – while an en space referred to a space half the width of its height (usually the dimensions for a capital "N").

Individual letters are assembled into words and lines of text with the aid of a [[composing stick]], and the whole assembly is tightly bound together to make up a page image called a ''forme'', where all letter faces are exactly the same height to form a flat surface of type. The forme is mounted on a [[printing press]], a thin coating of viscous ink is applied and impressions made on paper under great pressure in the press. "Sorts" is the term given to special characters not freely available in the typical type case, such as the "@" mark.

== Metal type combined with other methods ==
[[File:Ceramic type 02.jpg|thumb|Ceramic type from the collections of [[University of Reading]].]]

Sometimes it is erroneously stated that printing with metal type replaced the earlier methods. In the industrial era printing methods would be chosen to suit the purpose. For example, when printing large scale letters in posters etc. the metal type would have proved too heavy and economically unviable. Thus, large scale type was made as carved wood blocks as well as ceramics plates.&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Philip B., Purvis, Alston W. "Graphic Design and the Industrial Revolution" ''History of Graphic Design''. Hoboken, N.J: Wiley, 2006. p.&amp;nbsp;139.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in many cases where large scale text was required, it was simpler to hand the job to a [[Sign painting|sign painter]] than a printer.
Images could be printed together with movable type if they were made as [[woodcut]]s or [[wood engraving]]s as long as the blocks were made to the same type height. If [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] methods, such as copper plates, were used for the images, then images and the text would have required separate print runs on different machines.

'''Jacqueline Nancy Mary Adams''', {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CBE|QSO}} (19 May 1926 – 27 March 2007) was a [[New Zealand]] [[botanist]], [[botanical illustrator|botanical artist]], and [[museum curator]].  Born in Levin in 1926, Nancy Adams attended [[Wellington Girls' College|Wellington Girls’ College]] and [[Victoria University of Wellington]], studying [[zoology]] and botany. At 16 she joined the Botany Division of New Zealand's [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (New Zealand)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (DSIR).  She worked there until 1959, when she was appointed to the Dominion Museum (now the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]]) as assistant Curator of Botany with a special responsibility for algae. She retired from her position at the museum in 1987 but continued to be an Honorary Research Associate of the Museum.&lt;ref name="rnzih"&gt;{{cite web|last=New Zealand Garden Journal|title=Obituary|url=http://www.rnzih.org.nz/RNZIH_Journal/Pages_25-26_from_2007_Vol10_No1.pdf|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nancy Adams was a prolific artist, illustrating nearly forty publications on native plants, alpine life, trees and shrubs. Included in these publications is an article written by [[Ella Orr Campbell]] a fellow New Zealand botanist, for whom Adams drew ''Thallus of Marchasta bearing archegoniophres''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Ella O.|title=The Liverwort Genus Marchasta|journal=Tuatara|date=November 1961|volume=9|issue=2|page=77|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/Bio09Tuat02-fig-Bio09Tuat02_078a.html|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received international recognition for her detailed and delicate algal illustrations.&lt;ref name="rnzih" /&gt;  Awards included the [[Loder Cup]] in 1964, the [[Queen's Service Order]] in 1989, and the [[New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haines|first=Catharine|title=International women in science: a biographical dictionary to 1950|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=1-57607-090-5|pages=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HftdjMNDvwIC&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;ots=cfXuNgS2d-&amp;dq=madge%20adam%20oxford&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=madge%20adam%20oxford&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 she also received an award for her work ''Seaweeds of New Zealand: An Illustrated Guide'', which held a description of 600 different plant species and illustrating 441.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herald|first=The New Zealand|title=Obituary: Nancy Adams|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10431737|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neo-Dada Organizers''' was a Japanese [[Neo-Dada]]ist art group formed by [[Masunobu Yoshimura]]&lt;ref name=UCLA /&gt; that was active from 1960 until 1963.&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt; Composed of around ten young painters and performers who met periodically at Yoshimura's [[atelier]] in [[Shinjuku]], they "announced their radical stances through introducing destructive akushon (action) that deviates from any conventional form of art", and aimed to "shock the audience with impulsive, disturbing performances."&lt;ref name=UCLA&gt;{{cite web|title=BODY/  VIOLENCE/ CITY  The Neo-Dada Art  Actions in 1960 Tokyo|url=http://www.urbanhumanities.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/FA13-Body-Violence-City.pdf|publisher=Urban Humanities Institute, UCLA|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used the human body as their medium of art. Their violent performances were both based in artistic intentions and responded to the political climate the time.

==Origins==
Neo-Dada Organizers was reacting to a Japan that was rapidly modernizing after the destruction of [[World War II]]. Beyond opposing the art of the time, they reacted "to the increasing number and tenacity of public policies aimed at regulating the body",&lt;ref name=UCLA /&gt; and in particular to the efforts by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] government, led by Prime Minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]], to renew the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|United States Japan Security Treaty]], which led to massive protests across the country.

{{Video games}}
'''Nonviolent video games''' are [[video game]]s characterized by little or no [[Violence#Violence in the media|violence]]. As the term is vague, game designers, developers, and marketers that describe themselves as non-violent video game makers, as well as certain reviewers and members of the non-violent gaming community, often employ it to describe games with ''comparatively'' little or no violence. The definition has been applied flexibly to games in such purposive genres as the [[Christian video game]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Beliefs/story?id=1042784&amp;page=1 Christian Video Games Offer Wholesome Action: Game Makers Hope Non-Violent Alternatives Will Catch On]''. [[ABC News|ABC News/Technology]]. 17 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of games at the fringe of the "non-violence" label can only be viewed as objectively violent.

The purposes behind the development of the nonviolent genre are primarily reactionary in nature. As video quality and level of gaming technology have increased, the violent nature of some video games has gained worldwide attention from moral, political, gender, and medical/psychological quarters. The popularity of violent video games and increases in youth violence have led to much research into the degree to which video games may be blamed for societally negative behaviors. Despite the inconclusive nature of the scientific results, a number of groups have rejected violent video games as offensive and have promoted the development of non-violent alternatives. The existence of a market for such games has in turn led to the manufacture and distribution of a number of games specifically designed for the nonviolent gaming community. Video game reviewers have additionally identified a number of games belonging to traditionally violent gameplay genres as "nonviolent" in comparison to a typical game from the violent genre. Despite the fact that some of these games contain mild violence, many of them have entered the argot of nonviolent gamers as characteristic non-violent games.

==Video game violence and attendant controversies==
{{Main article|Video game controversy#Crime and violence}}

Controversies surrounding the negative influences of video games are nearly as old as the medium itself. In 1964, [[Marshall McLuhan]], a noted media theorist, suggested in his book, ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'', that "[t]he games people play reveal a great deal about them.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]''. Signet. 1964. Re-issued 1994. {{ISBN|0-262-63159-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; " This was built upon in the early 1980s in an anti-video-game crusade spearheaded by the former Long Island PTA president, Ronnie Lamm, who spoke about her cause on the [[PBS NewsHour|MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour]] in December 1982.&lt;ref name=gonzalez&gt;Gonzalez, Lauren. ''[http://www.gamespot.com/features/6090892 When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy]''. [[GameSpot]] feature. Retrieved 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], [[C. Everett Koop]], had suggested that games had no merit and offered little in the way of anything constructive to young people.&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt; Despite early general claims of the negative effects of video games, however, effects of these concerns were relatively minor prior to the early 1990s.

Discussion of the impact of violence in video games came as early as 1976's ''[[Death Race (1976 video game)|Death Race]]'' arcade game (a game with black and white graphics which involved running over screaming zombies).  In the 1980s titles such as Exidy's ''[[Chiller (video game)|Chiller]]'' (1986), Namco's ''[[Splatterhouse]]'' (1987) and Midway's ''[[Narc (video game)|NARC]]'' (1988) raised concerns about video game violence in the arcade. Home games such as [[Palace Software|Palace]]'s ''[[Barbarian (Palace Software)|Barbarian]]'' (1987) featured the ability to decapitate opponents. It was not until graphic capabilities increased and a wave of new ultra-violent titles were released in the early 1990s that the mainstream news began to pay significant attention to the phenomenon. In 1992, with [[Midway Games|Midway]]'s release of the first ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' video game, and then in 1993 with [[id Software|id]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', genuine controversy was first ignited as the wide and growing popularity of violent video games came into direct conflict with the moral and religious ethics of concerned citizens. Protests and [[List of banned video games|game-bannings]] followed the publicizing of these conflicts, and controversies would erupt periodically throughout the 1990s with the releases of such games as ''[[Dreamweb]]'' (1992), ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' (1992), ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' (1993), ''[[Phantasmagoria (video game)|Phantasmagoria]]'' (1995), ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' (1996), ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]'' (1997), ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' (1997), ''[[Carmageddon]]'' (1997), ''[[Postal (video game)|Postal]]'' (1997), ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' (1997), ''[[Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now]]'' (1998), ''[[Blood II: The Chosen]]'' (1998), ''[[Grand Theft Auto 2]]'' (1999), and ''[[Requiem: Avenging Angel]]'' (1999) among others.

In April 1999, the fears of the media and violence-watch groups were legitimated in their eyes as investigations into the lives of [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], the shooters in the [[Columbine High School massacre]], revealed that they had been fans of the video game, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', and had even created [[Doom WAD|levels]] for it today dubbed "the [[Harris levels]]". A great deal of discussion of violence in video games followed this event with strong arguments made on both sides, and research into the phenomenon which had begun during the 1980s received renewed support and interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20080422082626/http://mentalhealth.about.com/cs/familyresources/a/vidgameviolence.htm Violent Video Games Produce Violent Behavior]''. [[About.com]] article. 9 November 2005. Retrieved 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher]], led a study on violence in youth and determined that while the impact of video games on violent behavior has yet to be determined, "findings suggest that media violence has a relatively small impact on violence," and that "meta-analysis [had demonstrated that] the overall effect size for both randomized and correlational studies was small for physical aggression and moderate for aggressive thinking."&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;

Despite this, the controversies and debate have persisted, and this has been the catalyst for the emergence of the non-violent video game genre. Non-violent video games are defined in the negative by a ''[[Modus tollendo ponens]]'' [[Disjunctive syllogism|disjunctive argument]]. In other words, in order to recognize a non-violent game, an identifier must recognize the violent game as a distinct class. This has led to a degree of ambiguity in the term as it relies upon a definition of [[violence]] which for different identifiers may mean different things. In general, violence may be placed into at least three distinct categories:
*Totally non-violent games – Games in which absolutely no violence occurs. This category contains games characterized by lack of the death of characters, lack of sudden noise or movement, and often lack of traditional conflict. (e.g., ''[[Below the Root (video game)|Below the Root]]'' or ''[[Sudoku Gridmaster]]'')
*Games in which the player acts non-violently – Games where violence occurs to the character-player as a result of environmental hazards or enemies but the character-player's reaction is to run away or otherwise distance himself from the violence.
**Games with environmental hazards only – Games lacking enemies, but containing a potentially violent environment (E.g. ''[[Alleyway (video game)|Alleyway]]'', or ''[[Roller Coaster (video game)|Roller Coaster]]'')
**Games with enemies – Games with violent enemies which the player-character must avoid (E.g. the ''[[Eggerland (series)|Eggerland]]'' series)
*Games in which the player acts non-violently to other sentient beings – Games where a player acts violently against robots or other non-living non-sentient enemies (E.g. ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'')

===Education===
The majority of these games have not been scientifically tested to see whether children learn the skills the games claim to teach.In another study performed in Chile, educational video games were put into some first and second grade classrooms. Children who had the games in their classroom showed more progress in math, reading comprehension, and spelling than the children who did not use games in their classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmch.tv/mentors_teachers/video_games_benefits.asp "Are there any benefits of playing video games" Accessed 13 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
{{Main article|Video game effects}}

The [[history of video games|history of video game development]] shares approximate contemporaneity with [[media violence research]] in general. In the early 1960, studies were conducted on the effects of [[adolescents and cartoon violence|violence in cartoons]],&lt;ref&gt;Mussen, P., &amp; Rutherford, E. (1961). ''Effects of aggressive cartoons on children’s aggressive play''. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 62, 461–464.&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the 1970s and 1980s a number of studies were conducted on how televised violence influenced viewers (especially younger viewers). The focus of many of these studies was on the effects of exposure of children to violence, and these studies frequently employed the [[social learning theory]] framework developed by [[Albert Bandura]] to explore violent behavioral modeling.

[[File:David Satcher official photo portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher]] has conducted research in the field of video game violence and has concluded that "findings suggest that media violence has a relatively small impact on [youth] violence."&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;]]
With advancements in video technology and the rise of video games containing graphic violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, media violence research shifted to a great degree from televised violence to video game violence. Although under current debate, a number of researchers have claimed that violent games may cause more intense feelings of aggression than nonviolent games, and may trigger feelings of anger and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C. A., &amp; Bushman, B. J. (2001). ''Effects of violent games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A meta-analytical review of the scientific literature''. Psychological Science, 12, 353–359.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical explanations for these types of effects have been explained in myriad theories including social cognitive theory, excitation transfer theory, priming effect and the [[Video game effects#General Aggression Model|General Aggression Model]].  However recent scholarship has suggested that social cognitive theories of aggression are outdated and should be retired.&lt;ref&gt;name=Ferguson &amp; Dyck, 2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Christopher|title=Paradigm change in aggression research: The time has come to retire the General Aggression Model|journal=Aggression and Violence Behavior|year=2012|issue=17|pages=220–228|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927103208/http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One difference between video games and television which nearly all media violence studies recognize is that video games are primarily interactive while television is primarily passive in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsh, Stephen J. ''Children, Adolescents, and Media Violence – A Critical Look at the Research''. Media Violence and the Concept of Risk. [[SAGE Publications]]. 2006. p. 276. {{ISBN|0-7619-2976-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Video game players identify with the character they control in the video games and there have been suggestions that the interactivity available in violent video games narrows the gap between the theory and practice of youth violence in a manner that goes beyond the effects of televised violence.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Kelly Stephen. ''[http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-1107102-220029/unrestricted/Meyers_dis.pdf Television and Video Game Violence: Age Differences and the Combined Effects of Passive and Interactive Violent Media]''. Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College – Department of Psychology. December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Patricia Marks and Cocking, Rodney R. ''Interacting with video: Volume 11 of Advances in applied developmental psychology''. Greenwood Publishing Group. 1996. {{ISBN|1-56750-152-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledgment of the fact that, for better or worse, video games are likely to remain a part of modern society has led to a brace of comparative studies between violent games and non-violent games.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;Cooper, J., &amp; Mackie, D. (1986). ''Video games and aggression in children''. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 16(8), 726–744.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamborini, R., Eastin, M. S., Skalski, P., Lachlan, K., Fediuk, T. A., &amp; Brady, R. (2004). ''Violent virtual video games and hostile thoughts''. Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, 48(3), 335–357.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=polman&gt;Polman, H., de Castro, B. O., &amp; van Aken, M. A. G. (2008). ''Experimental study of the differential effects of playing versus watching violent video games on children’s aggressive behavior''. Aggressive Behavior, 34(3), 256–264.&lt;/ref&gt; As technology has advanced, such studies have adapted to include the effects of violent games and non-violent games in new media methods such as immersive virtual reality simulations.&lt;ref&gt;Arriaga, P., Esteves, F., Caneiro, P., &amp; Monteiro, M. B. (2008). ''Are the effects of unreal violent video games pronounced when playing with a virtual reality system?'' Aggressive Behavior, 34(5), 521–538.&lt;/ref&gt;

Results have varied, with some research indicating correlation between violence in video games and violence in players of the games, and other research indicating minimal if any relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Craig &amp; Dill, Karen. ''Video Games and Aggressive Thoughts, Feelings, and Behavior in the Laboratory and in Life''. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, April 2000 Vol. 78, No. 4, 772–790.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silvern, S. B., &amp; Williamson, P. A. (1987). The effects of video game play on young children’s aggression, fantasy, and prosocial behavior. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 8(4), 453–462.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of solid conclusion on the issue, the suggestion that violent games cause youth violence together with the clear popularity of violent video game genres such as the [[first-person shooter]] have led some game designers to publish non-violent alternatives.&lt;ref name=dobson&gt;Dobson, Jason.

===Lawsuits and legislation===
As research supporting the view that video game violence leads to youth violence has been produced, there have been a number of lawsuits initiated by victims to gain compensation for loss alleged to have been caused by video-game-related violence. Similarly, in the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] and the legislatures of states and other countries, a number of legislative actions have been taken to mandate rating systems and to curb the distribution of violent video games. At times, individual games considered too violent have been censored or banned in such countries as [[Censorship in Australia#Video games|Australia]], [[Law 3037/2002|Greece]], [[List of banned video games|etc.]]

[[File:JackThompsonAttorney.jpg|thumb|200px|Former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] has filed lawsuits against the makers of violent games, alleging the violent content causes real-world violence.]]

Christian Science Monitor. 19 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Activism|activist]] and (now former) attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] brought suit against [[Atari]], [[Nintendo]], [[Sega]], and [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] on behalf of the victims of [[Heath High School shooting]] in ''[[Heath High School shooting|James v. Meow Media]]''. The suit was dismissed in 2000, absolving the companies of responsibility for the shooter's actions based on a lack of remedy under Kentucky [[tort]] law.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=16730 Federal appeals panel upholds dismissal of lawsuit against movie, video game makers]''. [[Associated Press]]. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the dismissal, and in 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] denied [[certiorari]], refusing to review the case because it was not dismissed on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=17477 High court won't revive suit blaming Hollywood for school shooting]''. [[Associated Press]]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the County Council for St. Louis, Missouri enacted Ordinance 20,193 that barred minors from purchasing, renting, or playing violent video games deemed to contain any visual depiction or representation of realistic injury to a human or a "human-like being" that appealed to minors' "morbid interest in violence."&lt;ref name=krug&gt;Krug, Judith F. &amp; Caldwell-Stone, Deborah. ''[http://www.mediainstitute.org/ONLINE/FAM2003/6-a.html Controversial Ruling Finds Video Games Not Protected Speech]''. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This ordinance was challenged in 2001 by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) as violative of freedom of expression as guaranteed by the first amendment. The IDSA cited the 7th Circuit case of ''American Amusement Machine Association v. Kendrick''&lt;ref&gt;''American Amusement Machine Association v. Kendrick'', 244 F.3d 572 (7th Cir. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; as precedent suggesting that video game content was a form of freedom of expression, however in 2002 the Eastern District Court of Missouri ultimately issued the controversial ruling that "video games are not a form of expression protected by the First Amendment" in ''Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County''.&lt;ref&gt;''Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County'', 200 F. Supp. 2d 1126 (E.D. Mo. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Columbine High School massacre]], a $5 billion lawsuit was filed in 2001 against a number of video game companies and [[id Software]], the makers of the purportedly violent video game, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' by victims of the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=13762 Federal suit blames video-game makers for Columbine shooting]''.

The suit was dismissed by Judge Babcock in March 2002 in a ruling suggesting that a decision against the game makers would have a chilling effect on free speech. Babcock noted that "it is manifest that there is social utility in expressive and imaginative forms of entertainment, even if they contain violence."&lt;ref name=AP1/&gt;

In 2003, Washington State enacted a statute banning the sale or rental to minors of video games&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Chris. ''[http://money.cnn.com/2003/05/20/technology/gaminglaw Wash. bans 'violent' game sales]''. CNN/Money. 21 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; containing "aggressive conflict in which the player kill, injures, or otherwise causes physical harm to a human form in the game who is depicted by dress or other recognizable symbols as a public law enforcement officer." In 2004, this statute was subsequently declared an unconstitutional violation of the first amendment right to free speech in the Federal District Court case of ''Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Maleng''.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Irwin. ''Case-in-Point''. Legal Television Network. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Jack Thompson brought suit against [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' in representation of the victims of the [[Devin Moore (murderer)|Devin Moore]] shooting incident. On 7 November 2005, Thompson withdrew from ''[[Strickland v. Sony]]'', stating, "It was my idea [to leave the case]." He was quick to mention that the case would probably do well with or without his presence. This decision followed scrutiny from Judge James Moore, however Thompson claimed he received no pressure to withdraw. At the same time, Judge James Moore had taken the motion to revoke Thompson's license under advisement. Jack Thompson appeared in court to defend his ''[[pro hac vice]]'' right to practice law in Alabama, following accusations that he violated legal ethics.&lt;ref&gt;DeWitt, Robert.

In 2005, California State Senator, [[Leland Yee]] introduced [[California Assembly Bills 1792 &amp; 1793]] which barred ultra-violent video games and mandated the application of [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] ratings for video games. Yee, a former [[Developmental psychology|child psychologist]] has [[Leland Yee#Video game controversies|publicly criticized]] such games as ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' and ''[[Manhunt 2]]'', and opposes the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s ''Global Gaming League''. Both of these bills were passed by the assembly and signed by Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in October 2005. By December 2005, both bills had been struck down in court by Judge Ronald Whyte as unconstitutional, thereby preventing either from going into effect on 1 January 2006. Similar bills were subsequently filed in such states as Michigan and Illinois, but to date all have been ruled to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, Patrick R.

Houston Law Review&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, in reaction to such controversial games as ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] along with Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] and [[Evan Bayh]], introduced the [[Family Entertainment Protection Act]] (S.2126), intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games by imposing a federal mandate for inclusion of [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] ratings.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4682533.stm Clinton wades into GTA sex storm]''.

In June 2006, the Louisiana case of ''[[Entertainment Software Association v. Foti]]'' struck down a state statute that sought to bar minors from purchasing video games with violent content. The statute was declared an unconstitutional violation of the 1st Amendment. Amici filing briefs included [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]].

On 27 September 2006, Senator [[Sam Brownback]] (R-KS) introduced the United States [[Truth in Video Game Rating Act]] (S.3935). The act would require the ESRB to have access to the full content of and hands-on time with the games it was to rate, rather than simply relying on the video demonstrations submitted by developers and publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Proposes New ESRB Legislation|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11030|work = [[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=9 October 2008}} 27 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Congressman [[Fred Upton]] introduced the [[Video Game Decency Act]] (H.R.6120) to the House.

===Degrees of violence===
{{Main article|Video game content rating system}}

Video game rating boards exist in a number of countries, typically placing restrictions (suggested or under force of law) for content that is violent or sexual in nature. About 5% of games fall into a category rated "mature" and recommended to those 17 years old and older. Those games account for about a quarter of all video game sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-06-27-supreme-court-violent-video-games_n.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Joan | last1=Biskupic | first2=Mike | last2=Snider | title=Supreme Court rejects ban on violent video games | date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamers seeking violence find themselves increasingly age restricted as identified violence level increases. This means that non-violent games, which are the least restricted, are available to all players at any age. This moral or legislative public policy against violence has the indirect effect of encouraging players of all ages and especially younger players to play non-violent games, however it also produces something of a [[forbidden fruit]] effect. For this and other reasons, the effectiveness of rating systems such as the ESRB to actually curb violent gameplay in youth gaming has been characterized as futile.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. David Walsh (21 March 2000).

The number of studies in this field has blossomed contemporaneously with greater [[gender studies]], and a degree of tension exists in the field between the traditional stereotype of violence as a male-dominant characteristic and the realities of the marketing data for violent games.

In 2008, an example of such studies was funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice to the Center for Mental Health and Media.&lt;ref&gt;Olson CK, Kutner LA, Warner DE, Almerigi JB, Baer L, Nicholi AM Jr, &amp; Beresin EV: ''Factors correlated with violent video game use by adolescent boys and girls''. Journal of Adolescent Health, 2007, 41: 77–83&lt;/ref&gt; These studies were released in the book, ''[[Grand Theft Childhood]]'', wherein it was found that among girls, nine of the "top ten [most popular video games] were nonviolent games such as ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' titles, ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' or [[Game (simulation)|simulation game]]s" compared to a majority of violent games in the top ten favorites of boys.&lt;ref&gt;Kutner, Lawrence, Ph.D. and Olson, Cheryl K., Sc.D. ''[[Grand Theft Childhood|Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do]]''. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. 15 April 2008. {{ISBN|0-7432-9951-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the conclusion reached in ''Grand Theft Childhood'' was that "focusing on such easy but minor targets as violent video games causes parents, social activists and public-policy makers to ignore the much more powerful and significant causes of youth violence that have already been well established, including a range of [non-gender-linked] social, behavioral, economic, biological and mental-health factors."&lt;ref&gt;Kutner, Lawrence, Ph.D. and Olson, Cheryl K., Sc.D. ''[[Grand Theft Childhood|Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do]]''. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. 15 April 2008. {{ISBN|0-7432-9951-5}}. p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion supports [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher|Satcher]]'s 2001 study (''supra'').&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;

Despite this conclusion, general awareness of the issue together with traditional stereotyping has led a number of game developers and designers to create non-violent video games specifically for [[girl gamer|female audiences]]. Advertisement placement and other marketing techniques have in the past targeted women as more receptive to non-violent video game genres such as [[life simulation game]]s, [[strategy game]]s, or [[puzzle video game]]s. Although these genres often contain certain degrees of violence, they lack the emphasis on graphic violence characterized for instance by the [[first-person shooter]] genre.

==Religious perspective==
Criticism for the violent aspects of video game culture has come from a number of anti-violence groups, and perhaps the most vocal of these are the numerous religious opposition groups. The moral codes of nearly all major religions contain prohibitions against murder and violence in general. In some cases this prohibition even extends to aggression, wrath, and anger. Violent video games, while merely vicarious in nature, have been the focus of religious disapproval or outrage in various circles.&lt;ref name=nash/&gt; Notable anti-violent-video-game crusader, former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] is a self proclaimed [[Christian right|Christian conservative]],&lt;ref name=provenzo/&gt; and his legal actions against violent video games have been intimately linked to his religious views. As groups like the [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] population have increased in number of adherents, new marketing opportunities have developed contemporaneously.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;Davis, Matthew. ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4534835.stm Christians purge video game demons]''. BBC News – Washington. 24 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Several religion-centric games forums such as [[GameSpot]]'s [[GameSpot#Forums|"Religion and Philosophy" forum]] have developed within the greater gaming community in reaction to this growing niche.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gamespot.com/pages/unions/forums/show_topics.php?board_id=909179086&amp;union_id=7382 Religion and Philosophy]''.

===Christian games===
{{Main article|Christian video game}}
There has been a rapid increase in [[Christian video game]]s in the last decade,&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; however as Christian games have striven to compete with their more popular secular progenitors, there has been an increasing number of games released that blur the lines between Christian and non-Christian values.&lt;ref&gt;Hutson, Jonathan. ''[http://www.talk2action.org/story/2006/5/29/195855/959 The Purpose Driven Life Takers (Part 1)]''. Talk to Action. 29 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Thompson, for instance, has publicly decried such Christian games as ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]'', stating "It's absurd, ... you can be the Christians blowing away the infidels, and if that doesn't hit your hot button, you can be the Antichrist blowing away all the Christians."&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;Chmielewski, Dawn C. ''[http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/10/business/fi-godgames10/2 Converting Video Games Into Instruments of God]'' LA Times. 10 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (The game reviewers [[IGN]], [[Ars Technica]] and [[GameSpy]] have disagreed that "Left Behind: Eternal Forces" is overtly violent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.ign.com/articles/745/745956p1.html IGN: Left Behind: Eternal Forces Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/reviews/2006/12/leftbehind.ars Ars Technica: Left Behind: Eternal Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/left-behind-eternal-forces/749748p1.html GameSpy: Left Behind: Eternal Forces Review]&lt;/ref&gt;) Similarly, James Dobson, PhD., founder of the [[Focus on the Family]] group, has advised parents in relation to video games to "avoid the violent ones altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, James. Dr. ''[http://www.uexpress.com/focusonthefamily/index.html?uc_full_date=20041010 Teen's Hard Times Can Help Build Character]''. 10 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Super 3D Noah's Ark.png|frame|In the [[Christian video game]], ''[[Super 3D Noah's Ark]]'', the player takes the role of [[Noah]] as he non-violently shoots food with a slingshot in order to sate hordes of ravening animals.]]
Although Christian games have been around since [[Sparrow Records]]' ''[[Music Machine (album series)#Spin-offs|Music Machine]]'' for the [[Atari 2600]], there have been few genres as unassailably violent as that of the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS). The majority of games that have been [[List of banned video games|banned]] for violence have been FPS games, and for this reason, Christian games in the FPS genre have struggled to overcome the blurring effects of the violence inherent to the genre. Games such as ''[[Revelation 7 (video game)|Revelation 7]]'' and ''[[Xibalba (video game)|Xibalba]]'', for instance, have attempted to avoid claims of violence by using "off the wall" [[absurdism|absurdist]] humor with enemies such as flying, bat-winged clown heads (modeled after the biblical [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]]) that shoot rays out of their nose, or alien Nazis (a mocking reference to [[Raëlism|Raëlian]] religious beliefs)&lt;ref name=linder&gt;Linder, Matthew. ''Marty Bee Interview''. Gamepraise.net (also available at Objectiveministries.org). 1 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian FPS games such as ''[[Eternal War]]'' have avoided the issue by expressing the view that justified violence is morally acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twoguyssoftware.ca/ Xrucifix]. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these games, despite containing objectively violent content, have been affirmatively labeled "non-violent video games" by marketers and faith-based non-violent gaming communities. In direct response to the [[Columbine High School massacre]] (alleged to have been caused by the shooters' obsession with the game, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''), Rev. Ralph Bagley began production on ''[[Catechumen (video game)|Catechumen]]'', a Christian first-person game produced by N'Lightening Software involving holy swords instead of guns.&lt;ref&gt;Dee, Jonathan. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01GAMES.html PlayStations of the Cross]''. New York Times. 1 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Catechumen'', the player fights inhuman demons using holy armament. When "sent back" the demons produce no blood or gore, and for this reason it has been described as a non-violent game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/disneys-atlantis-the-lost-empire Metacritic Game Review]&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of ''Catechumen'', according to Rev. Bagley, is "to build the genre of Christian gaming. People are tired of having these violent, demonic games dictating to their kids."&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; Among Christian FPS games, a lack of gore has often been used as the minimum standard for non-violence. Christian game reviewers have at times characterized non-Christian games such as ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' and ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'' as comparatively non-violent games despite their lack of a Christian focus.

An example of a notable Christian video game organization is the Christian Game Developers Foundation, focusing on [[Family-friendliness|family-friendly]] gameplay and Biblical principles. Another well known Christian video game creator and distributor is [[Wisdom Tree]] which is best known for its unlicensed Christian video games on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].

===Hindu games===
In 2006, Escapist magazine reported that a Hindu first-person shooter entitled ''My Hindu Shooter'' was in the works.&lt;ref&gt;Varney, Allen. ''[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_66/385-My-Hindu-Shooter My Hindu Shooter]''. 10 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''My Hindu Shooter'', a game based on the [[Unreal Engine]], the player employs the [[Vedas|Vedic]] abilities of [[Jyotiṣa|astrology]], [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic healing]], breathing (meditation), [[herbalism]], [[Gandharva Kingdom#Gandharva Chitrasena|Gandharva Veda music]], architecture (which let you purify demonic areas) and [[Yajna|yagyas]] (rituals). Gameplay involved acquisition of the [[siddhi]]s of clairvoyance, levitation, invisibility, shrinking and strength, and the ultimate goal of the game was to achieve pure consciousness by removing [[karma]] through completion of quests and cleansing the six [[chakra]]s in ascending order.&lt;ref&gt;Kietzmann, Ludwig.

===Buddhist games===
According to Buddhist morality, the first of the [[Five Precepts]] of [[Śīla]] is a personal rule of not killing. This moral guideline extends to human as well as non-human life. 
There are five conditions to violate the first precept:
# The being must be alive. 
# There must be the knowledge that it is a sentient living being. 
# There must be an intention to cause death. 
# An act must be done to cause death. 
# There must be death, as the result of the said act.

{{Original research|section|date=July 2014}}As the first precept requires an actual living being to be killed to be considered as violated, Buddhists can still enjoy video games with violence because there is no real being that is dying or being hurt. The fuller extent of the first precept is to maintain a harmless attitude towards all. The main problem is the mind, which is the main focus of Buddhism. Violent video games tend to create ill-will and tension, thus it is not conducive for meditation practice. Other than that, the action of the mind also creates ''kamma'' (action) which will bear its fruit when the conditions are right.

Although primarily [[browser game]]s, a number of stand-alone video games eschewing violence, such as the 2007 Thai game ''Ethics Game'' have been created that promote the Five Precepts and Buddhism generally.&lt;ref&gt;Sherriff, Lucy.

===Muslim games===
Despite notoriety in the Western press for controversial violent games such as ''[[Under Ash]]'', and ''[[Under Siege (2005 video game)|Under Siege]]'', Muslim developer Afkar Media has also produced at least one non-violent game entitled ''Road Block Buster''. In ''Road Block Buster'' the hero must "jump[] around [] doing tricks to soldiers ...

===Religion neutral games===
Non-profit organization [http://heartseed.sourceforge.net/ Heartseed] set out to produce several non-violent games, drawing inspiration from a claimed agreement between several religions under the sign of nonviolence: "Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism and others, – because throughout all of them can be found a common thread of  decency meant to propel us toward spiritual enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://heartseed.sourceforge.net/about.php Heartseed's About Page ]''&lt;/ref&gt; This project seems to have been discontinued.

==Types of non-violent video games==
Non-violent video games as a genre are characterized as a [[Video game genres#Video game genres by purpose|genre by purpose]]. Unlike genres described by style of gameplay, non-violent video games span a wide number of gameplay genres. Defined in the negative, the purpose of non-violent games is to provide the player with an experience that ''lacks'' violence. Many traditional gameplay genres naturally lack violence and application of the term "non-violent video games" to titles that fall under these categories raises no questions regarding accuracy. For game developers and designers who self-identify as non-violent video game makers, however, the challenge has been to expand the concepts of non-violence into such traditionally violent gameplay genres as [[action game]]s, [[role-playing game (video games)|role-playing games]], [[strategy game]]s, and the [[first-person shooter]].&lt;ref name=linder/&gt;

[[Video game genres#Other notable genres|Emergent and more recent gameplay genres]] such as [[music video game]]s are for the most part naturally non-violent. [[Video game genres#Video game genres by purpose|Purposive video game genres]] such as [[educational game]]s also are primarily non-violent in nature. Other electronic game genres like [[audio game]]s are also most frequently non-violent. The indisputably non-violent nature of these games are often considered self-evident by members of both the non-violent gaming community and the gaming community at large. As such they are often not explicitly identified as such. Typically, explicit identification is applied counterintuitively to titles where there might otherwise be a question concerning non-violence. This has led such categorization to be viewed with mistrust, hostility, and mockery&lt;ref name=brown&gt;Brown, Seth. ''[http://www.cracked.com/article_15672_praystation-6-most-misguided-christian-video-games.html PrayStation: The 6 Most Misguided Christian Video]''. [[Cracked.com]]. August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; by those who fail to recognize the comparative nature of the definition or who disagree fundamentally with the underlying purpose of the genre.

===Traditionally non-violent games===
[[File:KMines.png|thumb|Games like ''[[Minesweeper (video game)|Minesweeper]]'' contain traditionally non-violent [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] aspects, though minesweeper takes its name from a facet of war.]]
Among traditionally non-violent games are included [[List of maze video games|maze games]], [[adventure game]]s, [[life simulation game]]s, [[construction and management simulation]] games, and some [[vehicle simulation game]]s among others. These games are generally less frequently described as non-violent due to the self-evident nature of the descriptive term. Prior to the development of games specifically designed for non-violence, non-violent gamers were limited to these traditionally non-violent genres, however a number of games even under the traditionally non-violent umbrella may be considered arguably violent. ''[[Minesweeper (computer game)|Minesweeper]]'', for instance, is an abstraction of a scenario that often leads to a patently violent result.

Other common traditionally non-violent genres include [[adventure game]]s, [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]]s, [[music video game]]s, [[programming game]]s, [[Party video game|party games]], and traditional games.

Examples of traditionally non-violent games include:
*''[[Sudoku Gridmaster]]'' – A totally non-violent game wherein the player must assign the mathematically appropriate number to the corresponding blank in a grid.
*''[[Roller Coaster (video game)|Roller Coaster]]'' – A game featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player must navigate a dangerous amusement park to collect pieces of money.
*''[[Alleyway (video game)|Alleyway]]'' – A game with only environmental hazards featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player must break blocks (mild violence) with a ball while avoiding the floor of the level.
*The ''[[Eggerland (series)|Eggerland]]'' series – A series with enemies featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player must solve block-sliding puzzles in order to secure a key and unlock the door to the next room.
*''[[Robots (1984 video game)|Robots]]'' – A game lacking violence to sentient beings wherein a player must either bomb malfunctioning robots or conserve bombs by stepping strategically in order to induce the robots to crash into one another.

===Non-violent action games===
[[File:Seiklus.jpg|thumb|''[[Seiklus]]'' is a [[platform game|platformer]] that lacks much of the violence traditionally associated with platformers.]]
Action games have typically been among the most violent of video games genres with the liberal employment of enemies to thwart the actions of the player-character, and an emphasis on killing these enemies to neutralize them. As action games have developed they have become progressively more violent over the years as advances in graphic capabilities allowed for more realistic enemies and death sequences. Nevertheless, some companies like [[Nintendo]] have tended to shy away from this kind of realism in favor of cartoon and fantasy violence, a concept also implicated in the increase of youth violence by [[media violence research]]ers. This has created a spectrum of violence in action games. Non-violent video game proponents have labeled a number of games containing comparatively low-level violence as non-violent as well as games such as the anti-violent [[serious game]], ''[[Food Force]]''.

Studies have also shown that there are tangible benefits to violence in action games such as increased ability to process visual information quickly and accurately. This has led to support for the development of action games that are non-violent which will allow players to retain the positive visual processing benefits without the negatives associated with violence.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Mark.

====Non-violent first person shooters====
The application of the term "non-violent" to genres such as the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS), that many players consider ''inherently'' or ''definitionally'' violent, has at times generated vociferous arguments that the concept is inconceivable and at best oxymoronic. This argument typically derives from a strict definition of violence as "extreme, destructive, or uncontrollable force especially of natural events; intensity of feeling or expression,&lt;ref&gt;''violence''. Encarta. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; " a definition by which the vast majority of video games may be described as violent. Despite arguments to the contrary, however, such characterizations have been employed as a marketing tool by makers and distributors of non-violent video games, and the degree of popularity enjoyed by games so described may be attributed to the comparative violence of other more violent members of the supergenre.

Non-violent first-person shooter developers have expressed the notion that it is the challenge of making a non-violent game in a violent genre that motivates them in part.&lt;ref name=linder/&gt; Rarely, FPS games such as ''[[Garry's Mod]]'' and ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' that have been developed without the specific intent of non-violence have been identified by reviewers and the non-violent gaming community as non-violent FPSes.&lt;ref name=gigaom&gt;Au, Wagner James. ''[http://gigaom.com/2008/01/31/does-portals-success-presage-game-industry-shift Does Portal’s Success Presage Game Industry Shift?]''.

V.17 No.21. 22–28 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Such characterizations have led to the concern that parents may allow their children to play these games, not realizing that there are still some elements of violence including violent deaths. Further ambiguities arise when determining whether a game is a first-person ''shooter'', as in certain games such as ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'', the player doesn't shoot anything at all, but merely clicks walls with the cursor. Similarly, in games such as ''[[Myst#Remakes and rereleases|realMyst]]'', the player merely interacts with the environment by touching things in the first-person and the term "shooter" is seen to be objectively inaccurate. Despite this, non-violent first-person games have often been characterized oxymoronically as shooters because of all comparable genres, these games are most closely similar to the FPS and often employ engines designed for the FPS genre.

Often modeled upon violent FPS games, non-violent FPSes such as ''[[Chex Quest]]'' or the newer Sherlock Holmes games, may bear striking resemblance to the violent game whose engine they are using. Developers of such games often have done little to change the game other than replacing violent or scary imagery and recasting the storyline to describe "zorching", "slobbing", or otherwise non-lethally incapacitating enemies. Examples of simple changes intended to reduce violence for non-violent FPSes include the alteration of the red shroud from the death-sequence in ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' to become the green shroud from the slime-sequence in ''Chex Quest'' or the removal of the red shroud from the death-sequence in ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' for the deaths in ''Portal''. At times, similarities between violent progenitors and their non-violent descendants have proved strong enough that the non-violent developers have cast their game as a spoof of the violent version. This is apparent in ''Chex Quest''. Off-beat and absurdist humor have been employed in a number of games order to tone down the serious content by makers of non-violent FPSes.&lt;ref name=linder/&gt;

One subgenre of the FPS that typically is not characterized as non-violent despite the fact that gameplay revolves to a great degree around avoidance of battle, is that of [[stealth game]]s. Although much of the gameplay characteristic to stealth games accords closely with the requirements of the non-violent genre, stealth games most frequently simply delay chaotic violence to focus instead upon controlled precision violence.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} When stealth and violence are both present as options, stealth is often presented as the superior option for being morally superior or requiring greater skill.&lt;ref name="kotakuDishonoredParty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/dishonoreds-party-level-rewrote-the-rules-of-stealth-ga-1613011624|last=Burford|first=GB|work=Kotaku|title=Dishonored's Party Level Rewrote The Rules Of Stealth Games|date=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-violent role-playing games===
[[File:Spritual warfare.PNG|frame|The [[Christian video game|Christian RPG]], ''[[Spiritual Warfare (video game)|Spiritual Warfare]]'', features a non-violent hero who spreads repentance by sharing holy fruit]]
Though infrequently regarded as explicitly violent, role-playing video games (RPGs) have traditionally focused on the adventures of a party of travelers as they spend days and months leveling-up to fight greater and greater foes. Fighting in these games is highly stylized and often turn-based, however the actions of the player-characters and the enemies that attack them are distinctly violent. There have been some attempts made to reduce this violence by rendering it in cartoonish format as in some members of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series{{Citation needed|date = July 2009}} or by recasting the enemies' deaths as "fainting," "sleeping," or becoming "stunned" as in the ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' series, however neither of these series has been explicitly labeled non-violent.

One rare example of an RPG that was designed as a non-violent video game is ''[[Spiritual Warfare (video game)|Spiritual Warfare]]'', a game with enemies featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player wanders about converting the denizens of his town to Christianity while fending off the attacks of wild animals with holy food. Another example is ''[[A Tale in the Desert]]'', an [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] based on economic development.

Secular examples include Capcom's ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;Landis, Shawn. ''Capcom's Ace Attorney Video Game''. 24 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savino, Candace. ''[http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/28/ds-fanboy-review-apollo-justice-ace-attorney DS Fanboy Review: Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney]''. 28 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Interactive Software|Victor]]'s ''[[Story of Seasons (series)|Story of Seasons]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nowar-paix.ca/goodvideogames/index.html Recommended Nonviolent Video Games]''. NoWar list.&lt;/ref&gt; – a simulation/RPG game. Additionally, such RPGs as  ''[[Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar]]'', ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', and ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' have all been identified as containing certain modes of play that are mostly non-violent. This concept is also explored in the higher difficulty levels of the [[Thief (series)|''Thief'' series]].

In 2015 the fan-funded indie RPG ''[[Undertale]]'' allowed players to choose whether or not to use violent methods, in a story that includes both explicit and subtextual commentary on the nature of violence in videogames.

===Non-violent strategy games===
As with role-playing games, strategy games have traditionally focused on the development and expansion of a group as they defend themselves from the attacks of enemies. Strategy games tend not to be explicitly described as violent, however they nearly universally contain violent content in the form of battles, wars, and other skirmishes. Additionally, strategy games tend to more often strive for realistic scenarios and depictions of the battles that result. Counteracting this violence, however, is the fact that strategy games tend to be set at a distant third party perspective and as such the violence of the battles tends to be minute and highly stylized.

For the most part, non-violent groups have not explored this genre of violent game. Gender-marketers have designed strategy games for both male and female audiences, however gender-linked treatment of violence has not occurred in this genre and as such, male- and female-oriented strategy games tend to contain equal degrees of violence. Christian developers have made various attempts at the genre including ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]'' in which the player attempts to convert as many civilians in an apocalyptic future as possible by raising their spirit level and shielding them from the corrupting influences of rock-and-roll music and general secularism. The game has been criticized by such anti-violent video game personalities as former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]]&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; for strategy involving the slaying of infidels and non-believers, and for the ability of players engaged in multi-play modes to play as the Antichrist on the side of the Forces of Satan.

Secular non-violent video game designers have emerged from the [[serious game]]s movement and include such anti-violence titles as ''[[PeaceMaker (computer game)|PeaceMaker]]'', a game where the player tries to foster peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and ''[[A Force More Powerful]]'', a nonviolence-themed game designed by [[Steve York]], a documentary filmmaker  and director of Bringing Down a Dictator, a non violent resistance film featuring Ivan Marovic, a resistance leader against [[Slobodan Milošević]] who was instrumental in bringing him down in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Troeh, Eve. ''[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5342543 Video Game Teaches Non-Violent Solutions]''. [[National Public Radio]]. 14 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krotoski, Aleks. ''[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2006/may/08/seriousgamere Serious game: resolving conflict with non-violent means]''. The Guardian. 8 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Though these games are anti-violent, however, failure on the part of the player leads to violence. Thus the goal of the game is merely shifted to active violence-prevention while the degree of violence used to challenge the player remains consistent with violent strategy games.

Some examples of relatively nonviolent strategy games include:
*''[[M.U.L.E.]]''&lt;ref name="anderson198312"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n12/114_MULE.php | title=M.U.L.E | accessdate=March 17, 2011 | author=Anderson, John J. | date=December 1983 | publisher=Creative Computing | pages=114 | quote=I should also mention that there is no shooting to be found anywhere in the game.

===Non-violent sports games and non-violent vehicle simulations===
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
According to the Funk and Buchman method for [[Game classification#Electronic games|classifying video games]], there are six categories into which games may be divided:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Children, Adolescents and the Media|author=[[Victor C. Strasburger]] and Barbara J. Wilson|pages=122–123|year=2002|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0-7619-2125-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#general entertainment (no fighting or destruction)
#educational (learning or problem solving)
#fantasy violence (cartoon characters that must fight or destroy things, and risk being killed, in order to achieve a goal)
#human violence (like fantasy violence, but with human rather than cartoon characters)
#nonviolent sports (no fighting or destruction)
#sports violence (fighting or destruction involved)

The separation of violent and nonviolent sports here illustrates a phenomenon also recognizable in the [[vehicle simulation game]] genre. With both sport and vehicle simulation games, gameplay has traditionally been highly bipolar with nearly as many violent titles as non-violent. Just as there are non-violent and ''violent'' sports games, so too are there [[flight simulator|flight]] and [[combat flight simulator|''combat'' flight simulators]], [[Space simulator|space flight]] and [[Space flight simulator game|space ''combat'' simulators]], and [[Racing video game|racing game]]s and [[vehicular combat game|vehicular ''combat'' games]]. Distinction of games as violent or non-violent here serves a purely practical purpose as gameplay may differ considerably beyond the merely aesthetic.

Such sports as [[Table tennis|Ping-pong]], [[golf]], and [[Cue sports|billiards]], have in the past been identified as nonviolent.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent, Martin. ''[http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/37171/Twisted_List_Top_Nonviolent_Sports_Games.html Twisted List: Top Nonviolent Sports Games]''. G4TV TechTV Vault. 16 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of a nonviolent game that has been employed in a number of studies and government committee reports is ''[[NBA Jam: Tournament Edition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsh, S. J. (1998). ''Seeing the world through Mortal Kombat-colored glasses: violent video games and the development of a short-term hostile attribution bias''. Childhood, 5 (2), 177–184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, Joanne. ''[https://www.webcitation.org/5s52ruFm4?url=http://yourmindonmedia.com/downloads/media_violence_paper.pdf The Psychological Effects of Media Violence on Children and Adolescents]''. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirsh. S. J. ''Mortal Kombat and children’s perceptions of aggressive intent''. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://libertus.net/censor/history/docarchive/OFLC99_Comp_Games_Aust_Exec_Sum.pdf Computer Games and Australians Today]''.

'''[[Visual arts]]''' &amp;ndash; class of [[Art#Art forms|art forms]], including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[photography]], [[printmaking]] and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily [[visual]] in nature. Visual Arts that produce three-dimensional objects, such as [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]], are known as [[plastic arts]].  The current usage of ''visual arts'' includes [[fine arts]] as well as [[crafts]], but this was not always the case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4194">[[File:Percy-reeve.jpg|right|thumb|Reeve in 1899]]
'''Percy Reeve''' (born 21 December 1855; date of death not known) was an English composer and music critic.  Reeve wrote several successful [[operetta]]s, often as companion pieces to longer works, as well as music for other theatrical pieces and serious music during the last two decades of the 19th century.  As a music critic, he wrote extensively for  ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', ''[[Saturday Review (London)|The Saturday Review]]'' and other publications.

==Life and career==
He was born in [[Harley Street]], London, the son of a clergyman. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and the [[London Academy of Music]].  In 1877 he was appointed to a civil service post in the [[Lord Chancellor]]'s office, composing music in his spare time.&lt;ref name=lute&gt;"Mr Percy Reeve", ''Lute'' magazine, December 1899, pp. 849-50&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Reeve's operetta ''[[A Private Wire]]'' (1883) ran for more than nine months at the [[Savoy Theatre]] as a [[Curtain raiser (drama)|Curtain raiser]] to ''[[Iolanthe]]''.  The same year, he wrote ''Love &amp; Music'', a book of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, Percy.  ''Love and Music'', 1883, London: David Bogue&lt;/ref&gt;  He later composed the music for "Ruddy George, or Robin Redbreast", at [[Toole's Theatre]] (1887; a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Ruddigore]]'') to a libretto by H. G. F. Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon. [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchiveother.htm "Other Items: ''Ruddy George''"] at ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan: a selling exhibition of memorabilia", c20th.com, accessed April 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1888, Reeve wrote about his old school in "An Eton Half Holiday".&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, Percy. "An Eton Half Holiday", ''Hood's Comic Annual'', 1888&lt;/ref&gt;  His operetta ''The Crusader and the Craven'' (1890), with words by W. Allison, had a long run at the [[Gielgud Theatre|Globe Theatre]] (opening as an afterpiece to an operatic adaptation of ''The Black Rover'') due to its "bright and taking music",&lt;ref&gt;''The Theatre'', vol. 16, London: Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent, p. 257, 1 November 1890&lt;/ref&gt; despite a libretto described by a later critic as "almost heroically banal", with lines such as, "I am a fierce crusader, a terror to each foe, to infidel invader, I carry death and woe".&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Malcolm. "Review", ''The International History Review'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (September 2001), pp. 676-77&lt;/ref&gt;  He contributed to ''Cupid &amp; Co.'' in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Scowcroft, Philip L. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/162.htm "A 162nd Garland of British Light Music Composers"]. MusicWeb International, accessed 11 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Reeve also wrote music for burlesques at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] and [[incidental music]] for [[West End theatre|West End]] plays, as well as serious [[chamber music|chamber works]], and songs to texts by a wide range of authors, from [[Théophile Gautier]] to [[E. Nesbit]] to [[Henry Pottinger Stephens]].&lt;ref name=lute/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/839M136MSQ7LD2RAJD6JXN63JKBI5IE6QRI267V2V3UAKBCM96-17947?func=short-jump&amp;jump=000021 British Library catalogue], accessed 11 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Reeve was also a prolific musical journalist, contributing to a wide range of publications including ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', ''[[Saturday Review (London)|The Saturday Review]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name=lute/&gt;  In 1896 he was appointed editor of ''The Lute'', a music magazine.  After Reeve's death, [[Lord Northcliffe]] recalled him in ''[[The Musical Times]]'': "He was on my staff for a time, as musical critic; sensitive little man, with beautiful hands – irritable!"&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', 1 November 1931, p. 990&lt;/ref&gt;

As a fluent French speaker, he was responsible for the English translation used by [[F. C. Burnand]], and the lyrics, for [[Edmond Audran]]'s ''Miss Helyett'' (1890), staged successfully in London as ''Miss Decima'' in 1891.&lt;ref name=lute/&gt;

[[Image:Posterization example.jpg|thumb|300px|Example of a photograph in [[JPEG]] format (24-bit color or 16.7 million colors) before posterization, contrasting the result of saving to [[GIF]] format (256 colors). Posterization occurs across the image, but is most obvious in areas of subtle variation in tone.]]
[[Image:Lucidity I.jpg|thumb|300px|Posterized photo of a [[hibiscus]].]]

'''Posterization''' or '''posterisation''' of an image entails conversion of a continuous gradation of tone to several regions of fewer tones, with abrupt changes from one tone to another.  This was originally done with photographic processes to create [[poster]]s.  It can now be done photographically or with digital image processing, and may be deliberate or an unintended artifact of [[color quantization]].

==Cause==
The effect may be created deliberately, or happen accidentally.  For artistic effect, most [[image editing]] programs provide a posterization feature, or photographic processes may be used. 

Unwanted posterization, also known as [[color banding|banding]], may occur when the [[color depth]], sometimes called bit depth, is insufficient to accurately sample a continuous gradation of color tone. As a result, a continuous gradient appears as a series of discrete steps or bands of color — hence the name. When discussing [[fixed pixel display]]s, such as LCD and plasma televisions, this effect is referred to as false contouring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/4520-7874_1-5107912-7.html#falsecontouring |title=HDTV World Glossary |accessdate=2007-06-06 |year=2007 |publisher=CNET Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Compression artifact|compression]] in image formats such as [[JPEG]] can also result in posterization when a smooth gradient of colour or luminosity is compressed into discrete quantized blocks with stepped gradients. The result may be compounded further by an [[optical illusion]], called the [[Mach bands|Mach band illusion]], in which each band appears to have an intensity gradient in the direction opposing the overall gradient. This problem may be resolved, in part, with [[Dither#Digital photography and image processing|dithering]].

== Photographic process ==
Posterization is a process in photograph development which converts normal photographs into an image consisting of distinct, but flat, areas of different tones or colors. A posterized image often has the same general appearance, but portions of the original image that presented gradual transitions are replaced by abrupt changes in shading and gradation from one area of tone to another. Printing posterization from black and white requires density separations, which one then prints on the same piece of paper to create the whole image. Separations may be made by density or color, using different exposures. Density Separations may be created by printing three prints of the same picture, each at a different exposure time that will be combined for the final image.

== Applications ==
Typically, posterization is used for tracing [[contour lines]] and [[raster to vector|vectorizing photo-realistic images]]. This tracing process starts with 1 bit per channel and advances to 4 bits per channel. As the bits per channel increases, the number of levels of lightness a color can display increases.

A visual artist, faced with [[line art]] that has been damaged through JPEG compression, may consider posterizing the image as a first step to remove artifacts on the edges of the image.

==Posterizing time {{anchor|Temporal posterization}} ==
Temporal posterization is the [[visual effect]] of reducing the [[frame rate|number of frames]] of [[video]], while not reducing the speed at which it actually plays.  This compares to regular posterization, where the number of individual color variations is reduced, while the overall range of colors is not.  The motion effect is similar to the effect of a flashing strobe light, but without the contrast of bright and dark.  Unlike a [[Telecine|pulldown]], the unused frames are simply discarded, and it is intended to be apparent (longer than the [[persistence of vision]] that [[video]] and [[motion picture]]s normally depend on). An [[animated GIF]] often looks posterized because of its normally-low frame rate.

More formally, this is [[downsampling]] in the time dimension, as it is reducing the resolution (precision of the ''input''), not the bit rate (precision of the ''output,'' as in posterization).

The resulting stop-go motion is a temporal form of [[jaggies]]; formally, a form of [[aliasing]]. This effect may be the intention, but to reduce the frame rate without introducing this effect, one may use [[temporal anti-aliasing]], which yields [[motion blur]].

Compare with [[Slow motion#Time stretching|time stretching]], which ''adds'' frames.

[[File:CRT phosphors.png|right|thumb|375px|The [[emission spectra]] of the three [[phosphor]]s that define the '''additive primary colors''' of a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] color video display.  Other electronic color display technologies ([[LCD]], [[Plasma display]], [[OLED]]) have analogous sets of primaries with different emission spectra.]]

A set of '''primary colors''' is, most tangibly, a set of ''real'' [[colorant]]s or colored lights that can be combined in varying amounts to produce a [[gamut]] of colors. This is the essential method used in applications that are intended to elicit the perception of diverse sets of color, e.g. electronic displays, color printing, and paintings. Perceptions associated with a given combination of primary colors are predicted by applying the appropriate mixing model ([[additive mixing|additive]], [[subtractive mixing|subtractive]], additive averaging etc.) that embodies the underlying physics of how light interacts with the media and ultimately the retina.

Primary colors can also be conceptual, either as additive mathematical elements of a [[color space]] or as irreducible phenomenological categories in domains such as psychology and [[Philosophy of color|philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; have led to practically useful insights.

All sets of real and color-space primaries are ''arbitrary'', in the sense that there is no one set of primaries that can be considered the canonical set. Primary pigments or light sources selected for a given application on the basis of subjective preferences as well as practical factors such as cost, stability, availability etc.  Color-space primaries can be subjected to meaningful [[Injective function|one-to-one]] transformations so that the transformed space is still complete and each color is specified with a unique sum.

== Additive mixing of light ==

[[File:LCD pixels RGB.jpg|thumb|350px|A photograph of the red, green, and blue elements (subpixels) of an [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]].  Additive mixing explains how light from these colored elements can be used for photorealistic color image reproduction.]]

The perception elicited by multiple light sources co-stimulating the same area of the retina is additive, i.e., predicted via summing the [[spectral power distribution]]s or tristimulus values of the individual light sources (assuming a color matching context). For example, a purple spotlight on a dark background could be matched with coincident blue and red spotlights that are both dimmer than the purple spotlight. If the intensity of the purple spotlight was doubled it could be matched by doubling the intensities of both the red and blue spotlights that matched the original purple.  The principles of additive color mixing are embodied in [[Grassmann's law (optics)|Grassmann's laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Additive mixing of coincident spot lights was applied in the experiments used to derive the [[CIE 1931]] colorspace. The original ''[[monochromatic]]'' primaries of the (arbitrary) wavelengths of 435.8&amp;nbsp;nm (violet), 546.1&amp;nbsp;nm (green), and 700&amp;nbsp;nm (red) were used in this application due to the convenience they afforded to the experimental work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The exact colors chosen for additive primaries are a technological compromise between the available [[phosphor]]s (including considerations such as cost and power usage) and the need for large chromaticity gamut. The [[Rec. 709|ITU-R BT.709-5]]/[[sRGB]] primaries are typical.

It is important to note that additive mixing provides very poor predictions of color perception outside the color matching context.  Well known demonstrations such as [[The dress]] and other examples&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In general, we cannot completely predict all possible perceived colors from combinations of primary lights in the context of real world images and viewing conditions.  The cited examples suggest just how remarkably poor such predictions can be.

== Subtractive mixing of ink layers ==

{{See also|CMYK color model}}
[[File:Halftoningcolor.svg|thumb|350px|A magnified representation of small partially overlapping spots of cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black) [[halftone]]s in [[CMYK]] process printing.  Each row represents the pattern of partially overlapping ink "rosettes" so that the patterns would be perceived as blue, green, and red when viewed on white paper from a typical viewing distance. The overlapping ink layers mix subtractively while additive mixing predicts the color appearance from the light reflected from the rosettes and white paper in between them.]]

The [[subtractive color|subtractive]] color mixing model predicts the spectral power distributions of light filtered through overlaid partially absorbing materials on a reflecting or transparent surface. Each layer partially absorbs some wavelengths of light from the illumination spectrum while letting others pass through multiplicatively, resulting in a colored appearance. Overlapping layers of ink in printing mix subtractively over reflecting white paper in this way to generate photorealistic color images.  The typical number of inks in such a printing process ranges from 3 to 6 (e.g., [[CMYK]] process, [[hexachrome|Pantone hexachrome]]). In general, using fewer inks as primaries results in more economical printing but using more may result in better color reproduction.

[[Cyan]], [[magenta]], and [[yellow]] are good subtractive primaries in that the spectral power distributions of light reflected from idealized inks can be combined for the largest chromaticity gamuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The color of light (i.e., the spectral power distribution) reflected from illuminated surfaces coated in paint mixes, slurries of pigment particles, is not well approximated by a subtractive or additive mixing model.

There are hundreds of commercially available pigments for visual artists to use and mix (in various media such as oil, watercolor, acrylic, gouache, and pastel).  A common approach is to use just a limited palette of primary pigments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There is no specific set of pigments that are primary colors, the choice of pigments depends entirely on the artist's subjective preference of subject and style of art as well as material considerations like lightfastness and mixing heuristics.  Contemporary classical realists have often advocated that a limited palette of white, red, yellow, and black pigment (often described as the "Zorn palette") is sufficient for compelling work.&lt;ref name="gurney_zorn"&gt;{{cite web

== Color-space primaries ==
A contemporary description of the [[color vision]] system provides an understanding of primary colors that is consistent with modern [[color science]]. The human eye normally contains only three types of color photoreceptors, known as long-wavelength (L), medium-wavelength (M), and short-wavelength (S) [[cone cell]]s. These photoreceptor types respond to different degrees across visible electromagnetic spectrum. The S cone response is generally assumed to be negligible at long wavelengths greater than about 560&amp;nbsp;nm while the L and M cones respond across the entire visible spectrum.&lt;ref name="stockmansharpe2006"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LMS primaries are imaginary since there is no visible wavelength that stimulates only one type of cone (i.e., humans cannot normally see a color that corresponds to pure L, M or S stimulation). The LMS primaries are complete since every visible color can be mapped to a triplet specifying the coordinates in [[LMS color space]].

[[File:Normalized Cone Sensitivities.png|thumb|center|375px|Normalized cone [[spectral sensitivity]] curves]]

The L, M and S response curves (''cone fundamentals'') were deduced from ''color matching functions'' obtained from controlled color matching experiments (e.g., [[CIE 1931]]) where observers matched the color of a surface illuminated by monochromatic light with mixtures of three monochromatic primary lights illuminating a juxtaposed surface. Practical applications generally use a canonical linear transformation of LMS space known as [[CIEXYZ]]. The X, Y, and Z primaries are typically more useful since luminance (Y) is specified separately from a color's chromaticity.  Any color space primaries which can be mapped to physiologically relevant LMS primaries by a linear transformation are necessarily either imaginary or incomplete or both. The color-matching context is always three dimensional (since LMS space is three dimensional) but more general ''color appearance'' models like [[CIECAM02]] describe color in six dimensions and can be used to predict how colors appear under different viewing conditions.

Thus for trichromats like humans, we use three (or more) primaries for most general purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two primaries would be unable to produce even some of the most common among the named colors. Adding a reasonable choice of third primary can drastically increase the available gamut, while adding a fourth or fifth may increase the gamut but typically not by as much.

Most [[placental mammal]]s other than primates have only two types of color photoreceptor and are therefore [[dichromacy|dichromats]], so it is possible that certain combinations of just two primaries might cover some significant gamut relative to the range of their color perception.  Meanwhile, [[birds]] and [[marsupials]] have four color photoreceptors in their eyes, and hence are [[tetrachromats]]. There is one scholarly report of a functional human tetrachromat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The presence of photoreceptor cell types in an organism's eyes do not directly imply that they are being used to functionally perceive color. Measuring functional spectral discrimination in non-human animals is challenging due to the difficulty in performing psychophysical experiments on creatures with limited behavioral repertoires who cannot respond using language. Limitations in the discriminative ability of shrimp having twelve distinct color photoreceptors have demonstrated that having more cell types in itself need not always correlate with better functional color vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{Main|Opponent process}}

The [[opponent process]] is a color theory that states that the human [[visual system]] interprets information about [[color]] by processing signals from [[cone cell|cones]] and [[rod cell|rods]] in an antagonistic manner.  The theory states that every color can be described as a mix along the three axes of red vs. green, blue vs. yellow and white vs. black.  The six colors from the pairs might be called "psychological primary colors", because any other color could be described in terms of some combination of these pairs.

== Examples ==
The motif involves a character who makes a promise pertaining to love for another character. The first character promises to grant the other his/her love if an impossible wish is granted. Alternately, the first character could promise the second anything he/she asks for in exchange for escape from a life-or-death situation. 

A notable example of the first scenario is [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Franklin's Tale]]", itself partly based on [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Filocolo]]''; Dorigen, a married woman whose husband is absent, promises another suitor that he may have her if she makes the rocks on the coast of Brittany disappear.&lt;ref name="edwards" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clouston|first=W.

An example of the second variation is found in Chaucer's "[[The Wife of Bath's Tale]]", where the main character, a young rapist knight threatened with execution if he cannot answer the question "What do women want?," promises an older woman (the proverbial "[[loathly lady]]") anything she desires if she can provide the answer (she desires to marry him).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Jill|title=Geoffrey Chaucer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zlX9B4etMxAC&amp;pg=PR10|accessdate=9 January 2013|year=2002|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=9780859916134|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wollock|first=Jennifer G.|title=Rethinking Chivalry and Courtly Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orTn7RpmyZIC&amp;pg=PA169|accessdate=9 January 2013|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780275984885|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sidlaphadi'' near [[Badami]] in [[Karnataka]], is a natural rock bridge and pre historic rock shelter. It is located at about four km. in the middle of a shrub jungle near the historic town of Badami. A bridle and kutcha path through sandstone hills from Badami leads to Sidlaphadi and there is no metal road to the spot. ''Sidlaphadi'' literally means in Kannada the ''Rock of lightning'', derived from gaping holes in the natural rock arch, which was formed when a lightning struck.&lt;ref name=arun&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhat|first1=Arun|title=Struck by lightning|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/41256/ipl-2012.html|accessdate=13 August 2014|publisher=Deccan Herald|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The natural rock bridge structure looks like a ''wide arch'' between two sandstone boulders (served as a roof). The rock structure has large, gaping holes in the arch and allows sunlight to enter inside which provides the required light for interiors. It was also a shelter for hunter-gatherer prehistoric people.

There is a replica of Sidlaphadi in the Badami archaeological museum, it is dedicated to recreate Sidlaphadi and has posters to provide relevant information about the evolution of man.

There are evidences to prove that the Sidlaphadi was a dwelling of prehistoric man.

==Prehistoric rock art==

This natural rock bridge structure was studied by archaeologist Shri A. Sundar, who identified prehistoric (now fading) paintings on the roof of the arch. The blunt weapons of stone were also discovered in the area.&lt;ref name=arun/&gt;

'''The Storran Gallery''' was a fashionable ''avant-garde'' art gallery in [[London]] in the 1930s. In 1937 it was run by the prominent art critic [[Eardley Knollys]] (a friend of [[Picasso]])&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/may/24/art.law|title=Cracking down on art fraud &amp;#124; Art and design &amp;#124; The Guardian|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=2015-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Ala Storey]] and the artist [[Frank Coombs (artist)|Frank Coombs]] (1906-1941). The gallery was at 106 [[Brompton Road]] London SW3 (just opposite [[Harrods]]) but moved to [[Fitzroy Street]] and then 316 [[Euston Road]].

An unusual exhibition at the gallery in 1938 was ‘‘The Jones Exhibition’’.

'''The Dot ''' is a work of art in [[Emmen (Drenthe)|Emmen]] ([[Netherlands]]). It is designed and painted by art collective the [[toyism|toyists]]. The Dot is a former gas container of which only two still exist in Europe. The toyists painted this monumental industrial object and linked it with the theme of Live with energy.

==History==
Toyist Dejo (founder of [[Toyism]]) came up with the idea of painting the gas globe in Emmen in 1997. After the first meetings in 2005 with the owner of the gas container, energy company [[Essent]] (later called Enexis), it would still take until 2008 before the project could finally be put in motion. This was partly due to the establishment of the foundation Living Industry , which deals with the reuse of industrial properties and the redevelopment of industrial sites. After the municipality of Emmen agreed with the project, a scaffolding of eight stories was built around the 22 meter high gas container. On the 27th of July the artist started the project of painting The Dot.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 116. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Voormalige_gasbol.jpg|thumb|links|150px|Former gas container]]

==Transformation==
The transformation of the former (blue) gas container took several months to complete, from mid July 2009 until the unveiling on June 4 in 2010, with a winter break of two months. The project had 17 toyists from 7 different countries working for 6000 hours, they painted an area of 1250 m2 in multiple layers.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 61. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme==
The theme of this art work is live with energy. Figurative imagery in the painting tells the story of the history of energy production. There are four sub designs based on the four elements of life: earth (raw energy), water (hydroelectric power), fire (solar energy) and air (wind power). Each sub-design presents the combination or contrast of old and new forms of energy production and their applications (the sciences). In addition to these four fundamental themes, there is a single, central figure: the tree. The tree is a metaphor for life, energy, growth, development, and change. The province of Drenthe with its rich history of peat production is also represented in the painting. In addition, in the form of standalone motifs, general applications or containers of energy such as ecobunny lights and battery-insects can be seen moving throughout the whole painting.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 108. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:THE DOT Live with Energy - Toyism.jpg|500px|Design of The Dot]]

==Restoration==
In the summer of 2015 The Dot was repainted. Over the years the paint had peeled off and The Dot needed to be restored to its former state. The toyists set up a crowdfunding project and, when enough money was collected, started the restoration.

In 2013 the toyists did a similar project in Keflavik, Iceland called [[Uppspretta]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20988">'''U.S. standard clothing sizes''' for women were originally developed from statistical data in the 1940s and 1950s. At that time, they were similar in concept to the [[EN 13402]] European clothing size standard, although individual manufacturers have always deviated from them, sometimes significantly.

However, as a result of various cultural pressures, most notably [[vanity sizing]], North American clothing sizes have drifted substantially away from this standard over time, and now have very little connection to it. Instead, they now follow the more loosely defined standards known as [[US standard clothing size#Conversion from catalog sizes|U.S. catalog sizes]].

Body measurements below are given in inches.

==History==

Men's standard sizes were probably developed first during the [[American Revolutionary War]], and they were in regular use by the American army during the [[War of 1812]] for ready-made uniforms {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. These were based on the chest measurement, with other measurements being assumed to be either proportional (the circumference of the neck, waist, hips, and thighs) or easily altered (length of the inseam) {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}.

As this was largely successful in men, the same approach was attempted in the early 20th century for women using the bust as the sole measurement {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. However, this proved unsuccessful because women's bodies have far more variety in shape. The [[hourglass figure]] is frequently used as an industry standard, but only 8% of women have this body shape {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. A woman with an hourglass figure and a woman with an apple-shaped figure who have the same bust size will not have the same waist or hip sizes.

This was a significant problem for mail-order companies, and several attempts at predictable, standard sizing were made {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. In the 1940s, the statisticians Ruth O'Brien and William Shelton received a [[Works Progress Administration]] grant to conduct the most ambitious effort to solve this problem. Their team measured almost 15,000 women across the US. After discovering the complex diversity of women's actual sizes, which produced five to seven different body shapes, they proposed a three-part sizing system. Each size would be the combination of a single number, representing an upper body measurement, plus an indicator for height (short, regular, and long) and an indication for girth (slim, regular, and stout).  The various combinations of height and girth resulted in nine different sizes for each numerical upper-body measurement, which was highly impractical for manufacturing {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}.

As a result, O'Brien and Shelton's work was rejected. In 1958, the [[National Bureau of Standards]] invented a new sizing system, based on the hourglass figure and using only the bust size to create an arbitrary standard of sizes ranging from 8 to 38, with an indication for height (short, regular, and tall) and lower-body girth (plus or minus). The resulting commercial standard was not widely popular, and was declared voluntary in 1970 and withdrawn entirely in 1983. In 1995, [[ASTM International]] published its own voluntary standard, which has been revised since then {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. It has not been widely adopted.

==Women's sizes==
Women's sizes are divided into various types, depending on height. These charts give an indication of size only and are by no means exact as they vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, sometimes by a full inch up and down.

=== Overview ===
There are multiple size types, designed to fit somewhat different body shapes.  Variations include the height of the person's [[torso]] (known as ''back length''), whether the bust, waist, and hips are straighter (characteristic of teenagers) or curvier (like many adult women), and whether the bust is higher or lower (characteristic of younger and older women, respectively). These categories include:

;Misses sizes:  The most common size category.  For women of about average height (5'4") with an average bust height and an hourglass figure.  Dress sizes may be given as girth at the bust in inches (e.g., 36), but even-numbered sizes from 2 to 16 are more common.  Categorical sizes range from XS (extra-small) to XL (extra-large).
;Junior sizes: For short women with higher busts and fairly straight bodies.  Junior sizes are commonly given as odd-numbered sizes from 1 to 15, which correspond to the next number up in misses' sizes.
;Women's sizes '''or''' plus sizes:  For larger women of average height, sometimes with lower bust lines.  Like misses' sizes, the sizes may be given as a dress size based on the bust measurement, but they are usually given as even-numbered sizes from 18 up.  Categorical sizes usually range from 1X (similar to extra-large, but with slightly different proportions compared to the misses' size) up.
;Misses petite: For short women with average busts and more hourglass body shapes.  Sizes follow the misses' standard and are marked with a P, as in 10P.
;Junior petite: For very short women with average busts and fairly straight bodies.  Size may be denoted as "5JP" or as "5P".
;Women's petite:  For larger, shorter women, sometimes with lower bust lines.  Sizes are marked the same as women's with a P, as in 20P.
;Young junior: For short women with high busts and fairly straight bodies.
;Tall sizes:  For taller women (usually 5'8" or above), usually with a proportionately average bust height and an hourglass figure.  Sizes are usually written with the corresponding misses' size and a T to indicate tall, as in "10T".
;Half sizes: For short women with lower busts and more hourglass body shapes.  Sizes are written with a ½, as in "10½".

Please compare to your favorite fit charts. These measurements conflict with many other size charts. These charts are significantly smaller than many current US clothing companies.

With the average American woman's height (20 years and older) at about 63.8" or approximately 5'4" (162.1&amp;nbsp;cm) {{harv|Department of Health|2012}}, both standard and catalog size ranges attempt to address a variety of weights / builds as well as providing for the "shorter-than-average" height woman with "petite" and "half-sizes". However "taller-than-average" women may find their size-height addressed by manufacturers less frequently, and may often find themselves facing issues of slightly too short pant legs and sleeve cuffs, as well as waist lengths.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12319">'''Variable data printing''' ('''VDP''') (also known as '''variable information printing''' ('''VIP''') or '''variable imaging''' ('''VI''')) is a form of digital printing,  including [[on-demand printing]], in which elements such as [[Writing|text]], [[graphics]] and [[image]]s may be changed from one printed piece to the next, without stopping or slowing down the printing process and using information from a [[database]] or external file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC’s of VDP – A Variable Data Printing Basics Guide|url=http://www.efi.com/documents/promo/abc/ABCs_VDP_Letter.pdf|publisher=Electronics for Imaging, Inc.|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a set of personalized letters, each with the same basic layout, can be printed with a different name and address  on each letter. Variable data printing is mainly used for [[direct marketing]], [[customer relationship management]], [[advertising]], invoicing and  applying addressing&lt;ref name="Mailing"&gt;{{cite news|title=Saving Mailing Costs with Variable Data Printing|url=http://www.ondemandexpo.com/on-demand-newsletter/saving-mailing-costs-with-variable-data-printing|accessdate=1 June 2011|newspaper=On Demand Expo eNewletter|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on selfmailers, brochures or postcard campaigns.

==Variable data printing==

VDP is a direct outgrowth of [[digital printing]], which harnesses computer databases and digital print devices and highly effective software to create high-quality, full color documents, with a look and feel comparable to conventional [[offset printing]]. Variable data printing enables the [[mass customization]] of documents via digital print technology, as opposed to the '[[mass-production]]' of a single document using [[offset lithography]]. Instead of producing 10,000 copies of a single document, delivering a single message to 10,000 customers, variable data printing could print 10,000 unique documents with customized messages for each customer.

The returns for variable printing vary from double the normal return at the basic level to 10–15 times the return for fully variable jobs.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} This naturally depends on content and the relevancy of that content, but the technique presents an effective tool for increasing [[return on investment|ROI]] on marketing campaigns.

There are several levels of variable printing. The most basic level involves changing the salutation or name on each copy much like [[mail merge]]. More complicated variable data printing uses 'versioning', where there may be differing amounts of customization for different markets, with text and images changing for groups of addresses based upon which segment of the market is being addressed. Finally there is full variability printing, where the text and images can be altered for each individual address. All variable data printing begins with a basic design that defines static elements and variable fields for the pieces to be printed. While the static elements appear exactly the same on each piece, the variable fields are filled in with text or images as dictated by a set of application and style rules and the information contained in the database.

There are three main operational methodologies for variable data printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Variable-Data Printing: Personalized Delivery of Information for the 21st Century|url=http://www.digitaloutput.net/content/ContentCT.asp?P=78|publisher=Rockport Custom Publishing, LLC|accessdate=4 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001035330/http://www.digitaloutput.net/content/ContentCT.asp?P=78|archive-date=1 October 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one methodology, a static document is loaded into printer memory.  The printer is instructed, through the [[print driver]] or [[raster image processor]] (RIP) to always print the static document when sending any page out to the printer driver or RIP.  Variable data can then be printed on top of the static document.  This methodology is the simplest way to execute VDP, however its capability is less than that of a typical mail merge.

A second methodology is to combine the static and variable elements into print files, prior to printing, using standard software. This produces a conventional (and potentially huge) print file&lt;ref name="Tongues"&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaking In Tongues: Sorting Out Variable Data Printing Languages|url=http://www.fujixerox.com.au/products/image/media/TSR-0906-Speak-Tongues-reprint.pdf|work=Volume 7, Number 17|publisher=The Seybold Report|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with every image being merged into every page.  A shortcoming of this methodology is that running many very large print files can overwhelm the RIP's processing capability. When this happens, printing speeds might become slow enough to be impractical for a print job of more than a few hundred pages.

A third methodology is to combine the static and variable elements into print files, prior to printing, using specialized VDP software. This produces optimized print files, such as [[PDF/VT]], PostScript or [[PPML]],&lt;ref name="Tongues" /&gt; that maximize print speed since the RIP only needs to process static elements once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hohensee|first=Reinhard|title=Managing Variable Data Full-Color Printing at High Speeds|url=http://www.infoprintsolutionscompany.com/internet/comnelit.nsf/Files/ManagingPrintatHighSpeedInfoPrint/$File/ManagingPrintatHighSpeedInfoPrint.pdf|publisher=InfoPrint Solutions|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software and services==

There are many software packages available to merge text and images into VDP print files. Some are stand-alone software packages, however most of the advanced VDP software packages are actually plug-in modules for one or more publishing software packages such as [[Adobe Creative Suite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Generation of Variable Data Publishing Solutions|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/vdp/pdfs/vdp_whitepaper.pdf|publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated|accessdate=5 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002170743/http://www.adobe.com/products/vdp/pdfs/vdp_whitepaper.pdf|archive-date=2 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides VDP software, other software packages may be necessary for VDP print projects. Mailing software is necessary in the United States ([[United States Postal Service]]) and Canada to take advantage of reduced postage for [[bulk mailing]].&lt;ref name="Mailing" /&gt; Used prior to the VDP print file creation, mailing software presorts and validates and generates bar codes for mailing addresses. Pieces can then be printed in the proper sequence for sorting by postal code. In Canada, [[Canada Post]] now offers a 'Machineable'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/default-e.asp&lt;/ref&gt; personalized mail category which does not require addresses to be sorted into any specific order before mailing; therefore reducing the need for specialized sorting software to obtain optimal postage rates. 

Software to manage data quality (e.g. for duplicate removal or handling of bad records) and uniformity may also be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frey|first=Franziska|title=Upstream Database and Digital Asset Management in Variable Data Printing|url=http://print.rit.edu/pubs/picrm200801.pdf|publisher=Printing Industry Center at RIT|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In lieu of purchasing software, various companies provide an assortment of VDP-related print file, mailing and data services.

==Benefits==

The difference between variable data printing and traditional printing is the personalization that is involved. Personalization allows a company to connect to its customers. Variable data printing is more than a variable name or address in a printed piece; in the past, a variable name would have been effective, because it was a new concept at the time. In today’s world, personalization has to reflect what the customer values. In order for VDP to be successful, the company must know something about the customer. For example, a customer who loves baseball receives a VDP postcard with an image of their favorite baseball player. The postcard is effective, because the customer is more likely to read what is on it. An example of an ineffective VDP piece would be to mail a postcard to the same customer with an image of a soccer player. If the customer has no interest in soccer, then he or she may or may not pay attention to the postcard. The idea is to add value to the customer through the ability to relate to them. Personalization allows a company to relate, communicate, and possibly start a relationship with a prospective customer and to maintain a relationship with their current customers. A prospect that is converted to a customer can then be converted to a loyal customer. Companies want to create loyal customers, and variable data printing can help gain these types of customers, along with quality work and service.&lt;ref name="Tierney"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tierney|first=Jim|title=Variable data printing update|url=http://multichannelmerchant.com/printchannel/0301-variable-data-printing-update/index.html|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another benefit is the increase in the response rate and response time. Because personalization catches the attention of the consumer, the response rate of a mail campaign increases. Personalization also increases the response time, because the mailed piece has an effect on the consumer. This effect causes the consumer to respond quicker. A mailed piece that is not eye-catching may be put down and forgotten until a later time, so it may take weeks before a response is received.&lt;ref name="Tierney"/&gt;

==Integration==

Variable data printing can be combined with other platforms – such as [[Persistent uniform resource locator|PURLS]], email blasts, and QR codes; all three platforms are considered marketing tools. Many people have found the benefit of combining all of these platforms in order to have a successful campaign. Email blasts and PURLS allow a company to find out information about their consumer. An email blasts usually doesn’t contain much personalization, but it can. The bulk of the personalization would be seen in a PURL. A PURL is a personalized uniform resource locator (URL). In short, it is a landing page. It is also where most of the knowledge about the consumer will be gained. The email blasts will contain a PURL, which will lead the consumer to a personalized page. The PURL is where a company can gain information about the consumer through the requested information. The QR code can be added to a mailed piece. It works like an email blasts. It directs the consumer to a website. The integration of these three platforms can help a campaign.&lt;ref name="Tierney"/&gt;

==Origin of the concept==

The origin of the term variable data printing is widely credited to Frank Romano, Professor Emeritus, School of Print Media, at the [[College of Imaging Arts and Sciences]] at [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]. Mr. Romano does not explicitly take credit for coining the term &lt;ref name="Romano"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Frank Romano on VDP

 | date = 17 January 2013
 | url = http://www.ez-vdp.com/content.cfm?id=2063&amp;le=1

but points to his use of it as early as 1969 and its appearance in the 1999 book, “Personalized and Database Printing”, that he authored with David Broudy.&lt;ref name="Romano" /&gt;

The concept of merging static document elements and variable document elements predates the term and has seen various implementations ranging from simple desktop '[[mail merge]]', to complex [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] applications in the financial and banking industry. In the past, the term VDP has been most closely associated with digital printing machines. However, in recent years the application of this technology has spread to web pages, emails, and mobile messaging.

'''''WomaNews''''' was a [[radical feminist]] [[newspaper]] that began in [[Gainesville, Florida]] in the 1970s before moving production to New York, New York. 

==Purposes==
Mainstream American newspapers addressed majority concerns and so different minority papers emerged in response to the need for a more comprehensive and multivocal approach to news. Women's sections in mainstream newspapers and women's newspapers provided a needed avenue for the dissemination of information and discussion of current concerns from and for women. The same is true for other minority newspapers, like the many [[African-American newspapers]] that covered human rights violations, oppression, and the beginnings of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], before mainstream newspapers offered regular or even-handed coverage.
