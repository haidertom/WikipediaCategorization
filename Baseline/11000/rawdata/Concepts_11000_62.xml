'''AXIOM''' is an [[open hardware]] and [[free software]] [[digital cinema camera]] family of devices being developed by a [[DIY]] community around the apertus° project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.zeit.de/2014/26/open-source-patente-industrie/seite-2 | title=Open Source: Eine Revolution mit Lötkolben und Schraubenzieher (German) | publisher=zeit.de | year=2014 | accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community’s second generation camera, AXIOM Beta Compact, is presently in development.

== History ==
In 2006 Oscar Spierenburg, a Dutch film director,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6814696/ | title=Oscar Spierenburg IMDB | publisher=imdb.com | year=2017 | access-date=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; noticed a discussion taking place on DVInfo.net entitled “3 channel 36 bit 1280 X 720 low $ camera”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dvinfo.net/forum/alternative-imaging-methods/25296-3-channel-36-bit-1280-x-720-low-camera-viper-21.html#post433657 |title=3 channel 36 bit 1280 X 720 low $ camera viper - The Digital Video Information Network |date=February 18, 2006 |access-date=April 18, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006212612/http://www.dvinfo.net/forum/alternative-imaging-methods/25296-3-channel-36-bit-1280-x-720-low-camera-viper-21.html#post433657 |archivedate=2017-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; inside which [[Elphel]] cameras, which are typically used in scientific applications, had been mentioned.

In the same year a discussion thread entitled "High Definition with Elphel model 333 camera"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dvinfo.net/conf/showthread.php?t=63677 |title=High Definition with Elphel model 333 camera - The Digital Video Information Network |date=2007-07-01 |access-date=2017-04-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701143201/http://dvinfo.net/conf/showthread.php?t=63677 |archivedate=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was posted on the DVInfo.net forum, whereupon the forum’s members discussed how best to adapt Elphel open hardware camera devices for use in film production. Sebastian Pichelhofer discovered this thread in 2008 and assisted with the project by developing an Elphel camera internal hard-disk recorder user interface.

By early 2009, and because over the course of three years upwards of 1000 posts had been submitted to this thread, the community realised that it was going to be difficult to maintain a full overview of the project in this way, and consequently a dedicated website was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://apertus.org/history | title=apertus° History | publisher=apertus.org | year=2014 | accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the decision making and naming/logo design was decided upon by the community.

After having done some contracting work with Elphel, Pichelhofer focused full-time on the project across 2011 and in July 2012 the plan to create an AXIOM camera hardware prototype from scratch, and thereby overcome some of the limitations that were found to be inherent with Elphel hardware at the time (mainly due to Elphel Inc. having shifted the company's core business focus towards development of a panoramic camera solution), was announced at the Libre Software Meeting in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://schedule2012.rmll.info/Apertus-The-birth-of-a-completely-open-digital-cinema-camera?lang=en | title= Apertus - The birth of a completely open digital cinema camera  | publisher=Libre Software Meeting | year=2012 | accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prototype became known as AXIOM Alpha and was intended to gather feedback from typical shooting scenarios with a view to incorporating ideas into a future, more modular, kit version of the camera aimed at developers and early adopters (AXIOM Beta I Developer Kit).

Shortly after development on the AXIOM Alpha began, a [[nonprofit organization]] was established to provide legal shelter for the community, and an apertus° [[company]] was registered by Spierenburg in order to facilitate responsibilities that had been neglected up to this point, e.g. signing contracts with electronic part/service providers, paying for prototype manufacturing etc. Because of his drive and enthusiasm for the project Pichelhofer was elected apertus° Association chairman.

After reading a local [[hackerspace]] forum post in May 2013 Herbert Pötzl became aware of the community's efforts and met with Pichelhofer shortly thereafter. Pötzl had an extensive background in electronics engineering and software development and was appointed AXIOM Technical Lead. After Pötzl helped to develop critical aspects of hardware and software the AXIOM Alpha prototype was showcased at the Vienna Hackerlab in March 2014 whilst rough planning for a more modular and powerful camera was well underway.

In 2014, after [[crowdfunding]] the research and development through [[Indiegogo]], work began on creating AXIOM Beta - a five [[printed circuit board]] stack, [[FOSS]] and [[open-source hardware]], digital cinema camera incorporating the ams Sensors Belgium CMV12000 [[CMOS]] image sensor.

In recent times, and because existing manufacturers have proved reluctant to open their protocols up to the wider world, user groups have accepted responsibility and contributed to what became known as the ‘DSLR revolution’ first-hand e.g. the [[Magic Lantern (firmware)]] community. Magic Lantern is a free and open source software add-on that runs from a camera’s SD/CF card. It added a host of new features to Canon’s DSLRs that weren't included from the factory by Canon. Because the AXIOM Beta concept is essentially the hardware equivalent of the software they originally pioneered, Magic Lantern partnered with the apertus° Association in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://www.apertus.org/axiom-team-talk-video-volume1-article | title= AXIOM Team Talk - Volume 1  | publisher=apertus.org | year=2015 | accessdate=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Magic Lantern community has been involved with various colour science experiments using the camera.

Research on an AXIOM Gamma started in March 2015 after the project was awarded funding from the [[European Union|EU]]'s [[Horizon 2020|Horizon2020]] programme.

AXIOM Alpha was a digital cinema camera [[proof of concept]] prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/Axiom-Alpha-Die-Open-Hardware-Kamera-2194752.html | title=Axiom Alpha: Die Open-Hardware-Kamera (German) | publisher=heise.de | year=2014 | accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two units were built in 2013 and the second revision model was presented at the [[Metalab]] (a Vienna-based [[Hackerspace]]) in spring 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://metalab.at/wiki/Metaday_65 | title=Metaday 65: Building an open source digital cinema camera - Functional Prototype Presentation | publisher=Metalab | year=2014 | accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main components included a Zedboard using a [[Xilinx]] [[Zynq-7000|Zynq-7020]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Xcell-Daily-Blog/Zynq-based-Axiom-Alpha-open-4K-cine-camera-proto-debuts-in/ba-p/430066 |title=Zynq-based Axiom Alpha open 4K cine camera proto debuts in Vienna hackerspace |date=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[System on a chip|System on a chip (SoC)]] and a [[4K resolution|4K]] [[35mm#Super 35|Super35mm]] [[image sensor]] designed by the Belgian company CMOSIS (later renamed to ''ams Sensors Belgium'' after being acquired by ams &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.cmosis.com/news/press_releases/ams_acquires_cmosis_a_leading_supplier_of_high-end_area_scan_and_miniature | title=ams acquires CMOSIS, a leading supplier of high-end area scan and miniature medical image sensors | publisher=ams | year=2015 | accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Xcell-Daily-Blog/Zynq-based-ZedBoard-CMOSIS-Super35-Image-Sensor-Apertus/ba-p/398425 | title=Zynq-based ZedBoard + CMOSIS Super35 Image Sensor + Apertus Engineering = Axiom Open 4K Cinema Camera | publisher=Xilinx | year=2014 | accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technical specifications ===
The ams Sensors Belgium CMV12000 [[APS-C|Super35/APS-C]] image sensor has a resolution of 4096×3072 pixels, a [[color depth]] of 12&amp;nbsp;bits/pixel and is able to capture at a maximal frame rate of 300 frames/sec in 10-bit mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cmosis.com/products/product_detail/cmv12000 |title=Cmosis CMV12000 product page |date=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is connected to the ZedBoard over [[FMC – FPGA Mezzanine Card|FMC]].
The Xilinx Zynq Z-7020 combines a [[ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore|Cortex-A9]] dual-core with an [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]].
The ZedBoard contains the Zynq Z-7020 and all the necessary interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zedboard.org/product/zedboard |title=ZedBoard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software ===
The operating system is [[Linux kernel]]-based ([[Arch Linux]]) and composed entirely of free and open-source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.apertus.org/index.php?title=AXIOM_Beta_Software|title=AXIOM Beta/AXIOM Beta Software - apertus° wiki|website=wiki.apertus.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AXIOM Beta Developer Kit (DK)''' - apertus° offers AXIOM Beta Developer Kit without an enclosure either in kit form or readily assembled. The AXIOM Beta DK provides easy access to the camera’s printed circuit boards and is aimed at those who want to work on software related development. With this in mind all associated design files, BOMs, and STL files (for CAD or 3D printing components such as a lightweight enclosure), software source code repositories, etc. are made freely available. First AXIOM Beta DK's began shipping in October 2016.

'''AXIOM Beta Compact (CP)''' - A more user-friendly version of the camera suited to photo and video production environments is intended to ship with a CNC-milled aluminium enclosure and a web-based GUI (graphical user interface) for controlling camera functions through a [[Wi-Fi]] connection. AXIOM Beta CP is in development.

'''AXIOM Beta Extended (EX)''' - A Shoulder mounted rig incorporating AXIOM Beta, larger cooling fans, data storage facilities and an on-board PC. At time of writing (November 2017) AXIOM Beta EX is presently in concept phase.

[[File:AXIOM_Gamma_Prototype.jpeg|thumb|right|AXIOM Gamma Prototype]]

Research into developing the AXIOM Gamma started in March 2015 after the project was awarded [[Horizon 2020]] funding from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/194334_en.html|title=European Commission : CORDIS : Projects &amp; Results Service : Apertus° eXtendable Integrated Open Modular Cinema Camera|website=cordis.europa.eu|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was coordinated by the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]] and involved a consortium of European partners including apertus°, af inventions, Antmicro and [[Peter Denz|DENZ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eu.axiom-camera.com/partners/|title=Partners|website=eu.axiom-camera.com|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AXIOM Gamma utilizes a modular hardware concept that allows the camera to be a fully extendible and repairable camera system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26248">[[Julia Kristeva|Julia Kristeva’s]] theory of [[abjection]] produces many implications that cause us to think about how we position ourselves between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Kristeva posits that women are abjected as they represent a “suffocating return to the archaic maternal body”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy and the Maternal Body|last=Boulous Walker|first=Michelle|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1998|isbn=|location=London|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or more specifically, the return to immanence (death). In [[modernity]], the use of the abjected maternal or feminine body is utilised in popular culture to elicit horror from audiences. This, sometimes inadvertently, subverts the [[patriarchy]]’s grip on society and brings to light the oppression of women.{{REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE WHEN CLOSING THIS AfD}}

=== Lady Gaga ===
During the course of her ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' album cycle, [[Lady Gaga]] harnessed the abject in order to bring the repressed maternal to the forefront of her performances. In her ''[[Born This Way Ball]]'' world tour, Gaga commenced the concert by being birthed out of a large inflatable vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/lady-gaga-enters-through-giant-1547850|title=Lady Gaga shocks fans by climbing out of a giant inflatable vagina for her Born This Way Ball|last=Robertson|first=James|date=January 21, 2013|website=Mirror|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was met by considerable audience disgust, as it threatened the breakdown of our reality, and our distinction between subject and object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Theory: The Key Concepts|last=Felluga|first=Dino|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her infamous [[Born This Way (song)|''Born This Way'' video]], Gaga created a new religious scripture in which the mother is the almighty god. In this video, Gaga discusses the birth of a new race under ‘Mother Monster’, as the “wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began”, she exclaims that this moment of birth is not temporal, but eternal. Upon its release, this video was scalded for relying on shock tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/31300/1/a-look-back-at-lady-gaga-s-misunderstood-masterpiece|title=A look back at Lady Gaga's misunderstood masterpiece|last=Hall|first=Jake|date=May 30, 2016|website=Dazed|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction is perhaps unsurprising due to the way Gaga used the abjected site of the maternal in order to challenge our evolutionary instinct to reject death. Gaga consistently uses the abject to shock audiences and bring attention to the oppression of women in modernity. In 2014, Gaga performed at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] (South by Southwest) and included in this performance her song titled [[Swine (song)|Swine]], a song about sexual assault against women. For this performance Gaga brought performance artist [[Millie Brown (performance artist)|Millie Brown]] to the stage, whom of which began to vomit green paint over Gaga’s body while she played the drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lady-gaga-stages-dramatic-performance-art-spectacle-at-sxsw-197152/.|title=Lady Gaga Stages Dramatic Performance-Art Spectacle at SXSW|last=Edwards|first=Gavin|date=March 14, 2014|website=Rolling Stone|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Using the abject materials of oral disgust and waste&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Body in Western Culture: Contemporary Perspectives|last=Kristeva|first=Julia|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; , Gaga attempted to emphasise the way in which women are objectified and abused by men. It is a cunning juxtaposition as Gaga sings about her experience with sexual assault and vomit is hurled onto her body. A similar sentiment lies in her infamous ‘meat dress’. Using the abject material of blood and flesh that draped over her body, Gaga left people speechless and in a state of utter disgust. It was only later that Gaga revealed she had worn the dress as a statement against the “[[Don't ask, don't tell|Don’t Ask Don’t Tell]]” policy which silenced gay soldiers in the United States military. On the Ellen Show, Gaga exclaimed “if we don't stand up for what we believe in, if we don't fight for our rights, pretty soon we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our bones.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/956399/lady-gaga-explains-her-meat-dress-its-no-disrespect|title=Lady Gaga Explains Her Meat Dress: It's No Disrespect|last=Mapes|first=Jillian|date=September 13, 2010|website=Billboard|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;This makes clear the potential of Julia Kristeva’s theory of abjection to create social change.

=== Björk ===
Icelandic artist [[Björk]] is well known for her outlandish style and eccentric performances. Her latest album, ''[[Utopia (Björk album)|Utopia]]'' is accompanied by a plethora of abject imagery that run parallel with the feminist lyricism of the album. The album cover depicts a creature-like Björk with a bird fetus nestled in her neck, and a vagina growing from her forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rocknyc.live/bjork-announces-utopia-with-a-vagina-inspired-album-cover.html|title=Björk Announces 'Utopia' With A Vagina-Inspired Album Cover|last=Camus|first=Alyson|date=November 3, 2017|website=Rock NYC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively uses the abject in order to bring the maternal to the public sphere, forcing us to come to terms with our origin, and consequently, our imminent death. In her music video for ''[[The Gate (song)|The Gate]],'' Björk constructs a utopia of her own, rife with the symbolism of female genitalia which is played alongside birdsongs and a flute arrangement. This is another instance in which Björk has celebrated the maternal, and thus emphasised the silencing of such through our reaction to the “matriarchal tapestry” she weaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/11/23/bjork-utopia-review-sex-feminism|title=The pro-women vision of Björk's Utopia|last=Myers|first=Owen|date=November 23, 2017|website=Fader|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ariana Grande ===
It is only in recent times that American pop artist [[Ariana Grande]] has reinforced the notion of abjection within her own works. While she hinted towards a more female oriented approach on songs and videos such as ''[[Dangerous Woman (song)|Dangerous Woman]]'', it is one of her latest releases, off her 2018 album ''[[Sweetener (album)|Sweetener]]'', that has proven to manifest as Kristeva proposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection|last=Kristeva|first=Julia|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=Manhattan, NY|pages=i.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[God Is a Woman|God is a woman]]'' has quickly become a cornerstone of powerful female sexuality both in and outside of the [[private sphere]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/13/ariana-grande-god-is-a-woman-new-music-video-watch-female-lord-history|title=God is a Woman: Ariana Grande taps into a long herstory of a female lord|last=Mahdawi|first=Arwa|date=July 18, 2018|website=[[The Guardian]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://themuse.jezebel.com/ariana-grande-makes-us-pray-to-a-feminist-woman-god-1827475713|title=Ariana Grande Makes Us Pray to a Feminist Woman God|last=Hope|first=Clover|last2=Finger|first2=Bobby|date=July 13, 2018|website=The Muse|publisher=Jezebel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018|last3=Sherman|first3=Maria|last4=Garza|first4=Frida|last5=Shaffer|first5=Claire}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with rewritings of both history and mythology from a female (and symbiotically [[Feminism|feminist]]) perspective. The overarching message is one of women’s sexual empowerment, and while that is heavily reflected in the lyricism, the accompanying music video leaves audiences with additional images and symbols of the [[Goddess|divine feminine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHLHSlExFis|title=God is a woman|last=Grande|first=Ariana|date=July 13, 2018|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolism and commentary in the form of a variety of depictions of the [[vagina]] are evident&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ariana-grandes-god-is-a-woman-vagina-references|title=Ariana Grande’s ‘God Is a Woman’ Music Video Is Full of Vagina References|last=Rearick|first=Lauren|date=July 13, 2018|website=Teen Vogue|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; through various poses and hand gestures especially. The rewriting of spirituality with the phrase “God is a woman” repeated throughout, and the final image of Grande as God in a reimagining of ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'' reaffirms this call for female uprising, and challenges our society’s preconceived notions of what is and is not kept private; is a direct confrontation of the patriarchy and what women should “keep” of themselves solely for the pleasure or wants of the men that own them. However, the retaliation from religious sects especially reinstates the notion of abjection, as people of dogmatic faith claim Grande committed blasphemy in her lyrics and images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://readbloomjoy.com/2018/07/21/ariana-grandes-new-song-god-is-a-woman-has-christians-triggered/|title=Ariana Grande's New Song 'God is a woman' Has Christians Triggered|last=Gabrielle|first=Lex|date=July 2018|website=BloomJoyCollective|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grande’s use of this supremely maternal narrative, the notion that God is a woman because of their (or his or her, depending on perspective) divinity, sexual liberation and power of creation drives the message of abjection in modernity home.

== Film ==

=== Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 ===
Defined as a film in the ‘splatter’ subgenre of horror films, ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2|Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]'' harnesses the abject in a peculiar way. Horror is often defined as a misogynistic or heteronormative genre, but as [[Jack Halberstam]] makes clear, these ‘splatter’ films often use the abject to present queerness, or the unrecognisable human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monsters|last=Halberstam|first=Judith|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=North Carolina|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,'' bodies are brutalised by the chainsaw, and what we are left with is the excess flesh that survives the chainsaw, forming a queer and gender indifferent identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and The Technology of Monsters|last=Halberstam|first=Judith|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=North Carolina|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;According to Jack Halberstam, in this film we are subjected to the abject in the form of blood, flesh, etc., which change the bodily terrain of ‘man’ and ‘woman’. A ‘splattered’ or bloody body is queer, as it subverts the connotations of masculinity and femininity through an unrecognisable sea of tarnished flesh. 

=== Teeth ===
In the film [[Teeth (film)|Teeth]] (2007), the theories of Julia Kristeva’s on abjection and Barbara Creed’s monstrous-feminine can be explored.

Teeth is a [[Comedy horror|horror comedy]] film and [[Coming-of-age story]] written and directed by [[Mitchell Lichtenstein]] and stars [[Jess Weixler]] as Dawn, an outspoken activist of an abstinence-only group at her high school, while trying to suppress her own budding sexual desires.

The story follows Dawns’ journey of sexual discovery, however, takes a dark turn after Dawn and her new boyfriend Toby take a swim together at a local swimming hole. Toby forces himself onto Dawn, and when she tries to resist he assaults her and knocks her unconscious and proceeds to rape her. Toby is swiftly punished for sexually debasing Dawn with the masculine weapon of rape, as Dawn’s body savagely fights back, and severs Toby’s penis with her vagina. 

Through the violent act of rape and subsequent removal of Toby’s penis, Dawn discovers she is the living embodiment of the myth of the [[Vagina dentata|Vagina Dentata]] or “the toothed vagina” – the vagina that castrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|publisher=Penguin|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this act, Dawn is immediately rendered unnatural to the viewer and abject. &amp;nbsp;

Freud wrote that “Probably no male human being is spared the terrifying shock of threatened castration at the sight of the female genitals,”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fetishism', On Sexuality|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=Penguin|year=1981|isbn=|series=Pelican Freud Library|volume=7|location=Harmondsworth|pages=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creed expands on this thought and states that “[[Castration anxiety]] is a central concern of the horror film - particularly the slasher sub-genre. Woman's body is slashed and mutilated, not only to signify her own castrated state, but also the possibility of castration for the male.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creed|first=Barbara|date=1986|title=Horror and the Monstrous-Feminine - an Imaginary Abjection|url=|journal=Screen|volume=27 (1)|pages=52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creed describes how the sight of the female genitals is monstrous-feminine as the role of ‘the archaic mother’, as the absence of a penis is proof that castration can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creed|first=Barbara|date=1986|title=Horror and the Monstrous-Feminine - an Imaginary Abjection|url=|journal=Screen|volume=27 (1)|pages=63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Dawn is the physical manifestation of [[Castration anxiety]] for males with her vagina dentata, she is made monstrous-feminine. 

Through the film Dawn learns she has evolved to have this power and learns to control it through other sexual encounters. During her initial research of her vagina dentata, she discovers that to be ‘cured’ a male hero is to conquer vagina dentata through sexual intercourse, and thus restoring the woman to her ‘proper place’ in the ‘natural’ (patriarchal) order of the world. 

What makes this film different from the usual misogynistic and patriarchal themes and tropes found in a majority of the horror genre, is that it transforms the view of monstrous-feminine to that of a heroine. The director, Mitchell Lichtenstein, explicitly wanted to change the narrative of the myth of vagina dentata to be not about women, but men, and the fear men have of women and desire for control over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/sundance-interview-with-teeth-director-mitchell-lichtenstein/|title=Sundance Interview with Teeth Director Mitchell Lichtenstein|last=Billington|first=Alex|date=January 15, 2008|website=Firstshowing.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://demonista.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/never-conquered-teeth/|title=“She would never be conquered:” Feminist Resistance in Teeth|last=|first=|date=July 16, 2010|website=Demonista|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchel Lichtenstein is quoted in interviews that he didn’t want to perpetuate gynophobia and wanted to turn the myth ‘on its head’. &amp;nbsp;The vagina dentata myth always has the masculine hero conquering the woman, the monstrous-feminine, and destroying the teeth to free her. In his film, Lichtenstein wanted Dawn to be the heroine, with a power so she could never be conquered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifc.com/2008/01/mitchell-lichtenstein-on-teeth|title=Mitchell Lichtenstein on “Teeth“|last=Hillis|first=Aaron|date=January 14, 2008|website=IFC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein made a concerted effort to both not show Dawn’s toothed vulva or to have the action of the teeth snapping shut to be very audible. This was to ensure that Dawn and her ‘teeth’ were not the monster, the monstrous-feminine, but were an evolved adaption to protect her from violent sexual predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://demonista.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/never-conquered-teeth/|title=“She would never be conquered:” Feminist Resistance in Teeth|last=|first=|date=July 16, 2010|website=Demonista|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, Dawn evolved her vaginal dentata into a biological [[Anti-rape device]], developed to deter and prevent rape by causing pain and disfigurement to sexual violence perpetrators.

Reviews of the film have been mixed with praise from feminists for empowerment and from psychoanalysts for its exploration of the subject matter, while the anti-women [[Men's rights movement]] predictably claim the film is grossly misandrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/teeth|title=Teeth|last=|first=|date=|website=Metacritic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the history of the horror genre and its misogynistic and patriarchal themes, it is refreshing to see a film challenge these outdated ideas.

== Television ==

=== American Horror Story ===
Throughout its eight seasons, ''[[American Horror Story]]'' has continuously shocked viewers with its intense themes. The anthology series is no stranger to depicting its female characters as antagonists, with some of these including brutal criminals, murderers, a nun subjected to demonic possession, cult members and witches. Having such grim and vicious depictions of women has often been one of the focal points for the show, drawing viewers in with the complexities of the powerful, [[violent feminine]]. The construction and use of these characters is disconcerting: horror has quite a narrow scope in relation to the presence of predatory women, and this is evident in the impact female heavy seasons of ''[[American Horror Story]]'' (such as ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum|Asylum]]'', ''[[American Horror Story: Coven|Coven]]'', ''[[American Horror Story: Cult|Cult]]'' and more recently ''[[American Horror Story: Apocalypse|Apocalypse]]'') have on ratings, viewers and themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/why-female-violence-against-men-is-societys-last-great-taboo/|title=Why female violence against men is society's last greatest taboo|last=Daubney|first=Martin|date=March 15, 2016|website=The Telegraph|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While female antagonists are commonplace, female victims are (unsurprisingly) also a factor. It is interesting then to explore the almost exclusively female horrors of the first three seasons (''[[American Horror Story: Murder House|Murder House]]'', ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum|Asylum]]'' and ''[[American Horror Story: Coven|Coven]]'') , with tropes such as closeted queerness, fetishisation, rape, birth and abortions (failed, forced and traumatic), suicide, mental illness, institutionalisation, race and the ''[[Salem witch trials|Salem Witch Trials]]'' all confirming and playing out many women’s worst nightmares. Such explicit depictions of this, then, bring [[Julia Kristeva|Kristeva]]’s theory into full effect; the notion of abjection being carried out with the blood, gore, violence, nudity, bodies, maternity and spaces ''[[American Horror Story]]'' creates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kitschmag.com/2014/09/03/american-horror-story-as-the-female-horror-story/|title=American Horror Story as the Female Horror Story|last=Berdie, Alyssa. &amp; Tiffany, Kaitlyn.|first=|date=September 2014|website=kitsch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mostly in later seasons where female empowerment and justice is served, however, there is always a prevalent and sinister underlying tension when a woman is violated at any point throughout the various ideas explored in the show’s entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimejusticejournal.com/article/view/101|title=Girls, Crime and Violence: Toward a Feminist Theory of Female Violence|last=Carrington|first=Kerry|date=September 11, 2013|website=International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a final draw to [[Julia Kristeva|Kristeva’s]] theories, the relevance of distorted, disabled, or otherwise abnormal bodies in the show’s fourth season, ''[[American Horror Story: Freak Show|Freakshow]]'', is another theme to bring abjection to the forefront. Having differing bodies or abilities outside of the [[realm of possibility]] (including a [[Ethel Darling|bearded woman]], a [[List of American Horror Story: Freak Show characters|strong man]], several dwarves, a [[List of American Horror Story: Freak Show characters|three breasted woman]] and [[Bette and Dot Tattler|conjoined twins]] to name a few) for the season’s 1950s time setting is projected as unsettling and grotesque to not only regular society within the show but also the intended audience. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

=== Orange is the New Black ===
Another depiction of abjection in modernity is within television series ''[[Orange Is the New Black|Orange is the New Black]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01490400.2016.1203848?journalCode=ulsc20|title=Women's Leisure as Political Practice: A Feminist Analysis of Orange Is the New Black|last=McKeown, Janet K. L. &amp; Parry, Diana C.|first=|date=August 5, 2016|website=Taylor and Francis Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fictional television show, which centralises around the women within a low security prison, uses its scope of women as criminals to fight alongside movements within society (such as [[LGBT|LGBT+]] and [[Black Lives Matter]]). Using the idea of incarcerated females directly correlates with the abject, as it challenges the ideas of the [[violent and/or deviant feminine]], and the links to maternity are pellucid (both literally and symbolically when considering the pregnant female inmates in the show). By highlighting racial divides between the cell blocks and mainstreaming and normalising lesbian identity and sex, the show also calls for women to celebrate and enjoy themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/17/orange-is-the-new-black-this-show-will-change-the-fabric-of-our-culture|title=Orange is the New Black: This show will change the fabric of our culture|last=Ellis-Petersen|first=Hannah|date=June 2016|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidenced from the initial audience shock at the themes, vulgarity and sexual prowess of the program, this notion of [[abjection]] is extremely relevant when assessing the disruption of what a woman should be in our society, using the distasteful material as fuel to reroute criminality and women in that situation.

=== The Boulet Brothers' Dragula ===
Following in the footsteps of the immensely popular [[RuPaul's Drag Race|Rupaul’s Drag Race]], [[The Boulet Brothers' Dragula|The Boulet Brothers’ Dragula]] adapt their own drag reality show that is filled to the brim with abject imagery and references to the monstrous feminine.

According to ancient and [[History of science in the Middle Ages|medieval science]], '''aether''' ({{lang-grc|αἰθήρ}}, ''aither''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=ether |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=4th |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2006 |isbn=978-0618701728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), also spelled '''æther''' or '''ether''' and also called '''quintessence''', is the material that fills the region of the [[universe]] above the [[Sublunary sphere|terrestrial sphere]].&lt;ref name="smoot" /&gt; The concept of aether was used in several theories to explain several natural phenomena, such as the traveling of light and gravity. In the late 19th century, physicists postulated that aether permeated all throughout space, providing a medium through which light could travel in a [[vacuum]], but evidence for the presence of such a medium was not found in the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], and this result has been interpreted as meaning that no such [[luminiferous aether]] exists.&lt;ref&gt;Carl S. Helrich, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aRpJJXc-LCIC&amp;pg=PA26 ''The Classical Theory of Fields: Electromagnetism''] Berlin, Springer 2012, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythological origins==
{{main|Aether (mythology)}}
{{see also|Empyrean}}
The word  {{lang|grc|αἰθήρ}} (''aithēr'') in [[Homeric Greek]] means "pure, fresh air" or "clear sky". In [[Greek mythology]], it was thought to be the pure essence that the gods breathed, filling the space where they lived, analogous to the ''[[Air (classical element)|air]]'' breathed by mortals.&lt;ref name="gm.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Aether/aether.html |title=Aether |publisher=GreekMythology.com |accessdate=20 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220225142/http://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Aether/aether.html |archivedate=20 December 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also personified as a deity, [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]], the son of [[Erebus]] and [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] in traditional Greek mythology.&lt;ref name="gm.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Aither.html|title = AITHER|date = |access-date = January 16, 2016|website = AETHER : Greek protogenos god of upper air &amp; light ; mythology : AITHER|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aether is related to {{lang|grc|αἴθω}} "to incinerate",&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Pokorny|Pokorny, Julius]] (1959).

==Fifth element==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Classical element]] --&gt;
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|Medieval concept of the cosmos. The innermost spheres are the terrestrial spheres, while the outer are made of aether and contain the celestial bodies]]
In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (58d) speaking about air, Plato mentions that "there is the most translucent kind which is called by the name of aether (αίθηρ)".&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]],  ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=1C8F72843B9D65CB4C634D700A6E694C?doc=Plat.+Tim.+58d 58d].&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise he adopted the classical system of four elements. [[Aristotle]], who had been Plato's student at the [[Akademia]], agreed on this point with his former mentor, emphasizing additionally that fire sometimes has been mistaken for aether. However, in his Book ''[[On the Heavens]]'' he introduced a new "first" element to the system of the [[classical element]]s of [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian]] [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]]. He noted that the four terrestrial classical elements were subject to change and naturally moved linearly. The first element however, located in the celestial regions and heavenly bodies, moved circularly and had none of the qualities the terrestrial classical elements had. It was neither hot nor cold, neither wet nor dry. With this addition the system of elements was extended to five and later commentators started referring to the new first one as the fifth and also called it ''aether'', a word that Aristotle had not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hahm |first1=David E. |title=The fifth element in Aristotle's ''De Philosophia'': A Critical Re-Examination |journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies |date=1982 |volume=102 |pages=60–74 |doi=10.2307/631126|jstor=631126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aether did not follow [[Aristotelian physics]] either. Aether was also incapable of motion of quality or motion of quantity. Aether was only capable of local motion. Aether naturally moved in circles, and had no contrary, or unnatural, motion.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. E. R. Lloyd]]), ''Aristotle: The Growth and Structure of his Thought'', Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1968, pp. 133-139, {{ISBN|0-521-09456-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle also noted that crystalline spheres made of aether held the celestial bodies. The idea of crystalline spheres and natural circular motion of aether led to Aristotle's explanation of the observed orbits of stars and planets in perfectly circular motion in crystalline aether.&lt;ref name="smoot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aether.lbl.gov/www/classes/p10/aristotle-physics.html |title=Aristotle's Physics |author=George Smoot III |website=lbl.gov |accessdate=20 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220230803/http://aether.lbl.gov/www/classes/p10/aristotle-physics.html |archivedate=20 December 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval scholastic philosophers granted ''aether'' changes of density, in which the bodies of the planets were considered to be more dense than the medium which filled the rest of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Edward|title=Planets, Stars, &amp; Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200-1687|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=978-0-521-56509-7|pages=322–428|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Fludd]] stated that the aether was of the character that it was "subtler than light". Fludd cites the 3rd-century view of [[Plotinus]], concerning the aether as penetrative and non-material.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fludd, "Mosaical Philosophy". London, Humphrey Moseley, 1659. Pg 221.&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Arche]].

==Quintessence==
Quintessence is the [[Latinate]] name of the fifth element used by medieval alchemists for a medium similar or identical to that thought to make up the heavenly bodies. It was noted that there was very little presence of quintessence within the terrestrial sphere. Due to the low presence of quintessence, earth could be affected by what takes place within the heavenly bodies.&lt;ref name="TheAlchemists"&gt;''The Alchemists'', by F. Sherwood Taylor page 95&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was developed in the 14th century text ''The testament of Lullius'', attributed to [[Ramon Llull]]. The use of quintessence became popular within medieval alchemy. Quintessence stemmed from the medieval elemental system, which consisted of the four classical elements, and aether, or quintessence, in addition to two chemical elements representing metals: [[sulphur]], "the stone which burns", which characterized the principle of combustibility, and [[mercury (element)|mercury]], which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties.

This elemental system spread rapidly throughout all of Europe and became popular with alchemists, especially in medicinal alchemy. Medicinal alchemy then sought to isolate quintessence and incorporate it within medicine and elixirs.&lt;ref name="TheAlchemists" /&gt; Due to quintessence's pure and heavenly quality, it was thought that through consumption one may rid oneself of any impurities or illnesses. In ''The book of Quintessence'', a 15th-century English translation of a continental text, quintessence was used as a medicine for many of man's illnesses. A process given for the creation of quintessence is [[distillation]] of alcohol seven times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stavacademy.co.uk/mimir/quintessence.htm ''The book of Quintessence''], Early English Text society original series number 16, edited by F. J. Furnivall&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the term quintessence has become synonymous with [[elixirs]], medicinal [[alchemy]], and the [[philosopher's stone]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dictionary of Alchemy'', by Mark Haeffner&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{main|Aether theories}}
With the [[History of physics#18th-century developments|18th century physics developments]], physical models known as "aether theories" made use of a similar concept for the explanation of the propagation of electromagnetic and gravitational forces. As early as the 1670s, Newton used the idea of aether to help match observations to strict mechanical rules of his physics.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Osler, ''Reconfiguring the World.'' The Johns Hopkins University Press 2010. (155).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the early modern aether had little in common with the aether of classical elements from which the name was borrowed. These aether theories are considered to be scientifically obsolete, as the development of [[special relativity]] showed that Maxwell's equations do not require the aether for the transmission of these forces. However, Einstein himself noted that his own model which replaced these theories could itself be thought of as an aether, as it implied that the empty space between objects had its own physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert: "Ether and the Theory of Relativity" (1920), republished in Sidelights on Relativity (Methuen, London, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the early modern aether models being superseded by general relativity, occasionally some physicists have attempted to reintroduce the concept of aether in an attempt to address perceived deficiencies in current physical models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dirac | first1 = Paul | year = 1951 | title = Is there an Aether? | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 168 | issue = 4282| pages = 906–907 | doi=10.1038/168906a0|bibcode = 1951Natur.168..906D }}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed model of [[dark energy]] has been named "[[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]" by its proponents, in honor of the classical element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zlatev | first1 = I. | last2 = Wang | first2 = L. | last3 = Steinhardt | first3 = P. | year = 1999 | title = Quintessence, Cosmic Coincidence, and the Cosmological Constant | url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/358722| journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 82 | issue = 5| pages = 896–899 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.896 | bibcode=1999PhRvL..82..896Z|arxiv = astro-ph/9807002 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea relates to the hypothecial form of dark energy postulated as an explanation of observations of an accelerating universe. It has also been called a [[Fifth force|fifth fundamental force]].

===Aether and light===
{{main|Luminiferous aether}}
The motion of light was a long-standing investigation in physics for hundreds of years before the 20th century. The use of aether to describe this motion was popular during the 17th and 18th centuries, including a theory proposed by [[Johann II Bernoulli]], who was recognized in 1736 with the prize of the French Academy. In his theory, all space is permeated by aether containing "excessively small whirlpools". These whirlpools allow for aether to have a certain elasticity, transmitting vibrations from the corpuscular packets of light as they travel through.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Edmund Taylor, ''A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity from the Age of Descartes to the Close of the 19th Century'' (1910), pp. 101-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory of [[luminiferous aether]] would influence the [[wave|wave theory]] of light proposed by [[Christiaan Huygens]], in which light traveled in the form of [[longitudinal waves]]  via an "omnipresent, perfectly elastic medium having zero density, called aether". At the time, it was thought that in order for light to travel through a vacuum, there must have been a medium filling the void through which it could propagate, as sound through air or ripples in a pool. Later, when it was proved that the nature of light wave is [[transverse wave|transverse]] instead of longitudinal, Huygens' theory was replaced by subsequent theories proposed by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and [[Louis-Victor de Broglie|de Broglie]], which rejected the existence and necessity of aether to explain the various optical phenomena. These theories were supported by the results of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] in which evidence for the motion of aether was conclusively absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Michelson |first=Albert A. |title=The Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether |journal = American Journal of Science |volume = 22 |issue=128 |year = 1881 |pages = 120–129 |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-22.128.120|title-link=s:The Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether |bibcode=1881AmJS...22..120M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the experiment influenced many physicists of the time and contributed to the eventual development of Einstein's [[special relativity|theory of special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shankland | first1 = R. S. | year = 1964 | title = Michelson-Morley Experiment | url = | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 32 | issue = 1| page = 16 | doi = 10.1119/1.1970063 |bibcode = 1964AmJPh..32...16S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aether and gravitation===
[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumbnail|Sir Isaac Newton]]
Aether has been used in various gravitational theories as a medium to help explain gravitation and what causes it. It was used in one of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s first published theories of gravitation, ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (the ''Principia''). He based the whole description of planetary motions on a theoretical law of dynamic interactions. He renounced standing attempts at accounting for this particular form of interaction between distant bodies by introducing a mechanism of propagation through an intervening medium.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld1969"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenfeld |first1=L. |title=Newton's views on aether and gravitation |journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences |date=1969 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=29–37 |doi=10.1007/BF00327261}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls this intervening medium aether. In his aether model, Newton describes aether as a medium that "flows" continually downward toward the Earth's surface and is partially absorbed and partially diffused. This "circulation" of aether is what he associated the force of gravity with to help explain the action of gravity in a non-mechanical fashion.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld1969"/&gt; This theory described different aether densities, creating an aether density gradient. His theory also explains that aether was dense within objects and rare without them. As particles of denser aether interacted with the rare aether they were attracted back to the dense aether much like cooling vapors of water are attracted back to each other to form water.&lt;ref name="newton1679"/&gt; In the ''Principia'' he attempts to explain the elasticity and movement of aether by relating aether to his static model of fluids. This elastic interaction is what caused the pull of gravity to take place, according to this early theory, and allowed an explanation for action at a distance instead of action through direct contact. Newton also explained this changing rarity and density of aether in his letter to [[Robert Boyle]] in 1679.&lt;ref name="newton1679"&gt;Newton, Isaac.[http://www.orgonelab.org/newtonletter.htm "Isaac Newton to Robert Boyle, 1679."] 28 February 1679.&lt;/ref&gt; He illustrated aether and its field around objects in this letter as well and used this as a way to inform Robert Boyle about his theory.&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orgonelab.org/newtonletter.htm |title=Isaac Newton's Letter to Robert Boyle, on the Cosmic Ether of Space - 1679 |author=James DeMeo |year=2009 |website=orgonelab.org |accessdate=20 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220231449/http://www.orgonelab.org/newtonletter.htm |archivedate=20 December 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Newton eventually changed his theory of gravitation to one involving force and the laws of motion, his starting point for the modern understanding and explanation of gravity came from his original aether model on gravitation.&lt;ref name="robishaw"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KkS9CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=newton+robert+boyle+aether#v=onepage&amp;q=newton%20robert%20boyle%20aether&amp;f=false |title=The Esoteric Codex: Esoteric Cosmology |author=Andrew Robishaw |page=6 |date=9 April 2015 |publisher=Lulu.com |accessdate=20 December 2016 |isbn=9781329053083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Analysis Situs''''' is a book by the [[Princeton University|Princeton]] mathematician [[Oswald Veblen]], published in 1922. It is based on his 1916 lectures at the Cambridge Colloquium of the [[American Mathematical Society]]. The book, which went into a second edition in 1931, was the first English-language [[textbook]] on [[topology]], and served for many years as the standard reference for the domain. Its contents were based on the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] as well as Veblen's own work with his former student and colleague, [[James Waddell Alexander II|James Alexander]].{{sfnp|Hodge|1961|p=508}}

Among the many innovations in the book was the first definition of a [[topological manifold]],{{sfnp|Scholz|1999|p=}} and systematisations of [[Betti number]], [[Whitehead torsion|torsion]], the [[fundamental group]], and the [[topological spaces|topological classification problem]].{{sfnp|Batterson|2007|p=608}}

In [[theology]], '''angelism''' is a pejorative for arguments that [[human being]] as essentially [[angel]]ic, and therefore [[sin]]-less in actual nature. The term is used as a criticism, to identify ideas which reject conceptions of human nature as being (to some degree) sinful and [[lust]]ful: 
:"[Angelism] minimizes [[concupiscence]] and therefore ignores the need for moral vigilance and prayer to cope with the consequences of [[original sin]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=31808 |title=Dictionary : ANGELISM |publisher=Catholicculture.org |date=2014-12-08 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory is proposed by [[Grafton Elliott-Smith]] (1912) who was a neuroanatomist who was chiefly concerned with the emergence of the primate brain.

The '''arboreal theory''' claims that [[primate]]s evolved from their ancestors by adapting to [[arboreal]] life.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy,G.E. ''Paleoanthroplogy'' (1980) New York: McGRAW-HILL BOOK COMPANY.(p.28)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sussman, R. W. (1991). Primate origins and the evolution of angiosperms. American Journal of Primatology, 23(4), 209-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Primates are thought to have developed several of their [[Trait (biology)|traits]] and [[Habituation|habits]] initially while living in trees.  One key component to this argument is that primates relied on sight over [[Olfaction|smell]].  They were able to develop a keen sense of [[depth perception]], perhaps because of the constant leaping that was necessary to move about the trees.  Primates also developed [[hand]]s and feet that were capable of grasping.  This was also a result of arboreal life, which required a great deal of crawling along branches, and reaching out for fruit and other food.  These early primates were likely to have [[diet (nutrition)|eaten]] foods found in trees, such as flowers, fruits, berries, gums, leaves, and insects.  They are thought to have shifted their diets towards insects in the early [[Cenozoic|Cenozoic era]], when insects became more numerous.

An '''area chart''' or '''area graph''' displays graphically quantitative data. It is based on the [[line chart]]. The area between axis and line are commonly emphasized with colors, textures and hatchings. Commonly one compares two or more quantities with an area chart.

== History ==
[[William Playfair]] is usually credited with inventing the area charts as well as the [[Line chart|line]], [[Bar chart|bar]], and [[pie chart]]s. His book ''The Commercial and Political Atlas'', published in 1786, contained a number of [[time-series]] graphs, including ''Interest of the National Debt from the Revolution'' and ''Chart of all the Imports and Exports to and from England from the Year 1700 to 1782'' that are often described as the first area charts in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Playfair's Commercial and Political Atlas and Statistical Breviary|last1=Playfair|first1=William|last2=Wainer|first2=Howard|last3=Spence|first3=Ian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|ISBN=9780521855549|location=|pages=|author-link1=William Playfair|author-link2=Howard Wainer|author-link3=Ian Spence (psychologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Visual Display of Quantitative Information|last=Tufte|first=Edward|publisher=Graphics Press|year=1983|ISBN=0961392142|location=Cheshire, Connecticut|page=13|pages=|author-link=Edward Tufte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common uses ==

Area charts are used to represent cumulated totals using numbers or percentages (stacked area charts in this case) over time.
Use the area chart for showing trends over time among related attributes. The area chart is like the plot chart except that the area below the plotted line is filled in with color to indicate volume.

When multiple attributes are included, the first attribute is plotted as a line with color fill followed by the second attribute, and so on.

== Variations ==

Area charts which use vertical and horizontal lines to connect the data points in a series forming a step-like progression are called ''step-area charts''.

Area charts in which data points are connected by smooth curves instead of straight lines are called ''spline-area charts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Area, Spline-Area, Step-Area Charts | url=http://www.anychart.com/products/anychart/gallery/Area,_Spline-Area,_Step-Area_Charts/ | publisher=AnyChart | access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atheist feminism''' is a branch of [[feminism]] that advocates [[atheism]]. Atheist feminists also oppose [[religion]] as a main source of female oppression and [[Gender inequality|inequality]], believing that the majority of the religions are [[Sexism|sexist]] and oppressive to women.&lt;ref name="newstatesman1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/07/women-god-stangroom-benson |title=Does God Hate Women? |journal=New Statesman |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Ernestine Rose===
[[File:ErnestineRose.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Waist high portrait of woman in her forties, wearing a dark dress, with hair in ringlets|[[Ernestine Rose]] was a feminist and an atheist, well before the label "atheist feminist" existed.]]

The first known feminist who was also an atheist was [[Ernestine Rose]], born in Poland on January 13, 1810.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atheists.org/Ernestine_Rose%3A_A_Troublesome_Female |first=Ernestine |last=Rose |authorlink=Ernestine Rose |title=A Troublesome Female |website=theists.org |accessdate=2010-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120040052/https://atheists.org/Ernestine_Rose%3A_A_Troublesome_Female |archivedate=2010-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her open confession of disbelief in [[Judaism]] when she was a teenager brought her into conflict with her father (who was a rabbi) and an unpleasant relationship developed.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; In order to force her into the obligations of the Jewish faith, her father, without her consent, betrothed her to a friend and fellow Jew when she was sixteen.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; Instead of arguing her case in a Jewish court (since her father was the local rabbi who ruled on such matters), she went to a secular court, pleaded her own case, and won.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; In 1829 she went to [[England]], and in 1835 she was one of the founders of the British atheist organization Association of All Classes of All Nations, which "called for [[human rights]] for all people, regardless of sex, class, color, or national origin".&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; She lectured in England and America (moving to America in May 1836) and was described by Samuel P. Putnam 3 as "one of the best lecturers of her time". He wrote that "no orthodox [meaning religious] man could meet her in debate".&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt;

In the winter of 1836, Judge Thomas Hertell, a radical and freethinker, submitted a married women's property act in the legislature of the state of New York to investigate ways of improving the civil and property rights of married women, and to permit them to hold real estate in their own name, which they were not then permitted to do in New York. Upon hearing of the resolution, Ernestine Rose drew up a petition and began the soliciting of names to support the resolution in the state legislature, sending the petition to the legislature in 1838.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; This was the first petition drive done by a woman in New York.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; Ernestine continued to increase both the number of the petitions and the names until such rights were finally won in 1848, with the passing of the Married Women's Property Act.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Others who participated in the work for the bill included [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Lucretia Mott]] and [[Frances Wright]], who were all anti-religious.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; Later when Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton analyzed the influences which led to the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] on women's rights in 1848, they identified three causes, the first two being the radical ideas of Frances Wright and Ernestine Rose on religion and democracy, and the initial reforms in women's property law in the 1830s and 1840s.

Ernestine later joined a group of [[Freethought|freethinkers]] who had organized a Society for Moral Philanthropists, at which she often lectured.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; In 1837, she took part in a debate that continued for thirteen weeks, where her topics included the advocacy of abolition of slavery, women's rights, equal opportunities for education, and civil rights.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; In 1845 she was in attendance at the first national convention of infidels [meaning atheists].&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; Ernestine Rose also introduced "the agitation on the subject of women's suffrage" in Michigan in 1846.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; In a lecture in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in 1851, she opposed calling upon the Bible to underwrite the rights of women, claiming that human rights and freedom of women were predicated upon "the laws of humanity" and that women, therefore, did not require the written authority of either Paul or Moses, because "those laws and our claim are prior" to both.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt;

She attended the Women's Rights Convention in the Tabernacle, New York City, on September 10, 1853, and spoke at the Hartford Bible Convention in 1854.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; It was in March of that year, also, that she took off with Susan B. Anthony on a speaking tour to Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; Susan B. Anthony arranged the meetings and Ernestine Rose did all of the speaking; after this successful tour, Susan B. Anthony embarked on her own first lecture tour.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt;

Later, in October 1854, Ernestine Rose was elected president of the National Women's Rights Convention at Philadelphia, overcoming the objection that she was unsuitable because of her atheism.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; Susan B. Anthony supported her in this fight, declaring that every religion—and none—should have an equal right on the platform.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; In 1856 she spoke at the Seventh National Woman's [Rights] Convention saying in part, "And when your minister asks you for money for missionary purposes, tell him there are higher, and holier, and nobler missions to be performed at home. When he asks for colleges to educate ministers, tell him you must educate woman, that she may do away with the necessity of ministers, so that they may be able to go to some useful employment."{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

She appeared again in Albany, New York, for the State Women's Rights Convention in early February 1861, the last one to be held until the end of the Civil War.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; On May 14, 1863, she shared the podium with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, [[Lucy Stone]], and [[Antoinette Blackwell]] when the first [[Women's National Loyal League]] met to call for equal rights for women, and to support the government in the Civil War "in so far as it makes a war for freedom".&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt;

She was in attendance at the [[American Equal Rights Association]] meeting in which there was a schism and on May 15, 1869, she joined with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucy Stone to form a new organization, the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]], which fought for both male and female suffrage, taking a position on the executive committee.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt; She died at Brighton, England, on August 4, 1892, at age eighty-two.&lt;ref name="atheists.org"/&gt;

The most prominent other people to publicly advocate for feminism and to challenge Christianity in the 1800s were [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2000 Years of Disbelief: Famous People With the Courage to Doubt|isbn=978-1573920674|first=James A. |last=Haught|publisher=Prometheus Books |date=June 1, 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftp.fortunaty.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.fortunaty.net/com/sacred-texts/wmn/wcs/index.htm|title=Women, Church and State Index|website=ftp.fortunaty.net|accessdate=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 Stanton wrote an essay entitled "Has Christianity Benefited Woman?" arguing that it had in fact hurt women's rights, and stating, "All religions thus far have taught the headship and superiority of man, [and] the inferiority and subordination of woman. Whatever new dignity, honor, and self-respect the changing theologies may have brought to man, they have all alike brought to woman but another form of humiliation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenwriters.library.emory.edu/content.php?level=div&amp;id=stanton_christianity_001&amp;document=stanton_christianity|title=Emory Women Writers Resource Project : Has Christianity Benefited Woman? an electronic edition : Essay 0|website=womenwriters.library.emory.edu|accessdate=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] wrote the book for which she is best known, ''Woman, Church, and State'', which was one of the first books to draw the conclusion that Christianity is a primary impediment to the progress of women, as well as civilization.&lt;ref name="ftp.fortunaty.net"/&gt; In 1895 [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] wrote ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'', revised and continued with another book of the same name in 1898, in which she criticized religion and stated "the Bible in its teachings degrades women from Genesis to Revelation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Woman's Bible: A Classic Feminist Perspective|isbn=978-0486424910|first= Elizabeth |last=Cady Stanton|authorlink=Elizabeth Cady Stanton|publisher=Dover Publications|date=January 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/wb/|title=The Woman's Bible Index|website=sacred-texts.com|accessdate=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]&lt;/ref&gt;

African American feminist atheists like Hutchinson espouse an [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] approach to feminist organizing, activism and scholarship that is rooted in the lived experiences and social history of communities of color with respect to racism, white supremacy, sexism/misogynoir, heterosexism and capitalist oppression.  Black feminist atheist praxis differs from atheist feminist approaches that confine critique of religion to dogma and gender oppression rather than looking at how religious hierarchies are also informed by imperialism, capitalism and segregation. Feminist activist from FEMEN Inna Shevchenko speaks out against organised religions as one of the major historical obstacles for women's liberation and feminism. At the Secular Conference 2017 in London,speaking on compatibility of feminism and religion, she said "I am looking forward for a day, when imams, rabbis, priests, religious fanatics, sexistst and mysoginists fed by monotheist dogmas will go down on their knees but not to pray for support of their god, they will go on their knees in front of women of the world to pray for their forgiveness. It is only then they can be proud of their gods".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzVhwsetzDk|title=Inna Shevchenko, FEMEN Leader: "Gods vs Girls: Is Religion Compatible with Feminism?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the first "Women in Secularism" conference was held, from May 18–20 at the Crystal City Marriott at Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womeninsecularism.org/2012/|title=Women in Secularism: 2012 conference in Washington, DC|website=womeninsecularism.org|access-date=2013-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730235818/http://www.womeninsecularism.org/2012/|archive-date=2013-07-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 [[Jennifer McCreight]] founded a movement known as Atheism Plus that "applies skepticism to everything, including social issues like sexism, racism, politics, poverty, and crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freethoughtblogs.com/blaghag/|title=Blag Hag|author=Jen|website=freethoughtblogs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheism Plus had a website that was active from 2012 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheismplus.com/ |title=Atheism Plus |website=atheismplus.com on archive.org |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422122532/http://atheismplus.com/ |archivedate=2016-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 a joint statement by atheist activists [[Ophelia Benson]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] was issued stating, "It’s not news that allies can’t always agree on everything. People who rely on reason rather than dogma to think about the world are bound to disagree about some things. Disagreement is inevitable, but bullying and harassment are not. If we want secularism and atheism to gain respect, we have to be able to disagree with each other without trying to destroy each other. In other words we have to be able to manage disagreement ethically, like reasonable adults, as opposed to brawling like enraged children who need a nap. It should go without saying, but this means no death threats, rape threats, attacks on people’s appearance, age, race, sex, size, haircut; no photoshopping people into demeaning images, no vulgar epithets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2014/07/joint-statement-by-ophelia-benson-and-richard-dawkins/|title=Joint statement by Ophelia Benson and Richard Dawkins|author=Ophelia Benson|website=Butterflies and Wheels}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/2014/07/joint-statement-by-ophelia-benson-and-richard-dawkins/|title=Joint statement by Ophelia Benson and Richard Dawkins|author=Stephanie|website=Richard Dawkins Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins added, "I’m told that some people think I tacitly endorse such things even if I don’t indulge in them. Needless to say, I’m horrified by that suggestion. Any person who tries to intimidate members of our community with threats or harassment is in no way my ally and is only weakening the atheist movement by silencing its voices and driving away support."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Baksheesh''' or '''bagsheesh''' (from {{lang-fa|بخشش}} ''bakhshesh''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=+baksheesh&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is [[tip (gratuity)|tipping]], [[Charity (virtue)|charitable giving]], and certain forms of [[political corruption]] and [[bribery]] in the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]].

==Etymology and usage==
Baksheesh comes from the Persian word {{lang|fa|بخشش}} (''bakhshesh''), which originated from the [[Middle Persian]] language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dehkhoda dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word had also moved to other cultures and countries. In the [[Albanian Language|Albanian]], [[Arabic Language|Arabic]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Languages of India|Indian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Turkish language]]s, ''bakshish'' or бакшиш means "tip" in the conventional western sense. In Greek, μπαξίσι (''baksisi'') can mean a gift in general. In [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]], ''Bakschisch'' is a small bribe (in Romanian as well, depending on the context; usually employed as a euphemism to ''şpagă'', which means outright bribe).

== Types ==
*[[Charity (virtue)|Charity]] to beggars:  In [[Pakistan]], [[beggars]] solicit alms by crying'' 'baksheesh, baba!'.''&lt;ref&gt;Mark McCrum. [https://books.google.com/books?id=D9oiqvpqxusC&amp;pg=PA104 ''Going Dutch in Beijing: How to Behave Properly When Far Away from Home'']. Macmillan, 2008. {{ISBN|0-8050-8676-5}}, {{ISBN|9780805086768}}/ Pg 104&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tipping: This does not correlate with the European system of [[tip (gratuity)|tipping]], as it also includes demonstrations of gratitude, respect, or veneration. An offering to the [[deity|gods]] may be considered baksheesh. A ''[[faqir]]'' may also ask for ''baksheesh'', but no thought is in his mind that he is begging. In fact, in Pakistan and the [[Muslim]] world, the giver of alms often salutes the beggar for having been given the opportunity to gain [[:wikt:merit|merit]]. In [[Egypt]], baksheesh is often requested on top of fares to taxi drivers, and as service charges to waiters, doormen, shopkeepers, garage attendants, and many others employed in service-sector jobs.
* Outright [[bribery]]: In countries with [[Corruption index|endemic corruption]], for instance, a member of the police force, or a migration or customs officer, or any other type of government official may be swayed from legitimately or illegitimately arresting, issuing a fine, or imposing a tax on someone by a suitable payment of baksheesh which would constitute a bribe, whether it was offered to the official or requested by the official.

==In literature==

When American mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] travelled on his maiden visit to [[India]] in 1954, he encountered pervasive begging which he called the "Baksheesh Complex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Joseph |editor=Robin Larsen |editor2=Stephen Larsen |editor3=Antony Van Couvering |title=Baksheesh and Brahman: Asian Journals - India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VySPqLx1DucC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Brahma+and+Baksheesh&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Brahma%20and%20Baksheesh&amp;f=false|year=2002|publisher=New World Library|isbn=1-57731-237-6|pages= xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Twain]], after riding through the [[Bible|Biblical]] town of [[Magdala]] in 1867, makes note of his encounter with beggars and the term "bucksheesh" in his published work ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'': "They hung to the horses' tails, clung to their manes and the stirrups, closed in on every side in scorn of dangerous hoofs&amp;mdash;and out of their infidel throats, with one accord, burst an agonizing and most infernal chorus:'' '[[wikt :howadji|Howajji]], bucksheesh! howajji, bucksheesh! howajji, bucksheesh! bucksheesh! bucksheesh!' ''I never was in a storm like that before."

Leo Deuel, the writer on archaeology, sardonically described baksheesh as "lavish remuneration and bribes, rudely demanded but ever so graciously accepted by the natives in return for little or no services rendered".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | title=Testaments of Time; the Search for Lost Manuscripts and Records, | author=Deuel, Leo | year=1966 | location=New York | page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bram Stoker]] mentions backsheesh twice in ''[[Dracula]]''.  The log of the ship ''Demeter'' when recording the voyage from Varna to Whitby uses the word backsheesh separately during the description of two inspections by customs officers, once when the ship was entering the [[Bosphorus]] and again while on the way through the [[Dardanelles]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=sn9W2cLuhxYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dracula&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=evRKUojPFoWI0AXw4oDABQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=backsheesh&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2006">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Busemann ''G''-space}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''[[Busemann G-space|Busemann ''G''-space]]''' is a type of [[metric space]] first described by [[Herbert Busemann]] in 1942.

If &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space such that

#  for every two distinct &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;z \in X-\{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,z)+d(y,z)=d(x,z)&lt;/math&gt; ([[Menger convexity]])
# every &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-bounded set of infinite cardinality possesses [[accumulation point]]s
# for every &lt;math&gt;w \in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;\rho_w&lt;/math&gt; such that for any distinct points &lt;math&gt;x,y \in B(w,\rho_w)&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;z \in  ( b(w,\rho_w)-\{ x,y \} )^\circ&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,z)+d(y,z)=d(x,z)&lt;/math&gt; ([[geodesic]]s are locally extendable)
# for any distinct points &lt;math&gt;x,y \in X&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;u,v \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,u)+d(y,u)=d(x,u)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d(x,v)+d(y,v)=d(x,v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(y,u)=d(y,v)&lt;/math&gt; (geodesic extensions are unique).

then ''X'' is said to be a ''Busemann'' ''G''-''space''.  Every Busemann ''G''-space is a [[homogenous space]].

The [[Busemann conjecture]] states that every Busemann ''G''-space is a [[topological manifold]]. It is a special case of the [[Bing–Borsuk conjecture]]. The Busemann conjecture is known to be true for dimensions 1 to 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.|first1=Halverson, Denise|last2=Dušan|first2=Repovš,|title=The Bing–Borsuk and the Busemann conjectures|journal=Mathematical Communications|date=23 December 2008|volume=13|issue=2|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/30884|language=en|issn=1331-0623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Papadopoulos|first1=Athanase|title=Metric Spaces, Convexity and Nonpositive Curvature|date=2005|publisher=European Mathematical Society|isbn=9783037190104|pages=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrwzXZB0YrIC&amp;pg=PA77|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{confused|text=a [[Jack (device)|car jack]], a device for lifting up the body of a vehicle}}
{{redirect|Car-jacked|the children's novel|Car-Jacked (novel)}}
'''Carjacking'''  is a [[robbery]] in which the item taken over is a motor vehicle.&lt;ref name="Cherbonneau"&gt;Michael Cherbonneau, "Carjacking," in ''Encyclopedia of Social Problems'', Vol. 1 (SAGE, 2008: ed. Vincent N. Parrillo), pp. 110-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word is a [[portmanteau]] of [[automobile|car]] and hijacking. The term was coined by EJ Mitchell, an editor with ''[[The Detroit News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pulitzer, Lisa Beth. Crime On Deadline. New York, New York: Boulevard Books, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; ''The News'' first used the term in a 1991 report on the murder of Ruth Wahl, a 22-year-old Detroit drugstore cashier who was killed when she would not surrender her [[Suzuki Sidekick]], and in an investigative report examining the rash of what Detroit Police call "robbery armed unlawful driving away an automobile" [in dispatch slang shortened to R.A.-YOU-Da] plaguing Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Detroit News'', August 28, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
A study published in the ''[[British Journal of Criminology]]'' in 2003 found that "for all of the media attention it has received in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, carjacking remains an under-researched and poorly understood crime."&lt;ref name="Jacobs2003"&gt;Bruce A. Jacobs, Volkan Topalli &amp; Richard Wright, "Carjacking, Streetlife and Offender Motivation" in ''The British Journal of Criminology'', Vol. 43, Issue 4 (October 2003), pp. 673–688.&lt;/ref&gt; The study authors conducted [[semi-structured interview]]s with 28 active carjackers in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and based on these interviews concluded that "the decision to commit a carjacking stems most directly from a situated interaction between particular sorts of perceived opportunities and particular sorts of perceived needs and desires, this decision is activated, mediated, and shaped by participation in urban street culture."&lt;ref name="Jacobs2003"/&gt;

A study published in the ''[[Journal of Contemporary Ethnography]]'' in 2013 noted that "carjacking requires offenders to neutralize victims who are inherently mobile and who can use their vehicles as both weapons and shields." The study noted that carjackers use fear to compel compliance from victims.&lt;ref name="Jacobs2013"&gt;Bruce Jacobs, "The Manipulation of Fear in Carjacking" in ''Journal of Contemporary Ethnography'', Vol. 42, Issue 5 (February 2013), pp. 523-544.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2008 paper by the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]] conceptualized carjackings as falling into four types based on method and motive: organized and instrumental, organized and acquisitive, opportunistic and instrumental, and opportunistic and acquisitive. An example of an ''organized and instrumental'' carjacking is a planned carjacking with a weapon to use the vehicle for [[ram-raiding|ram an ATM to steal cash]]. An example of an ''organized and acquisitive'' carjacking is a planned carjacking to sell the vehicle in a known market. An example of an ''opportunistic and instrumental'' carjacking is a carjacking without a weapon to sell "vehicle/parts with no market in mind." An example of an ''opportunistic and acquisitive'' carjacking is a carjacking without a weapon to [[Joyride (crime)|joyride]].&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"&gt;Lisa Jane Young and Maria Borzycki, [http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/341-360/tandi351.html Carjacking in Australia: recording issues and future directions], ''Trends &amp; Issues in Crime &amp; Criminal Justice'', No. 351, [[Australian Institute of Criminology]], February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 qualitative study published in ''[[Justice Quarterly]]'' examined auto theft and carjacking in the context of "sanction threats" that promoted fear and influenced "crime preferences" among criminals, thereby redirecting ("channeling") criminal activity. The study showed that "auto thieves are reluctant to embrace the violence of carjacking due to concerns over sanction threat severity they attributed to carjacking—both formal (higher sentences) and informal (victim resistance and retaliation). Meanwhile, the carjackers are reticent to enact auto theft because of the more uncertain and putatively greater risk of being surprised by victims, a fear that appears to overcome the enhanced long-term formal penalty of taking a vehicle by force."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce A. Jacobs &amp; Michael Cherbonneau, "Perceived Sanction Threats and Projective Risk Sensitivity: Auto Theft, Carjacking, and the Channeling Effect," ''Justice Quarterly'' (March 2017), pp. 1-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and response==
Common carjacking ruses include: (1) [[Traffic collision|bumping the victim's vehicle]] from behind, and taking the car when the victim gets out of the vehicle to assess damage and exchange information; (2) staging a fake car accident, sometimes with injuries, and stealing the vehicle of a passerby who stops to assist; (3) flashing lights or waving to get the victim's attention, indicating that there is a problem with the victim's car, and then taking the car once the victim pulls over; and (4) following a victim home, blocking the victim's car in a driveway or in front of a gate.&lt;ref name="Diplo"&gt;''[https://www.state.gov/m/ds/rls/rpt/19782.htm Carjacking&amp;mdash;Don't be a Victim]'', U.S. Department of State, [[Bureau of Diplomatic Security]] (August 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Police department]]s, security agencies, and [[Auto insurance|auto insurers]] have published lists of strategies for preventing and responding to carjackings.&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"&gt;[http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/06/nopd_crime_prevention_how_to_a.html NOPD crime prevention: How to avoid being carjacked], [[New Orleans Police Department]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="III"&gt;[http://www.iii.org/article/preventing-carjacking-theft Preventing Carjacking / Theft], [[Insurance Information Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Common recommendations include:
* Staying alert and being aware of one's surroundings&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;
* Parking in well-lighted areas&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="III"/&gt;
* Keeping [[vehicle door]]s locked and [[car windows|windows]] up&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;
* Avoiding unfamiliar or high-crime areas&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;
* Alerting police as soon as safely possible following a carjacking&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;
* Avoid isolated and less-well-trafficked parking lots, ATMs, pay phones, etc.&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="III"/&gt;
* When stopped in traffic, keeping some distance between the vehicle in front, so one can pull away easily if necessary.&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;
* If confronted, it is often safer to give up the vehicle and avoid resisting&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;

==Incidents by country==

===South Africa===
[[File:Hi-jacking hot spot.JPG|thumb|right|A sign in South Africa warning drivers]]
Carjacking is a significant problem in [[South Africa]], where it is called ''hijacking''.&lt;ref name="Caroll"&gt;Rory Caroll, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/02/film.oscars2006 Carjacking: the everyday ordeal testing South Africa], ''Guardian'' (March 2, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa is thought to have the highest carjacking rate in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Davis, [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1375/acri.36.2.173 Carjacking — Insights from South Africa to a New Crime Problem], '' Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Criminology'', Vol. 35, Issue 2, 2003, pp. 173-191.&lt;/ref&gt; There were 16,000 reported carjackings in 1998.&lt;ref name="Caroll"/&gt; The figures dropped to 12,434 reported carjackings in 2005,&lt;ref name="Caroll"/&gt; and continued to drop until the 2011-12, when the number of carjackings was 9,475, a record low.&lt;ref name="Conway-Smith"&gt;Erin Conway-Smith, [https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-05-27/carjackings-are-rise-again-south-africa Carjackings are on the rise again in South Africa], ''GlobalPost'' (May 27, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, however, carjackings increased as part of an overall increase in violent organized crime, which the [[Institute for Security Studies]] attributed to poor police leadership. There were 11,221 reported carjackings in 2014. More than half of all carjackings in South Africa occurred in [[Gauteng]] province, which includes [[Johannesburg]] and [[Pretoria]].&lt;ref name="Conway-Smith"/&gt; 

The carjacking issue in South Africa was depicted in the film ''[[Tsotsi]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="Conway-Smith"/&gt; 

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, several new, unconventional [[anti-hijack system|anti-carjacking systems]] designed to harm the attacker were developed and marketed in South Africa, where carjacking had become endemic. Among these was the now defunct [[Blaster (flamethrower)|Blaster]], a small [[flame-thrower]] that could be mounted to the underside of a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/africa/9812/11/flame.thrower.car/|publisher=CNN|title=Flamethrower now an option on S. African cars|date=December 11, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
==== Federal Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 ====

{{See also|Murder of Pam Basu}}

In 1992, Congress, in the aftermath of a spate of violent carjackings (including some in which the victims were murdered), passed the Federal Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 (FACTA), the first federal carjacking law, making it a [[federal crime]] (punishable by 15 years to [[life imprisonment]]) to use a firearm to steal "through force or violence or intimidation" a motor vehicle that had been shipped through [[interstate commerce]].&lt;ref name="Cherbonneau"/&gt; The 1992 Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 2119, took effect on October 25, 1992.&lt;ref name="Folks"&gt;Mike Folks, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-01-17/news/9401170203_1_federal-carjacking-law-carjacking-cases-pamela-basu Carjacking Law Getting Little Use: Few Prosecutions Occur Despite Increase in Number of Cases], ''Sun-Sentinel'' (January 17, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="18 U.S.C. § 2119"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2119 18 U.S.C. § 2119].&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a small number of federal prosecutions were imposed for carjacking the year after the act was enacted, in part because many federal carjacking cases were turned over to state prosecutions because they do not meet [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] criteria.&lt;ref name="Folks"/&gt; The Federal Death Penalty Act, part of the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994]], an omnibus crime bill, made sixty new federal crimes punishable by the [[Capital punishment by the United States federal government|federal death penalty]]; among these were the killing of a victim in the commission of carjacking.&lt;ref name="Cherbonneau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="18 U.S.C. § 2119"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amy D'Olivio, "Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act" in ''Encyclopedia of Law Enforcement'' (Sage, 2004: eds. Larry E. Sullivan et al.), p. 896.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1993, articles about carjackings appeared at the rate of more than one a week in newspapers throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;"Carjacking Reports Increase In Area -- Police Told Of Five Incidents Over Thanksgiving Holiday." ''Seattle Times'', Saturday, November 26, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The November 29, 1992, killing of two [[Osceola County, Florida]] men by carjackers using a stolen [[9×19mm Parabellum|9 mm]] pistol resulted in the first federal prosecution of a fatal carjacking.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Pierson Curtis, [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-01-30/news/9401300447_1_polk-county-bigger-gun-carjacking Youths Steal Guns To Steal Youths' Lives; The Gun Used In The Nation's First Federal Carjacking Case Was Bought Legally, Then Stolen], ''Orlando Sentinel'', January 30, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevalence and statistical analysis====
According to the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS) conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice's [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], from 1993 to 2002, some 38,000 carjackings occurred annually.&lt;ref name="Klaus"&gt;Patsy Klaus, [http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/c02.pdf National Crime Victimization Survey, Carjacking, 1993-2002], U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the survey, over this time period men were more often victims than women, blacks more than whites, and Hispanics more than non-Hispanics.&lt;ref name="Klaus"/&gt; 56% of carjackers were identified by victims as black, 21% white, 16% Asian or Native American, and 7% mixed race or unknown.&lt;ref name="Klaus"/&gt; Some 93% of carjackings occurred in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Klaus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin S. Wright, Motor Vehicle Theft, in ''Encyclopedia of Street Crime in America'' (Sage 2010: ed. Jeffrey Ian Ross), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There were multiple carjackers in 56% of incidents, and the carjacker or carjackers were identified as male in 93% of incidents. A weapon was used in 74% of carjacking victimization: firearms in 45%, knives in 11%, and other weapons in 18%. Victims were injured in about 32% of completed carjackings and about 17% of attempted carjackings. Serious injuries, such as gunshot or knife wounds, broken bones, or internal injuries occurred in about 9% of incidents. About 14 murders a year involved car theft, but not all of these were carjackings. There were multiple carjackers in 56% of incidents, and the carjacker or carjackers were identified as male in 93% of incidents. Some 68% of carjackings occurred at nighttime hours (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.). Some 98% of completed carjackings and 77% of attempted carjackings were reported to police. About 44% of carjacking incidents occurred in an open area (e.g., on the street or near public transportation) while 24% occurred in parking lots or garages or near commercial places (e.g., stores, gas stations, office buildings, restaurants/bars).&lt;ref name="Klaus"/&gt;

According to the NCVS, from 1992 and 1996, about 49,000 completed or attempted nonfatal carjackings took place each year in the United States. The carjacking was successful in about half of incidents. Data on fatal carjackings are not available; "about 27 homicides by strangers each year involved automobile theft," but not all of these were carjackings.&lt;ref name="Klaus2"&gt;Patsy Klaus, [http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cus96.pdf Carjackings in the United States, 1992-96], .S.

Carjackings were common in [[Newark, New Jersey]], in the 1990s, and a wave of carjackings took place again in 2010.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/nyregion/22carjack.html After Dozens of Arrests, Newark Carjackings Decline Sharply], March 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There were 288 carjackings in the city in 2010 (a 70% increase from the previous year), and [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] (which includes Newark) had 69 in December 2010 alone.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; The Associated Press reported that "unlike previous carjackings, in which thieves would strip vehicles for parts or sell them in other states, the recent wave perplexed law enforcement officials because almost all appeared to be done by thrill-seeking young men who would steal the cars for a few hours, drive them around and then abandon them."&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; After federal, state, and law enforcement agencies formed a task force, 42 suspects were charged, and carjackings dropped dramatically.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; However, national media attention on carjackings in Essex County returned in December 2013, when a [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] lawyer was murdered at [[The Mall at Short Hills]] in [[Millburn, New Jersey]], while defending his wife from four assailants,&lt;ref&gt;Marc Santora &amp; Annie Correaldec, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/nyregion/carjacking-victim-at-new-jersey-mall-dies.html Man Dies in Carjacking at Short Hills Mall; 2 Suspects Are Sought], ''New York Times'', December 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schwirtzdec, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/nyregion/4-suspects-held-in-deadly-carjacking-at-new-jersey-mall.html 4 Suspects Held in Fatal Carjacking at Mall], ''New York Times'', December 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/22/us/ap-us-shooting-nj-mall.html 4 Men Plead Not Guilty in Deadly Mall Carjacking], October 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; who were all later convicted of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Jongsma, [http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/crime/2017/10/10/two-men-plead-guilty-roles-fatal-short-hills-mall-carjacking/751683001/ Two men plead guilty to roles in fatal Short Hills mall carjacking], ''NorthJersey.com'' (October 10, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The major U.S. city with the highest rates of carjacking is [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name="Baldas"&gt;Tresa Baldas, [http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2014/11/30/detroit-police-fight-carjacking-crime/19671313/ Carjackers losing grip on Detroit, but strike daily], ''Detroit Free Press'' (November 30, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Detroit had 1,231 carjackings, more than three a day.&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt; By 2013, that number had fallen to 701, but this was still the highest known number of carjackings for any major city in the country.&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt;  The significant decrease in carjackings was credited to a coordinated effort by the [[Detroit Police Department]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and the [[United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan|local federal prosecutor's office]].&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt;  Serial carjackers were targeted for federal prosecutions and longer sentences, and in 2009 the Detroit Police Department centralized all carjacking investigations and developed a suspect profiling system.&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt; Through mid-November 2014, Detroit had 486 carjackings, down 31% from the year before, but this was still three times more than the carjackings experienced by [[New York City]] (which has ten times Detroit's population) in all of 2013.&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt; Even James Craig, [[chief of police]] of the [[Detroit Police Department]], was the victim of an attempted carjacking while he was in his [[police cruiser]].&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt;

A 2017 study used "Risk Terrain Modeling" analysis to identify spatial indicators of carjacking risk in Detroit. The analysis identified six factors that "were influential in the best fitting model: proximity to service stations; convenience/grocery/[[liquor store]]s; bus stops; residential and commercial demolitions; and areas with high concentrations of drug arrests and restaurants." The study found that certain locations in Detroit "had an expected rate of carjacking that was 278 times higher than other locations."&lt;ref&gt;Kim Michelle Lersch, [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235217302891 Risky places: An analysis of carjackings in Detroit], ''Journal of Criminal Justice'', Vol. 52 (September 2017), pp. 34-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

====State law====
Some states have a specific carjacking statute. Other states do not have a specific carjacking law, and prosecute carjackers under the general robbery statute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/print/cj/fslautotheftpptchart.pdf Auto Theft &amp; Carjacking State Statutes], National Conference of State Legislators (last accessed November 25, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of some states, such as [[Louisiana]], explicitly lists a killing in the course of defending oneself against forcible entry of an occupied motor vehicle as a [[justifiable homicide]].&lt;ref name="Cherbonneau"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://articles.latimes.com/1997/aug/14/news/mn-22319 Louisiana Drivers Given License to Kill] (August 14, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Michelle Gerlin, [http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=law_urbanlaw Louisiana's New "Kill the Carjacker" Statute: Self-Defense or Instant Injustice?], 55 Wash. U. J. Urb. &amp; Contemp. L. 10, (January 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Carjacking is an uncommon crime in Britain, making up about 1% of all vehicle thefts.&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"/&gt;

===Australia===
Australia does not specifically record the number of carjackings; such crimes are variously recorded as assault, robbery, motor vehicle theft, and some combination. However, a 2008 paper by the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]], analyzing police and insurance records, suggested that fewer than 300 carjackings occur annually in Australia (about 0.5% of all theft incidents in the country).&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"/&gt; The paper noted that the low incidence of carjacking compared to the United States is attributable to the low overall of firearm-related crime overall in Australia and  the fact that the "broader socioeconomic picture of Australian society is one of relative good health in terms of wealth distribution and social cohesion" providing little motivation for victimization that is "both personal and violent."&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"/&gt; The paper notes that although carjacking was rare, isolated hot spots do arise occasionally, and that since the late 1990s, "[Sydney]] has experienced a number of carjacking clusters ... each lasting around three to six months and occurring in different locations including the eastern suburbs, the inner city and the south-west."&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"/&gt;

In [[ontology]], the different kinds or ways of [[being]] are called '''categories of being'''; or simply '''categories'''. To investigate the categories of being is to determine the most fundamental and the broadest [[class (philosophy)|class]]es of entities.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} A distinction between such categories, in making the categories or applying them, is called an '''ontological distinction'''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Early development==
The process of abstraction required to discover the number and names of the categories has been undertaken by many philosophers since [[Aristotle]] and involves the careful inspection of each concept to ensure that there is no higher category or categories under which that concept could be subsumed. The [[Scholasticism|scholars]] of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries developed Aristotle's ideas, firstly, for example by [[Gilbert de la Porrée|Gilbert of Poitiers]], dividing Aristotle's ten categories into two sets, primary and secondary, according to whether they inhere in the subject or not:
*Primary categories: Substance, Relation, Quantity and Quality
*Secondary categories: Place, Time, Situation, Condition, Action, Passion&lt;ref&gt;Reese W.L. ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion'' (Harvester Press, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;
Secondly, following [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]’s likening of the classificatory hierarchy to a [[Porphyrian tree|tree]], they concluded that the major classes could be subdivided to form subclasses, for example, [[Substance theory|Substance]] could be divided into [[Genus]] and Species, and [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]] could be subdivided into [[Property (philosophy)|Property]] and Accident, depending on whether the property was necessary or contingent.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. cf Evangelou C. ''Aristotle’s Categories and Porphyry'' (E.J. Brill, Leiden, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative line of development was taken by [[Plotinus]] in the second century who by a process of abstraction reduced Aristotle’s list of ten categories to five: Substance, Relation, Quantity, Motion and Quality.&lt;ref&gt;Plotinus ''Enneads'' (tr. Mackenna S. &amp; Page B.S., The Medici Society, London, 1930) VI.3.3&lt;/ref&gt; Plotinus further suggested that the latter three categories of his list, namely Quantity, Motion and Quality correspond to three different kinds of relation and that these three categories could therefore be subsumed under the category of Relation.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. VI.3.21&lt;/ref&gt; This was to lead to the supposition that there were only two categories at the top of the hierarchical tree, namely Substance and Relation, and if relations only exist in the mind as many supposed, to the two highest categories, Mind and Matter, reflected most clearly in the dualism of [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;Descartes R. ''The Philosophical Works of Descartes'' (tr. Haldane E. &amp; Ross G., Dover, New York, 1911) Vol.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern development==
An alternative conclusion however began to be formulated in the eighteenth century by [[Immanuel Kant]] who realised that we can say nothing about [[Substance theory|Substance]] except through the relation of the subject to other things.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.3'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt; In the sentence "This is a house" the substantive subject "house" only gains meaning in relation to human use patterns or to other similar houses. The category of Substance disappears from [[Category (Kant)|Kant's tables]], and under the heading of Relation, Kant lists ''inter alia'' the three relationship types of Disjunction, Causality and Inherence.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.107,113&lt;/ref&gt; The three older concepts of Quantity, Motion and Quality, as [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] discovered, could be subsumed under these three broader headings in that [[Quantity]] relates to the subject through the relation of [[Logical disjunction|Disjunction]]; Motion relates to the subject through the relation of [[Causality]]; and [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]] relates to the subject through the relation of [[Inherence]].&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' pp.148-179&lt;/ref&gt; Sets of three continued to play an important part in the nineteenth century development of the categories, most notably in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel's]] extensive tabulation of categories,&lt;ref&gt;Stace W.T. ''The Philosophy of Hegel'' (Macmillan &amp; Co, London, 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Categories (Peirce)|C.S. Peirce's categories]] set out in his work on the logic of relations. One of Peirce's contributions was to call the three primary categories Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' pp.148-179&lt;/ref&gt; which both emphasises their general nature, and avoids the confusion of having the same name for both the category itself and for a concept within that category.

In a separate development, and building on the notion of primary and secondary categories introduced by the Scholastics, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] introduced the idea that secondary or "derivative" categories could be derived from the primary categories through the combination of one primary category with another.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.3'' p.116&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in the formation of three secondary categories: the first, "Community" was an example that Kant gave of such a derivative category; the second, "[[Linguistic modality|Modality]]", introduced by Kant, was a term which Hegel, in developing Kant's dialectical method, showed could also be seen as a derivative category;&lt;ref&gt;Hegel G.W.F. ''Logic'' (tr. Wallace W., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1975) pp.124ff&lt;/ref&gt; and the third, "Spirit" or "Will" were terms that [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.15''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer A. ''On the Four-Fold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason''  1813 (tr. Payne E., La Salle, Illinois, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; were developing separately for use in their own systems. [[Karl Jaspers]] in the twentieth century, in his development of existential categories, brought the three together, allowing for differences in terminology, as Substantiality, Communication and Will.&lt;ref&gt;Jaspers K. ''Philosophy'' 1932 (tr. Ashton E.B., University of Chicago Press, 1970) pp.117ff&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern of three primary and three secondary categories was used most notably in the nineteenth century by [[Peter Mark Roget]] to form the six headings of his [[Roget's Thesaurus|Thesaurus]] of English Words and Phrases. The headings used were the three objective categories of Abstract Relation, Space (including Motion) and Matter and the three subjective categories of Intellect, Feeling and Volition, and he found that under these six headings all the words of the English language, and hence any possible predicate, could be assembled.&lt;ref&gt;Roget P.M. ''Roget’s Thesaurus: The Everyman Edition'' 1952 (Pan Books, London, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century development==
In the twentieth century the primacy of the division between the subjective and the objective, or between mind and matter, was disputed by, among others, [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref&gt;Russell B. ''The Analysis of Mind'' (George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1921) pp.10,23&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gilbert Ryle]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryle G. ''The Concept of Mind''  (Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1949) pp.17ff&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy began to move away from the metaphysics of categorisation towards the linguistic problem of trying to differentiate between, and define, the words being used. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]’s conclusion was that there were no clear definitions which we can give to words and categories but only a "halo" or "corona"&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein L. ''Philosophical Investigations'' 1953 (tr. Anscombe G., Blackwell, Oxford, 1978) pp.14,181&lt;/ref&gt; of related meanings radiating around each term. Gilbert Ryle thought the problem could be seen in terms of dealing with "a galaxy of ideas" rather than a single idea, and suggested that [[category mistake]]s are made when a concept (e.g. "university"), understood as falling under one category (e.g. abstract idea), is used as though it falls under another (e.g. physical object).&lt;ref&gt;Ryle G. ''Collected Papers'' (Hutchinson, London, 1971) Vol.II: ''Philosophical Arguments'' 1945, pp.201,202&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the visual analogies being used, [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[Clarence Irving Lewis|Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.1'' pp.52,82,106&lt;/ref&gt; just like [[Plotinus]] earlier,&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.9'' VI.5.5&lt;/ref&gt; likened the terms of propositions to points, and the relations between the terms to lines. Peirce, taking this further, talked of univalent, bivalent and trivalent relations linking predicates to their subject and it is just the number and types of relation linking subject and predicate that determine the category into which a predicate might fall.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' Vol I pp.159,176&lt;/ref&gt; Primary categories contain concepts where there is one dominant kind of relation to the subject. Secondary categories contain concepts where there are two dominant kinds of relation. Examples of the latter were given by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] in his two propositions "the house is on the creek" where the two dominant relations are spatial location (Disjunction) and cultural association (Inherence), and "the house is eighteenth century" where the two relations are temporal location (Causality) and cultural quality (Inherence).&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.4'' pp.62,187&lt;/ref&gt; A third example may be inferred from Kant in the proposition "the house is impressive or [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]" where the two relations are spatial or mathematical disposition (Disjunction) and dynamic or motive power (Causality).&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. ''Critique of Judgement'' 1790 (tr. Meredith J.C., Clarendon Press, Oxford 1952) p.94ff&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.25'' pp.36,152&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the analogy of [[colour theory]] in order to illustrate the shades of meanings of words. Primary categories, like primary colours, are analytical representing the furthest we can go in terms of analysis and abstraction and include Quantity, Motion and Quality. Secondary categories, like secondary colours, are synthetic and include concepts such as Substance, Community and Spirit.

==Aristotle==
{{Main|Categories (Aristotle)}}
One of [[Aristotle]]’s early interests lay in the classification of the natural world, how for example the genus "animal" could be first divided into "two-footed animal" and then into "wingless, two-footed animal".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 1075a&lt;/ref&gt; He realised that the distinctions were being made according to the qualities the animal possesses, the quantity of its parts and the kind of motion that it exhibits. To fully complete the proposition "this animal is…" Aristotle stated in his work on the [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]] that there were ten kinds of predicate where...

"…each signifies either substance or quantity or quality or relation or where or when or being-in-a-position or having or acting or being acted upon".&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.2''&lt;/ref&gt;

He realised that predicates could be simple or complex. The simple kinds consist of a subject and a predicate linked together by the "categorical" or inherent type of relation. For Aristotle the more complex kinds were limited to propositions where the predicate is compounded of two of the above categories for example "this is a horse running". More complex kinds of proposition were only discovered after Aristotle by the Stoic, [[Chrysippus]],&lt;ref&gt;Long A. &amp; Sedley D. ''The Hellenistic Philosophers'' (Cambridge University Press, 1987) p.206&lt;/ref&gt; who developed the "hypothetical" and "disjunctive" types of [[syllogism]] and these were terms which were to be developed through the [[Scholasticism|Middle Ages]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter of Spain (''alias'' John XXI) ''Summulae Logicales''&lt;/ref&gt; and were to reappear in [[Category (Kant)|Kant's system of categories]].

''Category'' came into use with [[Aristotle]]'s essay ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'', in which he discussed univocal and [[equivocal]] terms, predication, and ten categories:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2412/2412-h/2412-h.htm Categories]'', translated by [[Ella Mary Edghill|E. M. Edghill]]. For the Greek terms, see ''[http://meta.montclair.edu/ancient/greek/aristotle_greek/ The Complete Works of Aristotle in Greek]'' (requires DjVu), Book 1 (''Organon''), ''Categories'' Section 4 (DjVu file's page 6).{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2412/2412-h/2412-h.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102084057/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2412/2412-h/2412-h.htm |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Affection (philosophy)|Affection]]''', passion (''paschein'', to suffer or undergo) – examples: to be lanced, to be heated, to be cooled

==Plotinus==
[[Plotinus]] in writing his ''[[Enneads]]'' around AD 250 recorded that "philosophy at a very early age investigated the number and character of the existents… some found ten, others less…. to some the genera were the first principles, to others only a generic classification of existents".&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.9'' VI.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; He realised that some categories were reducible to others saying "why are not Beauty, Goodness and the virtues, Knowledge and Intelligence included among the primary genera?"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' VI.2.17&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that such [[Transcendentals|transcendental categories]] and even the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories of Aristotle]] were in some way posterior to the three [[Eleatics|Eleatic]] categories first recorded in Plato's dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'' and which comprised the following three coupled terms: 
*Unity/Plurality
*Motion/Stability
*Identity/Difference&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Parmenides'' (tr. Jowett B., ''The Dialogues of Plato'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1875) p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] called these "the hearth of reality"&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.9'' Op.cit.1.4&lt;/ref&gt; deriving from them not only the three categories of Quantity, Motion and Quality but also what came to be known as "the three moments of the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic world process]]":
*First, there existed the "One", and his view that "the origin of things is a contemplation"
*The Second "is certainly an activity… a secondary phase… life streaming from life… energy running through the universe"
*The Third is some kind of Intelligence concerning which he wrote "Activity is prior to Intellection… and self knowledge"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' III.8.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotinus likened the three to the centre, the radii and the circumference of a circle, and clearly thought that the principles underlying the categories were the first principles of creation. "From a single root all being multiplies". Similar ideas were to be introduced into Early Christian thought by, for example, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] who summed it up saying "Therefore Unity, having from all eternity arrived by motion at duality, came to rest in [[trinity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson A.E. (ed.) ''Essays on the Trinity and the Incarnation'' (Longmans, London, 1928) pp.241-244&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kant==

In the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781), [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that the [[Category (Kant)|categories]] are part of our own mental structure and consist of a set of ''a priori'' concepts through which we interpret the world around us.&lt;ref&gt;	''Op.cit.3'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts correspond to twelve logical functions of the understanding which we use to make judgements and there are therefore two tables given in the ''Critique'', one of the Judgements and a corresponding one for the [[Category (Kant)|Categories]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.107,113&lt;/ref&gt; To give an example, the logical function behind our reasoning from ground to consequence (based on the [[Hypothetical syllogism|Hypothetical relation]]) underlies our understanding of the world in terms of cause and effect (the [[Causality|Causal relation]]). In each table the number twelve arises from, firstly, an initial division into two: the Mathematical and the Dynamical; a second division of each of these headings into a further two: Quantity and Quality, and Relation and Modality respectively; and, thirdly, each of these then divides into a further three subheadings as follows.

[[Critique of the Kantian philosophy|Criticism of Kant's system]] followed, firstly, by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who amongst other things was unhappy with the term "Community", and declared that the tables "do open violence to truth, treating it as nature was treated by old-fashioned gardeners",&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer A. ''The World as Will and Representation'' (tr. Payne A., Dover Publications, London, New York, 1966) p.430&lt;/ref&gt; and secondly, by [[Walter Terence Stace|W.T.Stace]] who in his book ''The Philosophy of Hegel'' suggested that in order to make Kant's structure completely symmetrical a third category would need to be added to the Mathematical and the Dynamical.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.15'' p.222&lt;/ref&gt; This, he said, Hegel was to do with his category of Notion.

==Hegel==
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]] in his ''[[Science of Logic]]'' (1812) attempted to provide a more comprehensive system of categories than Kant and developed a structure that was almost entirely triadic.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; So important were the categories to Hegel that he claimed "the first principle of the world, the Absolute, is a system of categories… the categories must be the reason of which the world is a consequent".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.63,65&lt;/ref&gt;

Using his own logical method of combination, later to be called the [[Dialectic|Hegelian dialectic]], of arguing from thesis through antithesis to synthesis, he arrived, as shown in W.T.Stace's work cited, at a hierarchy of some 270 categories. The three very highest categories were Logic, Nature and Spirit. The three highest categories of Logic, however, he called Being, Essence and Notion which he explained as follows:
*[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Being]] was differentiated from Nothing by containing with it the concept of the "Other", an initial internal division that can be compared with Kant's category of Disjunction. Stace called the category of Being the sphere of common sense containing concepts such as consciousness, sensation, quantity, quality and measure.
*[[Essence]]. The "Other" separates itself from the "One" by a kind of motion, reflected in Hegel's first synthesis of "[[Becoming (philosophy)|Becoming]]". For Stace this category represented the sphere of science containing within it firstly, the thing, its form and properties; secondly, cause, effect and reciprocity, and thirdly, the principles of classification, identity and difference. 
*[[Notion (philosophy)|Notion]]. Having passed over into the "Other" there is an almost [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic return]] into a higher unity that in embracing the "One" and the "Other" enables them to be considered together through their inherent qualities. This according to [[Walter Terence Stace|Stace]] is the sphere of philosophy proper where we find not only the three types of logical proposition: Disjunctive, Hypothetical and Categorical but also the three transcendental concepts of [[Transcendentals|Beauty, Goodness and Truth]].&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.18'' pp.124ff&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer's]] category that corresponded with Notion was that of Idea, which in his "''Four-Fold Root of Sufficient Reason''" he complemented with the category of the Will.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.20''&lt;/ref&gt; The title of his major work was "[[The World as Will and Representation|The World as Will and Idea]]". The two other complementary categories, reflecting one of Hegel's initial divisions, were those of Being and Becoming. At around the same time, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] was developing his colour theories in the ''[[Theory of Colours|Farbenlehre]]'' of 1810, and introduced similar principles of combination and complementation, symbolising, for Goethe, "the primordial relations which belong both to nature and vision".&lt;ref&gt;Goethe J.W. von, ''The Theory of Colours'' (tr. Eastlake C.L., MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1970) p.350&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] in his ''[[Science of Logic]]'' accordingly asks us to see his system not as a tree but as a circle.

==Peirce==

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who had read Kant and Hegel closely, and who also had some knowledge of Aristotle, proposed a system of merely three phenomenological categories: [[Categories (Peirce)|Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness]], which he repeatedly invoked in his subsequent writings. Like Hegel, C.S.Peirce attempted to develop a system of categories from a single indisputable principle, in Peirce's case the notion that in the first instance he could only be aware of his own ideas. 
	"It seems that the true categories of consciousness are first, feeling… second, a sense of resistance… and third, synthetic consciousness, or thought".&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' p.200, cf Locke&lt;/ref&gt;
	Elsewhere he called the three primary categories: [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]], Reaction and [[Meaning (semiotics)|Meaning]], and even [[Categories (Peirce)|Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness]], saying, "perhaps it is not right to call these categories conceptions, they are so intangible that they are rather tones or tints upon conceptions":&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' p.179&lt;/ref&gt;     
*Firstness ([[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]]): "The first is predominant in feeling… we must think of a quality without parts, e.g. the colour of magenta… When I say it is a quality I do not mean that it "inheres" in a subject… The whole content of consciousness is made up of qualities of feeling, as truly as the whole of space is made up of points, or the whole of time by instants".
*Secondness (Reaction): "This is present even in such a rudimentary fragment of experience as a simple feeling… an action and reaction between our soul and the stimulus… The idea of second is predominant in the ideas of causation and of statical force… the real is active; we acknowledge it by calling it the actual".
*Thirdness ([[Meaning (semiotics)|Meaning]]): "Thirdness is essentially of a general nature… ideas in which thirdness predominate [include] the idea of a sign or representation… Every genuine triadic relation involves meaning… the idea of meaning is irreducible to those of quality and reaction… synthetical consciousness is the consciousness of a third or medium".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.148-179&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Peirce's three categories correspond to the three concepts of relation given in Kant's tables, the sequence is now reversed and follows that given by [[Science of Logic|Hegel]], and indeed before Hegel of the three moments of the world-process given by [[Neoplatonism|Plotinus]]. Later, Peirce gave a mathematical reason for there being three categories in that although monadic, dyadic and triadic nodes are irreducible, every node of a higher valency is reducible to a "compound of triadic relations".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' p.176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who was developing "semiology" in France just as Peirce was developing "semiotics" in the US, likened each term of a proposition to "the centre of a constellation, the point where other coordinate terms, the sum of which is indefinite, converge".&lt;ref&gt;Saussure F. de,''Course in General Linguistics'' 1916 (tr. Harris R., Duckworth, London, 1983) p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Others==
[[Edmund Husserl]] (1962, 2000) wrote extensively about categorial systems as part of his [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

For [[Gilbert Ryle]] (1949), a category (in particular a "[[category mistake]]") is an important semantic concept, but one having only loose affinities to an ontological category.

Contemporary systems of categories have been proposed by [[John G. Bennett]] (The Dramatic Universe, 4 vols., 1956–65), [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (1974), [[Reinhardt Grossmann]] (1983, 1992), Johansson (1989), Hoffman and Rosenkrantz (1994), [[Roderick Chisholm]] (1996), [[Barry Smith (ontologist)]] (2003), and [[Jonathan Lowe]] (2006).

The term '''composition''' (from Latin ''com-'' "with" and ''ponere'' "to place"), in written language, refers to the body of important features established by the [[author]] in their creation of [[literature]]. Composition relates to [[narrative|narrative work]]s of literature, but also relates to essays, biographies, and other works established in the field of rhetoric.
&lt;!--- Write your article below this line ---&gt;

==In narratives==
In narratives (primarily [[fiction]]), composition includes, but is not limited to,

*[[Outline (summary)|Outline]], the organisations of thoughts and/or ideas which is used to determine organisational technique
*[[Plot (narrative)|Plot]], the course or arrangement of events
*[[Theme (literature)|Theme]], the unifying subject or idea
*[[Dialogue]], a reciprocal [[conversation]] between two or more persons
*[[Characterisation]], the process of creating [[Fictional character|characters]]
*[[setting (fiction)|Setting]], the time and location in which the composition takes place
*Description, [[definition]]s of things in the composition
*[[stylistics (linguistics)|Style]], specifically, the linguistic style of the composition
*Setting tone or [[Mood (literature)|mood]], conveying one or more emotions or feelings through words
*[[writer's voice|Voice]], the individual writing style of the [[author]]
*[[tone (literary)|Tone]], which encompasses the attitudes toward the subject and toward the audience

==In rhetoric==
In [[rhetoric]] (primarily [[non-fiction]]), composition is the arrangement and strategic use of written, oral, visual and/or digital  in order to inform, [[Persuasion|persuade]], or [[Motivation|motivate]] an audience in a given situation.

==Oral discourse==
Traditionally, oratory, or classical rhetoric, is composed of five stages, or canons:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Acceptance |editor-first=Patricia |editor-last=Bizzell |editor2-first=Bruce |editor2-last=Herzberg |title=The Rhetorical Tradition |edition=2nd |location=Boston |publisher=Bedford/St.Martin‘s |year=2001 |isbn=0-312-14839-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Invention, "the search of persuasive ways to present information and formulate arguments"
*Arrangement, "the organization of the parts of speech to ensure that all means of persuasion are present and properly disposed"
*Style, "the use of correct, appropriate, and striking language throughout the speech"
*Memory, "the use of mnemonics and practice of speech"
*Delivery, "the use of effective gestures and vocal modulation to present the speech"
Typically, in any speech classroom, these stages are still prevalent in the composing process. Other such qualities to be included, especially when considering ones' [[audience]] and methods of persuasion, would be the rhetorical appeals:
*[[Logos]], appeals to logic and reason, evidence and support
*[[Ethos]], appeals to ethics, the speaker's credibility, trustworthiness, and morals
*[[Pathos]], appeals to emotion, connecting with audience through shared feelings

==Written discourse==
As oral discourse shifted to more written discourse, the stage of memory and delivery began to fade, yet the first three stages hold its rank in the [[writing process]] of most composition classrooms. The rhetorical appeals also prove important in written texts, as the strategies of using these appeals become more complex as writers understand their audience's needs when not in physical view.

==Visual==
Composition, which includes the language of visuals is a recent development in composition studies. Sonja K. Foss argues that visuals are a valued component of rhetorical study, and to only focus on verbal discourse, limits the opportunity to engage in multiple symbols that create meaning and speak rhetorically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foss |first=Sonya |chapter=Framing the Study of Visual Rhetoric: Toward a Transformation of Rhetorical Theory |title=In Defining Visual Rhetorics |editor-first=Charles A. |editor-last=Hill |editor2-first=Marguerite |editor2-last=Helmers |location=Mahwah, New Jersey |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |year=2004 |pages=303–13 |isbn=0-8058-4402-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In thinking about how visuals are used to communicate, and how they are composed or analyzed in a rhetorical work, she argues that one considers the focus:
*Nature, the present elements/physical features and suggested elements/concepts and ideas
*Function, the action it communicates
*Evaluation, assessed rhetorically
Foss, who acknowledges [[visual rhetoric]], demonstrates that composition studies has to consider other definitions and incorporations of language.

==Digital==
This composition refers to work produced in digital spaces. The writer or speaker must not only consider all the composing processes of the above-mentioned discourse (like purpose, arrangement, etc.), but the relationship medium plays in the composing and decision process of that work. In digital discourse, the fifth canon of delivery takes on new meaning, and digital spaces change how traditional views of authority, circulation, and context are understood, like composing in a [[Wikipedia]]. Thus digital rhetoric, or [[eRhetoric]] offers new ways of composing.

[[File:Graffiti2i.PNG|thumb|400px|A digital illustration depicting a tree in autumn, drawn using [[Facebook]]'s "graffiti" app]]

'''Computer illustration''' or '''digital illustration''' is the use of digital tools to produce images under the direct manipulation of the artist, usually through a pointing device such as a [[graphics tablet|tablet]] or a [[computer mouse|mouse]]. It is distinguished from computer-''generated'' art, which is produced by a computer using mathematical models created by the artist. It is also distinct from digital manipulation of photographs, in that it is an original construction "from scratch". (Photographic elements may be incorporated into such works, but they are not necessarily the primary basis

==Pointing devices==
[[mouse (computing)|Mice]] are not very precise for drawing, so a [[Graphic_tablet|graphics tablet]] is an important tool for a digital illustrator, because it allows the user to make a mark easily in any direction, in a way that reflects the natural or "lively" line made by the human hand. In addition to flexibility of movement, an industry-standard digital drawing tablet has a pressure-sensitive surface, allowing the illustrator to make marks that vary from faint to bold, and from thin to broad. These variations mimic traditional wet and dry media. Drawing on a digital drawing tablet starts to feel natural after about a week of practice. A [[hybrid graphics tablet/screen]] might be helpful, since the artist can see more accurately where to place strokes in the image, but the hardware is currently much more expensive.

==Illustration software==
{{main|Graphic art software}}
[[File:First Daughter Inhales the Breath of the Citadel (detail).jpg|thumb|Example of an original bitmap (raster) painting in Photoshop. Note the fuzzy textures and transitions between colors that are typical of a painting program.]]  [[File:First Daughter Warns Juan in Orbit (detail).jpg|thumb|Example of an original vector drawing in Illustrator. Note the precise edges of shapes and even width of lines that are typical of a drawing program.]]
There are two main types of tools used for digital illustration: [[raster graphics|bitmap]]ped (also known as "raster") and [[vector graphics|vector]] applications. Bitmap applications are commonly called "painting" programs, while vector applications are called "drawing" programs. These terms reflect the difference in look-and-feel between the images created in each type of program.
With a [[List of raster graphics editors|bitmap application]], the content is stored digitally in fixed rows and columns of pixels, which can be created in separate layers for more easily isolating and manipulating different parts of the image. A bitmap image contains information about each pixel's hue (color), luminance (brightness), and saturation (intensity of color). When the pointing device moves over an area of the image, new colors and values are applied to the underlying pixels. Painting tools allow the easy creation of "fuzzy" imagery, including effects such as glows and soft shadows, and textures such as fur, velvet, stone and skin, and are heavily used in photo-retouching.

With [[List of vector graphics editors|vector-based tools]], the content is stored digitally as resolution-independent mathematical formulae describing lines (open paths), shapes (closed paths), and color fills, strokes or gradients. Vector paths are constructed of anchor points and path segments by using the pointing device to click and drag. Many vector graphics are readily available for download from online databases which can then be edited and incorporated into larger projects. Drawing tools typically create precise lines, shapes and patterns with well-defined edges and are superb for working with complex constructions such as maps and typography.
Digital illustrations may include both raster and vector graphics in the same work. A bitmap image file may be saved in a format which embeds a layer of vector information, and vector image file may include imported bitmap images.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2690">'''''Dira Betachtonim''''' ({{lang-he-n|דירה בתחתונים}}) is a concept in [[Chabad philosophy]] describing the process of manifesting the presence of God within the world. ''Dirah Batachtonim'' is discussed primarily by the fifth [[Chabad]] Rebbe, Rabbi [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]], in his ''[[Samech Vov]]'' series of Hasidic treatises. In the Samech Vov series, this idea is pronounced as the ultimate purpose of creation.&lt;ref name=66b&gt;Paltiel, Yosef Y. [http://www.insidechassidus.org/maamarim/27-samech-vav-earliest-paltiel-version-.html Samech Vav.] ''Inside Chassidus.'' insidechassidus.org. Accessed April 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the ''Dirah Betachtonim'' concept is the notion of sublimating the physical aspects of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Faitel. [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/294285/jewish/A-Synopsis-of-the-Dirah-Betachtonim-System.htm A Synopsis of the Dirah Betachtonim System]. ''Chabad.org''. Accessed April 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution==
The concept of a divine dwelling is attributed to a statement in ''[[Midrash Tanchuma]]'', an Talmudic book of homilies, “God had a desire to have a home in the lower world.”&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Simon. [http://www.meaningfullife.com/spiritual/mystics/The_Rebbe_Rashab.php Yom Tov Shel Rosh Hashanah - Tof Reish Samech Vov] Meaningful Life Center. Accessed April 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Tanchumah. Naso 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a theological system==
The concept of ''Dirah Betachtonim'' is the central focus of the book ''Heaven on Earth'' by Rabbi Faitel Levin. According to Levin, ''Dirah Betachtonim'' is not a solitary concept in Chabad philosophy, but represents a complete theological approach to the practice of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lubavitch.com/news/article/2014602/Exploring-the-Rebbes-Theology.html Exploring the Rebbe's Theology]. ''Lubavitch.com''. July 16, 2002. Accessed April 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons==
In Chabad philosophy, ''Dirah Betachtonim'' has been compared to the type of divine manifestation in the [[Atzilut|World of Atzilut]]. The divine presence in Atzilut is thought to be especially profound; ''Dirah Betachtonim'' is thought as the attempt to mimic that manifestation within the [[Assiah|World of Assiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Altein, Leibel.

A '''duplicate bridge movement''' is a scheme used in a [[duplicate bridge]] tournament to arrange which competitors play which opponents when, and which [[board (bridge)|boards]] they play. The arrangement has to satisfy a number of constraints which often conflict to some extent, and compromises may be required. The resolution of these compromises is to a considerable extent a matter of taste, and if possible the players should be consulted as to their preferences.

Movements are categorized by the type of event—Individual, Pairs, or Teams.

==Requirements for movements==
The requirements for the movement are as follows:

*The only really inflexible requirement is that no individual/pair/team plays the same boards more than once.
*The tournament should not be either too long or too short. A typical club session consists of around 24 boards, but a tournament for less experienced players may aim for rather fewer than this.
*No board should be required to be played at more than one table in the same round. Sometimes this rule is broken: the boards can be passed from one table to another during the course of a round.
*The movement should be as fair (or "balanced") as possible: in principle, this means that each pair should have an approximately equal opportunity to oppose each other pair, taking into account both "direct opponents" (who face one another at the same table) and "indirect opponents" (who play the same hands as each other at different times).
*For preference, the number of boards in each round should be as large as possible, since this reduces the number of rounds and saves some time.
*Subject to the other constraints, the movement should be as simple as possible, in order to minimise the possibility of errors occurring.
*In some countries it is usual for the boards to progress regularly, or as close as possible to regularly, from one table to the next lower numbered table. In other countries the boards are simply collected from a central table and this constraint does not apply.

It is important that once the movement is selected, it should be completed: uncompleted movements are likely to be unbalanced. Thus a movement should be selected which has a high probability of being completed.

==Two-winner and one-winner movements==

In two-winner movements, the NS pairs play the EW pairs, but never other NS pairs. There are thus two "fields" competing separately. If the average standard of the NS and EW pairs is different, this can give an unfair result.

In one-winner movements at certain points NS pairs play as EW and EW pairs play as NS, e.g. through an [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#arrowswitch|arrow switch]] (reversing the polarity of tables during some rounds). This creates a one-winner movement.

The number of rounds which are arrow switched affects the fairness of the result. Normally between one-eighth and one-quarter of the rounds are arrow switched. The English Bridge Union (EBU) recommends one eighth. So in a 7 or 8 round movement, you would arrow switch the last round.

==Pair movements==

There are two basic types of pair movements—Mitchell and Howell.&lt;ref name="acblhandbook"&gt;[http://web2.acbl.org/Handbook/handbook/ACBLHandbook.pdf ACBL Handbook, Chapter 4]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mitchell movements can be two-winner or one-winner. Howell and variants of Mitchell are one-winner.

===Mitchell movements===

In a standard Mitchell movement (also known as "straight Mitchell"), there are two separate groups of players—one group always sits North-South, and the other always sits East-West.  North-South players remain at the same table throughout all rounds of play.  After each round, boards move to the next lower numbered table (from table 1, boards go to the highest numbered table), and East-West pairs move to the next higher number table (at the highest numbered table, pairs move to table 1).  Pairs are typically identified by the direction they are sitting, coupled with the table number they start at.

This arrangement can be followed without modification when there is an odd number of tables, with no additional pairs left over (no half-tables).  Modifications to the straight Mitchell movement must be made whenever there  is an even number of tables, or a half-table.

A straight Mitchell movement requires that the number of rounds played R is equal to or less than the number of tables T. Hence, if there are 8 tables and time to play 24 boards, a maximum of 8 rounds can be played and there will be 3 boards per round.

If it is desired to play one or two rounds more than the number of tables, a Hesitation Mitchell or Double Hesitation Mitchell movement may be used if feasible.  Alternatively, a Howell type movement may be adopted.

====Even number of tables====

In a straight Mitchell with an even number of tables, after half of the rounds have been completed the East-West pairs will arrive at a table with boards that they have already played.  To avoid this problem, there are two basic options -- "Skip Mitchell" and "Bye-Stand Mitchell" (the latter is called a "Share and Relay Mitchell" in the UK).

=====Skip Mitchell=====

In a Skip Mitchell, after the number of rounds played equals the number of tables divided by 2, in moving for the next round the East-West pairs must "skip" a table.  The director must take care to announce the special movement when that round arrives, and North-South pairs should confirm that their new-arriving opponents did skip a table.  This choice is far simpler for the director to manage and is simpler to adjust if a late pair must be accommodated, but has the slight drawback that each East-West pair misses the chance to play one set of boards.  The Skip Mitchell requires that the number of tables is at least one greater than the number of rounds played, e.g. with 10 tables up to 9 rounds can be played, but with 8 tables the maximum is 7, otherwise EW pairs would encounter NS pairs more than once.

=====Bye-stand Mitchell or share and relay Mitchell=====

In a bye-stand Mitchell, there are two modifications needed to the basic table setup.  First, table 1 must be set up near the highest numbered table, because throughout the game, those two tables will share boards—after playing a board at one table it must be passed to the other to play.  Second, a "bye stand" or "relay table" must be set up halfway between the first and last tables—for example, in an eight-table movement, the bye stand must be set up between tables 4 and 5.  When moving boards after each round, boards at the table just above the bye stand go to the bye stand; the boards on the bye stand go to the table just below the bye stand.  In the eight-table example, boards go from table 5 to the bye stand, and from the bye stand to table 4.  This movement allows all pairs to play all boards, but the drawbacks are that the sharing of boards between two tables tends to slow down the movement, mistakes can be made with both the bye stand placement and the movement of boards to the bye stand, and late pairs are harder to accommodate.

=====Half tables=====

Adjustments to the straight Mitchell for half tables depend on whether the number of full tables is odd or even.

======Number of full tables is even======

In this case the adjustment is a "sit out".  This involves setting up the movement as if there were an odd number of tables and then running a straight Mitchell.  In an 8-1/2 table game, set up 9 tables with boards and assign North-South players to tables 1-8; East-West pairs are assigned to tables 1-9.  The movement proceeds exactly as in a straight Mitchell, when East-West pairs arrive at table 9 they simply do not play that round.

======Number of full tables is odd======

In this case the adjustment can be either 
* a sit out combined with Skip Mitchell
* sit out combined with Bye Stand Mitchell
* "North-South Bump"

The sit out with Skip Mitchell has the disadvantage that one East-West pair will skip the sit out table.  This is not a problem if the number of tables is greater than the number of rounds.

For a Bye Stand Mitchell, the East-West pair arriving at the highest numbered table (which normally shares boards with table 1) sits out. If desired and permitted, they may kibitz the deals at table 1 while they are sitting out. This is the best movement if the number of tables and rounds are equal, because it eliminates the share usually required.

For a North-South Bump, all but one pair are assigned to tables as in a straight Mitchell.  The remaining pair is a "Rover", that moves according to a schedule that differs depending on the number of full tables.  The Rover pair does not play the first round, at each subsequent round they move to a table according to their schedule and replace the North-South pair at that table for that round—the North-South pair at that table have been "bumped" and sit out that round.  If desired and permitted, the bumped pair can kibitz the table they have been bumped from.  Also, because the Rover pair does not play the first round, it can be a very good choice for handling a late-arriving pair.

=====Hesitation movements=====

In a Hesitation Mitchell, the EW pair arriving at the highest numbered table rotate to sit NS at that table on the next round, and then move to Table 1. With an odd number of tables, this allows one more round to be played than the number of tables. For example, with 24 boards and seven tables, eight rounds can be played.  A bye stand table will also be needed opposite the hesitation table; in this case between tables 3 and 4.

In a Double Hesitation Mitchell, there are two points where EW move to NS, though not normally at directly rotating tables. With an even number of tables, this allows two more rounds to be played than the number of tables. For example, with 24 boards and 6 tables, eight rounds can be played.  Two bye stand tables will also be needed.  The position of the rotations and bye stand tables must be chosen precisely, otherwise a conflict will arise, so table cards are needed.

===Howell movements===

In a [[Edwin C Howell (whist and bridge player)|Howell]] movement, pairs move according to a schedule that varies depending on the number of tables.  Pairs are identified by a pair number that identifies the position they sit for the first round.  Traditionally, the highest numbered pair sits North-South at table 1 and does not move from that position; the other pairs move from table to table, sometimes sitting North-South and sometimes East-West.  In moving according to the schedule, each pair will arrive at table 1 and sit East-West in the round corresponding to their pair number.  Directions are placed on each table telling each player what table and position they move to for the next round.

The Howell movement is better suited for smaller numbers of tables—as the number of tables grows, the number of rounds that must be played to have every pair play at every position becomes too large. For T tables, there will be (2T-1) rounds, e.g. 7 rounds for 4 tables, but 13 rounds for 7 tables. For larger games where a Howell-type movement is desired, "3/4 Howell" or "Part Howell" movements exist that provide balanced comparisons, accomplished in part by having in addition to the stationary pair at table one, pairs that remain at some higher numbered tables, but who may sit North-South in some rounds and East-West in others.

===Suggested pair movements===

Some suggestions for movements of from 3 up to 7 tables are as follows:

====Three tables====

*28 boards: Mitchell movement, 4 boards per round.

==Web movements==

Web movements are a modern improvement over the standard Mitchell in some circumstances. The main advantage of Web movements is they can allow large single sections with a fixed number of boards.&lt;ref name="ebunewsletter8_4"&gt;[http://www.ebu.co.uk/newsletters/?id=8&amp;page=4 English Bridge Union newsletter, Spring 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Each pair plays the same set of boards, which increases the overall fairness of the competition. Web movements can require additional sets of boards, which is facilitated by automatic dealing machines (now common in larger clubs).

==Individual movements==

There are two basic types of Individual movements—Shomate and Rainbow.  Shomate movements are similar in concept to Howell movements for pairs—for smaller numbers of tables, a single individual is stationary and all other players move from place to place, sitting at different tables/positions each round.  Rainbow movements are similar in concept to Mitchell movements.  A key difference for Rainbow movements is that they require the number of tables to be a prime number, and there must be at least 5 tables.  In a Rainbow movement, North players remain stationary throughout the game.  All other players move after each round.  Typically, boards move to the next lower table; South players move to the next higher table; East players move to the 2nd next higher tables (for example, moving from table 1 to table 3); and West players move to the 2nd lower table (for example, moving from table 3 to 1).  It is common for the player moving two tables lower to carry boards to the next lower table on the way to their next seat.  In a rainbow movement, if it is desired to increase the number of players a person has played with and against, this can be accomplished by having players at each table change positions at the same table within a round.  For example, if the movement calls for two boards per round, after playing one board, the South and West players at each table could exchange seats for the 2nd board.  If this is done, the players must remember to move back to their original position when moving at the end of the round.  In a movement with 3 boards per round, East, South, and West can move clockwise after each board (skipping the North seat).

==Team movements==

Teams movements are different from pairs movements as they have an extra requirement; not only do teams need to play all or most of the other teams and not play the same boards twice, each pair also has to play the same boards as their other pair against the same team, but in different rounds (this requirement can be avoided by using multiple copies of computer dealt boards).

The most common team movement, known as the American Whist League (AWL) movement, is again similar to the Mitchell movement, and requires an odd number of teams.  Each team starts sitting together at its home table.  For the first round, each team prepares the boards on its home table, and then its E-W pair moves down two tables and carries the boards with them, dropping them off at the first lower numbered table (for example, team 3's E-W pair would carry boards from table 3 to table 2, and then go sit at table 1).  This movement of boards one lower, E-W two lower, continues every round; when the E-W pairs arrive back at their home tables the movement is complete.

For an even number of tables, things become more difficult. A simple solution is to use an American Whist movement with an even number of rounds but with one or more teams not playing each other, which is not ideal. One or two of the moves between rounds will be different, to avoid board/team conflicts.  There are alternative movements which are better balanced but more complex, see EBU Movements Manual.

==Other forms of team competition==

Because the AWL movement is a round-robin movement (each team plays a match against all other teams), when the number of teams is large the number of boards per match must be small.  When this is not desirable, some other form of arranging competitors to play must be used.  The most common are Knockouts and Swiss.  In both of these, teams play head-to-head matches of a convenient number of boards in each round.  In Knockouts, match winners advance to the next round; the losers are eliminated from the event.  In Swiss, after each round, the tournament director examines the record of each team and assigns pairs of teams with similar records, but that have not played against each other, to oppose each other in the next round.  In either form, if there is an odd number of teams, one or more round-robins involving 3 teams must be used.  In knockouts, if a round robin is used, the number of boards in each match must be half the number used in the head-to-head matches (a "half-match"), to allow all competitors to finish a round in approximately the same amount of time.  In Swiss, it is possible to use either the half-match technique (in which case the subsequent pairings need to give less weight to the half-match results), or, to have the teams involved play the full number of boards, in which case the results will not be known until the other competitors have completed two matches.  This means that the number of rounds must be even.  Also, because the teams involved will not have results to compare for future pairings for two rounds, in the later rounds it is desirable to avoid assigning the leading teams to the round robin.

'''Energy technology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[engineering]] [[science]] having to do with the efficient, safe, [[environmentally friendly]] and economical extraction, conversion, transportation, storage and use of [[energy]], targeted towards yielding high efficiency whilst skirting [[adverse effect|side effects]] on humans, nature and the environment.

For people, energy is an overwhelming need and as a scarce [[resource]] it has been an underlying cause of political conflicts and wars. The gathering and use of energy resources can be harmful to local ecosystems and may have global outcomes.

==Interdisciplinary fields==
As an interdisciplinary science Energy technology is linked with many interdisciplinary fields in sundry, overlapping ways.

==Electrical engineering==
[[Image:Qatar, power lines (6).jpg|thumb|High-voltage lines for the long distance transportation of electrical energy]]

[[Electric power engineering]] deals with the production and use of [[electrical energy]], which can entail the study of machines such as [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[electric motor]]s and [[transformer]]s. [[Infrastructure]] involves [[Electrical substation|substations]] and [[transformer station]]s, [[power line]]s and [[Power cable|electrical cable]]. [[Load management]] and [[power management]] over networks have meaningful sway on overall energy efficiency. [[Electric heating]] is also widely used and researched.

==Thermodynamics==
{{Main article|Thermodynamics}}

[[Thermodynamics]] deals with the fundamental laws of energy conversion and is drawn from theoretical [[Physics]].

==Thermal and chemical energy==
[[Image:Wood-fired grate stoker.jpg|thumb|left|A [[wikt:grate|grate]] for a wood fire]]
Thermal and chemical energy are intertwined with [[chemistry]] and [[environmental studies]]. [[Combustion]] has to do with [[Gas burner|burner]]s and chemical [[engine]]s of all kinds, grates and [[incinerator]]s along with their energy efficiency, [[pollution]] and operational safety.

[[Exhaust gas]] purification technology aims to lessen [[air pollution]] through sundry mechanical, thermal and chemical cleaning methods. [[Emission control (disambiguation)|Emission control]] technology is a field of [[process engineering|process]] and [[chemical engineering]]. [[Boiler]] technology deals with the design, construction and operation of [[steam]] boilers and [[steam turbine|turbine]]s (also used in nuclear power generation, see below), drawn from [[applied mechanics]] and [[materials engineering]].

[[Energy conversion]] has to do with internal combustion engines, turbines, pumps, fans and so on, which are used for transportation, mechanical energy and power generation. High thermal and mechanical loads bring about operational safety worries which are dealt with through many branches of applied engineering science.

==Nuclear energy==
[[Image:Turbogenerator01.jpg|thumb|A [[steam turbine]].]]
[[Nuclear technology]] deals with [[nuclear power]] production from [[nuclear reactor]]s, along with the processing of nuclear fuel and disposal of radioactive waste, drawing from applied [[nuclear physics]], [[nuclear chemistry]] and [[radiation]] science.

Nuclear power generation has been politically controversial in many countries for several decades but the electrical energy produced through [[nuclear fission]] is of worldwide importance. There are high hopes that [[Fusion power|fusion]] technologies will one day replace most fission reactors but this is still a research area of [[nuclear physics]].

==Renewable energy==
{{Main article|Renewable energy}}
[[Image:Nellis AFB Solar panels.jpg|thumb|Solar ([[photovoltaic]]) panels at a military base in the US.]]
[[Renewable energy]] has many branches.

===Solar power===
{{Main article|Solar power}}

* [[Photovoltaic]] power draws electricity from solar radiation through [[solar cells]], either locally or in large photovoltaic power plants and uses [[semiconductor]] technology.
* [[Solar heating]] uses [[solar panel]]s which gather heat from sunlight to heat buildings and water.
* [[Solar thermal power]] produces electricity by converting solar heat.

===Wind power===
[[Image:WindMills.jpg|right|thumb|[[Wind turbine]]s on [[Inner Mongolia]]n grassland]]
{{Main article|Wind power}}

[[Wind turbine]]s draw energy from atmospheric currents and are designed using [[aerodynamics]] along with knowledge taken from mechanical and electrical engineering.

===Geothermal===
{{Main article|Geothermal}}

Where it can be had, [[geothermal]] energy is used for heating and electricity.

===Hydropower===
[[Image:Walchenseewerk Pelton 120.jpg|thumb|Building of [[Pelton turbine|Pelton water turbine]]s in [[Germany]].]]
{{Main article|Hydropower}}

Hydropower draws mechanical energy from rivers, [[wave power plant|ocean waves]] and [[tidal power|tides]]. [[Civil engineering]] is used to study and build [[dam]]s, [[tunnel]]s, [[waterways]] and manage coastal resources through [[hydrology]] and [[geology]]. A low speed [[water turbine]] spun by flowing water can power an [[electrical generator]] to produce electricity.

===Bioenergy===
{{Main article|Bioenergy}}
Bioenergy deals with the gathering, processing and use of biomasses grown in biological manufacturing, [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] from which [[power plant]]s can draw burning fuel. [[Ethanol]], [[methanol]] (both controversial) or hydrogen for [[fuel cells]] can be had from these technologies and used to generate electricity.

===Enabling technologies===

[[Heat pumps]] and [[Thermal energy storage]] are classes of technologies that can enable the utilization of renewable energy sources that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or [[waste heat]] from a process).

Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal]], and can involve storage of [[Sensible heat|sensible energy]] (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or [[latent energy]] (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hyropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative.

In [[mathematics]], specifically [[category theory]], an '''essential monomorphism''' is a [[monomorphism]] ''f'' in a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'' such that for a morphism ''g'' in ''C'', &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; is a monomorphism only when ''g'' is a monomorphism. Essential monomorphisms in a [[category of modules]] are those whose image is an [[essential submodule]] of the [[codomain]]. An injective hull of an object ''X'' is an essential monomorphism from ''X'' to an [[injective object]].

In [[particle physics]], a '''fermion''' is a particle that follows [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]. These particles obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Fermions include all [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s, as well as all [[composite particle]]s made of an [[even and odd|odd number]] of these, such as all [[baryon]]s and many [[atom]]s and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. Fermions differ from [[boson]]s, which obey [[Bose–Einstein statistics]].

A fermion can be an [[elementary particle]], such as the [[electron]], or it can be a [[composite particle]], such as the [[proton]]. According to the [[spin-statistics theorem]] in any reasonable [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[quantum field theory]], particles with [[integer]] [[spin (physics)|spin]] are [[boson]]s, while particles with [[half-integer]] spin are fermions.

In addition to the spin characteristic, fermions have another specific property: they possess conserved baryon or lepton quantum numbers. Therefore, what is usually referred to as the spin statistics relation is in fact a spin statistics-quantum number relation.&lt;ref&gt;Physical Review D volume 87, page 0550003, year 2013, author Weiner, Richard M., title "Spin-statistics-quantum number connection and supersymmetry"  arxiv:1302.0969&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, only one fermion can occupy a particular [[quantum state]] at any given time. If multiple fermions have the same spatial probability distribution, then at least one property of each fermion, such as its spin, must be different. Fermions are usually associated with [[matter]], whereas bosons are generally [[force carrier]] particles, although in the current state of particle physics the distinction between the two concepts is unclear.  [[Weak interaction|Weakly interacting]] fermions can also display bosonic behavior under extreme conditions.  At low temperature fermions show [[superfluidity]] for uncharged particles and [[superconductivity]] for charged particles.

Composite fermions, such as protons and [[neutron]]s, are the key building blocks of [[baryonic matter|everyday matter]].

The name fermion was coined by English theoretical physicist [[Paul Dirac]] from the surname of Italian physicist [[Enrico Fermi]].&lt;ref&gt;Notes on Dirac's lecture ''Developments in Atomic Theory'' at Le Palais de la Découverte, 6 December 1945, UKNATARCHI Dirac Papers BW83/2/257889. See note 64 on page 331 in "The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Mystic of the Atom" by Graham Farmelo&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elementary fermions==

The [[Standard Model]] recognizes two types of elementary fermions: [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s. In all, the model distinguishes 24 different fermions. There are six quarks ([[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], [[strange quark|strange]], [[charm quark|charm]], [[bottom quark|bottom]] and [[top quark|top]] quarks), and six leptons ([[electron]], [[electron neutrino]], [[muon]], [[muon neutrino]], [[Tau (particle)|tau particle]] and [[tau neutrino]]), along with the corresponding [[antiparticle]] of each of these.

Mathematically, fermions come in three types:
* [[Weyl fermion]]s (massless),
* [[Dirac fermion]]s (massive), and
* [[Majorana fermion]]s (each its own antiparticle).
Most Standard Model fermions are believed to be Dirac fermions, although it is unknown at this time whether the [[neutrino]]s are Dirac or Majorana fermions (or both). Dirac fermions can be treated as a combination of two Weyl fermions.&lt;ref name="MoriiLim2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=T. Morii|author2=C. S. Lim|author3=S. N. Mukherjee|title=The Physics of the Standard Model and Beyond|date=1 January 2004|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|isbn=978-981-279-560-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|106}}  In July 2015, Weyl fermions have been experimentally realized in [[Weyl semimetal]]s.

==Composite fermions==
{{see also|List of particles#Composite particles}}

Composite particles (such as [[hadron]]s, nuclei, and atoms) can be bosons or fermions depending on their constituents. More precisely, because of the relation between spin and statistics, a particle containing an odd number of fermions is itself a fermion. It will have half-integer spin.

Examples include the following:
*A baryon, such as the proton or neutron, contains three fermionic quarks and thus it is a fermion.
*The nucleus of a [[carbon-13]] atom contains six protons and seven neutrons and is therefore a fermion.
*The atom [[helium-3]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He) is made of two protons, one neutron, and two electrons, and therefore it is a fermion.

The number of bosons within a composite particle made up of simple particles bound with a potential has no effect on whether it is a boson or a fermion.

Fermionic or bosonic behavior of a composite particle (or system) is only seen at large (compared to size of the system) distances. At proximity, where spatial structure begins to be important, a composite particle (or system) behaves according to its constituent makeup.

Fermions can exhibit bosonic behavior when they become loosely bound in pairs. This is the origin of superconductivity and the [[superfluid]]ity of helium-3: in superconducting materials, electrons interact through the exchange of [[phonon]]s, forming [[Cooper pair]]s, while in helium-3, Cooper pairs are formed via spin fluctuations.

The quasiparticles of the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] are also known as [[composite fermions]], which are electrons with an even number of quantized vortices attached to them.

===Skyrmions===
{{Standard model of particle physics|cTopic=[[Elementary particle]]s}}
{{main|Skyrmion}}

In a quantum field theory, there can be field configurations of bosons which are topologically twisted. These are coherent states (or [[soliton]]s) which behave like a particle, and they can be fermionic even if all the constituent particles are bosons. This was discovered by [[Tony Skyrme]] in the early 1960s, so fermions made of bosons are named [[skyrmion]]s after him.

Skyrme's original example involved fields which take values on a three-dimensional sphere, the original [[nonlinear sigma model]] which describes the large distance behavior of [[pion]]s. In Skyrme's model, reproduced in the [[1/N expansion|large N]] or [[AdS/QCD|string]] approximation to [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD), the proton and neutron are fermionic [[topological soliton]]s of the pion field.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Whereas Skyrme's example involved pion physics, there is a much more familiar example in quantum electrodynamics with a [[magnetic monopole]]. A bosonic monopole with the [[Dirac quantization condition|smallest possible magnetic charge]] and a bosonic version of the electron will form a fermionic [[dyon]].

The analogy between the Skyrme field and the Higgs field of the electroweak sector has been used&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author-link=Richard M. Weiner|first= Richard M.| last=Weiner|title= The Mysteries of Fermions|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|volume= 49 |date=2010|pages=1174–1180|doi=10.1007/s10773-010-0292-7|issue=5|bibcode = 2010IJTP...49.1174W |arxiv = 0901.3816 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to postulate that all fermions are skyrmions. This could explain why all known fermions have baryon or lepton quantum numbers and provide a physical mechanism for the Pauli exclusion principle.

'''First-year composition''' (sometimes known as '''freshman composition''' or '''freshman writing''') is an introductory core curriculum [[writing]] course in  American colleges.  This course focuses on improving students' abilities to write in a university setting and introduces students to writing practices in the disciplines and professions.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, John. "[http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2012/03/16/essay-value-first-year-writing-courses| Essay on the Value of First-year Writing Courses]." ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]''. March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These courses are traditionally required of incoming students, thus the previous name, "Freshman Composition". Scholars working within the field of Composition-Rhetoric often have teaching First-year composition (FYC) courses  as the practical focus of their scholarly work. 

FYC courses are structured in a variety of ways.  Some institutions of higher education require only one term of FYC, while others require two or three courses. There are a number of identifiable [[Pedagogy|pedagogies]] associated with FYC, including: [[formalist theory in composition studies|current-traditional]], [[theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy|expressivist]], [[Cognitive rhetoric|social-epistemic]], [[Process theory of composition|process]], post-process and [[Writing about Writing]] (WAW). Each of these [[pedagogy|pedagogies]] can generate a multitude of curricula. 

Composition professionals, including those with degrees in Writing Studies and [[Rhetoric]] and [[Composition Studies|Composition]], often focus on a rhetorical approach to help students learn how to apply an understanding of [[audience]], purpose, [[Context (language use)|context]], invention, and [[Stylistics (literature)|style]] to their writing processes. This rhetorical approach has shown that real writing, rather than existing as isolated modes, has more to do with a writer choosing from among many approaches to perform rhetorical tasks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In addition to a focus on rhetoric, many first year composition courses also emphasize writing process, where students are encouraged to interact with classmates and receive feedback to be used for [[revision (writing) | revision]].  These practices can take the form of essay [[peer review]] or workshopping. [[Electronic Portfolio|Portfolios]] are a common way of assessing revised student work.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncte.org/cccc/resources/positions/electronicportfolios| Principles and Practices in Electronic Portfolios]." Conference on College Composition and Communication, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Since the late nineteenth century, college courses on composition have become increasingly common in American higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Sharon. ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays''. Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a longstanding course offering at many colleges, first-year composition remains controversial and marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Susan. ''Textual Carnivals: The Politics of Composition.'' Carbondale and Edwardsville, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook, Sue Ellen. "Women's Work: The Feminizing of Composition." ''Rhetoric Review'' 9(2) 1991: 201-229. &lt;/ref&gt;

===First-year requirement debate===

The requirement for a first-year composition course has been debated in [[composition studies]]. This debate centers around how effective the first-year composition course is and the changes that need to be made to develop the field of composition. While most schools do require some form of the first-year composition course, there are some schools that have decided to abolish the first-year composition requirement. Some scholars, such as Sharon Crowley in ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays,'' argue that this requirement should be abolished. Crowley does not suggest the course itself be removed, only the requirement that all freshmen take the course. She states that students would still be interested in the course if the requirement was abolished and that removing the requirement would strengthen the field of composition. She implies that composition studies is marginalized within the university because of the view of the first-year composition course as a skill course. Removing the requirement, she states, would remove the association of composition studies with introductory courses, giving more acknowledgement to the field. &lt;ref&gt; Crowley, Sharon. ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1998. pg 241-43. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; Crowley's opinion initiated a debate in the composition field, but she is not the only critic who advocates for the removal of this requirement. Scholars Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle also dislike the requirement and instead argue for a writing studies curriculum. &lt;ref&gt; Downs, Douglas and Elizabeth Wardle. ''Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions: (Re)Envisioning 'First-Year Composition' as 'Introduction to Writing Studies'''. College Composition and Communication. 58.4 (2007) 552-584. Web. &lt;/ref&gt; However, there are scholars who do not agree with this stance, argue that the first-year composition course is needed in the university, and believe that the requirement should remain. Scholar David Smit is one critic who favors keeping the requirement. He suggests that the requirement can be kept and the curriculum and structure of the first-year composition course altered for improvement. Smit explains that many of the developmental goals of those who favor abolishing the requirement can still be achieved by offering more writing experiences. He proposes more genre writing in composition courses with a "[[scaffolding]]" progression of discipline writing. If this was done, he suggests, the concerns over the status of composition studies in the university would still be solved, as the course would no longer be seen as skills based. &lt;ref&gt; Smit, David. ''The End of Composition Studies''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2004. pg 183-85. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; There has been no consensus reached in composition studies regarding the status of the first-year composition course requirement. The benefits of the course, as well as the drawbacks, continue to be debated and the scholars noted above are only a few of the voices and perspectives involved in this discussion. Despite the debate about the requirement, it remains in effect at a majority of universities{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

==Structure of contemporary first-year composition==

First-year composition is designed to meet the goals for successful completion set forth by the [http://wpacouncil.org/positions/outcomes.html/ Council of Writing Program Administrators]. To reach these goals, students must learn rhetorical conventions, [[critical thinking]] skills, [[information literacy]], and the process of writing an academic paper. While there is no American standard curriculum for first-year composition, curriculum is developed at several levels, including the state, institution, department, and [[Writing center|writing program]].

=== First-year composition and rhetoric ===

With the publication of James Kinneavy's ''Theory of Discourse'' in 1971, English departments began incorporating [[rhetoric]] into their composition classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Irene. ''Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing.'' Mahweh, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2003. p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing this, composition instructors have placed more emphasis on teaching [[audience analysis]], [[Aristotle]]'s three appeals ([[ethos]], [[pathos]], and [[logos]]), and teaching Kinneavy's modes of discourse.
According to Brian Sutton in "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper," since 1980, there has been an increasing debate in academic circles as to whether the "generic" approach to writing in first year composition is useful for students whose future writing will be discipline specific (46).&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Brian. "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper." ''Language and Learning Across the Disciplines'' 2.1 (1997) 46–57. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic writing===

First described by [[Mina P. Shaughnessy|Mina Shaughnessy]] in the 1970s, [[Basic writing]] is a division of composition studies that strives to bring disadvantaged students entering college to a more complete understanding of the rhetorical aspects of the writing process.&lt;ref&gt;Otte, George, and Rebecca Mlynarczyk.

'''Gender feminism''' is a [[Feminist movements and ideologies|subdivision of feminism]] based on the view that the [[Social construction of gender|gender differences are social constructs]] perpetrated by men in order to maintain dominance over women.&lt;ref name="Oxford_dict"&gt;{{cite web | title = Gender feminism (definition) | url = https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gender_feminism | publisher = Oxford Dictionaries }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoff_Sommers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pinker 2003"/&gt;

== History ==

Prior to the usage of the term ''gender feminism'' [[Gayle Rubin]]'s essay ''[[Gayle Rubin#"The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex"|The Traffic in Women: Notes on the "Political Economy" of Sex]]'' (1975) was published. In it she devised the phrase "sex/gender system", defining it as "the set of arrangements by which a society transforms biological sexuality into products of human activity, and in which these transformed sexual needs are satisfied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rubin | first = Gayle | author-link = Gayle Rubin | chapter = The traffic in women: notes on the ‘political economy’ of sex | chapter-url = http://www.umsl.edu/~gradyf/theory/sexgender.htm | editor-last = Reiter | editor-first = Rayna R. | editor-link = Rayna Rapp | title = Toward an anthropology of women | page = 159 | publisher = Aakar Books | location = Delhi | year = 2011 | orig-year = 1975 | isbn = 9789350021620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year [[Sandra Lee Bartky]], founding member of the [[Society for Women in Philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Roberts | first = Sam | title = Sandra Lee Bartky, at the vanguard of feminist philosophy, dies at 81 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/24/us/sandra-lee-bartky-dead.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 23 October 2016 | access-date = 29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the essay, ''Toward a Phenomenology of Feminist Consciousness'',&lt;ref name=Bartky_Phenomenology&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bartky | first = Sandra Lee | author-link = Sandra Bartky | title = Toward a phenomenology of feminist consciousness | journal = [[Social Theory and Practice]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 425&amp;ndash;439 | date = Fall 1975 | jstor = 23557163 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

As long as their situation is apprehended as natural, inevitable, and inescapable, women's consciousness of themselves, no matter how alive to insult and inferiority, is not yet feminist consciousness... The very meaning of what the feminist apprehends is illuminated by the light of what ought to be."&lt;ref name="Bartky_Phenomenology" /&gt;

In 1983 the philosopher [[Alison Jaggar]] wrote of the need for a new name for the direction that [[socialist feminism]] was taking. "Socialist feminism," she said, "has indicated a new domain for political economy; it has identified the questions that feminist political theory must ask, and it has shown the sorts of answers that are acceptable. However, socialist feminism has not yet provided the answers, in part because of continuing uncertainty about how the redefined domain of political economy should be conceptualized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaggar | first = Alison M. | author-link = Alison Jaggar | chapter = Socialist feminism and human nature | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xVI6ZYDkDSYC&amp;pg=PA155 | title = Feminist politics and human nature | page = 155 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Allanheld | location = Totowa, N.J | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780847672547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s the philosopher [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] criticized the attempt to increase the amount of [[feminist philosophy]] being taught making reference to what she called ''academic feminism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sommers | first = Christina |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers | title = Should the academy support academic feminism? | journal = [[Public Affairs Quarterly]] | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 97&amp;ndash;120 | date = July 1988 | jstor = 40435687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sommers | first = Christina |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers | title = Feminist philosophers are oddly unsympathetic to the women they claim to represent | journal = [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date = 11 October 1989 | url = https://www.chronicle.com/article/Feminist-Philosophers-Are/66921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''gender feminism'' was first used by ''[[New York Magazine|The New York Magazine]]'' in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Oxford_dict" /&gt; In 1994 Sommers used the term to criticize Rubin, Bartky, Jaggar and other feminists in her book, ''[[Who Stole Feminism?|Who Stole Feminism?

{{Quote|text=American feminism is currently dominated by a group of women who seek to persuade the public that American women are not the free creatures we think we are&amp;nbsp;... The feminists who hold this divisive view of our social and political reality believe we are in a gender war, and they are eager to disseminate stories of atrocity that are designed to alert women to their plight. The "gender feminists" (as I shall call them) believe that all our institutions, from the state to the family to the grade schools, perpetuate male dominance. Believing that women are virtually under siege, gender feminists naturally seek recruits to their side of the gender war. They seek support. They seek vindication. They seek ammunition.  |author=Christina Hoff Sommers |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers  |source=''[[Who Stole Feminism?]]'' (1994)&lt;ref name="Hoff_Sommers_P" /&gt;}}

Retrospectively Jaggar stated that prior to the publication of ''Who Stole Feminism?'', "Sommers was establishing her reputation as a defender of so-called traditional family values against those whom she called radical "gender feminists," a term she invented [in her book] to refer to any feminist who had moved beyond the ideas of nineteenth-century philosopher, [[John Stuart Mill]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaggar | first = Alison M. | author-link = Alison Jaggar | chapter = Whose politics?

Subsequent use of the term in the early 1990s by other theorists referencing Sommers work expanded its usage as a [[pejorative]] term.&lt;ref name=Sep92 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Oct92 /&gt;

== Characterization ==
{{See also|Social construction of gender}}
Gender feminism has been described as asserting that psychological differences between the sexes have little or nothing to do with evolution, but instead are largely or solely socially constructed.&lt;ref name="pinker 2003b"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pinker | first = Steven | chapter = The official theory | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G3_UAeo8Dh0C&amp;pg=PT29 | title = The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature | page = 6 | publisher = Penguin | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780140276053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoff_Sommers_P" /&gt;&lt;!-- According to Kuhle 2012 --&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhle 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kuhle | first = Barry X. | title = Evolutionary psychology is compatible with equity feminism, but not with gender feminism: A reply to Eagly and Wood | journal = [[Evolutionary Psychology (journal)|Evolutionary Psychology]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 39&amp;ndash;43 | doi = 10.1177/147470491201000104 | pmid = 22833845| date = January 2012 | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120116120314/http://www.epjournal.net/articles/evolutionary-psychology-is-compatible-with-equity-feminism-but-not-with-gender-feminism-a-reply-to-eagly-and-wood-2011/}}

=== Supporters of gender feminism ===

==== Nussbaum ====
Philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] puts forward a set of questions are raised when considering the future of feminism in America:
# What do American women have to complain of?
# Has the thought of radical feminists made a positive contribution to social justice and to the well-being of American women?
# Does the common feminist claim that many women's preferences and desires are distorted by a legacy of injustice pose a threat to democracy?&lt;ref name="Nussbaum_1999"&gt;{{cite book | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | chapter = American women: preferences, feminism, democracy | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7zoaKIolT9oC&amp;pg=PA131 | title = Sex and Social Justice | pages = 131&amp;ndash;133 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780195355017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}}

Comparing the advantages that American women have to women in developing countries, Nussbaum states that Sommers seems to think that women have no urgent complaints to press and she is critical of Sommers for not saying what she thinks about "legal developments aimed at securing full political and social equality for women&amp;nbsp;... [e.g.] laws against sexual harassment and marital rape." By not stating her views, Nussbaum says, "it is difficult to tell how close [Sommers] really is to the 'grass-roots constituency' that she claims to be representing."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum_1999" /&gt;{{rp|132–133}}

{{Quote|text=A gender feminist, for Sommers, is any thinker who believes that (1) women's suffrage did not remove a systemic asymmetry of power between women and men in our society, and/or (2) the existing preferences of women and men in our society concerning gender issues may be corrupted by social forces and not always reliable bases for the formation of social policy&amp;nbsp;... this definition is not ultimately helpful in sorting feminists into two categories ["gender feminists" or "[[equity feminists]]"] because it fits almost all contemporary social thinkers in political thought and economics.  |author=Martha Nussbaum |authorlink=Martha Nussbaum |source=''Sex and Social Justice'' (1999)&lt;ref name="Nussbaum_1999" /&gt;}}

However, Nussbaum states that it provides a way of reframing her original set of questions about the future of feminism in America:
# Do American women have complaints that have not been adequately addressed by the agenda of "[[equity feminism]]"? In other words, do they have good reasons to become "gender feminists"?
# Does the thought of [[radical feminist]] thinkers make a valuable contribution to addressing those complaints?
# Do the views of these "gender feminist thinkers" about preferences and desires pose a threat to democracy? 
The first two questions Nussbaum answers with a "yes" and the third with a "no."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum_1999" /&gt;{{rp|133}}

==== Other feminist supporters ====
Feminists have largely dismissed Sommers' claims.

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opponents of gender feminism ===

==== Sommers ====
Sommers endorses [[equity feminism]] which she equates with [[first-wave feminism]], rooted in the philosophy of [[liberalism]]. She distinguishes this perspective from [[second-wave feminism]] or gender feminism, which she describes as regarding all women as oppressed by an all-encompassing system of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name="Hoff_Sommers" /&gt;{{rp|22}} She further describes gender feminists as supporting [[difference feminism]], quoting authors who asserts that standards for good art are gendered.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoff Sommers | first = Christina |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers | chapter = Women under siege | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EIUtJziqIqAC&amp;pg=PA22 | title = Who stole feminism? How women have betrayed women | publisher = Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780684801568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|64}} For Sommers, gender or ''political feminism'' is defined in opposition to [[individualist feminism]].&lt;ref name="Hoff_Sommers" /&gt;

==== McElroy ====
[[Wendy McElroy]] also defines gender or political feminism in opposition to individualist feminism,&lt;ref name=mcelroy1&gt;{{cite book | last = McElroy | first = Wendy | author-link = Wendy McElroy | chapter = Introduction | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3BYpAAAAYAAJ | title = Liberty for women: freedom and feminism in the twenty-first century | page = 14 | publisher = Ivan R. Dee | location = Chicago | year = 2002 | isbn = 9781566634359 |quote=Ideologically speaking, individualist and radical or gender feminism are mirror images of each other}}&lt;/ref&gt; and synonymous with [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref name=mcelroy1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=mcelroy2&gt;{{cite journal | last = McElroy | first = Wendy | author-link = Wendy McElroy | title = Gender feminism and Ifeminism: wherin they differ | journal = Ethics &amp; Politics [Etica &amp; Politica] | volume = V | issue = 2  | date = 2003 |hdl=10077/5456 | quote = As a school within the broader feminist tradition, individual feminism contrasts sharply with gender feminism both in its theory and its history. Indeed the two schools define the ideological extremes of the feminist movement |url=http://www2.units.it/etica/2003_2/mcelroy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McElroy describes gender feminism as rooted in social constructionism. She describes gender feminists as asserting that women lack agency and are solely defined by the social institutions they inhabit, unable to make free choices. Accordingly, McElroy describes the gender feminist agenda as the destruction or transformation of social institutions. McElroy rejects these views as a means of disregarding the free choices of women to support existing institutions and oppose gender feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McElroy | first = Wendy | author-link = Wendy McElroy | title = Religion and American feminism | journal = [[Society (journal)|Society]] | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 28&amp;ndash;31 | doi = 10.1007/bf02802983 | date = March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}}

==== Pinker ====
[[Steven Pinker]], in his book, ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature'', elaborating on the dichotomy of Hoff Sommers, states that gender feminism is allied with [[Marxism]], [[postmodernism]], and [[social constructionism]], and as such  is based on three claims: gender differences are purely socially constructed and have no biological basis, human behavior is shaped by the single motive of [[Will to power|desire for power]], and human interactions are best understood not from individual psychology but from the motives of groups responding to groups.&lt;ref name="pinker 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pinker | first = Steven | chapter = Hot buttons: Gender | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G3_UAeo8Dh0C&amp;pg=PT509 | title = The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature | pages = 341–343 | publisher = Penguin | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780140276053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|341–342}} Pinker endorses Hoff Sommers' contrast of gender feminism  vs. equity feminism, with the latter seen as making a moral claim in favor of legal and social equality without making particular assertions about human behavior or biology. He regards [[difference feminism]] as an offshoot of gender feminism.&lt;ref name="pinker 2003" /&gt;{{rp|343}}

=== Relation to other forms of feminism ===
It has been used to distinguish perceived [[radical feminism]] and [[liberal feminism]].&lt;ref name=Sep92&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beckwith | first = Francis J. | title = Reply to Keenan: Thomson's argument and academic feminism | journal = [[International Philosophical Quarterly]] | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 369–376 | doi = 10.5840/ipq199232321 | date = September 1992 }}

The '''HDL Universal Tactical Role-Playing System''' is a [[role-playing game system]] produced by [[Tremorworks, LLC]].

== Details ==
HDL is a flexible, simple system of rules that are adaptable to a great number or settings, allowing them to be  used as alternate rules for existing games or as a mechanic for running campaigns of your own design. Unlike  other “universal” gaming systems, HDL’s focus is on simplicity and realism. To play, all you need is the main  book (a small and inexpensive volume as compared to many others), a set of HDL cards, and a few dice. There  is no need to purchase a slew of “required” supplemental information; everything you need is in one book.

Character creation is point-based; allocate 65 points to stats, ranging from 1 to 10, and 5 points to Backgrounds. Additional Background Points can be gained by taking Weaknesses. Skill Points are determined by  the top three mental stats: Reason, Knowledge, and Resolve. The final step is to draw a Background Card, to help fill in some aspect of the character’s background or past.

Game play is almost entirely skill-based, with a very detailed skill list across a number of categories, such as Combat, Computer, and Technical: Design.

Experience Points (EXP) are awarded to players each game session, through role-playing, overcoming challenges, and playing Game Cards. EXP is then spent to improve the character’s skills or stats, and can also be used to re-roll poor dice rolls.

The HDL namesake originates from the dice mechanic for the game, called the Half Die Level. For simplicity, all variables boil down to a simple number, which determines the die rolled. The number equals half the sides on the die. Thus, HDL 2 = 1d4, HDL 6 = 1d12, and HDL 10 = 2d10. In general, all rolls are based on an HDL equal to a certain stat, plus the character’s rating in the associated skill. For instance, attacking with a sword is based on gross motor coordination, or the Coordination stat, and the Sword: Slashing skill, so a character would roll the HDL of his Coordination, then add his Sword: Slashing skill.

With the emphasis on realism, and a greater focus on role-playing than dice-rolling and fighting, combat is intentionally quick and deadly; even the strongest enemy (or character) can still be felled by a well-placed
bullet or sword strike. Racking up a body count, or accumulating wealth, are secondary to the story and
characters. In this way, power-gamers quickly learn the benefits of negotiation and skill diversity, rather than the ability to smash down any obstacle or opponent. At the same time, the system is designed to help the players succeed; the Narrator is encouraged to challenge players, but in the end they are expected to survive and, ultimately, win.

ESPers are another focus of the main rules: people with incredible psychic powers. Built using a Background and special skills, ESPers have a wide range of paranormal abilities, including mind reading, telekinesis, and even teleportation. The ESPer rules can also be adapted for use as magical abilities in fantasy settings.

For war-game players, strategic hex-map based tactical combat is possible with the optional SCom rules. This optional addition to standard combat rules uses a point-based action system that is simple yet deeply strategic. With this system, direct competitive play is even possible.

'''Hangprinter''' is an [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[fused deposition modeling]] delta [[3D printer]] notable for its unique frameless design, it was created by Torbjörn Ludvigsen. The Hangprinter uses relatively low cost parts and can be constructed for around $250 USD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The printer is part of the [[RepRap project]] where many of the parts of the printer are able to be produced on the printer itself (partially self replicating). The files for the printer are available on [[GitHub|Github]] for download, modification and redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter|title=tobbelobb/hangprinter|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Headhunting''' is the practice of taking and [[Human trophy collecting|preserving a person's head]] after killing the person. Headhunting was practised in historic times in parts of [[Oceania]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]], [[Mesoamerica]], and [[Europe]]. It occurred in Europe to the end of the Middle Ages in Ireland and the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] regions, and until the 20th century in [[Montenegro]], [[Croatia]], [[Albania]], and western parts of [[Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/258121/headhunting |title=headhunting (anthropology) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2009-02-23 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headhunting practice has been the subject of intense study within the [[anthropology|anthropological community]], where scholars try to assess and interpret its social [[Social role|roles]], [[Social function|functions]], and motivations. Anthropological writings explore themes in headhunting that include [[mortification of the flesh|mortification]] of the rival, [[ritual murder|ritual violence]], [[cosmology|cosmological]] balance, the display of [[manhood]], [[cannibalism]], dominance over the body and soul of his enemies in life and afterlife, as a trophy and proof of killing (achievement in hunting), show of greatness, prestige by taking on a rival's spirit and power, and as a means of securing the services of the victim as a slave in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;E-Modigliani, "Un viaggio a Nias," Fratelli Treves Editori Milano 1890&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's scholars generally agree that headhunting's primary function was ritual and ceremonial. It was part of the process of structuring, reinforcing, and defending [[Social hierarchy|hierarchical relationships]] between communities and individuals.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Some experts theorize that the practice stemmed from the belief that the head contained "[[Soul (spirit)|soul]] matter" or life force, which could be harnessed through its capture.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, J. H. "The Significance of Head-Hunting in Assam." ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', vol. 58, 1928, pp. 399–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the [[Marind-anim]] in New Guinea were famed because of their headhunting.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 9&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was rooted in their belief system and linked to the name-giving of the newborn.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 111&lt;/ref&gt; The skull was believed to contain a [[mana]]-like force.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: blurb&lt;/ref&gt; Headhunting was not motivated primarily by cannibalism, but the dead person's flesh was consumed in ceremonies following the capture and killing.&lt;ref name=cannibalism&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Korowai people|Korowai]], a [[Papuan peoples|Papuan]] tribe in the southeast of [[Irian Jaya]], live in [[tree houses]], some nearly 40 metres high. This is believed to be a defensive practice, presumably as protection against the [[Citak]], a tribe of neighbouring headhunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/03/980309043026.htm |title=Head-Hunters Drove Papuan Tribe Into Tree-Houses |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=1998-03-09 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers believe that the American [[Michael Rockefeller]], who disappeared in New Guinea in 1961 while on a field trip, may have been taken by headhunters in the [[Asmat Regency|Asmat]] region. He was the son of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller.

In ''[[The Cruise of the Snark]]'' (1911), the account by [[Jack London]] of his 1905 adventure sailing in Micronesia, he recounted that headhunters of [[Malaita]] attacked his ship during a stay in [[Langa Langa Lagoon]], particularly around [[Laulasi Island]]. His and other ships were kidnapping villagers as workers on plantations, a practice known as [[blackbirding]]. Captain Mackenzie of the ship ''Minolta'' was beheaded by villagers as retribution for the loss of village men during an armed labour "recruiting" drive. The villagers  believed that the ship's crew "owed" several more heads before the score was even.&lt;ref name="wealth"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cruise of the Snark | work=[[The Cruise of the Snark]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3REJt-9gfm8C&amp;printsec=titlepage |pages=|author=[[Jack London]]|year=1911 |publisher=Harvard University Digitized Jan 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Southeast Asia ===

In Southeast Asia, anthropological writings have explored headhunting and other practises of the [[Murut people|Murut]], [[Ilongot people|Ilongot]], [[Igorot]], [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]], Berawan, Wana, and Mappurondo tribes. Among these groups, headhunting was usually a ritual activity rather than an act of war or feuding. A warrior would take a single head. Headhunting acted as a catalyst for the cessation of personal and collective [[mourning]] for the community's dead. Ideas of manhood and marriage were encompassed in the practice, and the taken heads were highly prized. Other reasons for headhunting included capture of enemies as slaves, looting of valuable properties, intra and inter-ethnic conflicts, and territorial expansion.

Italian anthropologist and explorer [[Elio Modigliani]] visited the headhunting communities in South [[Nias]] (an island to the west of Sumatra) in 1886; he wrote a detailed study of their society and beliefs. He found that the main purpose of headhunting was the belief that, if a man owned another person's skull, his victim would serve as a slave of the owner for eternity in the afterlife. Human skulls were a valuable commodity.&lt;ref&gt;E.Modigliani, "Un viaggio a Nias", Fratelli Treves Editori Milano 1890&lt;/ref&gt; Sporadic headhunting continued in Nias island until the late 20th century, the last reported incident dating from 1998.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Headhunting was practised among [[Sumba people]] until the early 20th century. It was done only in large war parties. When the men hunted wild animals, by contrast, they operated in silence and secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, Janet. ''The Play of Time: Kodi Perspectives on Calendars, History, and Exchange.'' Berkeley:  University of California Press,  c1993 1993. http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft0x0n99tc/ p.312-314&lt;/ref&gt; The skulls collected were hung on the skull tree erected in the center of village. As recently as 1998, in [[Waikabubak]], a major clash of clans resulted in some people being decapitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-58-apr-jun-1999/tragedy-in-sumba-2209694 |title=Tragedy in Sumba |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322175551/http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-58-apr-jun-1999/tragedy-in-sumba-2209694 |archivedate=March 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}. insideindonesia.org&lt;/ref&gt; This was reminiscent of the headhunting tradition.

Kenneth George wrote about annual headhunting rituals that he observed among the Mappurondo religious minority, an upland [[tribe]] in the southwest part of the Indonesian island of [[Sulawesi]]. Heads are not taken; instead, surrogate heads in the form of coconuts are used in a ritual ceremony. The ritual, called ''pangngae,'' takes place at the conclusion of the rice-harvesting season. It functions to bring an end to communal [[mourning]] for the deceased of the past year; express intercultural tensions and polemics; allow for a display of manhood; distribute communal resources; and resist outside pressures to abandon Mappurondo ways of life.

United States authorities in the Philippines suppressed headhunting among the [[Ilongot people|Ilongot]] in the 1930s. The [[Igorot people|Igorot]] in the [[Philippines]] also practiced headhunting.

The [[Va people|Wa]] tribe, whose domain straddles the Burma-China border, were once known to Europeans as the "Wild Wa" for their "savage" behavior. Until the 1970s, the Wa practiced headhunting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/covers/1101021216/story.html "Soldiers of Fortune"], TIME Asia&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Punan's heads taken by Sea Dayaks Wellcome M0005506.jpg|thumb|[[Punan Bah|Punan]]'s heads taken by [[Iban people|Sea Dayaks]]]]
In [[Sarawak]], the north-western region of the island of [[Borneo]], [[James Brooke]] and his descendants established a colonial dynasty. They eradicated headhunting in the hundred years before World War II. Before Brooke's arrival, the Iban had migrated from the middle Kapuas region into the upper Batang Lupar river region by fighting and displacing the small existing tribes, such as the Seru and Bukitan. Another successful migration by the Iban was from the Saribas region into the Kanowit area in the middle of the Batang Rajang river, led by the famous Mujah, Buah Raya. They fought and displaced such tribes as the Kanowit and Baketan.

Brooke first encountered the headhunting Iban of the Saribas-Skrang in Sarawak at the Battle of Betting Maru in 1849. He gained the signing of the Saribas Treaty with the Iban chief of that region, who was named Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana "Bayang". Subsequently, the Brooke dynasty expanded their territory from the first small Sarawak region to the present-day state of Sarawak. They enlisted the Malay, Iban, and other natives as a large but unpaid force to crush and pacify any rebellions in the states. The Brooke government prohibited headhunting  (''ngayau'' in Iban language) and added penalties for disobeying the Rajah-led government decree. During expeditions sanctioned by the Brooke government, they allowed headhunting. The natives who participated in Brooke-approved punitive expeditions were exempted from paying annual tax to the Brooke government and/or given new territories in return for their service. There were intra-tribal and intertribal headhunting.

The most famous Iban warrior to resist the colonial Brooke government was Libau "Rentap". The Brooke government had to send three punitive expeditions in order to defeat Rentapi at his fortress on the top of Sadok Hill.

The Iban conducted a third major migration, from upper Batang Ai region in the Batang Lupar region into Katibas and onward to Baleh/Mujong region in the upper Batang Rajang region. They displaced the existing tribes of the Kayan, Kajang, Ukit, etc. The Brooke government sanctioned the last migrations of the Iban, and reduced fighting to a minimum. The Iban conducted sacred ritual ceremonies with special and complex incantations to invoke god's blessings, which were associated with headhunting. An example was the Bird Festival in the Saribas/Skrang region and Proper Festival in the Baleh region, both required for men of the tribes to become effective warriors.

During the Japanese occupation during the Second World War, headhunting was revived among the natives. The Sukarno-led Indonesian forces fought against the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. Forces of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak fought in addition, and headhunting was observed during the communist insurgency in Sarawak and what was then Malaya. The Iban were noted for headhunting, and were later recognised as good rangers and trackers during military operations, during which they were awarded fourteen medals of valour and honour.

Since 1997 serious inter-ethnic violence has erupted on the island of Kalimantan, involving the indigenous [[Dayak people]]s and immigrants from the island of [[Madura]]. Events have included the [[Sambas riots]] and [[Sampit conflict]]. In 2001 during the [[Sampit conflict]] in the Central [[Kalimantan]] town of [[Sampit]], at least 500 [[Madurese people|Madurese]] were killed and up to 100,000 Madurese were forced to flee. Some Madurese bodies were decapitated in a ritual reminiscent of the Dayak headhunting tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/natres/timber/2001/0301brno.htm |title=Behind Ethnic War, Indonesia's Old Migration Policy |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=2001-03-01 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ambonese]], a tribe of mixed Malay-Papuan origin living in the [[Moluccas]], were fierce headhunters until the Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia suppressed the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nunusaku.com/pdfs/politicians_magicans.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In what is now known as New Zealand, the [[Māori people|Māori]] preserved the heads of enemies in a form known as ''[[mokomokai]].'' They removed the brain and eyes, and smoked the head. The heads were sold to European collectors in the late 1800s, in some instances having been commissioned and 'made to order.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/weather-delays-return-toi-moko-4703230 "Weather delays return of toi-moko"], TNVZ (national news)&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently the Māori are attempting to reclaim the heads of their own ancestors held in museums outside New Zealand. Twenty heads were returned to them by French authorities in January 2012, repatriated from museums.

===China===
During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Warring States period]]&lt;!-- give dates --&gt;, [[Qin (state)|Qin]] soldiers frequently collected their enemies' heads. Most of the soldiers were conscripted [[serfs]] and were not paid. Instead, the soldiers earned promotions and rewards from superiors by collecting the heads of enemies, a type of [[body count]]. In this area, authorities displayed heads of executed criminals in public spaces up to the 20th century.

Tom O'Neill wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Samurai]] also sought glory by headhunting. When a battle ended, the warrior, true to his mercenary origins, would ceremoniously present trophy heads to a general, who would variously reward him with promotions in rank, gold or silver, or land from the defeated clan. Generals displayed the heads of defeated rivals in public squares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/features/world/asia/japan/samurai-text/1 Tom O'Neill, "Samurai: Japan's Way of the Warrior"], ''National Geographic Magazine.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Headhunting was a common practice among [[Taiwanese aborigines]]. All tribes practised headhunting except the [[Yami people]], who were previously isolated on [[Orchid Island]], and the [[Ivatan people]]. It was associated with the peoples of the Philippines.

[[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines]], [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese people (Han)]] and [[Yamato people|Japanese]] settlers were choice victims of headhunting raids by Taiwanese Mountain Aborigines. The latter two groups were considered invaders, liars, and enemies. A headhunting raid would often strike at workers in the fields or set a dwelling on fire, and then kill and behead those who fled from the burning structure. The practice continued during the [[Japanese occupation of Taiwan]], but ended in the 1930s due to suppression by the colonial Japanese government.

[[File:Taiwan aborigines headhunting 06.jpg|thumb|The headhunting ritual of aborigines in Taiwan]]
The [[Taiwanese Aboriginal]] tribes, who were allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the [[Guo Huaiyi Rebellion]] in 1652, turned against the Dutch in turn during the [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]]. They defected to [[Koxinga]]'s Chinese forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Covell |first=Ralph R. |date=1998 |title=Pentecost of the Hills in Taiwan: The Christian Faith Among the Original Inhabitants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaP2UFZVGDoC&amp;pg=PA96 |location= |publisher=Hope Publishing House |edition=illustrated |pages=96–97 |isbn=0932727905 |accessdate=December 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty. The Sincan Aboriginals fought for the Chinese and beheaded Dutch people in executions. The frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on May 17, 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under Dutch rule. They hunted down Dutch people, beheading them and trashing their Christian school textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hsin-Hui |first=Chiu |date=2008 |title=The Colonial 'civilizing Process' in Dutch Formosa: 1624 - 1662 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4QzpJtddFxEC&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=BRILL |edition=illustrated |volume=Volume 10 of TANAP monographs on the history of the Asian-European interaction |page=222 |isbn=900416507X |accessdate=December 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Battle of Tamsui]] in the [[Keelung Campaign]] during the [[Sino-French War]] on 8 October 1884, the Chinese took prisoners and beheaded 11 French marines who were injured, in addition to ''La Gailissonniere's'' captain Fontaine. The heads were mounted on bamboo poles and displayed to incite anti-French feelings. In China pictures of the beheading of the Frenchmen were published in the ''Tien-shih-tsai Pictorial Journal'' in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlnKRaZ0f4QC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=French+severed+heads+bamboo+poles+Tamsui&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QjJJVJ_LJ5Gj8gGI4ICgAQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=French%20severed%20heads%20bamboo%20poles%20Tamsui&amp;f=false|title=Maritime Taiwan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A most unmistakable scene in the market place occurred. Some six heads of Frenchmen, heads of the true French type were exhibited, much to the disgust of foreigners. A few visited the place where they were stuck up, and were glad to leave it—not only on account of the disgusting and barbarous character of the scene, but because the surrounding crowd showed signs of turbulence. At the camp also were eight other Frenchmen's heads, a sight which might have satisfied a savage or a Hill-man, but hardly consistent with the comparatively enlightened tastes, one would think, of Chinese soldiers even of to-day. It is not known how many of the French were killed and wounded; fourteen left their bodies on shore, and no doubt several wounded were taken back to the ships. (Chinese accounts state that twenty were killed and large numbers wounded.)

In the evening Captain Boteler and Consul Frater called on General Sun, remonstrating with him on the subject of cutting heads off, and allowing them to be exhibited. Consul Frater wrote him a despatch on the subject strongly deprecating such practices, and we understand that the general promised it should not occur again, and orders were at once given to bury the heads. It is difficult for a general even situated as Sun is—having to command troops like the Hillmen, who are the veriest savages in the treatment of their enemies—to prevent such barbarities.

It is said the Chinese buried the dead bodies of the Frenchmen after the engagement on 8th instant by order of General Sun.

Han and Taiwanese Aboriginals revolted against the Japanese in the [[Beipu Uprising]] in 1907 and [[Tapani Incident]] in 1915. The [[Seediq people|Seediq aboriginals]] revolted against the Japanese in the 1930 [[Wushe Incident]] and resurrected the practice of headhunting, beheading Japanese during the revolt.

Headhunting has been a practice among the [[Mizo people|Mizo]] and the [[Naga people|Naga]] tribes of [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Myanmar]] till the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018|reason=Implying that the introduction of Christianity is what ended headhunting here is a pretty bold claim to make.}} The practice may have been common up to the 20th century and may still be practised in isolated Naga tribes of India and Myanmar.

===Amazon===
[[File:Objets dAmazonie (réserves visitables du musée national dethnologie) (1450150520).jpg|thumb|[[Shrunken head]] from the upper Amazon region]]
Several tribes of the [[Jivaroan]] group, including the [[Shuar people|Shuar]] in Eastern Ecuador and Northern Peru, along the rivers [[Chinchipe river|Chinchipe]], [[Bobonaza River|Bobonaza]], [[Morona]], [[Upano River|Upano]], and [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], main tributaries of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], practised headhunting for trophies. The heads were [[shrunken head|shrunk]], and were known locally as ''Tzan-Tzas''. The people believed that the head housed the soul of the person killed.

In the 21st century, the Shuar produce Tzan-tza replicas. They use their traditional process on heads of [[Silvery woolly monkey|monkeys]] and [[sloths]], selling the items to tourists. It is believed that splinter groups in the local tribes continue with these practises when there is a tribal feud over territory or as revenge for a crime of passion. {{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[Quechua people|Quechua]] Lamista in Peru used to be headhunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wb45ohGLvpEC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=quechua++head+hunting&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ETKl3YXSXI&amp;sig=dDPtC_RJK2fXg7mFhIyjEyXNHFg&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tw_HUdyHB8GZtAalqoH4Dg&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=quechua%20%20head%20hunting&amp;f=false|title=Plants, Health And Healing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesoamerican civilizations===
[[File:Tzompantli Tovar.jpeg|thumb|250px|A ''tzompantli'' is illustrated to the right of a depiction of an [[Aztec]] temple dedicated to the deity [[Huitzilopochtli]]; from Juan de Tovar's 1587 manuscript, also known as the [[Ramírez Codex]].]]
A ''[[tzompantli]]'' is a type of wooden rack or palisade documented in several [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations. It was used for the public display of [[human skull]]s, typically those of war captives or other [[human sacrifice|sacrificial victims]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-archaeology-skulls-idUSKBN19M3Q6 Tower of human skulls in Mexico casts new light on Aztecs]". Reuters. July 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A tzompantli-type structure has been excavated at the [[La Coyotera]], [[Oaxaca]], site. It is dated to the Proto-Classic [[Zapotec civilization]], which flourished from c. 2nd century BCE to the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer (1982), pp. 236–239&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tzompantli'' are also noted in other Mesoamerican [[pre-Columbian]] cultures, such as the [[Toltec]] and [[Mixtec]].

Based on numbers given by the [[conquistador]] [[Andrés de Tapia]] and Fray [[Diego Durán]], Bernard Ortiz de Montellano&lt;ref&gt;Ortíz de Montellano 1983&lt;/ref&gt; has calculated in the late 20th century that there were at most 60,000 skulls on the ''Hueyi Tzompantli'' (great Skullrack) of [[Tenochtitlan]]. There were at least five more skullracks in Tenochtitlan, but, by all accounts, they were much smaller.

Other examples are indicated from [[Maya civilization]] sites. A particularly fine and intact inscription example survives at the extensive [[Chichen Itza]] site.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

===Celts===
{{see also|Celtic decapitation}}
The [[Celts]] of Europe practised headhunting as the head was believed to house a person's soul. Ancient [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] recorded the Celts' habits of nailing heads of personal enemies to walls or dangling them from the necks of horses.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [[Diodorus Siculus]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=agd-eLVNRMMC&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA315,M1 5.2]&lt;/ref&gt;  Headhunting was still practised for a great deal longer by the Celtic [[Gaels]]. In the ''[[Ulster Cycle]],'' [[Cúchulainn]] is described as beheading the three sons of Nechtan and mounting their heads on his chariot. This is believed to have been a traditional warrior, rather than religious, practice. The practice continued approximately to the end of the [[Middle Ages]] in Ireland and the Anglo-Scottish marches.&lt;ref name=Headhunt&gt;[http://www.lard.net/headhunters.html "Headhunters", ''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; The religious reasons for collecting heads were likely lost after the Celts' conversion to Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018|reason=Saying the Celts stopped headhunting once they converted to Christianity is a bold claim.  Especially when the previous sentence says that headhunting was for cultural, not religious, reasons.}} Heads were also taken among the [[Germanic tribes]] and among [[Iberians]], but the purpose is unknown.

===Scythians===
The [[Scythians]] were excellent horsemen. Ancient Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that some of their tribes practised human sacrifice, drinking the blood of victims, [[scalping]] their enemies, and drinking wine from the enemies' skulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodotus/logos4_10.html |title=Summary of and commentary on Herodotus' Histories, book 4 |publisher=Livius.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montenegrins===
The [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] are an ethnic group in Southeastern Europe who are centered around the [[Dinaric Mountains|Dinaric mountains]]. They practiced headhunting until 1876, allegedly carrying the head from a lock of hair grown specifically for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KCZhBWVkgMC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=montenegrin+headhunting&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OmY8wE7VYx&amp;sig=qG1x69JYkHZLpPkbp8iVc94q3Hk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y_ThUsGxJsnyoASVsoDQBw&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=montenegrin%20headhunting&amp;f=false|title=Albania and the Albanians|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1830s, Montenegrin ruler [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš]] started building a tower called ''"Tablja"'' above [[Cetinje Monastery]]. The tower was never finished, and Montenegrins used it to display Turkish heads taken in battle, as they were in frequent conflict with the Ottoman Empire. In 1876 King [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] ordered that the practise should end. He knew that European diplomats considered it to be barbaric. The ''Tablja'' was demolished in 1937.

===Ottoman Turks===
[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] are alleged to have taken heads of the Montenegrins, when they came into conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1166608|title=Head-hunting in Europe: Montenegrin heroes, Turkish barbarians and Western observers = Chasse aux têtes en Europe : Héros monténégrins, barbares turcs et observateurs occidentaux|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern times==

===World War II===
{{Main|American mutilation of Japanese war dead}}
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van een Dajak krijger op Borneo met twee van hoofddeksels voorziene schedels in zijn handen en een kleed over zijn schouder TMnr 60043379.jpg|thumb|A [[Dayak people|Dayak]] headhunter, [[Borneo]].]]

During World War II, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] (specifically including American) troops occasionally collected the skulls of dead Japanese as personal trophies, as souvenirs for friends and family at home, and for sale to others. (The practice was unique to the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theater]]; United States forces did not take skulls of German and Italian soldiers.)  In September 1942, the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet mandated strong disciplinary action against any soldier who took enemy body parts as souvenirs. But such trophy-hunting persisted: ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' published a photograph in its issue of May 22, 1944, of a young woman posing with the autographed skull sent to her by her Navy boyfriend. There was public outrage in the US in response.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fus90|Fussel 1990]]: 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Har06|Harrison 2006]]: 817ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians{{who|date=February 2018}} have suggested that the practice related to Americans viewing the Japanese as [[American mutilation of Japanese war dead#Dehumanization|lesser people]] and in response to mutilation and torture of American dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wei92|Weingartner 1992]]: 67&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Borneo]], retaliation by natives against the Japanese was based on atrocities having been committed by the Japanese Army in that area. Following their ill treatment by the Japanese, the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] of Borneo formed a force to help the Allies. Australian and British special operatives of [[Z Special Unit]] developed some of the inland Dayak tribesmen into a thousand-man headhunting army. This army of tribesmen killed or captured some 1,500 Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/09/opinion/edheiman.php "'Guests' can succeed where occupiers fail"], ''International Herald Tribune,'' 9 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5124">'''Healthy city''' is a term used in [[public health]] and [[urban design]] to stress the impact of policy on [[health|human health]]. Its modern form derives from a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) initiative on Healthy Cities and Villages in 1986, but has a history dating back to the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Niyi Awofeso. [http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862003000300013&amp;script=sci_arttext  The Healthy Cities approach — reflections on a framework for improving global health.] ''Bull World Health Organ'' 2003; 81(3).&lt;/ref&gt; The term was developed in conjunction with the [[European Union]], but rapidly became international as a way of establishing healthy public policy at the local level through [[health promotion]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill M, Simard P. [http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/145.full Choosing indicators to evaluate Healthy Cities projects: a political task?] ''Health Promotion International'' 2006; 21(2): 145-152.&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasises the multi-dimensionality of [[health]] as laid out in WHO's constitution and, more recently, the [[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion]].&lt;ref name="whohc"&gt;World Health Organization.[http://www.euro.who.int/healthy-cities Healthy Cities and urban governance.] Copenhagen: WHO Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative term is [[Healthy community design|Healthy Communities]], or ''Municipios saludables'' in parts of Latin America.

==Approaches==
Many jurisdictions which have healthy community programmes and cities can apply to become a WHO-designated "Healthy City". WHO defines the Healthy City as:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/entity/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf Health Promotion Glossary 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"one that is continually creating and improving those physical and social environments and expanding those community resources which enable
people to mutually support each other in performing all the functions of life and in developing to their maximum potential."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Measuring the indices required, establishing standards and determining the impact of each component on health is difficult. In some regions such as Europe, a health impact assessment is a required piece of [[public policy]] development.&lt;ref&gt;WHO Europe. [http://www.euro.who.int/healthimpact Health impact assessment methods and strategies.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erica Ison. [http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/24/suppl_1/i64  The introduction of health impact assessment in the WHO European Healthy Cities Network.] ''Health Promotion International'' 2009; 24(Supplement 1):i64-i71.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many networks of healthy cities, including in Europe&lt;ref&gt;WHO Europe. [http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/environment-and-health/urban-health/partners WHO European Healthy Cities Network.]&lt;/ref&gt; and internationally, such as the [[Alliance for Healthy Cities]]. A key feature is ensuring that the [[social determinants of health]] are taken into consideration in urban design and urban governance. For example, "[[urbanization]] and health" was the theme of the 2010 [[World Health Day]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.[http://www.euro.who.int/worldhealthday/20100325_1 World Health Day 2010.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407222812/http://www.euro.who.int/worldhealthday/20100325_1 |date=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One tool in developing healthy cities is [[social entrepreneurship]].&lt;ref&gt;Evelyne de Leeuw. [http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/14/3/261  Healthy Cities: urban social entrepreneurship for health.] ''Health Promotion International'' 1999; 14(3): 261-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5361">'''Hypostasis''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ὑπόστασις) is the underlying state or underlying substance and is the fundamental [[reality]] that supports all else. In [[Neoplatonism]] the hypostasis of the [[soul]], the intellect (''[[nous]]'') and "[[Monad (philosophy)|the one]]" was addressed by [[Plotinus]].

In [[Christian theology]], a ''hypostasis'' is one of the three ''hypostases'' (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name=ERwin543&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Christianity'' Volume 5 by Erwin Fahlbusch, Jan Milic Lochman and John Mbiti (February 1, 2008) {{ISBN|080282417X}} page 543&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek philosophy==
[[Pseudo-Aristotle]] used ''hypostasis'' in the sense of [[Matter|material substance]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Aristotle]], ''[[De mundo]]'', 4.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoplatonists argue that beneath the surface phenomena that present themselves to our senses are three higher spiritual principles, or hypostases, each one more sublime than the preceding. For [[Plotinus]], these are: [[wikt:psyche#English|the Soul]], [[Nous|the Intellect]], and [[Henology|the One]]  .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who was Plotinus?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3237626.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Paula&gt;''Neoplatonism (Ancient Philosophies)'' by Pauliina Remes (2008), University of California Press {{ISBN|0520258347}}, pages 48–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[early Christian]] writings, hypostasis is used to denote "being" or "substantive reality" and is not always distinguished in meaning from ''[[ousia]]'' ('essence' or 'substance'). It was used in this way by [[Tatian]] and [[Origen]], and also in the [[anathema]]s appended to the [[Nicene Creed]] of 325.

===Trinitarian definitions===
{{one source|section|date=July 2015}}
It was mainly under the influence of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] that the terminology was clarified and standardized so that the formula "three hypostases in one ousia" came to be accepted as an epitome of the [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] doctrine of the Trinity.&lt;ref name="González 1987 307"&gt;{{cite book|last=González|first=Justo L.|title=A History of Christian Thought: From the Beginnings to the Council of Chalcedon|date=1987|publisher=Abingdon Press|location=Nashville, TN|isbn=0-687-17182-2|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[Basil of Caesarea]] argues that the two terms are not synonymous and that they, therefore, are not to be used indiscriminately in referring to the godhead. He writes:
{{quote|The distinction between ''ousia'' and ''hypostases'' is the same as that between the general and the particular; as, for instance, between the animal and the particular man. Wherefore, in the case of the Godhead, we confess one essence or substance so as not to give variant definition of existence, but we confess a particular hypostasis, in order that our conception of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit may be without confusion and clear.&lt;ref name="González 1987 307"/&gt;}}

This consensus, however, was not achieved without some confusion at first in the minds of Western theologians since in the West the vocabulary was different. Many Latin-speaking theologians understood ''hypo-stasis'' as "sub-stantia" (substance); thus when speaking of three "hypostases" in the [[Godhead in Christianity|godhead]], they might suspect three "substances" or [[tritheism]]. However, from the middle of the fifth century onwards, marked by [[Council of Chalcedon]], the word came to be contrasted with ''ousia'' and used to mean "individual reality," especially in the trinitarian and [[Christological]] contexts. The Christian concept of the Trinity is often described as being [[monotheism|one god]] existing in three distinct ''hypostases/personae/persons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=González|first=Justo L|authorlink=Justo L.

'''Jerzy Sikorski''' (born July 25, 1935) is a Polish historian, [[Copernicus|Copernicologist]], [[medievalist]], [[museologist]], author, publisher, journalist, and encyclopedist, who writes and publishes primarily in Polish.  He is a resident of [[Olsztyn]], Poland.

==Life==
===Early life===
Jerzy Sikorski was born on July 25, 1935 in [[Vilnius]] ([[Polish language|Polish]]: Wilno), to Anna Wołk-Lewanowicz (1914–1995) and Feliks Sikorski (1889–1980).  Five years later (1940) Sikorski's sister Maria Danuta was born.

In October 1944, during [[World War II]], Sikorski's mother Anna was arrested by the [[People's Commissariat for State Security]] along with 40 other people, when she was exposed as a courier between Vilnius' "Kedyw" and the general staff of the Polish [[Home Army]]. Early in January 1945 Sikorski's father Feliks was also arrested because he was a soldier of the 1st Polish Corps under the [[Poland|Polish]] general [[Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki]] in the ''Polish-Soviet War,'', but he was released after three months. Upon his release, Feliks made efforts to obtain Anna's release from prison, locate and take care of Jerzy and Maria, and reunite his family. Anna was released from prison camp in June 1946, and the family moved to Olsztyn. They chose Olsztyn based on the fact that most of the Vilnius board of education where Feliks once worked had been evacuated to Olsztyn, and Feliks could resume his position there.&lt;ref name=js2012&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (2012). "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/biografia Biografia: Jerzy Sikorski – O Sobie]". ''www.jerzysikorski.pl'', Olsztyn. Accessed 2018-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Following World War II, Sikorski's mother was prevented from teaching due to political persecution. After Sikorski graduated from high school in 1953, he was repeatedly denied entry to university in spite of passing exams in [[Gdańsk]], [[Warsaw]], [[Toruń]], and [[Poznań]]. Each time, he received the characteristic preprinted postcard with "not accepted due to lack of space".   On the advice of a Polish studies specialist teacher (Polish [[philologist]]), Janina Kirkicka, Sikorski was able to enroll in a two-year teacher's college in Olsztyn, but after two weeks the director Bolesław Wytrążek instructed Sikorski to leave the college, due the decision of the local [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) in [[Olsztyn]].  Through [[:pl:Hieronim_Skurpski|Hieronim Skurpski]], who was the director at the Museum of [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]] located at [[Olsztyn Castle]], Sikorski obtained employment (1954–1955) at the [[:pl:Muzeum Mikołaja Kopernika we Fromborku|Nicolas Copernicus Museum in Frombork]], which was under the patronage of the regional museum in Olsztyn.  The work at Frombork’s museum and the person of the great Polish Astronomer [[Nicolas Copernicus]], who spent most of his life in Frombork and Warmia region, made a lasting impression on Sikorski. As a result, Copernicus and ''Copernicana'' research became the dominant subject in Sikorski's lifetime work and in his professional affiliations with various research centers. Ultimately, it led to Sikorski's discovery and publication of Copernicus' resting place at Frombork’s cathedral in 1973, which was confirmed archaeologically in 2005.

In the fall of 1955 Sikorski enrolled at the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń]], where he chose to study under professor [[:pl:Karol Górski|Karol Górski]], who among other scholarly pursuits studied and researched the life and politics of Copernicus' maternal uncle, Bishop [[Lucas Watzenrode]].&lt;ref name=gorski1973&gt;Górski Karol (1973). ''Łukasz Watzenrode. Życie i działalność polityczna (1447–1512).'' Wrocław 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sikorski wrote his master’s thesis on Watzenrode, and   subsequently wrote his doctoral dissertation "Polish monarchy and Warmia at the end of the 15th century:  Issues in systemic-law and politics".&lt;ref name=js1978&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1978).  ''Monarchia polska i Warmia u schyłku XV wieku. Zagadnienia prawno-ustrojowe i polityczne''. Olsztyn, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completing of his academic studies at the Nicolas Copernicus University in Toruń in 1960, Sikorski accepted a position at the Museum of Warmia at [[Lidzbark Warmiński Castle]], where Copernicus spent at least seven years (1503–1509). Copernicus had strong ties to the city of Lidzbark, and had visited there at the invitation of his maternal uncle Bishop Lucas Watzenrode in 1495. Sikorski worked at the museum from 1961 to 1962.

Lidzbark Warmiński Castle was of substantial significance for Jerzy Sikorski's ''Copernicana'' studies in terms of the history of astronomy; as well as because the castle was a strongly fortified seat of the bishops of Warmia and the administration center of their lands  from the second half of the 14th century. At that time, Lidzbark city had one of the largest populations in Warmia, similar to [[Braniewo]].  In Lidzbark, Sikorski researched historic documents pertaining to the history of Poland's [[Baltic Sea|Baltic seashore]] ([[Pomerania]], [[Warmia]], [[Mazury]], [[Prussia]]), and its extant architectural relics, documents, and other materials relating to Nicolaus Copernicus.  Following the death of bishop Watzenrode in Toruń on March 29, 1512, Copernicus only sporadically visited Lidzbark, either as an emissary of the Warmia Chapter, or as a personal medical doctor for the successive bishops: [[:pl:Fabian Luzjański|Fabian Luzjański]] (d. 1523), [[Mauritius Ferber]] (Polish: Maurycy Ferber 1471–1537), and [[Johannes Dantiscus]] (Polish: Jan Dantyszek; 1485–1548).&lt;ref name=js2012/&gt;

==Author==
An organized index of published books and articles by Sikorski is listed at [http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/lista-publikacji his web portal], covering four areas of research: 1. Copernicana; 2.  Cities and castles of Prussia; 3.  Historic tradition of the region; and, 4. The History of Science.

An additional indexed list of Sikorski's complete articles and papers is available online at the [http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/baza-artykulow Database of Articles] (in Polish), including two English language papers: "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/empirical-table-olsztyn-question-nicolaus-copernicus-scientific-workshop The Empirical Table of Olsztyn the Question of Nicolaus Copernicus' Scientific Workshop]", and "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/practice-bishops-burials-frombork-cathedral-and-question-grave-nicolaus-copernicus-s-uncle The Practice of Bishops' Burials in Frombork Cathedral and the Question of the Grave of Nicolaus Copernicus' Uncle Łukasz Watzenrode]".
       
In 1973, in time for the 500th anniversary of Nicolas Copernicus' birth, Sikorski authored a popular [[monograph]] on the astronomer's life, work, and times.&lt;ref name=js1973&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1973).

==Journalist==
Between 1966 and 2007 Jerzy Sikorski published a number of articles in ''Mazury-Warmian Communications'' (''[[:pl:Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie|Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie]]''), on the history of [[Poland]]'s ancestral [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seashore [[Pomerania]], and the Polish regions of [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]]. He also published articles on the life and activities of the Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].&lt;ref name=js1969&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1969).

==Encyclopedist==
Jerzy Sikorski published a number of short biographies of Warmian Chapter canons and members in the ''[[Polish Biographical Dictionary]]'', which is printed by the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]. These included biographies of Preuck Jan (1575–1631), Preuck Jerzy (d. 1556), Reich Feliks (c. 1475–1539), Sculteti Aleksander (1485–1564), Sculteti Bernard (d. 1518), and Sculteti Jan (d. 1526).

===Copernicus' Polish nationality and descent===
[[File:Locationes mansorum desertorum Nicolaus Copernicus.JPG|thumb| Nicolaus [Nicolas] Copernicus' extant manuscript, 15 pages –  ''Locationes mansorum desertorum'' (''Allocation of abandoned fiefs'')]]
Reviewing the document ''Locationes mansorum desertorum'' (''Allocation of abandoned fiefs''), which was written by Copernicus in the region of Olsztyn Castle, Olsztyn, Poland, Jerzy Sikorski discovered that, out of the 136 names of allocation of fiefs, 60 were Polish names (peasants had only first names) written in phonetically correct Polish.&lt;ref name=js2011/&gt;{{rp|131}}  Sikorski also cites an extant document where Copernicus’ witness was Copernicus’ Polish servant: ''Wojciech Cebulski''.&lt;ref name=js2011/&gt;{{rp|128}} These documents indicate that Copernicus spoke and wrote Polish.

In a letter to king Sigismund I of Poland handwritten by Nicolas Copernicus in Olsztyn Castle, the administrator, chancellor, and commander in chief of the defense of Olsztyn Castle Copernicus and Warmia Canons together affirm their Polish nationality as subjects to King Sigismund I of Poland against the enemy, the German Teutonic Order. The writers say that they are willing to die defending Olsztyn Castle, Warmia, and Poland from the Teutonic Knights.  Nicolas Copernicus is directly associated with Sigismund I of Poland in the wars against the Teutonic Order, the reform of royal mints and the minting of coins, in establishing modern market economy in 16th century Poland, in direct contacts with king's personal medical doctor, with Cracow (Kraków) and the Jagiellonian University, and with the Polish Roman Catholic Church in Cracow.

Sikorski wrote "the intellectual adventure of my life were my discoveries of Copernicus’ Polish ancestry and nationality".&lt;ref name=js2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=fedo2015&gt;Fedoniuk B. (2015).

===Copernicus’ resting place===

Copernicus was reportedly buried in [[Frombork Cathedral]], but archaeologists searched there in vain for centuries for his remains. Efforts to locate the remains in 1581, 1626, 1802, 1909, 1939 and 2004 came to nought. In 1973 Dr Jerzy Sikorski published the location of Copernicus' resting place in his book, including the photo of the Altar of Saint Wacław, today Altar of Saint Cross, with a subscription (English translation of Polish) "The remains of Mikołaj Kopernik rest unnamed next to this altar".&lt;ref name=js1973/&gt;{{rp|193}}

===Location of Copernicus’ observatories===

[[File:Frombork-Cathedral-Altars-Tower-Curia-4b-final.jpg|thumb|Photographs of Frombork Cathedral and defensive walls, Copernicus’ extant Canonic Curia inside the walls (''Curiae intra muros''), and the location of Copernicus’ no-longer-extant Canonic Curia outside walls (''Curiae extra muros'').]]

Sikorski discovered the location of Copernicus' Canonic Curia outside the walls of Frombork (the ''Curiae extra muros'').&lt;ref name=js1969/&gt;{{cn|reason=Need a reference to a reliable secondary source.|date=September 2018}}  The building is not extant, having been burned by Teutonic Knights on February 1, 1520, but the foundation remains. 

Sikorski searched the area nearby with instruments such as [[ground-penetrating radar]] in an effort to find Copernicus’ observatory "pavimentum", which was believed to have been nearby, but did not find it.
Sikorski was aided in the search by the notebook of Elias Olsen, who was sent by [[Tycho Brahe]] to Frombork in 1584 to use the still-extant ''pavimentum'' to obtain astronomic observations for comparison with those of Copernicus. {{As of|2011}} the ''pavimentum'' has still not been located. Its foundations may have been destroyed during extensive ground works near Copernicus’ external curia.  

Sikorski since 1973 researched and wrote on Copernicus' observatory in Olsztyn, which contains a still-extant plaster astronomical table that was used by Copernicus from 1516 to 1521.

Sikorski has been awarded Polish presidential medals for his professional work as a historian and Copernicologist: the [[Gold Cross of Merit]] (1975) and Knight's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] (1986).&lt;ref&gt;Formal statement from the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland, BON – Department of Orders and Decorations, Reference: BON.0600.454.2.2017, July 27, 2017, Warsaw, addressed and forwarded by BON to Mr Artur Chojecki, the Province Region Governor of Warmia &amp; Mazury.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the fifteenth anniversary of the Warmia-Mazury Business Club, the President of Poland Lech Kaczyński gave presidential orders and awards to deserving club members. On March 28, 2008, the title "Personality of the Year 2008 in Warmia and Mazury" was awarded to Jerzy Sikorski for his research into the life and science of Nicolas Copernicus, and for his 1973 discovery of Copernicus's resting place.

The '''laws of thought''' are fundamental [[axiom]]atic rules upon which rational discourse itself is often considered to be based.  The formulation and clarification of such rules have a long tradition in the history of [[philosophy]] and [[logic]]. Generally they are taken as laws that guide and underlie everyone's thinking, [[thoughts]], expressions, discussions, etc. However, such classical ideas are often questioned or rejected in more recent developments, such as [[intuitionistic logic]], [[dialetheism]] and [[fuzzy logic]].

According to the 1999 Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;"Laws of thought".  Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy.  [[Robert Audi]], Editor,  Cambridge: Cambridge UP. p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt; laws of thought are laws by which or in accordance with which valid thought proceeds, or that justify valid inference, or to which all valid deduction is reducible. Laws of thought are rules that apply without exception to any subject matter of thought, etc.; sometimes they are said to be the object of logic{{explain|date=July 2018}}. The term, rarely used in exactly the same sense by different authors, has long been associated with three equally ambiguous expressions: the [[law of identity]] (ID), the [[law of contradiction]] (or non-contradiction; NC), and the [[law of excluded middle]] (EM).
Sometimes, these three expressions are taken as [[propositions]] of [[formal ontology]] having the widest possible subject matter, propositions that apply to entities as such: (ID), everything is (i.e., is identical to) itself; (NC) no thing having a given quality also has the negative of that quality (e.g., no even number is non-even); (EM) every thing either has a given quality or has the negative of that quality (e.g., every number is either even or non-even). Equally common in older works is the use of these expressions for principles of [[metalogic]] about propositions: (ID) every proposition implies itself; (NC) no proposition is both true and false; (EM) every proposition is either true or false.

Beginning in the middle to late 1800s, these expressions have been used to denote propositions of [[Boolean Algebra]] about classes: (ID) every class includes itself; (NC) every class is such that its intersection ("product") with its own complement is the null class; (EM) every class is such that its union ("sum") with its own complement is the universal class. More recently, the last two of the three expressions have been used in connection with the classical propositional logic and with the so-called [[protothetic]] or quantified [[propositional logic]]; in both cases the law of non-contradiction involves the negation of the conjunction ("and") of something with its own negation, ¬(A∧¬A), and the law of excluded middle involves the disjunction ("or") of something with its own negation, A∨¬A. In the case of propositional logic, the "something" is a schematic letter serving as a place-holder, whereas in the case of protothetic logic the "something" is a genuine variable. The expressions "law of non-contradiction" and "law of excluded middle" are also used for [[semantic]] principles of [[model theory]] concerning sentences and interpretations: (NC) under no interpretation is a given sentence both true and false, (EM) under any interpretation, a given sentence is either true or false.

The expressions mentioned above all have been used in many other ways. Many other propositions have also been mentioned as laws of thought, including the [[dictum de omni et nullo]] attributed to [[Aristotle]], the substitutivity of identicals (or equals) attributed to [[Euclid]], the so-called [[identity of indiscernibles]] attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and other "logical truths".

The expression "laws of thought" gained added prominence through its use by [[Boole]] (1815–64) to denote theorems of his "algebra of logic"; in fact, he named his second logic book ''An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities'' (1854). Modern logicians, in almost unanimous disagreement with Boole, take this expression to be a misnomer; none of the above propositions classed under "laws of thought" are explicitly about thought per se, a mental phenomenon studied by [[psychology]], nor do they involve explicit reference to a thinker or knower as would be the case in [[pragmatics]] or in [[epistemology]]. The distinction between psychology (as a study of mental phenomena) and logic (as a study of valid inference) is widely accepted.

==The three traditional laws==

===History===
[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] offers a history of the three traditional laws that begins with [[Plato]], proceeds through Aristotle, and ends with the [[scholastic logic|schoolmen]] of the [[Middle Ages]]; in addition he offers a fourth law (see entry below, under '''Hamilton'''):

:"'''The principles of Contradiction and Excluded Middle can be traced back to Plato''': The principles of Contradiction and of Excluded Middle can both be traced back to Plato, by whom they were enounced and frequently applied; though it was not till long after, that either of them obtained a distinctive appellation. To take the principle of Contradiction first. This law Plato frequently employs, but the most remarkable passages are found in the Phœdo, in the Sophista, and in the fourth and seventh books of the Republic. [Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 62]

:'''Law of Excluded Middle''': The law of Excluded Middle between two contradictories remounts, as I have said, also to Plato, though the Second Alcibiades, the dialogue in which it is most clearly expressed, must be admitted to be spurious. It is also in the fragments of Pseudo-Archytas, to be found in [[Stobaeus|Stobæus]]. [Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 65]

:Hamilton further observes that "It is explicitly and emphatically enounced by Aristotle in many passages both of his Metaphysics (l. iii. (iv.) c.7.) and of his Analytics, both Prior (l. i. c. 2) and Posterior (1. i. c. 4). In the first of these, he says: "It is impossible that there should exist any medium between contradictory opposites, but it is necessary either to affirm or to deny everything of everything." [Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 65]

:"'''Law of Identity.''' [Hamilton also calls this "The principle of all logical affirmation and definition"] '''Antonius Andreas''': The law of Identity, I stated, was not explicated as a coordinate principle till a comparatively recent period. The earliest author in whom I have found this done, is [[Antonius Andreas]], a scholar of Scotus, who flourished at the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century. The schoolman, in the fourth book of his Commentary of Aristotle's Metaphysics – a commentary which is full of the most ingenious and original views, – not only asserts to the law of Identity a coordinate dignity with the law of Contradiction, but, against Aristotle, he maintains that the principle of Identity, and not the principle of Contradiction, is the one absolutely first. The formula in which Andreas expressed it was ''Ens est ens''. Subsequently to this author, the question concerning the relative priority of the two laws of Identity and of Contradiction became one much agitated in the schools; though there were also found some who asserted to the law of Excluded Middle this supreme rank." [From Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 65-66]

=== Three traditional laws: identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle ===

The following will state the three traditional "laws" in the words of Bertrand Russell (1912):

====The law of identity====

The [[law of identity]]: 'Whatever is, is.'&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:72,1997 edition"&gt;Russell 1912:72,1997 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

For all a: a = a.

Regarding this law, Aristotle wrote:
{{quote|First then this at least is obviously true, that the word "be" or "not be" has a definite meaning, so that not everything will be "so and not so". Again, if "man" has one meaning, let this be "two-footed animal"; by having one meaning I understand this:—if "man" means "X", then if A is a man "X" will be what "being a man" means for him. (It makes no difference even if one were to say a word has several meanings, if only they are limited in number; for to each definition there might be assigned a different word. For instance, we might say that "man" has not one meaning but several, one of which would have one definition, viz. "two-footed animal", while there might be also several other definitions if only they were limited in number; for a peculiar name might be assigned to each of the definitions. If, however, they were not limited but one were to say that the word has an infinite number of meanings, obviously reasoning would be impossible; for not to have one meaning is to have no meaning, and if words have no meaning our reasoning with one another, and indeed with ourselves, has been annihilated; for it is impossible to think of anything if we do not think of one thing; but if this is possible, one name might be assigned to this thing.)|Aristotle|[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]], Book IV, Part 4 (translated by W.D. Ross)&lt;ref name="Metaphysics"&gt;http://www.classicallibrary.org/aristotle/metaphysics/book04.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

More than two millennia later, [[George Boole]] alluded to the very same principle as did Aristotle when Boole made the following observation with respect to the nature of [[language]] and those principles that must inhere naturally within them: {{quote|There exist, indeed, certain general principles founded in the very nature of language, by which the use of symbols, which are but the elements of scientific language, is determined. To a certain extent these elements are arbitrary. Their interpretation is purely conventional: we are permitted to employ them in whatever sense we please. But this permission is limited by two indispensable conditions, first, that from the sense once conventionally established we never, in the same process of reasoning, depart; secondly, that the laws by which the process is conducted be founded exclusively upon the above fixed sense or meaning of the symbols employed.|George Boole|[[An Investigation of the Laws of Thought]]}}

====The law of non-contradiction====

The [[law of non-contradiction]] (alternately the 'law of contradiction'&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:72, 1997 edition"&gt;Russell 1912:72, 1997 edition&lt;/ref&gt;): 'Nothing can both be and not be.'&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:72,1997 edition"/&gt;

In other words: "two or more contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time": [[Negation|¬]](A[[Logical conjunction|∧]]¬A).

In the words of Aristotle, that "one cannot say of something that it is and that it is not in the same respect and at the same time". As an illustration of this law, he wrote:
{{quote|It is impossible, then, that "being a man" should mean precisely not being a man, if "man" not only signifies something about one subject but also has one significance ... And it will not be possible to be and not to be the same thing, except in virtue of an ambiguity, just as if one whom we call "man", and others were to call "not-man"; but the point in question is not this, whether the same thing can at the same time be and not be a man in name, but whether it can be in fact.|Aristotle|Metaphysics, Book IV, Part 4 (translated by W.D. Ross)&lt;ref name="Metaphysics" /&gt;}}

====The law of excluded middle====

The law of excluded middle: 'Everything must either be or not be."&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:72,1997 edition"/&gt;

In accordance with the [[law of excluded middle]] or excluded third, for every proposition, either its positive or negative form is true: A[[Logical disjunction|∨]]¬A.

Regarding the [[law of excluded middle]], Aristotle wrote:
{{quote|But on the other hand there cannot be an intermediate between contradictories, but of one subject we must either affirm or deny any one predicate. This is clear, in the first place, if we define what the true and the false are. To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true; so that he who says of anything that it is, or that it is not, will say either what is true or what is false|Aristotle|Metaphysics, Book IV, Part 7 (translated by W.D. Ross)&lt;ref name="Metaphysics" /&gt;}}

===Rationale===
As the quotations from Hamilton above indicate, in particular the "law of identity" entry, the rationale for and expression of the "laws of thought" have been fertile ground for philosophic debate since Plato. Today the debate—about how we "come to know" the world of things and our thoughts—continues; for examples of rationales see the entries, below.
&lt;!--That everything be "the same with itself and different from another" (law of identity) is one of the "self-evident logical principles"&lt;ref&gt;"These three laws are samples of self-evident logical principles, but are not really more fundamental or more self-evident than various other similar principles: for instance, the one we considered just now, which states that what follows from a true premiss is true." ([[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[The Problems of Philosophy]]'', Chapter VII)&lt;/ref&gt; upon which all symbolic communication systems (languages) are founded, for it governs the use of those symbols (names, words, pictograms, etc.) which denote the various individual concepts within a language, so as to eliminate ambiguity in the conveyance of those concepts between the users of the language. Such a principle (law) is necessary because symbolic designators have no inherent meaning of their own, but derive their meaning from the language users themselves, who associate each symbol with an individual concept in a manner that has been conventionally prescribed within their linguistic group. The degree to which this law must be obeyed depends upon the kind of language that one is utilizing. In a [[natural language]] there is considerable tolerance for violations since there are other means—such as the context in which the symbol is used—by which one can determine which of a number of different concepts one is intended to call to mind by the use of a given symbol. However, in the language of [[mathematics]] or [[formal logic]] there is no such tolerance. If, for example, the symbol "+" were allowed to denote both the function of addition and some other mathematical function, then we would be unable to evaluate the truth value of a proposition such as "2+2=4", since the truth of such a proposition would be contingent upon which of the possible functions the symbol "+" was intended to denote. The same is true of symbols such as "2" and "4". If these symbols did not denote conventionally prescribed quantities, then one could not attribute proper meaning to them, and the proposition would be rendered unintelligible.--&gt;
&lt;!-- Furthermore, we cannot think [[Conceptual model|conceptually]] without making use of some form of language (symbolic communication), for thinking conceptually entails the manipulation and amalgamation of simpler [[concept]]s in order to form more complex concepts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Therefore we must have a means of distinguishing these different concepts, namely [[symbol]]s or [[sign]]s. It follows then that the first principle of language (law of identity) is also rightfully called the first principle of thought, and by extension, the first principle of reason (rational thought).{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}{{original research?|date=January 2014}}--&gt;to originally research?|data=february 2019}}--&gt;

==Plato==
In one of Plato's [[Socratic dialogue]]s, [[Socrates]] described three [[principle]]s derived from [[introspection]]: {{Quotation|First, that nothing can become greater or less, either in number or magnitude, while remaining equal to itself ... Secondly, that without addition or subtraction there is no increase or diminution of anything, but only equality ... Thirdly, that what was not before cannot be afterwards, without becoming and having become.|[[Plato]]|[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]], 155&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/plato/p71th/theaetetus.html|title= Theaetetus, by Plato|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= November 10, 2012|publisher= The University of Adelaide Library|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Indian logic==
The [[law of non-contradiction]] is found in ancient [[Indian logic]] as a meta-rule in the ''[[Kalpa (Vedanga)|Shrauta Sutras]]'', the grammar of [[Pāṇini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Frits Staal]]|title=Universals: Studies in Indian Logic and Linguistics|publisher=[[Chicago]]|year=1988|pages=109–28}} ([[cf.]] {{citation|title=Seeing Things Hidden|first=Malcolm|last=Bull|publisher=Verso|year=1999|isbn=1-85984-263-1|page=53}})&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'' attributed to [[Vyasa]]. It was later elaborated on by medieval commentators such as [[Madhvacharya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A History of Indian Philosophy|first=Surendranath|last=Dasgupta|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|year=1991|isbn=81-208-0415-5|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locke==
[[John Locke]] claimed that the principles of identity and contradiction (i.e. the law of identity and the law of non-contradiction) were general ideas and only occurred to people after considerable abstract, philosophical thought. He characterized the principle of identity as "Whatsoever is, is." He stated the principle of contradiction as "It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be." To Locke, these were not innate or ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/locke.htm|title= An Essay concerning Human Understanding|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leibniz==
[[Gottfried Leibniz]] formulated two additional principles, either or both of which may sometimes be counted as a law of thought:

:* [[principle of sufficient reason]]
:* [[identity of indiscernibles]]

In Leibniz's thought, as well as generally in the approach of [[rationalism]], the latter two principles are regarded as clear and incontestable [[axioms]].  They were widely recognized in [[Europe]]an thought of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, although they were subject to greater debate in the 19th century. As turned out to be the case with the [[law of continuity]], these two laws involve matters which, in contemporary terms, are subject to much debate and analysis (respectively on [[determinism]] and [[extensionality]]{{clarify|date=January 2014}}). Leibniz's principles were particularly influential in German thought. In France, the ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]'' was less swayed by them. [[Hegel]] quarrelled with the [[identity of indiscernibles]] in his ''[[Science of Logic]]'' (1812–1816).

==Schopenhauer==

===Four laws===
"The primary laws of thought, or the conditions of the thinkable, are four: &amp;ndash; 1. The law of identity [A is A]. 2. The law of contradiction. 3. The law of exclusion; or excluded middle. 4. The law of sufficient reason." (Thomas Hughes, ''The Ideal Theory of Berkeley and the Real World'', Part II, Section XV, Footnote, p. [https://archive.org/stream/idealtheoryberk01hughgoog#page/n48/mode/2up 38])

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] discussed the laws of thought and tried to demonstrate that they are the basis of reason. He listed them in the following way in his ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', §33:

#A subject is equal to the sum of its predicates, or a = a.
#No predicate can be simultaneously attributed and denied to a subject, or a ≠ ~a.
#Of every two contradictorily opposite predicates one must belong to every subject.
#Truth is the reference of a judgment to something outside it as its sufficient reason or ground.
Also:
{{Quotation|The laws of thought can be ''most intelligibly'' expressed thus:
#Everything that is, exists.
#Nothing can simultaneously be and not be.
#Each and every thing either is or is not.
#Of everything that is, it can be found why it is.
There would then have to be added only the fact that once for all in logic the question is about ''what is thought'' and hence about concepts and not about real things.|Schopenhauer| Manuscript Remains'', Vol. 4, "Pandectae II", §163'}}

To show that they are the foundation of [[reason]], he gave the following explanation:
{{Quotation|Through a reflection, which I might call a self-examination of the faculty of reason, we know that these judgments are the expression of the conditions of all thought and therefore have these as their ground. Thus by making vain attempts to think in opposition to these laws, the faculty of reason recognizes them as the conditions of the possibility of all thought. We then find that it is just as impossible to think in opposition to them as it is to move our limbs in a direction contrary to their joints. If the subject could know itself, we should know those laws ''immediately'', and not first through experiments on objects, that is, representations (mental images).|Schopenhauer| ''[[s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason#§ 33. Metalogical Truth.|''On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', §33]]'}}

Schopenhauer's four laws can be schematically presented in the following manner:
#A is A.
#A is not not-A.
#X is either A or not-A.
#If A then B (A implies B).

===Two laws===

Later, in 1844, Schopenhauer claimed that the four laws of thought could be reduced to two. In the ninth chapter of the second volume of ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', he wrote:
{{Quotation|It seems to me that the doctrine of the laws of thought could be simplified if we were to set up only two, the law of excluded middle and that of sufficient reason. The former thus: "Every predicate can be either confirmed or denied of every subject." Here it is already contained in the "either, or" that both cannot occur simultaneously, and consequently just what is expressed by the laws of identity and contradiction. Thus these would be added as corollaries of that principle which really says that every two concept-spheres must be thought either as united or as separated, but never as both at once; and therefore, even although words are joined together which express the latter, these words assert a process of thought which cannot be carried out. The consciousness of this infeasibility is the feeling of contradiction. The second law of thought, the principle of sufficient reason, would affirm that the above attributing or refuting must be determined by something different from the judgment itself, which may be a (pure or empirical) perception, or merely another judgment. This other and different thing is then called the ground or reason of the judgment. So far as a judgement satisfies the first law of thought, it is thinkable; so far as it satisfies the second, it is true, or at least in the case in which the ground of a judgement is only another judgement it is logically or formally true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40097/40097-h/40097-h.html|title= The Project Gutenberg EBook of The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3) by Arthur Schopenhauer|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= June 27, 2012|publisher= Project Gutenberg|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Boole (1854): From his "laws of the mind" Boole derives Aristotle's "Law of contradiction" ==
The title of [[George Boole]]'s 1854 treatise on logic, ''An Investigation on the Laws of Thought'', indicates an alternate path. The laws are now incorporated into an algebraic representation of his "laws of the mind", honed over the years into modern [[Boolean algebra]].

=== Rationale: How the "laws of the mind" are to be distinguished ===
Boole begins his chapter I "Nature and design of this Work" with a discussion of what characteristic distinguishes, generally, "laws of the mind" from "laws of nature":
: "The general laws of Nature are not, for the most part, immediate objects of perception. They are either inductive inferences from a large body of facts, the common truth in which they express, or, in their origin at least, physical hypotheses of a causal nature. . . . They are in all cases, and in the strictest sense of the term, probable conclusions, approaching, indeed, ever and ever nearer to certainty, as they receive more and more of the confirmation of experience. ...”

Contrasted with this are what he calls "laws of the mind": Boole asserts these are known in their first instance, without need of repetition: 
:“On the other hand, the knowledge of the laws of the mind does not require as its basis any extensive collection of observations. The general truth is seen in the particular instance, and it is not confirmed by the repetition of instances. ... we not only see in the particular example the general truth, but we see it also as a certain truth -- a truth, our confidence in which will not continue to increase with increasing experience of its practical verification.” (Boole 1854:4)

=== Boole's signs and their laws ===
Boole begins with the notion of "signs" representing "classes", "operations" and "identity":
:"All the signs of Language, as an instrument of reasoning may be conducted by a system of signs composed of the following elements
::"1st Literal symbols as x, y, etc representing things as subjects of our conceptions,
::"2nd Signs of operation, as +, −, x standing for those operations of the mind by which conceptions of things are combined or resolved so as to form new conceptions involving the same elements,
::"3rd The sign of identity, =.
:And these symbols of Logic are in their use subject to definite laws, partly agreeing with and partly differing from the laws of the corresponding symbols in the science of Algebra. (Boole 1854:27)

Boole then clarifies what a "literal symbol" e.g. x, y, z,... represents—a name applied to a collection of instances into "classes". For example, "bird" represents the entire class of feathered winged warm-blooded creatures. For his purposes he extends the notion of class to represent membership of "one", or "nothing", or "the universe" i.e. totality of all individuals: 
:"Let us then agree to represent the class of individuals to which a particular name or description is applicable, by a single letter, as z. ... By a class is usually meant a collection of individuals, to each of which a particular name or description may be applied; but in this work the meaning of the term will be extended so as to include the case in which but a single individual exists, answering to the required name or description, as well as the cases denoted by the terms "nothing" and "universe," which as "classes" should be understood to comprise respectively 'no beings,' 'all beings.'" (Boole 1854:28)

He then defines what the string of symbols e.g. xy means [modern logical &amp;, conjunction]:
:"Let it further be agreed, that by the combination xy shall be represented that class of things to which the names or descriptions represented by x and y are simultaneously, applicable. Thus, if x alone stands for "white things," and y for "sheep," let xy stand for 'white Sheep;'" (Boole 1854:28)

Given these definitions he now lists his laws with their justification plus examples (derived from Boole):
* (1) xy = yx [commutative law]
:: "x represents 'estuaries,' and y 'rivers,' the expressions xy and yx will indifferently represent" 'rivers that are estuaries,' or 'estuaries that are rivers,'"
* (2) xx = x, alternately x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = x [Absolute identity of meaning, Boole's "fundamental law of thought" cf page 49]
:: "Thus 'good, good" men, is equivalent to 'good' men".
'''Logical OR''': Boole defines the "collecting of parts into a whole or separate a whole into its parts" (Boole 1854:32). Here the connective "and" is used disjunctively, as is "or"; he presents a commutative law (3) and a distributive law (4) for the notion of "collecting". The notion of ''separating'' a part from the whole he symbolizes with the "-" operation; he defines a commutative (5) and distributive law (6) for this notion:
* (3) y + x = x + y [commutative law]
:: "Thus the expression 'men and women' is . . . equivalent with the expression" women and men. Let x represent 'men,' y, 'women' and let + stand for 'and' and 'or' . . ." 
* (4) z(x + y) = zx + zy [distributive law]
:: z = European, (x = "men, y = women): European men and women = European men and European women
* (5) x - y = -y + x [commutation law: separating a part from the whole] 
:: "All men (x) except Asiatics (y)" is represented by x - y. "All states (x) except monarchical states (y)" is represented by x - y
* (6) z(x - y) = zx - zy [distributive law]
Lastly is a notion of "identity" symbolized by "=". This allows for two axioms: (axiom 1): equals added to equals results in equals, (axiom 2): equals subtracted from equals results in equals.
* (7) Identity ("is", "are") e.g. x = y + z, "stars" = "suns" and "the planets"

'''Nothing "0" and Universe "1"''': He observes that the only two numbers that satisfy xx = x are 0 and 1. He then observes that 0 represents "Nothing" while "1" represents the "Universe" (of discourse).

'''The logical NOT''': Boole defines the contrary (logical NOT) as follows (his Proposition III): 
:"If x represent any class of objects, then will 1 - x represent the contrary or supplementary class of objects, i.e. the class including all objects which are not comprehended in the class x" (Boole 1854:48)
::If x = "men" then "1 - x" represents the "universe" less "men", i.e.  "not-men".

'''The notion of a particular as opposed to a universal''': To represent the notion of "some men", Boole writes the small letter "v" before the predicate-symbol "vx" some men.

'''Exclusive- and inclusive-OR''': Boole does not use these modern names, but he defines these as follows x(1-y) + y(1-x) and x + y(1-x), respectively; these agree with the formulas derived by means of the modern Boolean algebra.&lt;ref&gt;cf Boole 1842:55-57. The modern definition of logical OR(x, y) in terms of logical AND &amp;, and logical NOT ~ is: ~(~x &amp; ~y). In Boolean algebra this is represented by: 1-((1-x)*(1-y)) = 1 - (1 - 1*x - y*1 + x*y) = x + y - x*y = x + y*(1-x), which is Boole's expression. The exclusive-OR can be checked in a similar manner.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boole derives the law of contradiction ===
Armed with his "system" he derives the "principle of [non]contradiction" starting with his law of identity: x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = x. He subtracts x from both sides (his axiom 2), yielding x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - x = 0. He then factors out the x: x(x - 1) = 0. For example, if x = "men" then 1 - x represents NOT-men. So we have an example of the "Law of Contradiction":
:"Hence: x(1 - x) will represent the class whose members are at once "men," and" not men," and the equation [x(1 - x)=0] thus express the principle, that a class whose members are at the same time men and not men does not exist. In other words, that it is impossible for the same individual to be at the same time a man and not a man. . . . this is identically that "principle of contradiction" which Aristotle has described as the fundamental axiom of all philosophy. . . . what has been commonly regarded as the fundamental axiom of metaphysics is but the consequence of a law of thought, mathematical in its form." (with more explanation about this "dichotomy" comes about cf Boole 1854:49ff)

=== Boole defines the notion "domain (universe) of discourse"===
This notion is found throughout Boole's "Laws of Thought" e.g. 1854:28, where the symbol "1" (the integer 1) is used to represent "Universe" and "0" to represent "Nothing", and in far more detail later (pages 42ff):
:" Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. . . . Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse."

In his chapter "The Predicate Calculus" Kleene observes that the specification of the "domain" of discourse is "not a trivial assumption, since it is not always clearly satisfied in ordinary discourse . . . in mathematics likewise, logic can become pretty slippery when no D [domain] has been specified explicitly or implicitly, or the specification of a D [domain] is too vague'' (Kleene 1967:84).

==[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] (1837–38 lectures on Logic, published 1860): a 4th "Law of Reason and Consequent"==
As noted above, Hamilton specifies ''four'' laws—the three traditional plus the fourth "Law of Reason and Consequent"—as follows:
:"XIII. The Fundamental Laws of Thought, or the conditions of the thinkable, as commonly received, are four: -- 1. The Law of Identity; 2. The Law of Contradiction; 3. The Law of Exclusion or of Excluded Middle; and, 4. The Law of Reason and Consequent, or of [[Principle of Sufficient Reason|Sufficient Reason]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]], ([[Henry L. Mansel]] and [[John Veitch (poet)|John Veitch]], ed.), 1860 ''Lectures on Metaphysics and Logic, in Two Volumes. Vol. II. Logic'', Boston: Gould and Lincoln. Hamilton died in 1856, so this is an effort of his editors Mansel and Veitch. Most of the footnotes are additions and emendations by Mansel and Veitch -- see the preface for background information.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationale: "Logic is the science of the Laws of Thought as Thought"===
Hamilton opines that thought comes in two forms: "necessary" and "contingent" (Hamilton 1860:17). With regards the "necessary" form he defines its study as "logic": “Logic is the science of the necessary forms of thought” (Hamilton 1860:17). To define "necessary" he asserts that it implies the following four “qualities”:&lt;ref&gt;Lecture II LOGIC-I. ITS DEFINITION -HISTORICAL NOTICES OF OPINIONS REGARDING ITS OBJECT AND DOMAIN-II. ITS UTILITY Hamilton 1860:17-18&lt;/ref&gt;
:(1) “determined or necessitated by the nature of the thinking subject itself . . . it is subjectively, not objectively, determined;
:(2) “original and not acquired;
:(3) “universal; that is, it cannot be that it necessitates on some occasions, and does not necessitate on others.
:(4) "it must be a law; for a law is that which applies to all cases without exception, and from which a deviation is ever, and everywhere, impossible, or, at least, unallowed.  . . . This last condition, likewise, enables us to give the most explicit enunciation of the object-matter of Logic, in saying that Logic is the science of the Laws of Thought as Thought, or the science of the Formal Laws of Thought, or the science of the Laws of the Form of Thought; for all these are merely various expressions of the same thing."

===Hamilton's 4th law: "Infer nothing without ground or reason"===
Here's Hamilton's fourth law from his LECT. V. LOGIC. 60-61:

:"I now go on to the fourth law.

:"'''Par. XVII. Law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent''':

:"XVII. The thinking of an object, as actually characterized by positive or by negative attributes, is not left to the caprice of Understanding – the faculty of thought; but that faculty must be necessitated to this or that determinate act of thinking by a knowledge of something different from, and independent of; the process of thinking itself. This condition of our understanding is expressed by the law, as it is called, of Sufficient Reason ('''principium Rationis Sufficientis'''); but it is more properly denominated the law of Reason and Consequent ('''principium Rationis et Consecutionis'''). That knowledge by which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit something else, is called the ''logical reason ground,'' or ''antecedent''; that something else which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit, is called the ''logical consequent''; and the relation between the reason and consequent, is called the ''logical connection or consequence''. This law is expressed in the formula - Infer nothing without a ground or reason.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

:'''Relations between Reason and Consequent''': The relations between Reason and Consequent, when comprehended in a pure thought, are the following:
:1. When a reason is explicitly or implicitly given, then there must ¶ exist a consequent; and, ''vice versa'', when a consequent is given, there must also exist a reason.

::&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; See Schulze, ''Logik'', §19, and Krug, ''Logik'', §20, - ED.

:2. Where there is no reason there can be no consequent; and, ''vice versa'', where there is no consequent (either implicitly or explicitly) there can be no reason. That is, the concepts of reason and of consequent, as reciprocally relative, involve and suppose each other.

:'''The logical significance of this law''': The logical significance of the law of Reason and Consequent lies in this, - That in virtue of it, thought is constituted into a series of acts all indissolubly connected; each necessarily inferring the other. Thus it is that the distinction and opposition of possible, actual and necessary matter, which has been introduced into Logic, is a doctrine wholly extraneous to this science.

==Welton==
In the 19th century, the Aristotelian laws of thoughts, as well as sometimes the Leibnizian laws of thought, were standard material in logic textbooks, and J. Welton described them in this way:
{{Quotation|The Laws of Thought, Regulative Principles of Thought, or Postulates of Knowledge, are those fundamental, necessary, formal and a priori mental laws in agreement with which all valid thought must be carried on. They are a priori, that is, they result directly from the processes of reason exercised upon the facts of the real world. They are formal; for as the necessary laws of all thinking, they cannot, at the same time, ascertain the definite properties of any particular class of things, for it is optional whether we think of that class of things or not. They are necessary, for no one ever does, or can, conceive them reversed, or really violate them, because no one ever accepts a contradiction which presents itself to his mind as such.|Welton, ''A Manual of Logic'', 1891, Vol. I, p. 30.}}

==Russell (1903–1927)==
The sequel to [[Bertrand Russell]]'s 1903 "The Principles of Mathematics" became the three volume work named [[Principia Mathematica]] (hereafter PM), written jointly with [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. Immediately after he and Whitehead published PM he wrote his 1912 "The Problems of Philosophy". His "Problems" reflects "the central ideas of Russell's logic".&lt;ref&gt;Commentary by John Perry in Russell 1912, 1997 edition page ix&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Principles of Mathematics (1903)===
In his 1903 "Principles" Russell defines Symbolic or Formal Logic (he uses the terms synonymously) as "the study of the various general types of deduction" (Russell 1903:11). He asserts that "Symbolic Logic is essentially concerned with inference in general" (Russell 1903:12) and with a footnote indicates that he does not distinguish between inference and [[deductive reasoning|deduction]]; moreover he considers [[inductive reasoning|induction]] "to be either disguised deduction or a mere method of making plausible guesses" (Russell 1903:11). This opinion will change by 1912, when he deems his "principle of induction" to be par with the various "logical principles" that include the "Laws of Thought".

In his Part I "The Indefinables of Mathematics" Chapter II "Symbolic Logic" Part A "The Propositional Calculus" Russell reduces deduction ("propositional calculus") to 2 "indefinables" and 10 axioms:
:"17. We require, then, in the propositional calculus, no indefinable except the two kinds of implication [simple aka  "material"&lt;ref&gt;The "simple" type of implication, aka material implication, is the logical connective commonly symbolized by → or ⊃, e.g. p ⊃ q. As a connective it yields the truth value of "falsity" only when the truth value of statement p is "truth" when the truth value of statement q is "falsity"; in 1903 Russell is claiming that "A definition of implication is quite impossible" (Russell 1903:14). He will overcome this problem in PM with the simple definition of (p ⊃ q) =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; (NOT-p OR q).&lt;/ref&gt; and "formal"]-- remembering, however, that formal implication is a complex notion, whose analysis remains to be undertaken. As regards our two indefinables, we require certain indemonstrable propositions, which hitherto I have not succeeded in reducing to less ten (Russell 1903:15).

From these he ''claims'' to be able to ''derive'' the '''law of excluded middle''' and the '''law of contradiction''' but does not exhibit his derivations (Russell 1903:17). Subsequently, he and Whitehead honed these "primitive principles" and axioms into the nine found in PM, and here Russell actually ''exhibits'' these two derivations at ❋1.71 and ❋3.24, respectively.

===''The Problems of Philosophy'' (1912)===
By 1912 Russell in his "Problems" pays close attention to "induction" (inductive reasoning) as well as "deduction" (inference), both of which represent just two ''examples'' of "self-evident logical principles" that include the "Laws of Thought."&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:72, 1997 edition"/&gt;

'''Induction principle''': Russell devotes a chapter to his "induction principle". He describes it as coming in two parts: firstly, as a repeated collection of evidence (with no failures of association known) and therefore increasing probability that whenever A happens B follows; secondly, in a fresh instance when indeed A happens, B will indeed follow: i.e. "a sufficient number of cases of association will make the probability of a fresh association nearly a certainty, and will make it approach certainty without limit."&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1912:66, 1997 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

He then collects all the cases (instances) of the induction principle (e.g. case 1: A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = "the rising sun", B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = "the eastern sky"; case 2: A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = "the setting sun", B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = "the western sky"; case 3: etc.) into a "general" law of induction which he expresses as follows:
:"(a) The greater the number of cases in which a thing of the sort A has been found associated with a thing of the sort B, the more probable it is (if cases of failure of association are known) that A is always associated with B;
:"(b) Under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of the association of A with B will make it nearly certain that A is always associated with B, and will make this general law approach certainty without limit."&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1912:67, 1997 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

He makes an argument that this induction principle can neither be disproved or proved by experience,&lt;ref&gt;name="Russell 1912:70, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; the failure of disproof occurring because the law deals with ''probability'' of success rather than certainty; the failure of proof occurring because of unexamined cases that are yet to be experienced, i.e. they will occur (or not) in the future. "Thus we must either accept the inductive principle on the ground of its intrinsic evidence, or forgo all justification of our expectations about the future".&lt;ref&gt;name="Russell 1912:69, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In his next chapter ("On Our Knowledge of General Principles") Russell offers other principles that have this similar property: "which cannot be proved or disproved by experience, but are used in arguments which start from what is experienced." He asserts that these "have even greater evidence than the principle of induction . . . the knowledge of them has the same degree of certainty as the knowledge of the existence of sense-data. They constitute the means of drawing inferences from what is given in sensation".&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:70, 1997 edition"&gt;Russell 1912:70, 1997 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inference principle''': Russell then offers an example that he calls a "logical" principle. Twice previously he has asserted this principle, first as the 4th axiom in his 1903&lt;ref&gt;(4) A true hypothesis in an implication may be dropped, and the consequent asserted. This is a principle incapable of formal symbolic statement . . ." (Russell 1903:16)&lt;/ref&gt; and then as his first "primitive proposition" of PM: "❋1.1 Anything implied by a true elementary proposition is true".&lt;ref&gt;Principia Mathematica 1962 edition:94&lt;/ref&gt; Now he repeats it in his 1912 in a refined form: "Thus our principle states that if this implies that, and this is true, then that is true. In other words, 'anything implied by a true proposition is true', or 'whatever follows from a true proposition is true'.&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1912:71, 1997 edition&lt;/ref&gt; This principle he places great stress upon, stating that "this principle is really involved -- at least, concrete instances of it are involved -- in all demonstrations".&lt;ref name="Russell 1912:72, 1997 edition"/&gt;

He does not call his inference principle ''[[modus ponens]]'', but his formal, symbolic expression of it in PM (2nd edition 1927) is that of ''modus ponens''; modern logic calls this a "rule" as opposed to a "law".&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Alfred Tarski]] (Tarski 1946:47) distinguishes ''modus ponens'' as one of three "''rules'' of inference" or "''rules'' of proof", and he asserts that these "must not be mistaken for logical laws". The two other such "rules" are that of "definition" and "substitution"; see the entry under '''Tarski'''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the quotation that follows, the symbol "⊦" is the "assertion-sign" (cf PM:92); “⊦" means "it is true that", therefore “⊦p” where "p" is "the sun is rising" means "it is true that the sun is rising", alternately "The statement 'The sun is rising' is true". The "implication" symbol "⊃" is commonly read "if p then q", or "p implies q" (cf PM:7). Embedded in this notion of "implication" are two "primitive ideas", "the Contradictory Function" (symbolized by NOT, "~") and "the Logical Sum or Disjunction" (symbolized by OR, "⋁"); these appear as "primitive propositions" ❋1.7 and ❋1.71 in PM (PM:97). With these two "primitive propositions" Russell defines "p ⊃ q" to have the formal logical equivalence "NOT-p OR q" symbolized by "~p ⋁ q":
:"''Inference''. The process of inference is as follows: a proposition "p" is asserted, and a proposition "p implies q" is asserted, and then as a sequel the proposition "q" is asserted. The trust in inference is the belief that if the two former assertions are not in error, the final assertion is not in error. Accordingly, whenever, in symbols, where p and q have of course special determination
::" “⊦p” and “⊦(p ⊃ q)”
:" have occurred, then “⊦q” will occur if it is desired to put it on record. The process of the inference cannot be reduced to symbols. Its sole record is the occurrence of “⊦q”. . . . An inference is the dropping of a true premiss; it is the dissolution of an implication".&lt;ref&gt;Principia Mathematica 2nd edition (1927), pages 8 and 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, in a long "string" of inferences, after each inference we can '''detach''' the "consequent" “⊦q” from the symbol string “⊦p, ⊦(p⊃q)” and not carry these symbols forward in an ever-lengthening string of symbols. 
   
'''The three traditional "laws" (principles) of thought''': Russell goes on to assert other principles, of which the above logical principle is "only one". He asserts that "some of these must be granted before any argument or proof becomes possible. When some of them have been granted, others can be proved." Of these various "laws" he asserts that "for no very good reason, three of these principles have been singled out by tradition under the name of 'Laws of Thought'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Russell 1912:72, 1997 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; And these he lists as follows:
   
: "(1) ''The law of identity'': 'Whatever is, is.'
   
: (2) ''The law of contradiction'': 'Nothing can both be and not be.'
   
: (3) ''The law of excluded middle'': 'Everything must either be or not be.'"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Rationale''': Russell opines that "the name 'laws of thought' is ... misleading, for what is important is not the fact that we think in accordance with these laws, but the fact that things behave in accordance with them; in other words, the fact that when we think in accordance with them we think ''truly''."&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1997:73 reprint of Russell 1912&lt;/ref&gt; But he rates this a "large question" and expands it in two following chapters where he begins with an investigation of the notion of "a priori" (innate, built-in) knowledge, and ultimately arrives at his acceptance of the Platonic "world of universals". In his investigation he comes back now and then to the three traditional laws of thought, singling out the law of contradiction in particular: "The conclusion that the law of contradiction is a law of ''thought'' is nevertheless erroneous . . . [rather], the law of contradiction is about things, and not merely about thoughts . . . a fact concerning the things in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1997:88-89 reprint of Russell 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

His argument begins with the statement that the three traditional laws of thought are "samples of self-evident principles". For Russell the matter of "self-evident"&lt;ref&gt;Russell asserts they are "self-evident" a couple times, at Russell 1912, 1967:72&lt;/ref&gt; merely introduces the larger question of how we derive our knowledge of the world. He cites the "historic controversy . . . between the two schools called respectively 'empiricists' [ [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[David Hume|Hume]] ] and 'rationalists' [ [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]]" (these philosophers are his examples).&lt;ref name="Russell 1912, 1967:73"&gt;Russell 1912, 1967:73&lt;/ref&gt; Russell asserts that the rationalists "maintained that, in addition to what we know by experience, there are certain 'innate ideas' and 'innate principles', which we know independently of experience";&lt;ref name="Russell 1912, 1967:73"/&gt; to eliminate the possibility of babies having innate knowledge of the "laws of thought", Russell renames this sort of knowledge ''a priori''. And while Russell agrees with the empiricists that "Nothing can be known to ''exist'' except by the help of experience,",&lt;ref&gt;"That is to say, if we wish to prove that something of which we have no direct experience exists, we must have among our premises the existence of one or more things of which we have direct experience"; Russell 1912, 1967:75&lt;/ref&gt; he also agrees with the rationalists that some knowledge is ''a priori'', specifically "the propositions of logic and pure mathematics, as well as the fundamental propositions of ethics".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1912, 1967:80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

This question of how such ''a priori'' knowledge can exist directs Russell to an investigation into the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], which after careful consideration he rejects as follows:
:". . . there is one main objection which seems fatal to any attempt to deal with the problem of ''a priori'' knowledge by his method. The thing to be accounted for is our certainty that the facts must always conform to logic and arithmetic. . . . Thus Kant's solution unduly limits the scope of ''a priori'' propositions, in addition to failing in the attempt at explaining their certainty''".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1912, 1967:87,88&lt;/ref&gt;

His objections to Kant then leads Russell to accept the 'theory of ideas' of [[Plato]], "in my opinion . . . one of the most successful attempts hitherto made.";&lt;ref name="Russell 1912, 1967:93"&gt;Russell 1912, 1967:93&lt;/ref&gt; he asserts that " . . . we must examine our knowledge of universals . . . where we shall find that [this consideration] solves the problem of ''a priori'' knowledge.".&lt;ref name="Russell 1912, 1967:93"/&gt;

=== Principia Mathematica ( Part I: 1910 first edition, 1927 2nd edition) ===
Unfortunately, Russell's "Problems" does not offer an example of a "minimum set" of principles that would apply to human reasoning, both inductive and deductive. But PM does at least provide ''an'' example set (but not the minimum; see '''Post''' below) that is sufficient for ''deductive'' reasoning by means of the [[propositional calculus]] (as opposed to reasoning by means of the more-complicated [[predicate calculus]])—a total of 8 principles at the start of "Part I: Mathematical Logic". Each of the formulas :❋1.2 to :❋1.6 is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] (true no matter what the truth-value of p, q, r ... is). What is missing in PM's treatment is a formal rule of substitution;&lt;ref&gt;In his 1944 ''Russell's mathematical logic'', [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] observes that "What is missing, above all, is a precise statement of the syntax of the formalism. Syntactical considerations are omitted even in cases where they are necessary for the cogency of the proofs . . . The matter is especially doubtful for the rule of substitution and of replacing defined symbols by their ''definiens'' . . . it is chiefly the rule of substitution which would have to be proved" (Gödel 1944:124)&lt;/ref&gt; in his 1921 PhD thesis [[Emil Post]] fixes this deficiency (see '''Post''' below). In what follows the formulas are written in a more modern format than that used in PM; the names are given in PM). 
:❋1.1 Anything implied by a true elementary proposition is true.
:❋1.2 Principle of Tautology: (p ⋁ p) ⊃ p
:❋1.3 Principle of [logical] Addition: q ⊃ (p ⋁ q)
:❋1.4 Principle of Permutation: (p ⋁ q) ⊃ (q ⋁ p)
:❋1.5 Associative Principle: p ⋁ (q ⋁ r) ⊃ q ⋁ (p ⋁ r) [''redundant'']
:❋1.6 Principle of [logical] Summation: (q ⊃ r) ⊃ ((p ⋁ q) ⊃ (p ⋁ r))
:❋1.7 [logical NOT]: If p is an elementary proposition, ~p is an elementary proposition.
:❋1.71 [logical inclusive OR]: If p and q are elementary propositions, (p ⋁ q) is an elementary proposition.
Russell sums up these principles with "This completes the list of primitive propositions required for the theory of deduction as applied to elementary propositions" (PM:97).

Starting from these eight tautologies and a tacit use of the "rule" of substitution, PM then derives over a hundred different formulas, among which are the '''Law of Excluded Middle ❋1.71''', and the '''Law of Contradiction ❋3.24''' (this latter requiring a definition of logical AND symbolized by the modern ⋀: (p ⋀ q) =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; ~(~p ⋁ ~q). (PM uses the "dot" symbol &lt;sub&gt;▪&lt;/sub&gt; for logical AND)).

==Ladd-Franklin (1914): "principle of exclusion" and the "principle of exhaustion"==
At about the same time (1912) that Russell and Whitehead were finishing the last volume of their Principia Mathematica, and the publishing of Russell's "The Problems of Philosophy" at least two logicians ([[Louis Couturat]], [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]]) were asserting that two "laws" (principles) of contradiction" and "excluded middle" are necessary to specify "contradictories"; Ladd-Franklin renamed these the principles of [[Mutually exclusive events|exclusion]] and [[Collectively exhaustive events|exhaustion]]. The following appears as a footnote on page 23 of Couturat 1914:
:"As Mrs. LADD·FRANKLlN has truly remarked (BALDWIN, Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, article "Laws of Thought"), the principle of contradiction is not sufficient to define contradictories; the principle of excluded middle must be added which equally deserves the name of principle of contradiction. This is why Mrs. LADD-FRANKLIN proposes to call them respectively the principle of exclusion and the principle of exhaustion, inasmuch as, according to the first, two contradictory terms are exclusive (the one of the other); and, according to the second, they are exhaustive (of the universe of discourse)."

In other words, the creation of "contradictories" represents a [[dichotomy]], i.e. the "splitting" of a [[universe of discourse]] into two classes (collections) that have the following two properties: they are (i) mutually exclusive and (ii) (collectively) exhaustive.&lt;ref&gt;Cf Nagel and Newman 1958:110; in their treatment they apply this dichotomy to the collection of "sentences" (formulas) generated by a logical system such as that used by [[Kurt Gödel]] in his paper "On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematical and Related Systems". They call the two classes K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and define logical contradiction ~S as follows: "A formula having the form ~S is placed in [class] K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, if S is in K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; otherwise, it is placed in K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, no one thing (drawn from the universe of discourse) can simultaneously be a member of both classes (law of non-contradiction), ''but'' [and] every single thing (in the universe of discourse) must be a member of one class or the other (law of excluded middle).

==Post (1921): The propositional calculus is consistent and complete==
As part of his PhD thesis "Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions" [[Emil Post]] proved "the system of elementary propositions of Principia [PM]" i.e. its "propositional calculus"&lt;ref&gt;In the introductory comments to Post 1921 written by van Heijenoort page 264, van H observes that "The propositional calculus, carved out of the system of ''Principia Mathematica'', is systematically studied in itself, as a well-defined fragment of logic".&lt;/ref&gt; described by PM's first 8 "primitive propositions" to be ''consistent''. The definition of "consistent" is this: that by means of the deductive "system" at hand (its stated axioms, laws, rules) it is impossible to derive (display) both a formula S and its contradictory ~S (i.e. its logical negation) (Nagel and Newman 1958:50). To demonstrate this formally, Post had to add a primitive proposition to the 8 primitive propositions of PM, a "rule" that specified the notion of "substitution" that was missing in the original PM of 1910.&lt;ref&gt;In a footnote he stated "This operation is not explicitly stated in ''Principia'' but is pointed out to be necessary by Russell (1919, p. 151). Indeed: "The legitimacy of substitutions of this kind has to be insured by means of a non-formal principle of inference.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This footnote 1 states: "&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; No such principle is enunciated in Principia Mathematica or in M. Nicod's article mentioned above. But this would seem to be an omission". cf Russell 1919:151 referenced by Post 1921 in van Heijenoort 1967:267)&lt;/ref&gt;

Given PM's tiny set of "primitive propositions" and the proof of their consistency, Post then proves that this system ("propositional calculus" of PM) is ''complete'', meaning every possible [[truth table]] can be generated in the "system":
:". . .every truth system has a representation in the system of Principia while every complete system, that is one having all possible truth tables, is equivalent to it. . . . We thus see that complete systems are equivalent to the system of ''Principia'' not only in the truth table development but also postulationally. As other systems are in a sense degenerate forms of complete systems we can conclude that no new logical systems are introduced."&lt;ref&gt;Post 1921 in van Heijenoort 1967:267)&lt;/ref&gt;

===A minimum set of axioms? The matter of their independence===
Then there is the matter of "independence" of the axioms. In his commentary before Post 1921, [[Jean van Heijenoort|van Heijenoort]] states that [[Paul Bernays]] solved the matter in 1918 (but published in 1926) -- the formula ❋1.5 Associative Principle: p ⋁ (q ⋁ r) ⊃ q ⋁ (p ⋁ r) can be proved with the other four. As to what system of "primitive-propositions" is the minimum, van Heijenoort states that the matter was "investigated by Zylinski (1925), Post himself (1941), and Wernick (1942)" but van Heijenoort does not answer the question.&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary before Post 1921 in van Heijenoort:264-265&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Model theory versus proof theory: Post's proof ===
Kleene (1967:33) observes that "logic" can be "founded" in two ways, first as a "model theory", or second by a formal "proof" or "axiomatic theory"; "the two formulations, that of model theory and that of proof theory, give equivalent results"(Kleene 1967:33). This foundational choice, and their equivalence also applies to ''predicate logic'' (Kleene 1967:318). 
 
In his introduction to Post 1921, van Heijenoort observes that both the "truth-table and the axiomatic approaches are clearly presented".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort:264&lt;/ref&gt; This matter of a proof of consistency both ways (by a model theory, by axiomatic proof theory) comes up in the more-congenial version of Post's consistency proof that can be found in Nagel and Newman 1958 in their chapter V "An Example of a Successful Absolute Proof of Consistency". In the main body of the text they use a model to achieve their consistency proof (they also state that the system is complete but do not offer a proof) (Nagel &amp; Newman 1958:45-56). But their text promises the reader a proof that is axiomatic rather than relying on a model, and in the Appendix they deliver this proof based on the notions of a division of formulas into two classes K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that are '''mutually exclusive''' and '''exhaustive''' (Nagel &amp; Newman 1958:109-113)
&lt;!-- Their proofs adopt the same four axioms as those of Post 1921, minus the axiom ❋1.5 shown to be redundant by Bernays 1926. 
* First they specify the symbols called "variables" (e.g. p, q, r . . .), 
* Second, they assert the symbols they call "sentential connectives":  "~" (NOT), "⋁" (OR), "⊃" (IF . . . THEN . . .), and "▪" (AND), and two "signs of punctuation" "(", and ")". 
* Third they specify the ''Formation Rules'' that specify how to construct "valid" formulas from the variable-, connective- and punctuation-symbol : If S is a formula then ~(S) is a formula, If S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are formulas then (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⋁ S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊃ S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ▪ S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)is a formula.  
* Fourth are the two "transformation rules", the now-familiar Rules of Substitution and Detachment (''modus ponens''). 
Given this "system" they then propose to prove the "system" consistent. "The actual procedure is elegant", they state. "It consists in finding a characteristic or structural property of formulas [i.e. the 4 axioms and all "valid" logical formulas derived from them via the transformation rules] which satisfies the three following conditions". The property must be (1) common to all four axioms, AND (2) "hereditary" under the Transformation Rules (i.e. every axiom, and every formula derived by means of the ''Transformation'' rules from the axioms must have this property), BUT (3) at least one formula derived by the ''Formation'' rules does not have this property.

The property they pick is "tautologous", meaning the formula's truth value ''always'' evaluates to "true". They exhibit (p ⋁ q) as a properly-formed formula, but one that is not tautologus -- if p's truth value is "falsity" and q's truth value is "falsity" then (p ⋁ q)truth value is "falsity". They offer proof of the inheritability of "tautolgous" in appendices.--&gt;

==Gödel (1930): The first-order predicate calculus is complete==
The (restricted) "first-order predicate calculus" is the "system of logic" that adds to the propositional logic (cf '''Post''', above) the notion of "subject-predicate" i.e. the subject x is drawn from a domain (universe) of discourse and the predicate is a logical function f(x): x as subject and f(x) as predicate (Kleene 1967:74). Although Gödel's proof involves the same notion of "completeness" as does the proof of Post, Gödel's proof is far more difficult; what follows is a discussion of the axiom set.

=== Completeness ===
[[Kurt Gödel]] in his 1930 doctoral dissertation "The completeness of the axioms of the functional calculus of logic" proved that in this "calculus" (i.e. restricted predicate logic with or without equality) that every valid formula is "either refutable or satisfiable"&lt;ref&gt;cf introduction to Gödel 1930 by van Heijenoort 1967:582&lt;/ref&gt; or what amounts to the same thing: every valid formula is provable and therefore the logic is complete. Here is Gödel's definition of whether or not the "restricted functional calculus" is "complete":
:". . . whether it actually suffices for the derivation of ''every'' logico-mathematical proposition, or where, perhaps, it is conceivable that there are true propositions (which may be provable by means of other principles) that cannot be derived in the system under consideration."&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1930 in van Heijenoort 1967:582&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first-order predicate calculus===
This particular predicate calculus is "restricted to the first order". To the propositional calculus it adds two special symbols that symbolize the generalizations "for all" and "there exists (at least one)" that extend over the domain of discourse. The calculus requires only the first notion "for all", but typically includes both: (1) the notion "for all x" or "for every x" is symbolized in the literature as variously as (x), ∀x, ∏x etc., and the (2) notion of "there exists (at least one x)" variously symbolized as Ex, ∃x.

The '''restriction''' is that the generalization "for all" applies only to the ''variables'' (objects x, y, z etc. drawn from the domain of discourse) and not to functions, in other words the calculus will permit ∀xf(x) ("for all creatures x, x is a bird") but not ∀f∀x(f(x)) [but if "equality" is added to the calculus it will permit ∀f:f(x); see below under '''Tarski'''].  Example:
: Let the predicate "function" f(x) be "x is a mammal", and the subject-domain (or [[universe of discourse]]) (cf Kleene 1967:84) be the category "bats":
: The formula ∀xf(x) yields the truth value "truth" (read: "For all instances x of objects 'bats', 'x is a mammal'" is a truth, i.e. "All bats are mammals"); 
: But if the instances of x are drawn from a domain "winged creatures" then ∀xf(x) yields the truth value "false" (i.e. "For all instances x of 'winged creatures', 'x is a mammal'" has a truth value of "falsity"; "Flying insects are mammals" is false);
: However over the broad domain of discourse "all winged creatures" (e.g. "birds" + "flying insects" + "flying squirrels" + "bats") we ''can'' assert ∃xf(x) (read: "There exists at least one winged creature that is a mammal'"; it yields a truth value of "truth" because the objects x can come from the category "bats" and perhaps "flying squirrels" (depending on how we define "winged"). But the formula yields "falsity" when the domain of discourse is restricted to "flying insects" or "birds" or both "binsects" and "birds".

Kleene remarks that "the predicate calculus (without or with equality) fully accomplishes (for first order theories) what has been conceived to be the role of logic" (Kleene 1967:322).

===A new axiom: Aristotle's dictum – "the maxim of all and none" ===
This first half of this axiom -- "the maxim of all" will appear as the first of two additional axioms in Gödel's axiom set. The "dictum of Aristotle" ([[dictum de omni et nullo]]) is sometimes called "the maxim of all and none" but is really two "maxims" that assert: "What is true of all (members of the domain) is true of some (members of the domain)", and "What is not true of all (members of the domain) is true of none (of the members of the domain)".

The "dictum" appears in Boole 1854 a couple places:
:"It may be a question whether that formula of reasoning, which is called the dictum of Aristotle, ''de Omni et nullo'', expresses a primary law of human reasoning or not; but it is no question that it expresses a general truth in Logic" (1854:4)

But later he seems to argue against it:&lt;ref&gt;cf Boole 1854:226 ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC. CHAPTER XV. [CHAP. XV. THE ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC AND ITS MODERN EXTENSIONS, EXAMINED BY THE METHOD OF THIS TREATISE&lt;/ref&gt;
:"[Some principles of] general principle of an axiomatic nature, such as the "dictum of Aristotle:" Whatsoever is affirmed or denied of the genus may in the same sense be affirmed or denied of any species included under that genus. . . . either state directly, but in an abstract form, the argument which they are supposed to elucidate, and, so stating that argument, affirm its validity; or involve in their expression technical terms which, after definition, conduct us again to the same point, viz. the abstract statement of the supposed allowable forms of inference."

But the first half of this "dictum" (''dictum de omni'') is taken up by Russell and Whitehead in PM, and by [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] in his version (1927) of the "first order predicate logic"; his (system) includes a principle that Hilbert calls "Aristotle's dictum" &lt;ref&gt;He derives this and a "principle of the excluded middle" ~((x)f(x))→(Ex)~f(x) from his "ε-axiom" cf Hilbert 1927 "The Foundations of Mathematics", cf van Heijenoort 1967:466&lt;/ref&gt; 
:(x)f(x) → f(y)

This axiom also appears in the modern axiom set offered by [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] (Kleene 1967:387), as his "∀-schema", one of two axioms (he calls them "postulates") required for the predicate calculus; the other being the "∃-schema" f(y) ⊃ ∃xf(x) that reasons from the particular f(y) to the existence of at least one subject x that satisfies the predicate f(x); both of these requires adherence to a defined domain (universe) of discourse.

=== Gödel's restricted predicate calculus ===
To supplement the four (down from five; see '''Post''') axioms of the propositional calculus, Gödel 1930 adds the ''dictum de omni'' as the first of two additional axioms. Both this "dictum" and the second axiom, he claims in a footnote, derive from ''Principia Mathematica''. Indeed, PM includes both as
:❋10.1 ⊦ ∀xf(x) ⊃ f(y) ["I.e. what is true in all cases is true in any one case"&lt;ref&gt;1962 edition of PM 2nd edition 1927:139&lt;/ref&gt; ("Aristotle's dictum", rewritten in more-modern symbols)]
:❋10.2 ⊦∀x(p ⋁ f(x)) ⊃ (p ⋁ ∀xf(x)) [rewritten in more-modern symbols]
The latter asserts that the logical sum (i.e. ⋁, OR) of a simple proposition p and a predicate ∀xf(x) implies the logical sum of each separately. But PM derives both of these from six primitive propositions of ❋9, which in the second edition of PM is discarded and replaced with four new "Pp" (primitive principles) of ❋8 (see in particular ❋8.2, and Hilbert derives the first from his "logical ε-axiom" in his 1927 and does not mention the second. How Hilbert and Gödel came to adopt these two as axioms is unclear.

Also required are two more "rules" of detachment ("modus ponens") applicable to predicates.

==Tarski (1946): Leibniz's Law==
[[Alfred Tarski]] in his 1946 (2nd edition) "Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences" cites a number of what he deems "universal laws" of the sentential calculus,  three "rules" of inference, and one fundamental law of identity (from which he derives four more laws). The traditional "laws of thought" are included in his long listing of "laws" and "rules". His treatment is, as the title of his book suggests, limited to the "Methodology of the Deductive Sciences".

'''Rationale''': In his introduction (2nd edition) he observes that what began with an application of logic to mathematics has been widened to "the whole of human knowledge": 
:"[I want to present] a clear idea of that powerful trend of contemporary thought which is concentrated about modern logic. This trend arose originally from the somewhat limited task of stabilizing the foundations of mathematics. In its present phase, however, it has much wider aims. For it seeks to create a unified conceptual apparatus which would supply a common basis for the whole of human knowledge.".&lt;ref&gt;Tarski 1946:ix, 1995 edition&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- '''Laws of the sentential calculus''': Tarski defines a "law" as follows (cf p.&amp;nbsp;37ff):
:"Every scientific theory is a system of sentences which are accepted as true and which may be called LAWS or ASSERTED STATEMENTS, or, for short, simply STATEMENTS".&lt;ref&gt;Tarski 1946:3, 1995 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

(After the first "law", for brevity he omits the universal qualifier "For any p, q , . . ."). The symbol "~" indicates logical NOT, the symbol ⋀ indicates logical AND, the symbol ⋁ indicates logical OR, the symbol ↔ indicates logical equivalence ("if and only if"). He uses "matrices" (truth tables) to define these symbols; truth tables can then be used to demonstrate that each of these "laws" is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] (true no matter what truth value is assigned to each "variable" p, q, r): 
*Law of Simplification for logical multiplication [logical AND]: For any p and q: (p ⋀ q) → p
*'''Law of Identity: p → p'''.
*Law of Simplification for logical addition [logical OR]: p → (q ⋁ p)
*Law of [? logical equivalence]: [(p → q) ⋀ (q → p)] →  p ↔ q.
*Law of the Hypothetical Syllogism: [(p → q) ⋀ (q → r)] → (p → r).
*'''Law of Contradiction: ~[p ⋀ (~p)]'''
*'''Law of Excluded Middle: p ⋁ (~p)'''
*Law of Tautology for logical multiplication [logical AND]: (p ⋀ p) ↔ p
*Law of Tautology for logical addition [logical OR]: (p ⋁ p) ↔ p
*Law of Commutation [for logical AND]: (p ⋀ q) ↔ (q ⋀ p)
*Law of Commutation [for logical OR]: (p ⋁ q) ↔ (q ⋁ p)
*Law of Association [for logical AND]: (p ⋀ (q ⋀ r) ↔ [(p ⋀ q) ⋀ r]
*Law of Association [for logical OR]: (p ⋁ (q ⋁ r) ↔ [(p ⋁ q) ⋁ r]

'''Rules of inference''': Tarski then defines what he calls three "rules of inference" ("rules of proof") with this definition of what a "rule" is as opposed to a "law":
:"These rules, which must not be mistaken for logical laws, amount to directions as to how sentences already known as true may be transformed so as to yield new true sentences".&lt;ref&gt;Tarski 1946:47, 1995 edition&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rule of Definition
*Rule of [[Substitution]]
*Rule of Detachment ("[[modus ponens]] rule") ---&gt;

===Law of identity (Leibniz's Law, equality)===
To add the notion of "equality" to the "propositional calculus" (this new notion not to be confused with ''logical'' equivalence symbolized by ↔, ⇄, "if and only if (iff)", "biconditional", etc.) Tarski (cf p54-57) symbolizes what he calls  "Leibniz's law" with the symbol "=". This extends the domain (universe) of discourse and the types of functions to numbers and mathematical formulas (Kleene 1967:148ff, Tarski 1946:54ff).

In a nutshell: given that "x has every property that y has", we can write "x = y", and this formula will have a truth value of "truth" or "falsity". Tarski states this Leibniz's Law as follows:
* I. Leibniz' Law: x = y, if, and only if, x has every property which y has, and y has every property which x has.
He then derives some other "laws" from this law: 
* II. Law of Reflexivity: Everything is equal to itself: x = x. [Proven at PM ❋13.15]
* III. Law of Symmetry: If x = y, then y = x. [Proven at PM ❋13.16]
* IV. Law of Transitivity: If x = y and y = z, then x = z. [Proven at PM ❋13.17]
* V. If x = z and y = z, then x = y. [Proven at PM ❋13.172]

Principia Mathematica ''defines'' the notion of equality as follows (in modern symbols); note that the generalization "for all" extends over predicate-functions f( ):
:❋13.01. x = y =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; ∀f:(f(x) → f(y)) ("This definition states that x and y are to be called identical when every predicate function satisfied by x is satisfied by y"&lt;ref&gt;cf PM ❋13 IDENTITY, "Summary of ❋13" PM 1927 edition 1962:168&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilbert 1927:467 adds only two axioms of equality, the first is x = x, the second is (x = y) → ((f(x) → f(y)); the "for all f" is missing (or implied). Gödel 1930 defines equality similarly to PM :❋13.01. Kleene 1967 adopts the two from Hilbert 1927 plus two more (Kleene 1967:387).

== Contemporary developments ==
All of the above "systems of logic" are considered to be "classical" meaning propositions and predicate expressions are two-valued, with either the truth value "truth" or "falsity" but not both(Kleene 1967:8 and 83). While intuitionistic logic falls into the "classical" category, it objects to extending the "for all" operator to the Law of Excluded Middle; it allows instances of the "Law", but not its generalization to an infinite domain of discourse.

=== Intuitionistic logic ===
'[[Intuitionistic logic]]', sometimes more generally called '''constructive logic''', is a [[paracomplete]] [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]] that differs from [[classical logic]] by replacing the traditional concept of truth with the concept of [[constructive proof|constructive provability]].

The ''generalized'' law of the excluded middle is not part of the execution of [[intuitionistic logic]], but neither is it negated. Intuitionistic logic merely forbids the use of the operation as part of what it defines as a "[[constructive proof]]", which is not the same as demonstrating it invalid (this is comparable to the use of a particular building style in which screws are forbidden and only nails are allowed; it does not necessarily disprove or even question the existence or usefulness of screws, but merely demonstrates what can be built without them).

=== Paraconsistent Logic ===
'[[Paraconsistent logic]]' refers to so-called contradiction-tolerant logical systems in which a contradiction does not necessarily result in [[trivialism]]. In other words, the [[principle of explosion]] is not valid in such logics. Some (namely the dialetheists) argue that the law of non-contradiction is denied by [[dialetheic logic]]. They are motivated by certain paradoxes which seem to imply a limit of the law of non-contradiction, namely the [[Liar Paradox]]. In order to avoid a trivial logical system and still allow certain contradictions to be true, dialetheists will employ a paraconsistent logic of some kind.

=== Modal propositional calculi ===
(cf Kleene 1967:49): These "[[modal logic|calculi]]" include the symbols ⎕A, meaning "A is necessary" and ◊A meaning "A is possible". Kleene states that:
:"These notions enter in domains of thinking where there are understood to be two different kinds of "truth", one more universal or compelling than the other . . . A zoologist might declare that it is impossible that salamanders or any other living creatures can survive fire; but possible (though untrue) that unicorns exist, and possible (though improbable) that abominable snowmen exist."

'[[Fuzzy logic]]' is a form of [[many-valued logic]]; it deals with [[reasoning]] that is approximate rather than fixed and exact.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}
'''Matter''' is the substrate from which physical existence is derived, remaining more or less constant amid changes. The word "matter" is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''māteria'', meaning "wood", or “timber”, in the sense "material", as distinct from "mind" or "form".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "matter"&lt;/ref&gt; The image of wood came to Latin as a calque from the Greek philosophical usage of ''hyle'' (ὕλη).

==Ancient Greek philosophy==
In ancient [[Greek philosophy]], ''[[arche]]'' (ἀρχή) is the beginning or the first principle of the world. [[Thales of Miletus]] claimed that the first principle of all things is water. His theory was supported by the observation of moisture throughout the world and coincided with his theory that the earth floated on water.

Thales's theory was refuted by his pupil and successor, [[Anaximander]]. Anaximander noted that water could not be the arche because it could not give rise to its opposite, fire. Anaximander claimed that none of the elements (earth, fire, air, water) could be arche for the same reason. Instead, he proposed the existence of the [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]], an indefinite substance from which all things are born and to which all things will return.

[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], Anaximander's pupil, advanced yet another theory. He returns to the elemental theory, but this time posits air, rather than water, as the arche. Anaximenes suggests that all is made from air through either rarefication or condensation (thinning or thickening). Rarefied, air becomes fire; condensed, it becomes first wind, then cloud, water, earth, and stone in order.

[[Pythagoras of Samos]], a mathematician, mystic, and scientist, taught that number, rather than matter, constitutes the true nature of things. He seems to have influenced [[Socrates|Socrates']] [[ideal form]].

[[Heraclitus]] held that all is flux. In such a system there is no need for or possibility of matter.
[[Leucippus]] held that there exist indivisible particles, [[atoms]], underlying existence.

[[Empedocles]] held that there are [[Classical element|four elements]], from which things are derived, [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] and [[Air (classical element)|Air]]. Some added a fifth element, the [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], from which the heavens were derived. [[Socrates]] accepted (or at least did not reject) that list, as seen from [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], which identified the five elements with the [[Platonic solids]]. Earth was associated with the [[cube]], air with the [[octahedron]], water with the [[icosahedron]], fire with the [[tetrahedron]], and the heavens with the [[dodecahedron]].

[[Aristotle]], rejecting the atomic theory, instead analyzed the four terrestrial elements with the sense of touch:
* Air is primarily wet and secondarily hot.
* Fire is primarily hot and secondarily dry.
* Earth is primarily dry and secondarily cold.
* Water is primarily cold and secondarily wet.

He developed Socrates' ideal form into a theory which aimed to explain existence through the composition of matter and form. He conceived of matter as a passive possibility that something might be actualized by an active principle, a substantial form, giving it real existence. The theory of matter and form came to be known as [[Hylomorphism]].

Aristotle's ideas had little impact on the ancient world. The rise of [[Stoicism]] represented the return to earlier ideas. Their [[Categories (Stoic)|categories]] were an attempt to explain all existence without reference to anything [[incorporeal]].

[[Philo]] held that matter is the basis of evil.

[[Plotinus]] revived the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. 

==Medieval philosophy==
Many [[Christians]], such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], accepted Plotinus as the greatest of the [[pagan]] [[philosophers]]. Parts of Plotinus' ''[[Six Enneads]]'' were translated into [[Arabic]] as the ''[[Theology of Aristotle]]'', leading to a blossoming of Aristotle's philosophy in the [[Islamic]] world. This Islamic version of Aristotle eventually reached the [[University of Paris]] and the attention of [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophy, and the work of [[Thomas Aquinas]].

==Modern science==
From a philosophical viewpoint, the term "matter" still is used to distinguish the material aspects of the universe from those of the spirit.&lt;ref name=Bergson&gt;{{cite book |title=Matter and Memory |chapter=Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9XAeb1mx6gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPR7,M1 |author=Henri Bergson| authorlink=Henri Bergson |isbn=0-486-43415-X |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=2004 |edition=Reprint of edition of 1904}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of modern [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] marked a return to the atomic theories of Leucippus.  [[Quantum physics]] and [[special relativity]] however, complicate the picture through the identification of matter and [[energy]], [[Elementary particle|particle]] and [[wave]].

{{Spacetime|cTopic=Types}}
The '''Minkowski diagram''', also known as a '''spacetime diagram''', was developed in 1908 by [[Hermann Minkowski]] and provides an illustration of the properties of space and time in the [[special theory of relativity]]. It allows a qualitative understanding of the corresponding phenomena like [[time dilation]] and [[length contraction]] without mathematical equations.

Minkowski diagrams are two-dimensional graphs that depict events as happening in a [[universe]] consisting of one space dimension and one time dimension. Unlike a regular distance-time graph, the distance will be displayed on the horizontal axis and time on the vertical axis. Additionally, the time and space [[units of measurement]] are chosen in such a way that an object moving at the speed of light is depicted as following a 45° angle to the diagram's axes.

In this way, each object, like an observer or a vehicle, traces a certain line in the diagram, which is called its [[world line]]. Also, each point in the diagram represents a certain position in space and time, and is called an '''event''', regardless of whether anything relevant happens there.

== Basics ==
=== Position versus time graphs ===
[[File:Distance-time graph example.svg|thumb]]
In the study of 1-dimensional kinematics, position vs. time graphs (also called distance vs. time graphs, or p-t graphs) provide a useful means to describe motion. The specific features of the motion of objects are demonstrated by the shape and the slope of the lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What are position vs. time graphs? |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/one-dimensional-motion/displacement-velocity-time/a/position-vs-time-graphs |publisher=Khan Academy |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the accompanying figure, the plotted object moves away from the origin at a uniform speed of 1.66&amp;nbsp;m/s for six seconds, halts for five seconds, then returns to the origin over a period of seven seconds at a non-constant speed.

=== Spacetime diagrams ===
At its most basic level, a spacetime diagram is merely a time vs position graph, with the directions of the axes in a usual p-t graph exchanged, that is, the vertical axis refers to temporal and the horizontal axis to spatial coordinate values. Especially when used in STR, the temporal axes of a spacetime diagram are scaled with the speed of light {{mvar|c}}, and thus are often labeled by {{mvar|ct.}} This changes the dimension of the addressed physical quantity from &lt;''Time''&gt; to &lt;''Length''&gt;, in accordance to the dimension associated to the spatial axes, which are frequently labeled {{mvar|x.}}

=== Standard configuration ===
[[File:Standard configuration of coordinate systems.svg|thumb|Galilean diagram of two frames of reference in standard configuration.]]

To ease insight in how spacetime coordinates, measured by observers in different [[Inertial frame of reference|reference frames]], compare with each other, it is useful to work with a simplified setup. With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. Setting the temporal component aside for the moment, two  [[Galilean reference frame]]s (i.e. conventional 3-space frames), S and S' (pronounced "S&amp;nbsp;prime"), each with observers O and O' at rest in their respective frames, but measuring the other as moving with speeds ±''v'' are said to be in ''standard configuration'', when:
* The ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' axes of frame S are oriented parallel to the respective primed axes of frame S′.
* Frame S′ moves in the ''x''-direction of frame S with a constant velocity ''v'' as measured in frame S.

This spatial setting is displayed in the accompanying figure, in which the temporal coordinates are separately annotated as quantities ''t'' and ''t'''.

In a further step of simplification it is often possible to consider just the direction of the observed motion and ignore the other two spatial components, allowing ''x'' and ''ct'' to be plotted in 2-dimensional spacetime diagrams, as introduced above.

=== Minkowski diagrams ===
The term Minkowski diagram refers to a specific form of spacetime diagram frequently used in special relativity.  The term is used in both a generic and particular sense. In general, a Minkowski diagram is a two-dimensional graphical depiction of a portion of [[Minkowski space]], usually where space has been curtailed to a single dimension. The units of measurement in these diagrams are taken such that the [[light cone]] at an event consists of the lines of [[slope]] plus or minus one through that event.&lt;ref&gt;Mermin (1968) Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt; The horizontal lines correspond to the usual notion of ''simultaneous events'' for a stationary observer at the origin.

A particular Minkowski diagram illustrates the result of a [[Lorentz transformation]]. The Lorentz transformation relates two [[inertial frames of reference]], where an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]] stationary at the event {{nowrap|(0, 0)}} makes a change of [[velocity]] along the {{math|''x''}}-axis. The new time axis of the observer forms an angle {{math|''α''}} with the previous time axis, with {{math|''α'' &lt; {{sfrac|π|4}}}} (see the first figure on the right). In the new frame of reference the simultaneous events lie parallel to a line inclined by {{math|''α''}} to the previous lines of simultaneity. This is the new {{math|''x''}}-axis. Both the original set of axes and the primed set of axes have the property that they are orthogonal with respect to the [[Minkowski inner product]] or ''relativistic dot product''.

Whatever the magnitude of {{mvar|α}}, the line {{nowrap|1=''t'' = ''x''}} forms the universal&lt;ref&gt;See [[Vladimir Karapetoff]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bisection|bisector]].

The space and time [[units of measurement]] on the axes may, for example, be taken as one of the following pairs:
* Units of 30 centimetres length and [[nanosecond]]s
* [[Astronomical unit]]s and intervals of 8 minutes and 20 seconds (500 seconds)
* [[Light year]]s and [[year]]s
* [[Light-second]] and second

This way, light paths are represented by lines parallel to the bisector between the axes.

== Spacetime diagrams in Newtonian physics ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - Newtonian physics.svg|thumb|right|256px|In Newtonian physics for both observers the event at A is assigned to the same point in time.]]
The black axes labelled {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''ct''}} on the adjoining diagram are the coordinate system of an observer, referred to as 'at rest', and who is positioned at {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}}. This observer's world line is identical with the {{math|''ct''}} time axis. Each parallel line to this axis would correspond also to an object at rest but at another position. The blue line describes an object moving with constant speed {{math|''v''}} to the right, such as a moving observer.

This blue line labelled {{math|''ct''′}} may be interpreted as the time axis for the second observer. Together with the {{math|''x''}} axis, which is identical for both observers, it represents their coordinate system. Since the reference frames are in standard configuration, both observers agree on the location of the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] of their coordinate systems. The axes for the moving observer are not [[perpendicular]] to each other and the scale on their time axis is stretched. To determine the coordinates of a certain event, two lines, each parallel to one of the two axes, must be constructed passing through the event, and their intersections with the axes read off.

Determining position and time of the event A as an example in the diagram leads to the same time for both observers, as expected. Only for the position different values result, because the moving observer has approached the position of the event A since {{math|1=''t'' =  0}}. Generally stated, all events on a line parallel to the {{math|''x''}} axis happen simultaneously for both observers. There is only one universal time {{nowrap|1=''t'' = ''t''′}}, modelling the existence of one common position axis. On the other hand, due to two different time axes the observers usually measure different coordinates for the same event. This graphical translation from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''t''}} to {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''t''′}} and vice versa is described mathematically by the so-called [[Galilean transformation]].

:*Various English translations on Wikisource: [[s:Space and Time|Space and Time]]&lt;/ref&gt; Space and time have properties which lead to different rules for the translation of coordinates in case of moving observers. In particular, events which are estimated to happen simultaneously from the viewpoint of one observer, happen at different times for the other.

In the Minkowski diagram this [[relativity of simultaneity]] corresponds with the introduction of a separate &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; for the moving observer. Following the rule described above, each observer interprets all events on a line parallel to his &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; axis as simultaneous. The sequence of events from the viewpoint of an observer can be illustrated graphically by shifting this line in the diagram from bottom to top.

If {{math|''ct''}} instead of {{math|''t''}} is assigned on the time axes, the angle {{math|''α''}} between the {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''x''′}} axes will be identical with that between the time axes {{math|''ct''}} and {{math|''ct''′}}. This follows from the second postulate of special relativity, which says that the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion (see below). The angle {{math|''α''}} is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mechanics and Thermodynamics |edition=illustrated |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Demtröder |publisher=Springer |year=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-27877-3 |page=92-93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWUSDgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=TWUSDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93 Extract of page 93]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\alpha)=\frac{v}{c}=\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:MinkScale.svg|thumb|right|256px|Different scales on the axes.]]
The corresponding translation from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''t''}} to {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''t''′}} and vice versa is described mathematically by the [[Lorentz transformation]]. Whatever space and time axes arise through such transformation, in a Minkowski diagram they correspond to [[conjugate diameters]] of a pair of [[hyperbola]]s. The scales on the axes are given as follows: If {{math|''U''}} is the unit length on the axes of {{math|''ct''}} and {{math|''x''}} respectively, the unit length on the axes of {{math|''ct''′}} and {{math|''x''′}} is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jürgen |last=Freund |title=Special Relativity for Beginners: A Textbook for Undergraduates |publisher=World Scientific| year=2008 |pages=49|isbn=981277159X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;U'=U\cdot\sqrt\frac{1+\beta^2}{1-\beta^2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|''ct''}}-axis represents the worldline of a clock resting in {{math|''S''}}, with {{math|''U''}} representing the duration between two events happening on this worldline, also called the [[proper time]] between these events. Length {{math|''U''}} upon the {{math|''x''}}-axis represents the rest length or [[proper length]] of a rod resting in {{math|''S''}}. The same interpretation can also be applied to distance {{math|''U''′}} upon the {{math|''ct''′}}- and {{math|''x''′}}-axes for clocks and rods resting in {{math|''S''′}}.

=== History  ===
In Minkowski’s 1908 paper there were three diagrams, first to illustrate the Lorentz transformation, then the partition of the plane by the light-cone, and finally illustration of worldlines.&lt;ref name=minko /&gt; The first diagram used a branch of the [[unit hyperbola]] &lt;math&gt; t^2 - x^2 = 1 &lt;/math&gt; to show the locus of a unit of [[proper time]] depending on velocity, thus illustrating time dilation. The second diagram showed the conjugate hyperbola to calibrate space, where a similar stretching leaves the impression of [[FitzGerald contraction]]. In 1914 [[Ludwik Silberstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silberstein |first=Ludwik |date=1914 |title=The Theory of Relativity |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; included a diagram of "Minkowski’s representation of the Lorentz transformation". This diagram included the unit hyperbola, its conjugate, and a pair of [[conjugate diameters]]. Since the 1960s a version of this more complete configuration has been referred to as The Minkowski Diagram, and used as a standard illustration of the [[transformation geometry]] of special relativity. [[E. T. Whittaker]] has pointed out that the [[principle of relativity]] is tantamount to the arbitrariness of what hyperbola radius is selected for [[time]] in the Minkowski diagram. In 1912 [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Edwin B. Wilson]] applied the methods of [[synthetic geometry]] to develop the properties of the [[non-Euclidean]] plane that has Minkowski diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Edwin B.|last=Wilson|author1-link=Edwin B.

While the rest frame has space and time axes at right angles, the moving frame has primed axes which form an acute angle. Since the frames are meant to be equivalent, the asymmetry may be disturbing. However, several authors showed that there is a frame of reference between the resting and moving ones where their symmetry would be apparent ("median frame").&lt;ref name=mirimanoff /&gt; In this frame, the two other frames are moving in opposite directions with equal speed. Using such coordinates makes the units of length and time the same for both axes. If {{math|''β'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} and {{math|''γ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|{{sqrt|1 − ''β''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}}} is given between S and S′, then these expressions are connected with the values in their median frame S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as follows:&lt;ref name=mirimanoff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mirimanoff|first=Dmitry|title=La transformation de Lorentz-Einstein et le temps universel de M.

(2) &amp;  &amp; \beta_{0} &amp; =\frac{\gamma-1}{\beta\gamma}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, if {{math|''β'' {{=}} 0.5}} between S and S′, then by (2) they are moving in their median frame S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with approximately {{math|±0.268''c''}} each in opposite directions. On the other hand, if {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.5}} in S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then by (1) the relative velocity between S and S′ in their own rest frames is {{math|0.8''c''}}. The construction of the axes of S and S′ is done in accordance with the ordinary method using {{math|tan ''α'' {{=}} ''β''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} with respect to the orthogonal axes of the median frame (Fig. 1).

However, it turns out that, when drawing such a symmetric diagram, it is possible to derive the diagram's relations even without mentioning the median frame and {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} at all. Instead, the relative velocity {{math|''β'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} between S and S′ can directly be used in the following construction, providing the same result:&lt;ref name=sartori&gt;{{cite book |first=Leo |last=Sartori  |title=Understanding Relativity: A simplified approach to Einstein's theories |isbn=0-520-20029-2 |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996|pages=151ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|''φ''}} is the angle between the axes of {{math|''ct''′}} and {{math|''ct''}} (or between {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''x''′}}), and {{math|''θ''}} between the axes of {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''ct''′}}, it is given:&lt;ref name=sartori /&gt;&lt;ref name=gruner1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gruner2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shado /&gt;

\cos\varphi=\sin\theta &amp; =\frac{1}{\gamma},\\
\tan\varphi=\cot\theta &amp; =\beta\cdot\gamma.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Two methods of construction are obvious from Fig. 2: (a) The {{math|''x''}}-axis is drawn perpendicular to the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis, the {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''ct''}}-axes are added at angle {{math|''φ''}}; (b) the ''x''′-axis is drawn at angle {{math|''θ''}} with respect to the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis, the {{math|''x''}}-axis is added perpendicular to the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis and the {{math|''ct''}}-axis perpendicular to the {{math|''x''′}}-axis.

Also the components of a vector can be vividly demonstrated by such diagrams (Fig. 3): The parallel projections {{math|(''x'', ''t''; ''x''′ ,''t''′)}} of vector {{math|''R''}} are its [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] components, {{math|(''ξ'', ''τ''; ''ξ''′, ''τ''′)}} its covariant components.&lt;ref name=gruner1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gruner2 /&gt;

=== History ===
*[[Max Born]] (1920) drew Minkowski diagrams by placing the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis almost perpendicular to the {{math|''x''}}-axis, as well as the {{math|''ct''}}-axis to the {{math|''x''′}}-axis, in order to demonstrate length contraction and time dilation in the symmetric case of two rods and two clocks moving in opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Born|first=Max|title=Die Relativitätstheorie Einsteins|trans-title=Einstein's Theory of Relativity|location=|pages=177–180|publisher=Springer|year=1920|edition=First|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006663730}} See also [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=de_6AAAAQBAJ|page=187}} Reprint (2013) of third edition (1922) at Google books, p. 187]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Time dilation ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - time dilation.svg|thumb|right|256px|Time dilation: Both observers consider the clock of the other as running slower.]]
Relativistic time dilation means that a clock (indicating its [[proper time]]) that moves relative to an observer is observed to run slower. In fact, time itself in the frame of the moving clock is observed to run slower. This can be read immediately from the adjoining Loedel diagram quite straightforwardly because unit lengths in the two system of axes are identical. Thus, in order to compare reading between the two systems, we can simply compare lengths as they appear on the page: we do not need to consider the fact that unit lengths on each axis are warped by the factor
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt\frac{1+\beta^2}{1-\beta^2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
which we would have to account for in the corresponding Minkowski diagram.

The observer whose reference frame is given by the black axes is assumed to move from the origin O towards A. The moving clock has the reference frame given by the blue axes and moves from O to B. For the black observer, all events happening simultaneously with the event at A are located on a straight line parallel to its space axis. This line passes through A and B, so A and B are simultaneous from the reference frame of the observer with black axes. However, the clock that is moving relative to the black observer marks off time along the blue time axis. This is represented by the distance from O to B. Therefore, the observer at A with the black axes notices their clock as reading the distance from O to A while they observe the clock moving relative him or her to read the distance from O to B. Due to the distance from O to B being smaller than the distance from O to A, they conclude that the time passed on the clock moving relative to them is smaller than that passed on their own clock.

A second observer, having moved together with the clock from O to B, will argue that the other clock has reached only C until this moment and therefore this clock runs slower. The reason for these apparently paradoxical statements is the different determination of the events happening synchronously at different locations. Due to the principle of relativity, the question of who is right has no answer and does not make sense.
{{clear}}

== Length contraction ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - length contraction.svg|thumb|right|256px|Length contraction: Both observers consider objects moving with the other observer as being shorter.]]
Relativistic length contraction means that the [[proper length]] of an object moving relative to an observer is decreased and finally also the space itself is contracted in this system. The observer is assumed again to move along the {{math|''ct''}}-axis. The world lines of the endpoints of an object moving relative to him are assumed to move along the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis and the parallel line passing through A and B. For this observer the endpoints of the object at {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}} are O and A. For a second observer moving together with the object, so that for him the object is at rest, it has the proper length OB at {{nowrap|1=''t''′ = 0}}. Due to {{nowrap|OA &lt; OB}}. the object is contracted for the first observer.

The second observer will argue that the first observer has evaluated the endpoints of the object at O and A respectively and therefore at different times, leading to a wrong result due to his motion in the meantime. If the second observer investigates the length of another object with endpoints moving along the {{math|''ct''}}-axis and a parallel line passing through C and D he concludes the same way this object to be contracted from OD to OC. Each observer estimates objects moving with the other observer to be contracted. This apparently paradoxical situation is again a consequence of the relativity of simultaneity as demonstrated by the analysis via Minkowski diagram.

For all these considerations it was assumed, that both observers take into account the speed of light and their distance to all events they see in order to determine the actual times at which these events happen from their point of view.

== Constancy of the speed of light ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - 3 systems.svg|thumb|right|256px|Minkowski diagram for 3 coordinate systems. For the speeds relative to the system in black {{math|1=''v''′ = 0.4''c''}} and {{math|1=''v''″ = 0.8''c''}} holds.]] Another postulate of special relativity is the constancy of the speed of light. It says that any observer in an inertial reference frame measuring the vacuum speed of light relative to himself obtains the same value regardless of his own motion and that of the light source. This statement seems to be paradoxical, but it follows immediately from the differential equation yielding this, and the Minkowski diagram agrees. It explains also the result of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] which was considered to be a mystery before the theory of relativity was discovered, when photons were thought to be waves through an undetectable medium.

For world lines of photons passing the origin in different directions {{math|1=''x'' = ''ct''}} and {{math|1=''x'' = −''ct''}} holds. That means any position on such a world line corresponds with steps on {{math|''x''}}- and {{math|''ct''}}-axes of equal absolute value. From the rule for reading off coordinates in coordinate system with tilted axes follows that the two world lines are the angle bisectors of the {{math|''x''}}- and {{math|''ct''}}-axes. The Minkowski diagram shows, that they are angle bisectors of the {{math|''x′''}}- and {{math|''ct''′}}-axes as well. That means both observers measure the same speed {{math|''c''}} for both photons.

Further coordinate systems corresponding to observers with arbitrary velocities can be added to this Minkowski diagram. For all these systems both photon world lines represent the angle bisectors of the axes. The more the relative speed approaches the speed of light the more the axes approach the corresponding angle bisector. The &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis is always more flat and the time axis more steep than the photon world lines. The scales on both axes are always identical, but usually different from those of the other coordinate systems.

== Speed of light and causality ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - causality.svg|thumb|right|256px|Past and future relative to the origin. For the grey areas a corresponding temporal classification is not possible.]]
Straight lines passing the origin which are steeper than both photon world lines correspond with objects moving more slowly than the speed of light. If this applies to an object, then it applies from the viewpoint of all observers, because the world lines of these photons are the angle bisectors for any inertial reference frame. Therefore, any point above the origin and between the world lines of both photons can be reached with a speed smaller than that of the light and can have a cause-and-effect relationship with the origin. This area is the absolute future, because any event there happens later compared to the event represented by the origin regardless of the observer, which is obvious graphically from the Minkowski diagram.

Following the same argument the range below the origin and between the photon world lines is the absolute past relative to the origin. Any event there belongs definitely to the past and can be the cause of an effect at the origin.

The relationship between any such pairs of event is called ''timelike'', because they have a time distance greater than zero for all observers. A straight line connecting these two events is always the time axis of a possible observer for whom they happen at the same place. Two events which can be connected just with the speed of light are called ''lightlike''.

In principle a further dimension of space can be added to the Minkowski diagram leading to a three-dimensional representation. In this case the ranges of future and past become [[cone (geometry)|cone]]s with apexes touching each other at the origin. They are called [[light cones]].

== The speed of light as a limit ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - time travel.svg|thumb|right|256px|Sending a message at superluminal speed from O via A to B into the past. Both observers consider the temporal order of the pairs of events O and A as well as A and B different.]]
Following the same argument, all straight lines passing through the origin and which are more nearly horizontal than the photon world lines, would correspond to objects or signals moving [[Faster-than-light|faster than light]] regardless of the speed of the observer. Therefore, no event outside the light cones can be reached from the origin, even by a light-signal, nor by any object or signal moving with less than the speed of light. Such pairs of events are called ''spacelike'' because they have a finite spatial distance different from zero for all observers. On the other hand, a straight line connecting such events is always the space coordinate axis of a possible observer for whom they happen at the same time. By a slight variation of the velocity of this coordinate system in both directions it is always possible to find two inertial reference frames whose observers estimate the chronological order of these events to be different.

Therefore, an object moving faster than light, say from O to A in the adjoining diagram, would imply that, for any observer watching the object moving from O to A, another observer can be found (moving at less than the speed of light with respect to the first) for whom the object moves from A to O. The question of which observer is right has no unique answer, and therefore makes no physical sense. Any such moving object or signal would violate the principle of causality.

Also, any general technical means of sending signals faster than light would permit information to be sent into the originator's own past. In the diagram, an observer at O in the {{math|''x''-''ct''}} system sends a message moving faster than light to A. At A, it is received by another observer, moving so as to be in the {{math|''x''′-''ct''′}} system, who sends it back, again faster than light, arriving at B. But B is in the past relative to O. The absurdity of this process becomes obvious when both observers subsequently confirm that they received no message at all, but all messages were directed towards the other observer as can be seen graphically in the Minkowski diagram. Furthermore, if it were possible to accelerate an observer to the speed of light, their space and time axes would coincide with their angle bisector. The coordinate system would collapse, in concordance with the fact that due to [[time dilation]], time would effectively stop passing for them.

These considerations show that the speed of light as a limit is a consequence of the properties of spacetime, and not of the properties of objects such as technologically imperfect space ships. The prohibition of faster-than-light motion, therefore, has nothing in particular to do with electromagnetic waves or light, but comes as a consequence of the structure of spacetime.

==Eponym==
When Taylor and Wheeler composed ''Spacetime Physics'' (1966), they did ''not'' use the term "Minkowski diagram" for their spacetime geometry. Instead they included an acknowledgement of Minkowski’s contribution to philosophy by the totality of his innovation of 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor |last2=Wheeler |title=Spacetime Physics |date=1966 |page=37 |quote=Minkowski's insight is central to the understanding of the physical world. It focuses attention on those quantities, such as interval, which are the same in all frames of reference. It brings out the relative character of quantities, such as velocity, energy, time, distance, which depend on the frame of reference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When abstracted to a line drawing, then any figure showing conjugate hyperbolas, with a selection of conjugate diameters, falls into this category. Students making drawings to accompany the exercises in [[George Salmon]]’s ''A Treatise on Conic Sections'' (1900) at pages 165–171 (on conjugate diameters) will be making Minkowski diagrams.

==Spacetime diagram of an accelerating observer in special relativity==

[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed]]

The momentarily co-moving inertial frames along the world line of a rapidly accelerating observer (center). The vertical direction indicates time, while the horizontal indicates distance, the dashed line is the spacetime trajectory ("world line") of the observer. The small dots are specific events in spacetime. If one imagines these events to be the flashing of a light, then the events that pass the two diagonal lines in the bottom half of the image (the past light cone of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer. The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. Note how the momentarily co-moving inertial frame changes when the observer accelerates.

A '''modular process skid''' is a [[Process engineering|process system]] contained within a frame that allows the process system to be easily transported.  Individual skids can contain complete process systems and multiple process skids can be combined to create larger process systems or entire portable plants. They are sometimes called “a system in a box.” An example of a multi-skid process system might include a raw materials skid, a utilities skid and a processing unit which work in tandem.

Process skids are considered an alternative to traditional stick-built construction where process system parts are shipped individually and installed incrementally at the manufacturing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csidesigns.com/flowgeeks/what-is-a-skid-system/ |title=What Is a Skid System? &amp;#124; FlowGeeks |publisher=Csidesigns.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide the advantage of parallel construction, where process systems are built off-site in a fabrication facility while civil site upgrades are completed at the plant site simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicmodularprocess.com/blog/advantages-of-modular-process-design-infographic |title=Advantages of Modular Process Design Infographic |publisher=Epicmodularprocess.com |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skids are not always appropriate. If individual process parts are large and cannot reasonably be contained within the frame of a modular process skid, traditional construction methods are preferred.

==Skid design and layout==
Process skids are designed to contain a complete process system, a complete unit of operations or to organize a manufacturing process into logical units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proscon.com/solutions/modular.html |title=Modular Process Systems from |publisher=ProsCon |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; All skids have the following characteristics in common:
* '''Portable design'''– because they are self-contained units, built within frames, skid systems are easier to transport than traditional process systems. 
* '''Small footprint''' – process skid frames allow equipment layering. Piping, tanks, and necessary process equipment can be fit into a smaller footprint with a skid design
* '''Gathered process connections''' – process connections are gathered into one spot on the skid, making plant connections easier. In traditional process systems, connections are spread throughout the plant. 
* '''Controlled assembly''' – skids are typically built in controlled conditions offsite. Existing operations are not affected by skid fabrication. 
*[[Acceptance testing|'''FAT testing''']] before installation – Factory acceptance testing (FAT) can be completed before modular process skids are shipped to site. This reduces the amount of on-site startup time.
*'''Accessible layout''' – skids are designed for accessibility, usually including a center hallway, and major pieces of equipment placed around the edge of the frame.

'''Nature''', in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or [[universe]]. "Nature" can refer to the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of [[science]]. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

The word ''nature'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''natura'', or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".&lt;ref name="etymonline-nature"&gt;{{OEtymD|nature|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natura'' is a Latin translation of the Greek word ''[[physis]]'' (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.&lt;ref&gt;An account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard (2006) ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press. The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of ''physis'' was by [[Homer]] in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302–3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's ''[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux Greek Lexicon]''.) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see earlier note.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nature as a whole, the physical [[universe]], is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the advent of modern [[scientific method]] in the last several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "[[natural philosophy]]", akin to "systematic study of nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the word "physical" shows its use as a synonym for "natural" in about the mid-15th century: {{OEtymD|physical|accessdate=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and [[wildlife]]. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the [[Earth]]. It is often taken to mean the "[[natural environment]]" or [[wilderness]]—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human [[consciousness]] or a human [[mind]]. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the [[Wikt:unnatural|unnatural]] or the [[supernatural]].

Earth is the only [[planet]] known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the [[solar system]], it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest [[terrestrial planet]] and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow [[temperate]] zones, and a wide [[equator]]ial tropical to [[subtropical]] region.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The [[Crust (geology)|outer surface]] is divided into several gradually migrating [[tectonic plate]]s. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and an iron-filled core that generates a [[magnetic field]]. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

The [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = September 11, 2005|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050911103921.htm|title = Calculations favor reducing atmosphere for early Earth|work=[[Science Daily]]|accessdate = January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions.

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology}}
Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the [[Earth]]. The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, [[structural geology|structure]], [[Physical property|physical properties]], dynamics, and [[History of the Earth|history]] of [[Earth materials]], and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major [[academic discipline]], and is also important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of [[natural hazard]]s, some [[Geotechnical engineering]] fields, and understanding [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] and environments.

====Geological evolution====
[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Three types of geological [[plate tectonic]] boundaries.]]
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] onto the surface or intrude into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when [[sediment]]s settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into [[sedimentary rock]], or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava]] flows, blanket the surface. Igneous [[intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and [[transform boundary|transform boundaries]], respectively, between [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].

Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly 750&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] which broke apart about 540&amp;nbsp;million years ago, then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart about 180&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.B. |last=Murphy |author2=R.D.

During the [[Neoproterozoic]] era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in [[glacier]]s and ice sheets. This hypothesis has been termed the "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [[Cambrian explosion]] in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.L. |last=Kirschvink |date=1992 |chapter=Late Proterozoic Low-Latitude Global Glaciation: The Snowball Earth |chapterurl=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/firstsnowball.pdf |title=The Proterozoic Biosphere |editor=J.W.

Several million years ago, a species of small African [[ape]] gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="Margulis1995" /&gt; The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further [[civilization]] allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate.

==Atmosphere, climate, and weather==
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|[[Rayleigh scattering|Blue light is scattered more]] than other wavelengths by the gases in the [[atmosphere]], giving the Earth a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space]]
{{Main|Atmosphere of Earth|Climate|Weather}}
The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the [[Nature#Ecosystems|ecosystem]]. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[water vapor]], with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The [[ozone layer]] plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [[troposphere|lower part of the atmosphere]], and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJ4SnHbb-ZcC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions|last=Miller|first=G.|last2=Spoolman|first2=Scott|date=September 28, 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495383376}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the [[polar region]]s much colder.
[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation-wcag.gif|thumb|left|[[Lightning]]]]
Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s and [[cyclone]]s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [[Climate change|influence the climate]], including ocean currents, surface [[albedo]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.
[[File:Dszpics1.jpg|thumb|A tornado in central [[Oklahoma]]]]
The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [[latitude]]. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [[tropical climate]] at the equator to the [[polar climate]] in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the [[Earth]]'s [[axis of rotation|axis]] being [[axial tilt|tilted]] relative to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the [[sun]]. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere|southern]] hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that is readily modified by small changes to the [[Natural environment|environment]], so accurate [[Meteorology|weather forecasting]] is limited to only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Harvey|last2=Davidson|first2=Noel|date=May 25, 2015|title=Trends in the skill of weather prediction at lead times of 1–14 days|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=141|issue=692|pages=2726–36|via=Wiley|doi=10.1002/qj.2559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropical Ocean Warming Drives Recent Northern Hemisphere Climate Change|publisher=Science Daily|date=April 6, 2001|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water on Earth==
[[File:44 - Iguazu - Décembre 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Iguazu Falls]] on the border between [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]]]

'''Water''' is a [[chemical substance]] that is composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] and is vital for all known forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/background.html |title=Water for Life |publisher=Un.org |date=March 22, 2005 |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In typical usage, ''water'' refers only to its liquid form or [[States of matter|state]], but the substance also has a solid state, [[ice]], and a [[gas]]eous state, [[water vapor]], or [[steam]]. &lt;!--About 1.460 [[Tonne#Multiples|petatonnes]]&amp;nbsp;(Pt) (10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of water--&gt;Water covers 71% of the [[Earth]]'s surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|title=World|work=CIA – World Fact Book|accessdate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in [[aquifer]]s and 0.001% in the [[atmosphere|air]] as [[vapor]], clouds, and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070320034158/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html Water Vapor in the Climate System], Special Report, American Geophysical Union, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080220070111/http://www.unep.org/dewa/assessments/ecosystems/water/vitalwater/ Vital Water]. [[UNEP]].&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans hold 97% of surface water, [[glacier]]s, and polar [[ice cap]]s 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

===Oceans===
[[File:Ocean from Leblon.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Atlantic Ocean from [[Leblon]], Rio de Janeiro.]]
{{Main|Ocean}}
An ocean is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia.'' 2002. New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;"[http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html Distribution of land and water on the planet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103749/http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}". [http://www.oceansatlas.com/ UN Atlas of the Oceans]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to [[oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spilhaus | first1 = Athelstan F | year = 1942 | title = Maps of the whole world ocean | url = | journal = Geographical Review | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 431–35 | doi=10.2307/210385| jstor = 210385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the [[Southern Ocean]], and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, [[Headlands and bays|gulfs]], [[bay]]s and other names. There are also [[salt lake]]s, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the [[Aral Sea]] and the [[Great Salt Lake]].

===Lakes===
[[File:Lake mapourika NZ.jpeg|thumb|[[Lake Mapourika]], New Zealand]]
{{Main|Lake}}
A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]] (or [[physical feature]]), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]] (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328083/lake

|accessdate=June 25, 2008
|title=Lake (physical feature)
|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not well established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Definition|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lake|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of [[ethane]], most likely mixed with [[methane]]. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

====Ponds====
[[File:Mill Pond Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Westborough Reservoir (Mill Pond) in [[Westborough, Massachusetts]].]]
{{Main|Pond}}
A '''pond''' is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via [[current (stream)|current]] speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

===Rivers===
[[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nile]] river in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]'s capital city]]
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ''Burn'' in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS – U.S. Geological Survey – FAQs], No. 17 What is the difference between mountain, hill, and [[Summit (topography)|peak]]; lake and pond; or river and [[stream|creek]]?&lt;/ref&gt; A river is part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater]] recharge, [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from [[glacier]]s).

===Streams===
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|A rocky stream in [[Hawaii]]]]
{{Main|Stream}}
A stream is a flowing body of water with a [[Current (stream)|current]], confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s. In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide. Streams are important as conduits in the [[water cycle]], instruments in [[groundwater recharge]], and they serve as corridors for fish and [[wildlife]] migration. The biological [[habitat]] in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a [[riparian zone]]. Given the status of the ongoing [[Holocene extinction]], streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology|fluvial geomorphology]], [[aquatic ecology]], [[Freshwater fish|fish biology]], [[riparian|riparian ecology]], and others.

Ecosystems are composed of a variety of [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] components that function in an interrelated way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Introduction to the Ecosystem Concept |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9j.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: [[soil]], atmosphere, radiation from the [[sun]], water, and living organisms.

Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s interact with every other element in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;Odum, EP (1971) ''Fundamentals of ecology'', 3rd edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the [[food chain]], and exchange energy and [[matter]] between themselves as well as with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Organization of Life |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9d.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature [[dichotomy]] and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&amp;pg=PA237|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|date=2011-09-20|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1439820094|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller unit of size is called a [[microecosystem]]. For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A ''macroecosystem'' might involve a whole [[ecoregion]], with its [[drainage basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey |first=Robert G. |date=April 2004 |title=Identifying Ecoregion Boundaries |journal=Environmental Management |volume=34 |pmid=15883869 |issue=Supplement 1 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1007/s00267-003-0163-6 |pages=S14–26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lleZy8MU?url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilderness===

{{Main|Wilderness}}
'''Wilderness''' is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, [[:Category:national forests|national forests]], [[national park]]s, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], and solitude. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,&lt;ref name="Man p155-157"&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (2000) ''No Man's Garden'', Island Press, pp. 155–57, {{ISBN|1559634650}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural [[ecosystem]] (the [[biosphere]]). They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and that they provide [[habitat]] for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s, or [[laboratory|laboratories]].

==Life==
{{Life timeline}}
[[File:Malards in Golden Gate Park.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Female mallard and ducklings – [[reproduction]] is essential for continuing life]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}
Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=January 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s.

Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made [[Artificial life|analogs of life]] may also be considered to be life.

The [[biosphere]] is the part of Earth's outer shell&amp;nbsp;– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere&amp;nbsp;– within which life occurs, and which [[Biology|biotic]] processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest [[Geophysiology|geophysiological]] point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]] (rocks), [[hydrosphere]] (water), and [[atmosphere]] (air). The entire Earth contains over 75&amp;nbsp;billion tons (150 ''trillion'' pounds or about 6.8×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;The figure "about one-half of one percent" takes into account the following (See, e.g., {{cite book |last=Leckie |first=Stephen |date=1999 |chapter=How Meat-centred Eating Patterns Affect Food Security and the Environment |chapterurl=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=For hunger-proof cities: sustainable urban food systems |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |isbn=978-0889368828 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113020336/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html }}, which takes global average weight as 60&amp;nbsp;kg.), the total human biomass is the average weight multiplied by the current human population of approximately 6.5&amp;nbsp;billion (see, ''e.g.'', {{cite web |title=World Population Information |url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/world.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}): Assuming 60–70&amp;nbsp;kg to be the average human mass (approximately 130–150&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]] on the average), an approximation of total global human mass of between 390&amp;nbsp;billion (390×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) and 455&amp;nbsp;billion kg (between 845&amp;nbsp;billion and 975&amp;nbsp;billion lb, or about 423&amp;nbsp;million–488&amp;nbsp;million [[short ton]]s). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg (75&amp;nbsp;billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once life had appeared, the process of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.

Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the [[fossil]] record retains evidence of many of these older species.

===Plants and animals===
{{Main|Plant|Animal}}
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|A selection of diverse [[plant species]]]]
[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|A selection of diverse [[animal species]]]]
Originally [[Aristotle]] divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' system, these became the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] [[Vegetabilia]] (later [[Plantae]]) and [[Animal]]ia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [[fungus|fungi]] and several groups of [[alga]]e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=flora |url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1998 |title=Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources |chapter=Glossary |chapterurl=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |publisher=Department of the Interior, Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |id=SuDocs No. I 19.202:ST 1/V.1-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715060359/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some classifications use the term ''bacterial flora'' separately from ''plant flora''.

Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional [[flora]]s, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include ''fossil flora'', remnants&lt;br&gt; of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [[terrain]].

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of "native flora" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [[botanist]]s as a formal way to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.

Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and usually [[multicellular]] (although see [[Myxozoa]]), which separates them from bacteria, [[archaea]], and most [[protist]]s. They are [[heterotroph]]ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and [[alga]]e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking [[cell wall]]s.

With a few exceptions—most notably the two [[Phylum|phyla]] consisting of [[sponge]]s and [[placozoa]]ns—animals have bodies that are differentiated into [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[Animal shell|shells]], [[bone]]s, and [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]], a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.

Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [[civilization]] remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feedback Loops in Global Climate Change Point to a Very Hot 21st Century|publisher=Science Daily|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html|accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, [[deforestation]], and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the [[extinction]] of many plants and animals.

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|title=Natural Resources contribution to GDP|date=November 2014|website=World Development Indicators (WDI)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223080408/https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|archive-date=December 23, 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2012.html|title=GDP – Composition by Sector|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|work=[[The World Factbook]]|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. [[Agriculture#History|Agriculture]] was first adopted around the [[9th millennium BCE]]. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/plants/medicinal/plants.htm|title = Plant Conservation Alliance – Medicinal Plant Working Groups Green Medicine|publisher = US National Park Services |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Oosthoek|first = Jan|date = 1999|url = http://www.eh-resources.org/philosophy.html|title = Environmental History: Between Science &amp; Philosophy|publisher = Environmental History Resources|accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and beauty===
[[File:504px-Pinguiculagrandiflora1web.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'', commonly known as a [[Butterwort]]]]
Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called [[aesthetics]]. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |title=On the Beauty of Nature |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909220214/http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |archivedate=September 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] began in China during the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618–907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art.

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the [[Psalms]] and the [[Book of Job]], [[wilderness]] portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [[Romantic movement]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Accessed: May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This artistic movement also coincided with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist movement]] in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [[mimesis]], the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical [[Substantial form|forms]] and more generally by [[patterns in nature]]. As David Rothenburg writes, "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David |isbn=978-1608192168| date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}}

==Matter and energy==

{{Main|Matter|Energy}}
Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be "[[physics]]"&amp;nbsp;– the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature.

Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the [[observable universe]]. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent [[cold dark matter]] and 68.3 percent [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="planck_overview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planck 2013 results. I.

The behavior of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined [[physical law]]s. These laws have been employed to produce [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty [[physical constant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Taylor|first = Barry N.|date = 1971|url = http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/introduction.html|title = Introduction to the constants for nonexperts|publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate = January 7, 2007

==Beyond Earth==
[[File:Planets2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Planet]]s of the [[Solar System]] ''(Sizes to scale, distances and illumination not to scale)'']]
[[File:NGC 4414 (NASA-med).jpg|thumb|'''[[NGC 4414]]''' is a spiral galaxy in the constellation [[Coma Berenices]] about 56,000 [[light-year]]s in diameter and approximately 60 million light-years from [[Earth]]]]
{{Main|Outer space|Universe|Extraterrestrial life}}
Outer space, also simply called ''space'', refers to the relatively empty regions of the [[universe]] outside the [[atmosphere]]s of celestial bodies. ''Outer'' space is used to distinguish it from [[airspace]] (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the [[Solar System]] is called [[interplanetary space]], which passes over into [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]] at what is known as the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]].

Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]], [[cosmic microwave background radiation|blackbody radiation]] left over from the [[big bang]] and the origin of the universe, and [[cosmic ray]]s, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various [[subatomic particle]]s. There is also some gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[dust]], and small [[meteor]]s. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although the Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet [[Mars]] possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bibring, J |display-authors=etal|title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars Express data|journal = Science|volume = 312|issue = 5772|pages = 400–04|date = 2006|pmid = 16627738|doi = 10.1126/science.1122659|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.
If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Tariq|last = Malik|date = March 8, 2005|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7129347/|title = Hunt for Mars life should go underground|publisher = Space.com via msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the fourth-largest moon of [[Jupiter]], may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Turner, Scott |date = March 2, 1998|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news8.html|title = Detailed Images From Europa Point To Slush Below Surface|publisher = NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar [[Earth analog]]s – planets that lie in the [[habitable zone]] of space surrounding a [[star]], and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

'''Non-recurring engineering''' ('''NRE''') refers to the one-time cost to [[research]], [[design]], [[research and development|develop]] and [[physical test|test]] a new product or product enhancement. When [[budget]]ing for a new product, NRE must be considered to analyze if a new product will be [[profit (accounting)|profitable]]. Even though a company will pay for NRE on a project only once, NRE costs can be prohibitively high and the product will need to sell well enough to produce a return on the initial investment. NRE is unlike [[cost-of-production theory of value|production costs]], which must be paid constantly to maintain production of a product. It is a form of [[fixed cost]] in [[economics]] terms. Once a system is designed any number of units can be manufactured without increasing NRE cost.

In a project-type (manufacturing) company, large parts (possibly all) of the project represent NRE. In this case the NRE costs are likely to be included in the first project's costs, this can also be called [[research and development]] (R&amp;D). If the firm cannot recover these costs, it must consider funding part of these from [[reserve (accounting)|reserves]], possibly take a project loss, in the hope that the investment can be recovered from further profit on future projects.

The concept of full product NRE as described above may lead readers to believe that NRE expenses are necessarily high. However, Focused NRE wherein small amounts of NRE money can yield large returns by making existing product changes is an option to consider as well. A small adjustment to an existing assembly may be considered, in order to use a less expensive or improved subcomponent or to replace a subcomponent which is no longer available. In the world of embedded firmware, NRE may be invested in code development to fix problems or to add features where the costs to implement are a very small percentages of an immediate return. Chrysler found such a way to repair a transmission problem by investing trivial NRE dollars into computer firmware to fix a mechanical problem to save some tens of millions of dollars in mechanical repairs to transmissions in the field. 

Mastery of NRE concepts as financial investments are a most excellent loss control tool and must be considered a key part of manufacturing profit enhancement.

A '''pivot language''', sometimes also called a '''bridge language''', is an [[artificial language|artificial]] or [[natural language]] used as an intermediary language for translation between many different languages – to translate between any pair of languages A and B, one translates A to the pivot language P, then from P to B. Using a pivot language avoids the [[combinatorial explosion (communication)|combinatorial explosion]] of having translators across every combination of the supported languages, as the number of combinations of language is linear (&lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;), rather than quadratic &lt;math&gt;\left(\textstyle{\binom{n}{2}}=\frac{n^2-n}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; – one need only know the language A and the pivot language P (and someone else the language B and the pivot P), rather than needing a different translator for every possible combination of A and B.

The disadvantage of a pivot language is that each step of retranslation introduces possible mistakes and ambiguities – using a pivot language involves two steps, rather than one. For example, when [[Hernán Cortés]] communicated with [[Mesoamerican]] Indians, he would speak Spanish to [[Gerónimo de Aguilar]], who would speak [[Mayan language|Mayan]] to [[Malintzin]], who would speak [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] to the locals.

== Examples ==
{{See also|Interlingual machine translation}}
[[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are often used as pivot languages.  [[Interlingua]] has been used as a pivot language in international conferences and has been proposed as a pivot language for the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Breinstrup, Thomas. "Linguaphobos? Non in le UE". [Linguaphobes? Not in the EU]. ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', 2006, Issue 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Esperanto]] was proposed as a pivot language in the [[Distributed Language Translation]] project and has been used in this way in the Majstro Tradukvortaro at the Esperanto website [http://www.majstro.com/ Majstro.com].  The [[Universal Networking Language]] is an artificial language specifically designed for use as a pivot language.

== In computing ==
{{see also|Intermediate language|Data conversion#Pivotal conversion}}
Pivot coding is also a common method of translating data for computer systems.  For example, the [[internet protocol]], [[XML]] and [[high level language]]s are pivot codings of computer data which are then often rendered into internal binary formats for particular computer systems.

[[Unicode]] was designed to be usable as a pivot coding between various major existing character encodings, though its widespread adoption as a coding in its own right has made this usage unimportant.

== In machine translation (MT) ==
Current statistical machine translation ([[Statistical machine translation|SMT]]) systems use [[parallel corpora]] for source (s) and target (t) languages to achieve their good results, but good parallel corpora are not available for all languages. A pivot language (p) enables the bridge between two languages, to which existing parallel corpora are entirely or partially not yet at hand.

Pivot translation can be problematic because of the potential lack of fidelity of the information forwarded in the use of different corpora. From the use of two bilingual corpora (s-p &amp; p-t) to set up the s-t bridge, linguistic data are inevitably lost. Rule-based machine translation ([[RBMT]]) helps the system rescue this information, so that the system does not rely entirely on statistics but also on structural linguistic information.

Three basic techniques are used to employ pivot language in MT: (1) ''triangulation'', which focuses on phrase paralleling between source and pivot (s-p) and between pivot and target (p-t); (2) ''[[Transfer-based machine translation|transfer]]'', which translates the whole sentence of the source language to a pivot language and then to the target language; and (3) ''synthesis'', which builds a corpus of its own for system training.

The '''triangulation''' method (also called ''phrase table multiplication'') calculates the probability of both translation correspondences and lexical weight in s-p and p-t, to try to induce a new s-t phrase table. The '''transfer''' method (also called ''sentence translation strategy'') simply carries a straightforward translation of s into p and then another translation of p into t without using probabilistic tests (as in triangulation). The '''synthetic''' method uses an existing corpus of s and tries to build an own synthetic corpus out of it that is used by the system to train itself. Then a bilingual s-p corpus is synthesized to enable a p-t translation.

A direct comparison between triangulation and transfer methods for SMT systems has shown that triangulation achieves much better results than transfer.

All three pivot language techniques enhance the performance of SMT systems. However, the ''synthetic'' technique  doesn't work well with RBMT, and systems' performances are lower than expected. Hybrid SMT/RBMT systems achieve better translation quality than strict-SMT systems that rely on bad parallel corpora.

The key role of RBMT systems is that they help fill the gap left in the translation process of s-p → p-t, in the sense that these parallels are included in the SMT model for s-t.

==History==
In 2007, [[Sam Harris]] co-founded, alongside his wife, the (501(c)3) non-profit foundation called Project Reason. Harris is also chief executive of this organization. Its website describes itself in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Project Reason is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation devoted to spreading scientific knowledge and secular values in society. The project will draw on the talents of prominent and creative [[Intellectual|thinkers]] from a wide range of disciplines—[[science]], [[law]], [[literature]], [[entertainment]], [[information technology]], etc.—to encourage [[critical thinking]] and wise public policy. It will convene conferences, produce films, sponsor scientific research and opinion polls, award grants to other non-profit organizations, and offer material support to [[Dissident|religious dissidents]] and public intellectuals—with the purpose of eroding the influence of dogmatism, superstition and bigotry in the world.&lt;ref name=officialsite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.project-reason.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306140031/http://www.project-reason.org/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-03-06 |title=Project Reason |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Projects==
The organization maintains several projects, as well as an internet forum, that attempt to debunk religion using empirical and rational critiques.

''The Scripture Project'', undertaken under the mantle of Project Reason, stated the following as its goal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Steve Wells, creator of the Skeptics Annotated Bible, Qur'an, and Book of Mormon has generously donated the full contents of his website to Project Reason. Using this as a foundation, we intend to make the Scripture Project the best source for scriptural criticism on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150418140718/http://www.project-reason.org/scripture_project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Vatican Justice'', another project undertaken by Project Reason, has the following as its mission statement: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like to announce that Project Reason has joined Hitchens and Dawkins (both of whom sit on our advisory board) in an effort to end the "diplomatic immunity" which the Vatican claims protects the Pope from any responsibility. We would greatly appreciate your support in this cause.  All donations are tax-deductible in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150418141200/http://www.project-reason.org/vatican_justice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Secular Islam Sub-Project==

One of the most active sub-projects in Project Reason is the ''Secular Islam'' sub-project, with several initiatives falling under it.

One project within Secular Islam is titled "Modern Developments in Koranic Criticism: Christmas in the Koran" with the following description:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This project is being run by foundation advisor Ibn Warraq and takes as its focus the pioneering work in Syriac and Arabic linguistics of Christof Luxenberg. Luxenberg is a native Arab speaker and linguist, living in the West and writing under a pseudonym. Luxenberg's work has given new impetus to the discipline of Koranic studies, largely by revealing that many acknowledged obscurities in the Koran can be clarified by treating certain passages as a poor translations of Syriac into Arabic.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150418132933/http://www.project-reason.org/secular_islam&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Secular Islam sub-project supports other projects, such as ''The Institute for Research on Early Islamic History and the Koran'', having funded their conferences in 2008, 2012, and 2014. It pledges collaboration with the Ayaan Hirsi Ali Foundation, supports the Ex-Muslims of North America, and the Quilliam Foundation.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9720">{{technical|date=March 2016}}In [[mathematical logic]], '''satisfiability''' and '''[[Validity (logic)|validity]]''' are elementary concepts of [[semantics]]. A [[formula (mathematical logic)|formula]] is ''satisfiable'' if it is possible to find an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] ([[model theory|model]]) that makes the formula true.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Boolos and Jeffrey, 1974, chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  A formula is ''valid'' if all interpretations make the formula true. The opposites of these concepts are '''unsatisfiability''' and '''invalidity''', that is, a formula is ''unsatisfiable'' if none of the interpretations make the formula true, and ''invalid'' if some such interpretation makes the formula false. These four concepts are related to each other in a manner exactly analogous to [[Aristotle]]'s [[square of opposition]].

The four concepts can be raised to apply to whole [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theories]]: a theory is satisfiable (valid) if one (all) of the interpretations make(s) each of the [[axiom]]s of the theory true, and a theory is unsatisfiable (invalid) if all (one) of the interpretations make(s) each of the axioms of the theory false.

It is also possible to consider only interpretations that make all of the axioms of a second theory true. This generalization is commonly called [[satisfiability modulo theories]].

The question whether a sentence in [[propositional logic]] is satisfiable is a [[decidable problem]]. In general, the question whether sentences in [[first-order logic]] are satisfiable is not decidable.  In [[universal algebra]] and [[equational theory]], the methods of [[term rewriting]], [[congruence closure]] and [[unification (computer science)|unification]] are used to attempt to decide satisfiability.  Whether a particular [[theory (logic)|theory]] is decidable or not depends whether the theory is [[variable-free]] or on other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Franz Baader]]|author2=[[Tobias Nipkow]]|title=Term Rewriting and All That|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-77920-0|pages=58–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reduction of validity to satisfiability==
For [[classical logic]]s, it is generally possible to reexpress the question of the validity of a formula to one involving satisfiability, because of the relationships between the concepts expressed in the above square of opposition.  In particular φ is valid if and only if ¬φ is unsatisfiable, which is to say it is not true that ¬φ is satisfiable. Put another way, φ is satisfiable if and only if ¬φ is invalid.

For logics without negation, such as the [[List of logic systems#Positive propositional calculus|positive propositional calculus]], the questions of validity and satisfiability may be unrelated. In the case of the [[List of logic systems#Positive propositional calculus|positive propositional calculus]], the satisfiability problem is trivial, as every formula is satisfiable, while the validity problem is [[Co-NP-complete|co-NP complete]].

==Propositional satisfiability==
{{main|Propositional satisfiability}}
In the case of [[classical propositional logic]], satisfiability is decidable for propositional formulae.  In particular, satisfiability is an [[NP-complete]] problem, and is one of the most intensively studied problems in [[computational complexity theory]].

==Satisfiability in first-order logic==
Satisfiability is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] and indeed it isn't even a semidecidable property of formulae in [[first-order logic]] (FOL).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/content/institutes/thi/algi/lehre/SS12/AL12/skript/script120413.pdf |title= Chapter 1.3 Undecidability of FOL |accessdate= 21 July 2012 &lt;!-- at 13:25  --&gt; |author= Baier, Christel |year= 2012 |work= Lecture Notes&amp;nbsp;— Advanced Logics |publisher= Technische Universität Dresden&amp;nbsp;— Institute for Technical Computer Science |pages= 28–32 }}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact has to do with the undecidability of the validity problem for FOL. The question of the status of the validity problem was posed firstly by David Hilbert, as the so-called [[Entscheidungsproblem]]. The universal validity of a formula is a semi-decidable problem. If satisfiability were also a semi-decidable problem, then the problem of the existence of counter-models would be too (a formula has counter-models iff its negation is satisfiable). So the problem of logical validity would be decidable, which contradicts the Church-Turing theorem, a result stating the negative answer for the [[Entscheidungsproblem]].

==Satisfiability in model theory==
In [[model theory]], an [[atomic formula]] is satisfiable if there is a collection of elements of a [[structure (logic)|structure]] that render the formula true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wilifrid Hodges|title=A Shorter Model Theory|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-58713-1|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''A'' is a structure, φ is a formula, and ''a'' is a collection of elements, taken from the structure, that satisfy φ, then it is commonly written that

:''A'' ⊧ φ [a]

If φ has no variables, that is, if φ is an [[atomic sentence]], and it is satisfied by ''A'', then one writes

:''A'' ⊧ φ

In this case, one may also say that ''A'' is a model for φ, or that φ is ''true'' in ''A''.  If ''T'' is a collection of atomic sentences (a theory) satisfied by ''A'', one writes

:''A'' ⊧ ''T''

==Finite satisfiability==

A problem related to satisfiability is that of '''finite satisfiability''', which is the question of determining whether a formula admits a ''finite'' model that makes it true. For a logic that has the [[finite model property]], the problems of satisfiability and finite satisfiability coincide, as a formula of that logic has a model if and only if it has a finite model. This question is important in the mathematical field of [[finite model theory]].

Nevertheless, finite satisfiability and satisfiability need not coincide in general. For instance, consider the [[first-order logic]] formula obtained as the [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] of the following sentences, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are [[logical constant|constants]]:

* &lt;math&gt;R(a_0, a_0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;R(a_0, a_1)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x y (R(x, y) \rightarrow \exists z R(y, z))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x y z (R(y, x) \wedge R(z, x) \rightarrow x = z))&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting formula has the infinite model &lt;math&gt;R(a_0, a_0), R(a_0, a_1), R(a_1, a_2), \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, but it can be shown that it has no finite model (starting at the fact &lt;math&gt;R(a, b)&lt;/math&gt; and following the chain of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; [[atomic formula|atoms]] that must exist by the third axiom, the finiteness of a model would require the existence of a loop, which would violate the fourth axiom, whether it loops back on &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; or on a different element).

The [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of deciding satisfiability for an input formula in a given logic may differ from that of deciding finite satisfiability; in fact, for some logics, only one of them is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]].

== Numerical constraints ==
{{further|Satisfiability modulo theories|Constraint satisfaction problem}}
Numerical constraints often appear in the field of [[mathematical optimization]], where one usually wants to maximize (or minimize) an objective function subject to some constraints. However, leaving aside the objective function, the basic issue of simply deciding whether the constraints are satisfiable can be challenging or undecidable in some settings. The following table summarizes the main cases.

'''Secular arm''', in [[ecclesiastical law]], refers to the legal authority of the civil power, the State, or any [[Laity|lay]] authority, invoked by the Church to punish offenders in cases properly belonging to the jurisdiction of the Church. In the [[Middle Ages]] especially in Inquisition trials for [[heresy]], or grave immorality, ecclesiastical courts delivered convicted clerical and lay offenders over to the secular arm to administer severe capital punishments. The phrase "[[Spanish Inquisition#Sentencing|relaxed]] to the secular arm" was used by the [[Spanish Inquistion]] to describe the handover of the condemned heretic.

The medieval Latin phrase 'brachium seculare' was translated first into late Middle English.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, Religion&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Introduced circa 1180–1250 at the time of the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the church inquisitors delivered a [[Cathar]] heretic, or any heretic, to the secular arm, to be burnt at the stake. 
Under [[canon law]] church tribunals had no jurisdiction to impose penalties involving mutilation or death.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages p.260&lt;/ref&gt;
Notably the contrary circumstance of appeal by individuals to the secular authorities to interfere with, or hinder, the process of ecclesiastical jurisdiction was until recently punished in the [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholic]] [[Catholic Church|Church]] by [[excommunication]].&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (3 ed.)p.532&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sudarsky's classification of gas giants''' for the purpose of predicting their appearance based on their temperature was outlined by [[David Sudarsky]] and colleagues in the paper ''Albedo and Reflection Spectra of Extrasolar Giant Planets''&lt;ref name="sudarsky"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0004-637X/538/2/885/|author=Sudarsky, D.|author2=Burrows, A.|author3=Pinto, P.|title=Albedo and Reflection Spectra of Extrasolar Giant Planets|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] | volume=538 | date=2000 | pages=885–903 | doi=10.1086/309160 | bibcode=2000ApJ...538..885S|arxiv = astro-ph/9910504 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded on in ''Theoretical Spectra and Atmospheres of Extrasolar Giant Planets'',&lt;ref name="sudarsky2"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sudarsky, D. | author2=Burrows, A. | author3=Hubeny, I. | title=Theoretical Spectra and Atmospheres of Extrasolar Giant Planets | journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] | date=2003 | volume=588 | issue=2 | pages=1121–1148 | doi=10.1086/374331 | bibcode=2003ApJ...588.1121S|arxiv = astro-ph/0210216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published before any successful direct or indirect observation of an extrasolar planet atmosphere was made. It is a broad classification system with the goal of bringing some order to the likely rich variety of extrasolar gas-giant atmospheres.

[[Gas giant]]s are split into five classes (numbered using [[Roman numerals]]) according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties. In the Solar System, only [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are within the Sudarsky classification, and both are Class I.
The appearance of planets that are not gas giants cannot be predicted by the Sudarsky system, for example [[terrestrial planet]]s such as [[Earth]] and [[Venus]], [[HD 85512 b]] (3.6 [[Earth mass]]es) and [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb]] (5.5 Earth masses), or [[ice giant]]s such as [[Uranus]] (14 Earth masses) and [[Neptune]] (17 Earth masses).

== Background ==
The appearance of extrasolar planets is largely unknown because of the difficulty in making direct observations of [[extrasolar planets]]. In addition, analogies with planets in the [[Solar System]] can apply for few of the extrasolar planets known; because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example the [[hot Jupiter]]s.

Bodies that transit their star can be spectrographically mapped, for instance [[HD 189733 b]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2007-09/ssc2007-09a.shtml |title=First Map of Alien World |accessdate=November 23, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016161601/http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2007-09/ssc2007-09a.shtml |archivedate=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
That planet has further been shown to be blue with an [[albedo]] greater (brighter) than 0.14.&lt;ref name="Berdyugina"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.astro.phys.ethz.ch/papers/berdyugina/exoplanet_hd189733b.pdf | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=673 | issue=1 | date=20 January 2008 | title=First detection of polarized scattered light from an exoplanetary atmosphere | first=Svetlana V. | last=Berdyugina | author2=Andrei V.

Speculation on the appearances of ''unseen'' extrasolar planets currently relies upon computational models of the likely [[atmosphere]] of such a planet, for instance how the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile and composition would respond to varying degrees of [[insolation]].

== Planetary classes ==

=== Class I: Ammonia clouds ===
{{multiple image

| footer = [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], two Sudarsky class I gas giants.
}}
Planets in this class have appearances dominated by [[ammonia]] clouds. These planets are found in the outer regions of a [[planetary system]]. They exist at temperatures less than about {{convert|150|K|C F|sigfig=2}}. The predicted Bond [[albedo]] of a class I planet around a [[star]] like the [[Sun]] is 0.57, compared with a value of 0.343 for [[Jupiter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/jupiterfact.html Jupiter Fact Sheet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and 0.342 for [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/saturnfact.html Saturn Fact Sheet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy can be partially accounted for by taking into account non-equilibrium condensates such as [[tholin]]s or [[phosphorus]], which are responsible for the coloured clouds in the Jovian atmosphere, and are not modelled in the calculations.

The temperatures for a class I planet require a cool star or a distant orbit. The former stars might be too dim for us even to know about them, and the latter orbits might be too unpronounced for notice until several observations of those ''orbits''' "years" (cf. [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Third law|Kepler's third law]]). [[Superjovian]]s would have enough mass to improve these observations; but a superjovian of comparable age to Jupiter will have more [[internal heat]]ing than said planet, which could push it to a higher class.

As of 2015, [[47 Ursae Majoris c]] and [[47 Ursae Majoris d|d]] could be Class I planets. [[Upsilon Andromedae e]] and [[55 Cancri d]] may also be Class I planets.

=== Class II: Water clouds ===
Planets in class II are too warm to form ammonia clouds; instead their clouds are made up of [[water vapor]]. These characteristics are expected for planets with temperatures below around 250 K (-23°C; -10°F).&lt;ref name="sudarsky2" /&gt; Water clouds are more reflective than ammonia clouds, and the predicted Bond albedo of a class II planet around a Sun-like star is 0.81. Even though the clouds on such a planet would be similar to those of [[Earth]], the atmosphere would still consist mainly of [[hydrogen]] and hydrogen-rich molecules such as [[methane]].

Examples of possible class II planets: [[HD 45364 b]] and [[HD 45364 c]], [[HD 28185 b]], [[Gliese 876 b]] and [[Gliese 876 c|c]], [[Upsilon Andromedae d]], [[55 Cancri f]], [[47 Ursae Majoris b]], [[PH2b]], [[Kepler-90 h]], [[HD 10180 g]].

=== Class III: Cloudless ===
Planets with equilibrium temperatures between about 350 K (170&amp;nbsp;°F, 80&amp;nbsp;°C) and 800 K (980&amp;nbsp;°F, 530&amp;nbsp;°C) do not form global cloud cover, because they lack suitable chemicals in the atmosphere to form clouds.&lt;ref name="sudarsky2" /&gt; These planets would appear as featureless azure-blue globes because of [[Rayleigh scattering]] and absorption by [[methane]] in their atmospheres, appearing like Jovian-mass versions of [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. Because of the lack of a reflective cloud layer, the Bond albedo is low, around 0.12 for a class-III planet around a Sun-like star. They exist in the inner regions of a planetary system, roughly corresponding to the location of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].

Possible class-III planets are [[HD 37124 b]], [[HD 18742 b]], [[HD 178911 Bb]], [[55 Cancri c]], [[Upsilon Andromedae c]], [[Kepler-89e]], [[COROT-9b]] and [[HD 205739 b]]. Above 700 K (800&amp;nbsp;°F, 430&amp;nbsp;°C), sulfides and chlorides might provide [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]]-like clouds.&lt;ref name="sudarsky2" /&gt;

=== Class IV: Alkali metals ===
Above 900 K (630&amp;nbsp;°C/1160&amp;nbsp;°F), [[carbon monoxide]] becomes the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in a gas giant's atmosphere (rather than [[methane]]). Furthermore, the abundance of [[alkali metal]]s, such as [[sodium]] substantially increase, and [[spectral line]]s of [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] are predicted to be prominent in a gas giant's [[spectrum]]. These planets form cloud decks of [[silicate]]s and [[iron]] deep in their atmospheres, but this is not predicted to affect their spectrum. The Bond albedo of a class IV planet around a Sun-like star is predicted to be very low, at 0.03 because of the strong absorption by alkali metals. Gas giants of classes IV and V are referred to as [[hot Jupiter]]s.

[[55 Cancri b]] was listed as a class IV planet.&lt;ref name="sudarsky2"/&gt;

[[HD 209458 b]] at 1300 K (1000&amp;nbsp;°C) would be another such planet, with a geometric albedo of, within error limits, zero; and in 2001, NASA witnessed atmospheric sodium in its transit, though less than predicted. This planet hosts an upper cloud deck absorbing so much heat that below it is a relatively cool [[stratosphere]]. The composition of this dark cloud, in the models, is assumed to be titanium/vanadium oxide (sometimes abbreviated "TiVO"), by analogy with red dwarfs, but its true composition is yet unknown; it could well be as per Sudarsky.&lt;ref name=hubeny&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Spectrum and atmosphere models of irradiated transiting extrasolar giant planets |arxiv=0807.3588|date=2008 |author1=Ivan Hubeny |author2=Adam Burrows |doi=10.1017/S1743921308026458 |volume=4 |journal=Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union |page=239|bibcode=2009IAUS..253..239H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Radiative Hydrodynamical Studies of Irradiated Atmospheres |arxiv=0807.4541 |date=2008 |author1=Ian Dobbs-Dixon |doi=10.1017/S1743921308026495 |volume=4 |journal=Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union |page=273|bibcode=2009IAUS..253..273D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HD 189733 b]], with measured temperatures 920–1200 K (650–930&amp;nbsp;°C), also qualifies as class IV. However, in late 2007 it was measured as deep blue, with an albedo over 0.14 (possibly due to the brighter glow of its "hot spot"). No stratosphere has been conclusively proven for it as yet.

[[TrES-2b]] was measured with the lowest albedo, and therefore listed as class IV.

=== Class V: Silicate clouds ===
For the very hottest gas giants, with temperatures above 1400 K (2100&amp;nbsp;°F, 1100&amp;nbsp;°C) or cooler planets with lower gravity than Jupiter, the [[silicate]] and [[iron]] cloud decks are predicted to lie high up in the atmosphere. The predicted Bond albedo of a class V planet around a Sun-like star is 0.55, due to reflection by the cloud decks. At such temperatures, a gas giant may glow red from thermal radiation but the reflected light generally overwhelms thermal radiation. For stars of visual apparent magnitude under 4.50, such planets are theoretically visible to our instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Leigh C. | author2 = Collier C.

A related concept is that of '''linear sufficiency''', which is weaker than ''sufficiency'' but can be applied in some cases where there is no sufficient statistic, although it is restricted to linear estimators.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) — entry for linear sufficiency&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kolmogorov structure function]] deals with individual finite data; the related notion there is the algorithmic sufficient statistic.

The concept is due to [[Ronald Fisher|Sir Ronald Fisher]] in 1920. Stephen Stigler noted 1973 that the concept of sufficiency had fallen out of favor in [[descriptive statistics]] because of the strong dependence on an assumption of the distributional form (see [[#Exponential family|Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem]] below), but remained very important in theoretical work.&lt;ref name=Stigler1973&gt;{{cite journal

==Background==
Roughly, given a set &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; of [[independent identically distributed]] data conditioned on an unknown parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, a sufficient statistic is a function &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{X})&lt;/math&gt; whose value contains all the information needed to compute any estimate of the parameter (e.g. a [[maximum likelihood]] estimate).  Due to the factorization theorem ([[#Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem|see below]]), for a sufficient statistic &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{X})&lt;/math&gt;, the probabilty density can be written as &lt;math&gt;f_{\mathbf{X}}(x) = h(x) \, g(\theta, T(x))&lt;/math&gt;.  From this factorization, it can easily be seen that the maximum likelihood estimate of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; will interact with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; only through &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{X})&lt;/math&gt;.  Typically, the sufficient statistic is a simple function of the data, e.g. the sum of all the data points.

More generally, the "unknown parameter" may represent a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] of unknown quantities or may represent everything about the model that is unknown or not fully specified.  In such a case, the sufficient statistic may be a set of functions, called a ''jointly sufficient statistic''.  Typically, there are as many functions as there are parameters.  For example, for a [[Gaussian distribution]] with unknown [[mean]] and [[variance]], the jointly sufficient statistic, from which maximum likelihood estimates of both parameters can be estimated, consists of two functions, the sum of all data points and the sum of all squared data points (or equivalently, the [[sample mean]] and [[sample variance]]).

The concept is equivalent to the statement that, [[Conditional probability distribution|conditional]] on the value of a sufficient statistic for a parameter, the [[joint probability distribution]] of the data does not depend on that parameter. Both the statistic and the underlying parameter can be vectors.

==Mathematical definition==

A statistic ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T''(''X'') is '''sufficient for underlying parameter ''θ''''' precisely if the [[conditional probability distribution]] of the data ''X'', given the statistic ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T''(''X''), does not depend on the  parameter ''θ''.&lt;ref name="CasellaBerger"&gt;{{cite book | last = Casella | first = George |author2=Berger, Roger L.  | title = Statistical Inference, 2nd ed | publisher=Duxbury Press | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
As an example, the sample mean is sufficient for the mean (''μ'') of a [[normal distribution]] with known variance. Once the sample mean is known, no further information about ''μ'' can be obtained from the sample itself.  On the other hand, for an arbitrary distribution the [[median]] is not sufficient for the mean: even if the median of the sample is known, knowing the sample itself would provide further information about the population mean.  For example, if the observations that are less than the median are only slightly less, but observations exceeding the median exceed it by a large amount, then this would have a bearing on one's inference about the population mean.

==Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem==

''[[Ronald Fisher|Fisher's]] factorization theorem'' or ''factorization criterion'' provides a convenient '''characterization''' of a sufficient statistic.  If the [[probability density function]] is ƒ&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), then ''T'' is sufficient for ''θ'' [[if and only if]] nonnegative functions ''g'' and ''h'' can be found such that

:&lt;math&gt; f_\theta(x)=h(x) \, g_\theta(T(x)), &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the density ƒ can be factored into a product such that one factor, ''h'', does not depend on ''θ'' and the other factor, which does depend on ''θ'', depends on ''x'' only through ''T''(''x'').

It is easy to see that if ''F''(''t'') is a one-to-one function and ''T'' is a sufficient
statistic, then ''F''(''T'') is a sufficient statistic. In particular we can multiply a
sufficient statistic by a nonzero constant and get another sufficient statistic.

===Likelihood principle interpretation===
An implication of the theorem is that when using likelihood-based inference, two sets of data yielding the same value for the sufficient statistic ''T''(''X'') will always yield the same inferences about ''θ''.  By the factorization criterion, the likelihood's dependence on ''θ'' is only in conjunction with ''T''(''X'').  As this is the same in both cases, the dependence on ''θ'' will be the same as well, leading to identical inferences.

===Proof===
Due to Hogg and Craig.&lt;ref name="HoggCraig"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hogg | first = Robert V. |author2=Craig, Allen T.  | title = Introduction to Mathematical Statistics | publisher=Prentice Hall | year = 1995 | ISBN=978-0-02-355722-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n&lt;/math&gt;,  denote a random sample from a distribution having the [[Probability density function|pdf]] ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''θ'') for ''ι''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''θ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''δ''. Let ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a statistic whose pdf is ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;;&amp;nbsp;''θ''). Then ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a sufficient statistic for ''θ'' if and only if, for some function ''H'',

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i; \theta) = g_1 \left[u_1 (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n); \theta \right] H(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n). &lt;/math&gt;

First, suppose that
:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i; \theta) = g_1 \left[u_1 (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n); \theta \right] H(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n). &lt;/math&gt;

We shall make the transformation ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'', having inverse functions ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'', and [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] &lt;math&gt; J = \left[w_i/y_j \right] &lt;/math&gt;. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;
 \prod_{i=1}^n f \left[ w_i(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n); \theta \right]  = 
 |J| g_1 (y_1; \theta) H \left[ w_1(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n), \dots, w_n(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n) \right].
&lt;/math&gt;

The left-hand member is the joint pdf ''g''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;; θ) of ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  In the right-hand member, &lt;math&gt;g_1(y_1;\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the pdf of &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;H[ w_1, \dots , w_n] |J|&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of &lt;math&gt;g(y_1,\dots,y_n;\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_1(y_1;\theta)&lt;/math&gt;; that is, it is the conditional pdf &lt;math&gt;h(y_2, \dots, y_n \mid  y_1; \theta)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Y_2,\dots,Y_n&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;Y_1=y_1&lt;/math&gt;.

But &lt;math&gt;H(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;H\left[w_1(y_1,\dots,y_n), \dots, w_n(y_1, \dots, y_n))\right]&lt;/math&gt;, was given not to depend upon &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; was not introduced in the transformation and accordingly not in the Jacobian &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;h(y_2, \dots, y_n \mid y_1; \theta)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend upon &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistics for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

The converse is proven by taking:

:&lt;math&gt;g(y_1,\dots,y_n;\theta)=g_1(y_1; \theta) h(y_2, \dots, y_n \mid y_1),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h(y_2, \dots, y_n \mid y_1)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend upon &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;Y_2 ... Y_n&lt;/math&gt; depend only upon &lt;math&gt;X_1 ... X_n&lt;/math&gt;, which are independent on &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; when conditioned by &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt;, a sufficient statistics by hypothesis. Now divide both members by the absolute value of the non-vanishing Jacobian &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;, and replace &lt;math&gt;y_1, \dots, y_n&lt;/math&gt; by the functions &lt;math&gt;u_1(x_1, \dots, x_n), \dots, u_n(x_1,\dots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dots, x_n&lt;/math&gt;. This yields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{g\left[ u_1(x_1, \dots, x_n), \dots, u_n(x_1, \dots, x_n); \theta \right]}{|J^*|}=g_1\left[u_1(x_1,\dots,x_n); \theta\right] \frac{h(u_2, \dots, u_n \mid u_1)}{|J^*|}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J^*&lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian with &lt;math&gt;y_1,\dots,y_n&lt;/math&gt; replaced by their value in terms &lt;math&gt;x_1, \dots, x_n&lt;/math&gt;. The left-hand member is necessarily the joint pdf &lt;math&gt;f(x_1;\theta)\cdots f(x_n;\theta)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X_1,\dots,X_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;h(y_2,\dots,y_n\mid y_1)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;h(u_2,\dots,u_n\mid u_1)&lt;/math&gt;, does not depend upon &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;H(x_1,\dots,x_2)=\frac{h(u_2,\dots,u_n\mid u_1)}{|J^*|}&lt;/math&gt;

is a function that does not depend upon &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

===Another proof===
A simpler more illustrative  proof is as follows, although it applies only in the discrete case.

We use the shorthand notation to denote the joint probability density of &lt;math&gt;(X, T(X))&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f_\theta(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;f_\theta(x,t) = f_\theta(x)&lt;/math&gt;, as long as &lt;math&gt;t = T(x)&lt;/math&gt; and zero otherwise. Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_\theta(x) &amp; = f_\theta(x,t) \\
&amp; = f_\theta (x\mid t) f_\theta(t) \\
&amp; = f(x\mid t) f_\theta(t)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

with the last equality being true by the definition of sufficient statistics. Thus &lt;math&gt;f_\theta(x)=a(x) b_\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a(x) = f_{X \mid t}(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_\theta(t) = f_\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;f_\theta(x)=a(x) b_\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_\theta(t) &amp; = \sum _{x : T(x) = t} f_\theta(x, t) \\
&amp; = \sum _{x : T(x) = t} f_\theta(x) \\
&amp; = \sum _{x : T(x) = t} a(x) b_\theta(t) \\
&amp; = \left( \sum _{x : T(x) = t} a(x) \right) b_\theta(t).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

With the first equality by the [[Probability density function#Probability functions associated with multiple variables|definition of pdf for multiple variables]], the second by the remark above, the third by hypothesis, and the fourth because the summation is not over &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;f_{\theta\mid t}(x)&lt;/math&gt; denote the conditional probability density of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;T(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Then we can derive an explicit expression for this:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_{\theta\mid t}(x)
&amp; = \frac{f_\theta(x, t)}{f_\theta(t)} \\
&amp; = \frac{f_\theta(x)}{f_\theta(t)} \\
&amp; = \frac{a(x) b_\theta(t)}{\left( \sum _{x : T(x) = t} a(x) \right) b_\theta(t)} \\
&amp; = \frac{a(x)}{\sum _{x : T(x) = t} a(x)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

With the first equality by definition of conditional probability density, the second by the remark above, the third by the equality proven above, and the fourth by simplification. This expression does not depend on &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cnx.org/content/m11480/1.6/ | title=The Fisher–Neyman Factorization Theorem}}. Webpage at Connexions (cnx.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minimal sufficiency==
A sufficient statistic is '''minimal sufficient''' if it can be represented as a function of any other sufficient statistic. In other words, ''S''(''X'') is '''minimal sufficient''' if and only if&lt;ref&gt;Dodge (2003) — entry for minimal sufficient statistics&lt;/ref&gt;
#''S''(''X'') is sufficient, and
#if ''T''(''X'') is sufficient, then there exists a function ''f'' such that ''S''(''X'') = ''f''(''T''(''X'')).

Intuitively, a minimal sufficient statistic ''most efficiently'' captures all possible information about the parameter ''θ''.

A useful characterization of minimal sufficiency is that when the density ''f''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; exists, ''S''(''X'') is '''minimal sufficient''' if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f_\theta(x)}{f_\theta(y)}&lt;/math&gt; is independent of ''θ'' :&lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''S''(''x'') = ''S''(''y'')

This follows as a direct consequence from [[#Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem|Fisher's factorization theorem]] stated above.

A case in which there is no minimal sufficient statistic was shown by Bahadur, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann and Casella (1998), ''Theory of Point Estimation'', 2nd Edition, Springer, p 37&lt;/ref&gt; However, under mild conditions, a minimal sufficient statistic does always exist. In particular, in Euclidean space, these conditions always hold if the random variables (associated with &lt;math&gt;P_\theta&lt;/math&gt; ) are all discrete or are all continuous.

If there exists a minimal sufficient statistic, and this is usually the case, then every [[Completeness (statistics)|complete]] sufficient statistic is necessarily minimal sufficient&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann and Casella (1998), ''Theory of Point Estimation'', 2nd Edition, Springer, page 42&lt;/ref&gt;(note that this statement does not exclude the option of a pathological case in which a complete sufficient exists while there is no minimal sufficient statistic). While it is hard to find cases in which a minimal sufficient statistic does not exist, it is not so hard to find cases in which there is no complete statistic.

The collection of likelihood ratios &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{L(\theta_1\mid X)}{L(\theta_2\mid X)}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; is a minimal sufficient statistic if &lt;math&gt;P(X\mid \theta)&lt;/math&gt; is discrete or has a density function.

==Examples==
===Bernoulli distribution===

If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;....,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are independent [[Bernoulli trial|Bernoulli-distributed]] random variables with expected value ''p'', then the sum ''T''(''X'') =&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a sufficient statistic for ''p'' (here 'success' corresponds to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and 'failure' to  ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; so ''T'' is the total number of successes)

This is seen by considering the joint probability distribution:

:&lt;math&gt; \Pr\{X=x\}=\Pr\{X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,\ldots,X_n=x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the observations are independent, this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
p^{x_1}(1-p)^{1-x_1} p^{x_2}(1-p)^{1-x_2}\cdots p^{x_n}(1-p)^{1-x_n} &lt;/math&gt;

and, collecting powers of ''p'' and 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'',  gives

:&lt;math&gt;
p^{\sum x_i}(1-p)^{n-\sum x_i}=p^{T(x)}(1-p)^{n-T(x)}
&lt;/math&gt;

which satisfies the factorization criterion, with ''h''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 being just a constant.

Note the crucial feature: the unknown parameter ''p'' interacts with the data ''x'' only via the statistic ''T''(''x'') =&amp;nbsp;Σ&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

As a concrete application, this gives a procedure for creating a [[Fair_coin#Fair_results_from_a_biased_coin|fair coin from a biased coin]].

===Uniform distribution===
{{see also|German tank problem}}
If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are independent and [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] on the interval [0,''θ''], then ''T''(''X'') = max(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is sufficient for θ — the [[sample maximum]] is a sufficient statistic for the population maximum.

To see this, consider the joint [[probability density function]] of ''X''=(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_X(x_1,\ldots,x_n)
  &amp;= \frac{1}{\theta}\mathbf{1}_{\{0\leq x_1\leq\theta\}} \cdots
     \frac{1}{\theta}\mathbf{1}_{\{0\leq x_n\leq\theta\}} \\
  &amp;= \frac{1}{\theta^n}\mathbf{1}_{\{0\leq\min\{x_i\}\}}\mathbf{1}_{\{\max\{x_i\}\leq\theta\}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''1'''&lt;sub&gt;{''...''}&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[indicator function]].  Thus the density takes form required by the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem, where ''h''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''1'''&lt;sub&gt;{min{''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}≥0}&lt;/sub&gt;, and the rest of the expression is a function of only ''θ'' and ''T''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;max{''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}.

In fact, the [[minimum-variance unbiased estimator]] (MVUE) for ''θ'' is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{n+1}{n}T(X). &lt;/math&gt;

This is the sample maximum, scaled to correct for the [[bias of an estimator|bias]], and is MVUE by the [[Lehmann–Scheffé theorem]]. Unscaled sample maximum ''T''(''X'') is the [[maximum likelihood estimator]] for ''θ''.

===Uniform distribution (with two parameters)===

If &lt;math&gt;X_1,...,X_n&lt;/math&gt; are independent and [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] on the interval &lt;math&gt;[\alpha, \beta]&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are unknown parameters), then &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)=\left(\min_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i,\max_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a two-dimensional sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;(\alpha\, , \, \beta)&lt;/math&gt;.

To see this, consider the joint [[probability density function]] of &lt;math&gt;X_1^n=(X_1,\ldots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_{X_1^n}(x_1^n)
  &amp;= \prod_{i=1}^n \left({1 \over \beta-\alpha}\right) \mathbf{1}_{ \{ \alpha \leq x_i \leq \beta \} }
  = \left({1 \over \beta-\alpha}\right)^n \mathbf{1}_{ \{ \alpha \leq x_i \leq \beta, \, \forall \, i = 1,\ldots,n\}} \\
  &amp;= \left({1 \over \beta-\alpha}\right)^n \mathbf{1}_{ \{ \alpha \, \leq \, \min_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i \} } \mathbf{1}_{ \{ \max_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i \, \leq \, \beta \} }.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The joint density of the sample takes the form required by the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem, by letting

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
h(x_1^n)= 1, \quad
g_{(\alpha, \beta)}(x_1^n)= \left({1 \over \beta-\alpha}\right)^n \mathbf{1}_{ \{ \alpha \, \leq \, \min_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i \} } \mathbf{1}_{ \{ \max_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i \, \leq \, \beta \} }.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;h(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the parameter &lt;math&gt;(\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{(\alpha \, , \, \beta)}(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on &lt;math&gt;x_1^n&lt;/math&gt; through the function &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)= \left(\min_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i,\max_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i\right),&lt;/math&gt;

the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem implies &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n) = \left(\min_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i,\max_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;(\alpha\, , \, \beta)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Poisson distribution===

If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;....,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are independent and have a [[Poisson distribution]] with parameter ''λ'', then the sum ''T''(''X'') =&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a sufficient statistic for&amp;nbsp;''λ''.

To see this, consider the joint probability distribution:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Pr(X=x)=P(X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,\ldots,X_n=x_n).
&lt;/math&gt;

Because the observations are independent, this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x_1} \over x_1 !} \cdot
{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x_2} \over x_2 !} \cdots
{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x_n} \over x_n !}
&lt;/math&gt;

which may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
e^{-n\lambda} \lambda^{(x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n)} \cdot
{1 \over x_1 ! x_2 !\cdots x_n ! }
&lt;/math&gt;

which shows that the factorization criterion is satisfied, where ''h''(''x'') is the reciprocal of the product of the factorials.  Note the parameter λ interacts with the data only through its sum ''T''(''X'').

===Normal distribution===

If &lt;math&gt;X_1,\cdots,X_n&lt;/math&gt; are independent and [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] with expected value &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (a parameter) and known finite variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2,&lt;/math&gt; then 

:&lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)=\overline{x}=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^nX_i&lt;/math&gt; 

is a sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

To see this, consider the joint [[probability density function]] of &lt;math&gt;X_1^n=(X_1,\dots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities, i.e. -

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_{X_1^n}(x_1^n)
  &amp; = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp \left (-\frac{(x_i-\theta)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right ) \\ [6pt]
   &amp;= (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp \left ( -\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(x_i-\theta)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right ) \\ [6pt]
  &amp; = (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp \left (-\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{ \left ( \left (x_i-\overline{x} \right ) - \left (\theta-\overline{x} \right ) \right )^2}{2\sigma^2} \right ) \\ [6pt]
  &amp; = (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp \left( -{1\over2\sigma^2} \left(\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\overline{x})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n(\theta-\overline{x})^2 -2\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\overline{x})(\theta-\overline{x})\right) \right) \\ [6pt] 
  &amp;= (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp \left( -{1\over2\sigma^2} \left (\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\overline{x})^2 + n(\theta-\overline{x})^2 \right ) \right ) &amp;&amp; \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\overline{x})(\theta-\overline{x})=0 \\ [6pt]
  &amp;= (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp \left( -{1\over2\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\overline{x})^2 \right ) \exp \left (-\frac{n}{2\sigma^2} (\theta-\overline{x})^2 \right )

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The joint density of the sample takes the form required by the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem, by letting

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
h(x_1^n) &amp;= (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp \left( -{1\over2\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\overline{x})^2 \right ) \\[6pt]
g_{\theta}(x_1^n) &amp;=  \exp \left (-\frac{n}{2\sigma^2} (\theta-\overline{x})^2 \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;h(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{\theta}(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on &lt;math&gt;x_1^n&lt;/math&gt; through the function 

:&lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)=\overline{x}=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^nX_i,&lt;/math&gt;

the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem implies &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

(If &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2 &lt;/math&gt; is unknown: since &lt;math&gt;s^2  = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_i - \overline{x} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;,  the above likelihood can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_{X_1^n}(x_1^n)= (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp ( -\frac{n-1}{2\sigma^2}s^2 ) \exp \left (-\frac{n}{2\sigma^2} (\theta-\overline{x})^2 \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem still holds and implies that &lt;math&gt;(\overline{x},s^2)&lt;/math&gt; is a joint sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt; ( \theta , \sigma^2) &lt;/math&gt;.

===Exponential distribution===

If &lt;math&gt;X_1,\dots,X_n&lt;/math&gt; are independent and [[Exponential distribution|exponentially distributed]] with expected value ''θ'' (an unknown real-valued positive parameter), then &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)=\sum_{i=1}^nX_i&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistic for θ.

To see this, consider the joint [[probability density function]] of &lt;math&gt;X_1^n=(X_1,\dots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities, i.e. -

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_{X_1^n}(x_1^n)
  &amp;= \prod_{i=1}^n {1 \over \theta}  \, e^{ {-1 \over \theta}x_i }
   =               {1 \over \theta^n}\, e^{ {-1 \over \theta} \sum_{i=1}^nx_i }.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The joint density of the sample takes the form required by the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem, by letting

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
h(x_1^n)= 1,\,\,\,
g_{\theta}(x_1^n)= {1 \over \theta^n}\, e^{ {-1 \over \theta} \sum_{i=1}^nx_i }.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;h(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{\theta}(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on &lt;math&gt;x_1^n&lt;/math&gt; through the function &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)=\sum_{i=1}^nX_i&lt;/math&gt;

the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem implies &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)=\sum_{i=1}^nX_i&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

===Gamma distribution===

If &lt;math&gt;X_1,\dots,X_n&lt;/math&gt; are independent and distributed as a [[Gamma distribution|&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(\alpha \, , \, \beta) &lt;/math&gt;]], where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are unknown parameters of a [[Gamma distribution]], then &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n) = \left( \prod_{i=1}^n{X_i} , \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \right)&lt;/math&gt; is a two-dimensional sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;(\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt;.

To see this, consider the joint [[probability density function]] of &lt;math&gt;X_1^n=(X_1,\dots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities, i.e. -

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_{X_1^n}(x_1^n)
  &amp;= \prod_{i=1}^n \left({1 \over \Gamma(\alpha) \beta^{\alpha}}\right) x_i^{\alpha -1} e^{{-1 \over \beta}x_i}
  &amp;= \left({1 \over \Gamma(\alpha) \beta^{\alpha}}\right)^n \left(\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\right)^{\alpha-1} e^{{-1 \over \beta} \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The joint density of the sample takes the form required by the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem, by letting

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
h(x_1^n)= 1,\,\,\,
g_{(\alpha \, , \, \beta)}(x_1^n)= \left({1 \over \Gamma(\alpha) \beta^{\alpha}}\right)^n \left(\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\right)^{\alpha-1} e^{{-1 \over \beta} \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;h(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the parameter &lt;math&gt;(\alpha\, , \, \beta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{(\alpha \, , \, \beta)}(x_1^n)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on &lt;math&gt;x_1^n&lt;/math&gt; through the function &lt;math&gt;T(x_1^n)= \left( \prod_{i=1}^n{x_i} , \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

the Fisher–Neyman factorization theorem implies &lt;math&gt;T(X_1^n)= \left( \prod_{i=1}^n{X_i} , \sum_{i=1}^n{X_i} \right)&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;(\alpha\, , \, \beta).&lt;/math&gt;

==Rao–Blackwell theorem==

'''Sufficiency''' finds a useful application in the [[Rao–Blackwell theorem]], which  states that if ''g''(''X'') is any kind of estimator of ''θ'', then typically the conditional expectation of ''g''(''X'') given sufficient statistic ''T''(''X'') is a better estimator of ''θ'', and is never worse.  Sometimes one can very easily construct a very crude estimator ''g''(''X''), and then evaluate that conditional expected value to get an estimator that is in various senses optimal.

==Exponential family==
{{main|Exponential family}}
According to the '''Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem,''' among families of probability distributions whose domain does not vary with the parameter being estimated, only in [[exponential family|exponential families]] is there a sufficient statistic whose dimension remains bounded as sample size increases. Less tersely, suppose &lt;math&gt;X_n, n = 1, 2, 3, \dots&lt;/math&gt; are [[independent identically distributed]] random variables whose distribution is known to be in some family of probability distributions with fixed support. Only if that family is an exponential family there is a (possibly vector-valued) sufficient statistic &lt;math&gt;T(X_1, \dots, X_n)&lt;/math&gt; whose number of scalar components does not increase as the sample size ''n'' increases.

This theorem shows that sufficiency (or rather, the existence of a scalar or vector-valued of bounded dimension sufficient statistic) sharply restricts the possible forms of the distribution.

==Other types of sufficiency==
===Bayesian sufficiency===

An alternative formulation of the condition that a statistic be sufficient, set in a Bayesian context, involves the posterior distributions obtained by using the full data-set and by using only a statistic. Thus the requirement is that, for almost every ''x'',

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(\theta\mid X=x) = \Pr(\theta\mid T(X)=t(x)). &lt;/math&gt;

More generally, without assuming a parametric model, we can say that the statistics ''T'' is ''predictive sufficient'' if

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(X'=x'\mid X=x) = \Pr(X'=x'\mid T(X)=t(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

It turns out that this "Bayesian sufficiency" is a consequence of the formulation above,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear sufficiency===

A concept called "linear sufficiency" can be formulated in a Bayesian context,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Goldstein |first2=A. |last2=O'Hagan |year=1996 |title=Bayes Linear Sufficiency and Systems of Expert Posterior Assessments |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]] |series=Series B |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=301–316 |jstor=2345978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Godambe |first=V.

Thus, practitioners of the philosophy potentially face the challenge of living in an industrial society and adapting alternative norms, technologies, or practices.

Additionally, practical [[ecovillage]] builders like [[Living Villages]] maintain that the shift to alternative technologies will only be successful if the resultant built environment is attractive to a local [[culture]] and can be maintained and adapted as necessary over multiple generations.

Sustainable living is fundamentally the application of [[sustainability]] to lifestyle choice and decisions.

In the first conception, sustainable living can be described as living within the innate carrying capacities defined by these factors. In the second or [[Circles of Sustainability]] conception, sustainable living can be described as negotiating the relationships of needs within limits across all the interconnected domains of social life, including consequences for future human generations and non-human [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;http://citiesprogramme.com/aboutus/our-approach/circles-of-sustainability&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainable design]] and [[sustainable development]] are critical factors to sustainable living.

==Shelter==
[[Image:PA120016.JPG|thumb|right|240px|An example of ecological housing]]
On a global scale, shelter is associated with about 25% of the [[greenhouse gas]] emissions embodied in household purchases and 26% of households' [[land use]].&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivanova"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Environmental Impact Assessment of Household Consumption|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.12371/abstract|journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology|date = 2015-12-01|issn = 1530-9290|pages = 526–536|doi = 10.1111/jiec.12371|language = en|first = Diana|last = Ivanova|first2 = Konstantin|last2 = Stadler|first3 = Kjartan|last3 = Steen-Olsen|first4 = Richard|last4 = Wood|first5 = Gibran|last5 = Vita|first6 = Arnold|last6 = Tukker|first7 = Edgar G.|last7 = Hertwich|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Green building|Sustainable homes]] are built using sustainable methods, materials, and facilitate green practices, enabling a more sustainable lifestyle. Their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the Earth. Often, if necessary, they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores, schools, daycares, work, or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. ''Green Living for Dummies.'' Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, they are [[off-the-grid]] homes that do not require any public energy, water, or sewer service.

If not off-the-grid, sustainable homes may be linked to a grid supplied by a power plant that is using sustainable power sources, buying power as is normal convention. Additionally, sustainable homes may be connected to a grid, but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility. There are two common methods to approaching this option: net metering and double metering.&lt;ref name="McDilda, Diane Gow 2007"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. ''The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment.'' Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Net metering uses the common meter that is installed in most homes, running forward when power is used from the grid, and running backward when power is put into the grid (which allows them to “net“ out their total energy use, putting excess energy into the grid when not needed, and using energy from the grid during peak hours, when you may not be able to produce enough immediately). Power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid, as it is being produced. Double metering involves installing two meters: one measuring electricity consumed, the other measuring electricity created. Additionally, or in place of selling their renewable energy, sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries. This gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times (i.e.: night-time, when there has been no wind, etc.), and to be completely independent of the [[electrical grid]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. ''The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment''. Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainably designed (see [[Sustainable Design]]) houses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/greenbuilding/2010/05/18/what-is-a-sustainable-home-a-truly-green-home/|title=What is a Sustainable Home?

The design of a sustainable shelter affords the options it has later (i.e.: using [[Passive solar building design|passive solar lighting and heating]], creating temperature buffer zones by adding porches, deep overhangs to help create favorable microclimates, etc.)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"&gt;Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton. ''The Self-sufficient-ish Bible: an Eco-living Guide for the 21st Century.'' London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustainably constructed houses involve environmentally friendly management of waste building materials such as recycling and composting, use non-toxic and renewable, recycled, reclaimed, or low-impact production materials that have been created and treated in a sustainable fashion (such as using organic or water-based finishes), use as much locally available materials and tools as possible so as to reduce the need for transportation, and use low-impact production methods (methods that minimize effects on the environment).&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Clarke, and Tim Callahan.

Many materials can be considered a “green” material until its background is revealed. Any material that has used toxic or carcinogenic chemicals in its treatment or manufacturing (such as [[formaldehyde]] in glues used in woodworking), has traveled extensively from its source or manufacturer, or has been cultivated or harvested in an unsustainable manner might not be considered green. In order for any material to be considered green, it must be resource efficient, not compromise [[indoor air quality]] or [[water conservation]], and be energy efficient (both in processing and when in use in the shelter).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Resource efficiency can be achieved by using as much recycled content, reusable or recyclable content, materials that employ recycled or recyclable packaging, locally available material, salvaged or remanufactured material, material that employs resource efficient manufacturing, and long-lasting material as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/greenbuilding/Materials/ Green Building Materials: Sustainable Building.] CalRecycle.

===Sustainable building materials===
Some building materials might be considered "sustainable" by some definitions and under some conditions.  For example,  wood might be thought of as sustainable if it is grown using [[sustainable forest management]], processed using [[sustainable energy]].  delivered by [[sustainable transport]], etc.:  Under different conditions, however, it might not be considered as sustainable.  The following materials might be considered as sustainable under certain conditions, based on a [[Life-cycle assessment]].

[[Building insulation|Insulation]] of a sustainable home is important because of the energy it conserves throughout the life of the home. Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or, in combination with a house that is well designed, eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"/&gt; Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home.&lt;ref name="McDilda, Diane Gow 2007"/&gt;  Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Low-emissivity]] or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation. It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"/&gt; “Superwindows,” mentioned in [[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]], became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and a heavy gas filling. Although more expensive, they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory B. Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the next Industrial Revolution.'' Boston: Little, Brown and, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Equipping roofs with highly reflective material (such as aluminum) increases a roof's [[albedo]] and will help reduce the amount of heat it absorbs, hence, the amount of energy needed to cool the building it is on. [[Green roofs]] or “living roofs” are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building. They are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and, when in the broader picture of a community, reduce the heat island effect (see [[urban heat island]]) thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area. It is arguable that they are able to replace the physical “footprint” that the building creates, helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the building‘s presence.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlip, Jamie.

Energy efficiency and water conservation are also major considerations in sustainable housing. If using appliances, computers, [[HVAC]] systems, electronics, or lighting the sustainable-minded often look for an [[Energy Star]] label, which is government-backed and holds stricter regulations in energy and water efficiency than is required by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.pr_how_earn How a Product Earns the ENERGY STAR Label : ENERGY STAR."] ENERGY STAR.

As mentioned under Shelter, some sustainable households may choose to produce their own renewable energy, while others may choose to purchase it through the grid from a power company that harnesses sustainable sources (also mentioned previously are the methods of metering the production and consumption of electricity in a household). Purchasing sustainable energy, however, may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability. 6 out of the 50 states in the US do not offer green energy, for example. For those that do, its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid. Technically, in this case, the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/news/2007/07/buy-green-power-and-electricity-to-help-the-environment/overview/0707_buying_green_power_ov.htm Buy Green Power and Electricity to Help the Environment]. Consumer Reports: Expert Product Reviews and Product Ratings from Our Test Labs. Consumers Union of U.S., July 2007. Web. 28 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it is possible that the amount of green electricity that the buying household receives is a small fraction of their total incoming electricity. This may or may not depend on the amount being purchased. The purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utility’s effort in producing sustainable energy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton. The Self-sufficient-ish Bible: an Eco-living Guide for the 21st Century. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Producing sustainable energy on an individual household or community basis is much more flexible, but can still be limited in the richness of the sources that the location may afford (some locations may not be rich in renewable energy sources while others may have an abundance of it).

When generating renewable energy and feeding it back into the grid (in participating countries such as the US and Germany), producing households are typically paid at least the full standard electricity rate by their utility and are also given separate renewable energy credits that they can then sell to their utility, additionally (utilities are interested in buying these renewable energy credits because it allows them to claim that they produce renewable energy). In some special cases, producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate, but this is not common.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, Kate.

[[File:Solar panels in Ogiinuur.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An installation of [[solar panel]]s in rural Mongolia]]

Solar power harnesses the energy of the sun to make electricity. Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are [[Solar cells|photo-voltaic cells]] that are organized into panels and [[concentrated solar power]], which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an [[electrical generator]] via a [[steam turbine]] or [[heat engine]], or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/csp_program.html Solar Energy Technologies Program: Concentrating Solar Power]. Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy. US Department of Energy, 19 October 2010. Web. 31 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment. Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a [[direct current]] and has to be converted to [[alternating current]] before it can be used in a household. At this point, users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use, or use an AC/DC inverter for immediate use. To get the best out of a solar panel, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] of the sun should be between 20 and 50 degrees. Solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy, but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases. It has the advantages of being portable, easy to use on an individual basis, readily available for government grants and incentives, and being flexible regarding location (though it is most efficient when used in hot, arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; For those that are lucky, affordable rental schemes may be found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale, because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a [[parabolic reflector]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery, Yvonne 2008"&gt;Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. Green Living for Dummies. Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar thermal energy]] is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun. One of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through [[solar water heating]]. In a broad perspective, these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors, are either passive or active systems (active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank) and, in active systems, involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used. Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system (instead, they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850 Energy Savers: Solar Water Heaters]. Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy. US Department of Energy, 20 October 2010. Web. 28 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods of harnessing solar power are [[Solar combisystem|solar space heating]] (for heating internal building spaces), solar drying (for drying wood chips, fruits, grains, etc.), [[solar cookers]], [[Solar distillation|solar distillers]], and other [[passive solar]] technologies (simply, harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means).

Wind power is harnessed through turbines, set on tall towers (typically 20’ or 6m with 10‘ or 3m diameter blades for an individual household‘s needs) that power a generator that creates electricity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; They typically require an average of wind speed of 9&amp;nbsp;mi/hr (14&amp;nbsp;km/hr) to be worth their investment (as prescribed by the US Department of Energy), and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes. Wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 30’ (10m) in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions (such as neighboring buildings). Mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities. Wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce, their appearance, and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds (their blades obstruct passage in the sky). Wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt, approaching the cost of fossil fuels, and have quick paybacks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

For those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed (or falling from an adequate height) on their property, [[hydroelectricity]] may be an option. On a large scale, hydroelectricity, in the form of dams, has adverse environmental and social impacts. When on a small scale, however, in the form of single turbines, hydroelectricity is very sustainable. Single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive. On an individual household basis, single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route (but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production). It is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Geothermal energy production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earth’s surface, in reservoirs, to produce energy. Because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir, this source is considered sustainable. However, those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited (they cool down over time, making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible). This method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment. There do exist small individual scale geothermal operations, however, which harness reservoirs very close to the Earth’s surface, avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression. In this case, the heat is captured and sent to a [[geothermal heat pump]] system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it (often, this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months).&lt;ref name="Jeffery, Yvonne 2008"/&gt; Although geothermal energy is available everywhere on Earth, practicality and cost-effectiveness varies, directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs. Places such as the Philippines, Hawaii,  Alaska, Iceland, California, and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earth’s surface, making its production cost-effective.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

Biomass power is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel. As with the case of using green materials in a household, it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation. Although burning biomass for fuel releases [[carbon dioxide]], sulfur compounds, and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle, the amount that is released is sustainable (it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere). This is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; However, burning [[biodiesel]] and bioethanol (see [[biofuel]]) when created from virgin material, is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty, the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields (the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food), and may use unsustainable growing methods (such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester Russell. Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to save Civilization. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Digestion of organic material to produce methane is becoming an increasingly popular method of biomass energy production. Materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity. Methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills, full of decomposing waste, and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well. The advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere, exacerbating the greenhouse effect. Although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale (done in landfills), it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

==Food==
Globally, food accounts for 48% and 70% of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy and processed food rising quickly with income&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivanova"/&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Environmental impacts of industrial agriculture===

[[Industrial agriculture|Industrial agricultural production]] is highly resource and energy intensive.  Industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy [[irrigation]], extensive [[Pesticide application|pesticide]] and [[Fertilizer|fertilizer application]], intensive [[tillage]], concentrated [[monoculture]] production, and other continual inputs. As a result of these industrial farming conditions, today’s mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated. These stresses include: declining [[water table]]s, chemical [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], chemical [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[soil erosion]], [[land degradation]], loss in [[biodiversity]], and other ecological concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester R. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization''. W.W. Norton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conventional food distribution and long distance transport===

[[Conventional]] food distribution and long distance transport are additionally [[resource]] and [[energy]] exhaustive.  Substantial climate-disrupting [[carbon emissions]], boosted by the transport of food over long distances, are of growing concern as the world faces such [[global crisis]] as [[natural resource]] depletion, [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinberg, Richard. ''Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World''. Canada: New Society Publishers, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; “The average American meal currently costs about 1500 miles, and takes about 10 [[calorie]]s of oil and other [[fossil fuel]]s to produce a single calorie of food.”&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"&gt;Astyk, Sharon. ''Depletion and Abundance: Life on the New Home Front''. Canada: New Society Publishers,  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local and seasonal foods===

A more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally. Buying food from local farmers reduces [[carbon output]], caused by long-distance food transport, and stimulates the local economy.&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"/&gt; Local, small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage, [[nutrient cycling]], fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications.&lt;ref name="Shiva, Vandana 2000"&gt;Shiva, Vandana. ''Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply''. Cambridge, MA: South End Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting a more regional, seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport. These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable [[growing season]]. Thus, [[seasonal food]] farming does not require energy intensive [[greenhouse]] production, extensive irrigation, plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods, and other environmental stressors.&lt;ref name="Seymour, John 2003"&gt;Seymour, John. ''The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It''. London: DK Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Local, seasonal produce is typically fresher, unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious. Local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling.&lt;ref&gt;Princen, Thomas. ''The Logic of Sufficiency''. New York: MIT Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Farmers' market]]s, public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce, are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions.  As well as promoting localization of food, farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction.&lt;ref name="Todd, J 1994"&gt;Todd, J. and N. J. Todd. ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines: Principles of Ecological Design''. Berkeley, CA:  North Atlantic Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA). A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production. CSA's usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits, sometimes including dairy products, meat and special food items such as baked goods.&lt;ref&gt;Nabhan, Gary. ''Coming Home to Eat''. Berkeley, CA: W.W. Norton, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis, the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine. Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic, economical, and sociopolitical disasters were to occur.&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"/&gt;

===Reducing meat consumption===

Industrial meat production also involves high environmental costs such as [[land degradation]], [[soil erosion]] and depletion of [[natural resource]]s, especially pertaining to water and food.&lt;ref name="Seymour, John 2003"/&gt; Mass meat production increase the amount of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]].  For more information on the [[environmental impact of meat production]] and consumption, see the [[ethics of eating meat]]. Reducing meat consumption, perhaps to a few meals a week, or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production. Buying and consuming organically raised, [[free range]] or [[Grass fed|grass fed meat]] is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption.&lt;ref name="Shiva, Vandana 2000"/&gt;

===Organic farming===

Purchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living. [[Organic farming]] is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability. According to the [[USDA]] [[National Organic Standards Board]] (NOSB), [[organic agriculture]] is defined as "an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain, or enhance ecological harmony. The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people." Upon sustaining these goals, organic agriculture uses techniques such as [[crop rotation]], [[permaculture]], [[compost]], [[green manure]] and [[biological pest control]]. In addition, organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides, [[plant growth regulators]] such as [[hormones]], livestock [[antibiotics]], [[food additives]] and [[genetically modified organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html Organic Agriculture - What is Organic Agriculture?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018130008/http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html |date=18 October 2010 }} Iowa State University. 2008. Web. Retrieved on: 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Organically farmed products include vegetables, fruit, grains, herbs, meat, dairy, eggs, fibers, and flowers. See [[organic certification]] for more information.

===Urban gardening===
[[File:Ganjiaxiang - edible landscaping - P1070640.JPG|thumb|"Edible landscaping": a vegetable garden incorporated by the local residents into a roadside park. [[Qixia District]], [[Nanjing]], China]]
In addition to local, small-scale farms, there has been a recent emergence in [[urban agriculture]] expanding from [[community gardens]] to private [[home gardens]]. With this trend, both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in [[food production]]. A network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities.&lt;ref&gt;Flores, H.C. ''Food Not Lawns: How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; With every bite of food raised from urban gardens, negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways. For instance, vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] required for industrial agricultural operations. The nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables. Nitrogen fertilizer also produces [[nitrous oxide]], a more damaging [[greenhouse gas]] than [[carbon dioxide]]. Local, community-grown food also requires no imported, long-distance transport which further depletes our [[fossil fuel]] reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Nyerges, Christopher. ''Urban Wilderness: a guidebook to resourceful city living''. Culver, CA: Peace Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; In developing more efficiency per land acre, urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas: in vacant lots, public parks, private yards, church and school yards, on roof tops ([[roof-top garden]]s), and many other places.  Communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible.&lt;ref&gt;Hemenway, Toby. ''Gaia’s Garden''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetically pleasing [[edible landscaping]] plants can also be incorporated into city landscaping such as blueberry bushes, grapevines trained on an arbor, pecan trees, etc.&lt;ref name="Todd, J 1994"/&gt; With as small a scale as home or community farming, sustainable and organic farming methods can easily be utilized. Such sustainable, organic farming techniques include: [[composting]], [[biological pest control]], [[crop rotation]], [[mulching]], [[drip irrigation]], [[nutrient cycling]] and [[permaculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Warde, Jon, ed. ''The Backyard Builder: Over 150 Projects for Your Garden, Home and Yard''. New York:  Random House, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; For more information on sustainable farming systems, see [[sustainable agriculture]].

===Food preservation and storage===

Preserving and storing foods reduces reliance on long-distance transported food and the market industry. Home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year, enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket. Food can be preserved and saved by [[Dehydration (food)|dehydration]], [[Freezing (food)|freezing]], [[vacuum packing]], [[canning]], [[bottling]], [[pickling]] and jellying.&lt;ref&gt;Ciperthwaite, Wm. ''A Handmade Life: In Search of Simplicity''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; For more information, see [[food preservation]].

==Transportation==
{{main|Sustainable transport}}
[[File:20120623 ChevyVolt-Chicago-Compost.jpg|thumb|A [[carsharing]] [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicle being used to drop off [[compost]] at an urban facility in [[Chicago]].]]
With rising [[peak oil]] concerns, [[climate warming]] exacerbated by [[carbon emissions]] and high energy prices, the conventional [[automobile industry]] is becoming less and less feasible to the conversation of sustainability. Revisions of [[Public transport|urban transport]] systems that foster mobility, low-cost transportation and healthier urban environments are needed. Such urban transport systems should consist of a combination of [[rail transport]], [[bus transport]], [[bicycle]] pathways and [[pedestrian]] [[walkways]]. Public transport systems such as underground rail systems and bus transit systems shift huge numbers of people away from reliance on car [[mobilization]] and dramatically reduce the rate of carbon emissions caused by automobile transport.&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009"&gt;Brown, Lester R. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization''. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carpooling]] is another alternative for reducing oil consumption and carbon emissions by transit.

In comparison to automobiles, bicycles are a paragon of energy efficient personal transportation with the bicycle roughly 50 times more energy efficient than driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/science/the-bicycle-and-the-ride-to-modern-america.html|title=The Bicycle and the Ride to Modern America|date=13 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycles increase mobility while alleviating [[Traffic congestion|congestion]], lowering [[Air pollution|air]] and [[noise pollution]], and increasing [[physical exercise]]. Most importantly, they do not emit climate-disturbing [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009"/&gt; [[Bike-sharing]] programs are beginning to boom throughout the world and are modeled in leading cities such as [[Paris]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen|first=Susan|author2=Stacey Guzman|title=Worldwide Bikesharing|journal=Access Magazine|year=2011|url=http://uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326063609/http://www.uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml|archivedate=26 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bike-sharing programs offer [[kiosks]] and docking stations that supply hundreds to thousands of bikes for rental throughout a city through small deposits or affordable memberships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen|first=Susan|author2=Guzman, S.|author3=H. Zhang|title=Bikesharing in Europe, the Americas, and Asia: Past, Present, and Future|journal=Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research|year=2010|url=http://76.12.4.249/artman2/uploads/1/Bikesharing_in_Europe__the_Americas__and_Asia.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610155608/http://76.12.4.249/artman2/uploads/1/Bikesharing_in_Europe__the_Americas__and_Asia.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent boom has occurred in [[electric bicycles|electric bikes]] especially in China and other Asian countries. Electric bikes are similar to [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicles in that they are battery powered and can be plugged into the provincial [[electric grid]] for recharging as needed. In contrast to plug-in hybrid cars, electric bikes do not directly use any [[fossil fuels]].  Adequate sustainable urban transportation is dependent upon proper city [[infrastructure]] and planning that incorporates efficient public transit along with bicycle and pedestrian-friendly pathways.&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009" /&gt;  Patrick Maria Johnson was the founder of this.

==Water==
{{Contradicts other|date=December 2013|1=Water efficiency}}
{{main|Water efficiency}}
A major factor of sustainable living involves that which no human can live without, [[water]]. Unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind.  Currently, humans use one-fourth of the Earth’s total fresh water in natural circulation, and over half the accessible [[Surface runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution''. New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[population growth]] and water demand is ever increasing. Thus, it is necessary to use available water more efficiently. In sustainable living, one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple, everyday measures.  These measures involve considering indoor [[home appliance]] efficiency, outdoor water use, and daily water use awareness.

===Indoor home appliances===

Housing and [[commercial buildings]] account for 12 percent of America’s freshwater withdrawals.&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"/&gt;  A typical American single family home uses about {{convert|70|USgal|L}} per person per day indoors.&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"/&gt; This use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to [[Home appliance|appliance]] quality.

====Toilets====

[[Toilets]] accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor water use in the United States in 1999.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/watersense/pubs/indoor.html Indoor Water Use in the United States] WaterSense: An EPA Partnership Program. US Environmental Protection Agency, 9 November 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.&lt;ref name="HawkenPaul"&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution.'' New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
A home’s toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A [http://www.floatbooster.com/Product.html float booster] attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.

If installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model. A [[low flush toilet]] uses one to two gallons per flush.  Traditionally, toilets use three to five gallons per flush. If an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place, 70% of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html Green Building Health and Environmental Considerations in Building and Renovating Today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130194906/http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html |date=30 November 2010 }} Urban Builders Group. Urban Builders Group LTD. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to have a toilet that uses no water.  A [[composting toilet]] treats human waste through [[composting]] and [[dehydration]], producing a valuable soil additive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php What is a Composting Toilet?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120223832/http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php |date=20 November 2010 }} Composting Toilet World. Envirolet. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces.  The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer.  The feces can be dried and bagged or composted.  These toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup.  In addition to providing valuable fertilizer, these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment, as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve [[topsoil]].

Additionally, one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing. For instance, instead of flushing small wastes, such as tissues, one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost.

====Showers====

On average, showers were 18% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999, at {{convert|6|-|8|USgal|L}} per minute traditionally in America.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; A simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow, high-performance showerheads.  These showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less. An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter. This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature.  [[Solar water heater]]s can be used to obtain optimal water temperature, and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels. To lessen excess water use, water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation. This insulation decreases hot water generation time. A simple, straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers.   One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary (such as while lathering) and resuming the shower when water is necessary.  This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting (common in the UK but not the United States).

====Dishwashers and sinks====

On average, sinks were 15% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; There are, however, easy methods to rectify excessive water loss. Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator. This device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume, reducing water use by half. Additionally, there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature. Finally, a [[laminar flow]] device creates a 1.5-2.4 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half, but can be turned to normal water level when optimal.

In addition to buying the above devices, one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks, and fixing these links if they exist. According to the EPA, "A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day, while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; When washing dishes by hand, it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing, and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously.

On average, dishwashing consumes 1% of indoor water use.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; When using a [[dishwasher]], water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full.  Some have a "low flow" setting to use less water per wash cycle. Enzymatic [[detergents]] clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====Washing machines====

On average, 23% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999 was due to clothes washing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In contrast to other machines, American [[washing machines]] have changed little to become more sustainable. A typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design, in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water. Horizontal-axis machines, in contrast, put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it. These machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability.

===Outdoor water use===

There are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal [[yard]], [[roof]], and [[garden]] in more sustainable living. While conserving water is a major element of sustainability, so is sequestering water.

====Conserving water====

In planning a yard and garden space, it is most sustainable to consider the plants, soil, and available water.  Drought resistant shrubs, plants, and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species.  Additionally, native plants (as opposed to herbaceous perennials) will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area.  [[Xeriscaping]] is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as [[slope]], [[soil type]], and [[native plant]] range.  It can reduce landscape water use by 50 – 70%, while providing [[habitat]] space for wildlife.  Plants on slopes help reduce [[Surface runoff|runoff]] by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall.  Grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste.

After planting, placing a circumference of [[mulch]] surrounding plants functions to lessen [[evaporation]].  To do this, firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline. This prevents [[water runoff]].   When watering, consider the range of sprinklers; watering paved areas is unnecessary.  Additionally, to conserve the maximum amount of water, watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation.  Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system.  Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose, leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period.  These systems use 30 – 50% less water than conventional methods.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkham, R. and Dyer, J., 1993: "Linking Water and Energy Savings in Irrigation," Rocky Mountain Institute Publication #A94-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf Soaker Hoses: Good for your Garden, Your Wallet, and Our Environment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011035501/http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf |date=11 October 2010 }} Saving Water Partnership. Seattle and Participating Area Water Utilities. 2005. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  They connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch.  A layer of [[organic material]] added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention; previously planted areas can be covered with [[compost]].

In caring for a lawn, there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques.  A primary aspect of lawn care is watering.  To conserve water, it is important to only water when necessary, and to deep soak when watering.  Additionally, a lawn may be left to go dormant, renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality.

====Sequestering water====

A common method of water sequestrations is [[rainwater harvesting]], which incorporates the collection and storage of rain.  Primarily, the rain is obtained from a roof, and stored on the ground in catchment tanks.  Water sequestration varies based on extent, cost, and complexity.   A simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout, while a more complex method involves multiple tanks.  It is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets.  Additionally, using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff [[pollution]], picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains.  The following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply:

Collection area (square feet) × Rainfall (inch/year) / 12 (inch/foot) = Cubic Feet of Water/Year

Cubic Feet/Year × 7.43 (Gallons/Cubic Foot) = Gallons/year

Note, however, this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=182095 How to Manage Stormwater: Rain Barrels]. Stormwater Management for Clean Rivers. Environmental Services. Web. 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greywater]] systems function in sequestering used indoor water, such as laundry, bath and sink water, and filtering it for reuse.  Greywater can be reused in [[irrigation]] and toilet flushing.  There are two types of greywater systems: gravity fed manual systems and package systems.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"&gt;[http://www.greenbuildingsupply.com/Public/Energy-WaterConservation/GreywaterSystems/index.cfm Greywater Systems: Reusing Bath, Laundry, and Sink Water to Conserve Fresh Water]. Green Building Supply. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The manual systems do not require electricity but may require a larger yard space.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"/&gt;  The package systems require electricity but are self-contained and can be installed indoors.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"/&gt;

==Waste==

As populations and resource demands climb, waste production contributes to [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]] of [[carbon dioxide]], leaching of hazardous materials into the soil and waterways, and [[methane emissions]].  In America alone, over the course of a decade, 500 trillion pounds of American resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases.&lt;ref name="HawkenPaul" /&gt; Thus, a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious.  One can do this by reducing waste, reusing commodities, and recycling.

There are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living.  Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t credit card and insurance offers] and [http://www.dmachoice.org/ direct mail marketing] and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails.  Junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of landfill waste in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catalogchoice.org/environmental-facts|title=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service - Put an end to junk mail, catalogs, and phone books.|website=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk, reducing packaging materials. Preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthwormtechnologies.com/about-us/|title=Our Story|first=Earthworm|last=Technologies®|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint. Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Reduce] United States Environmental Protection Agency. 5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By reusing materials, one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills. Reusing saves [[natural resources]] by decreasing the necessity of [[raw material]] extraction. For example, reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects.

[[Recycling]], a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials, is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods.  Recycling incorporates three primary processes; collection and processing, manufacturing, and purchasing recycled products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Wastes – Resource Conservation – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle] United States Environmental Protection Agency.  5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  A natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil, which can be carried out at home or locally with community [[composting]]. An offshoot of recycling, [[upcycling]], strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php UpCycle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112170212/http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php |date=12 November 2010 }} Sustainability Management. Presidio Graduate School. Web. 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating measures of reusing, reducing, and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use materials in a more sustainable manner.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Syncope''', also known as '''fainting''', is a loss of [[consciousness]] and muscle strength characterized by a fast onset, short duration, and spontaneous recovery.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; It is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the [[brain]], typically from [[hypotension|low blood pressure]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; There are sometimes [[prodrome|symptoms before the loss of consciousness]] such as lightheadedness, [[diaphoresis|sweating]], [[pale skin]], blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, or feeling warm.&lt;!-- &lt;re name=EB2014/&gt; --&gt; Syncope may also be associated with a short episode of muscle twitching.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; When consciousness and muscle strength are not completely lost, it is called [[presyncope]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; It is recommended that presyncope be treated the same as syncope.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
Causes range from non-serious to potentially fatal.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; There are three broad categories of causes: [[heart]] or [[blood vessel]] related, [[reflex syncope|reflex]] also known as [[Nervous system|neurally]] mediated, and [[orthostatic hypotension]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Issues with the heart and blood vessels are the cause in about 10% and typically the most serious while neurally mediated is the most common.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Heart related causes may include an [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythm]], problems with the [[heart valve]]s or heart muscle and blockages of blood vessels from a [[pulmonary embolism]] or [[aortic dissection]] among others.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Neurally mediated syncope occurs when blood vessels expand and [[bradycardia|heart rate decreases]] inappropriately.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; This may occur from either a triggering event such as exposure to blood, pain, strong feelings or a specific activity such as [[urination]], [[vomiting]], or [[coughing]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; This type of syncope may also occur when an area in the neck known as the [[carotid sinus]] is pressed.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; The third type of syncope is due to a drop in blood pressure from standing up.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; This is often due to medications that a person is taking but may also be related to [[dehydration]], significant bleeding or [[infection]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Diagnosis and management --&gt;
A medical history, physical examination, and [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) are the most effective ways to figure out the underlying cause.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; The ECG is useful to detect an abnormal heart rhythm, [[coronary artery disease|poor blood flow to the heart muscle]], and other electrical issue such as [[long QT syndrome]] and [[Brugada syndrome]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Heart related causes also often have little history of a [[prodrome]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Low blood pressure and a fast heart rate after the event may indicate blood loss or dehydration, while [[Hypoxia (medical)|low blood oxygen levels]] may be seen following the event in those with pulmonary embolism.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; More specific tests such as [[implantable loop recorder]]s, [[tilt table testing]] or [[carotid sinus massage]] may be useful in uncertain cases.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; [[Computer tomography|Computed tomography]] (CT) is generally not required unless specific concerns are present.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Other causes of similar symptoms that should be considered include [[seizure]], [[stroke]], [[concussion]], [[Hypoxia (medical)|low blood oxygen]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[drug intoxication]] and some psychiatric disorders among others.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Treatment depends on the underlying cause.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Those who are considered at high risk following investigation may be admitted to hospital for further [[telemetry|monitoring of the heart]].&lt;ref name=EB2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peeters|first1=SY|last2=Hoek|first2=AE|last3=Mollink|first3=SM|last4=Huff|first4=JS|title=Syncope: risk stratification and clinical decision making.|journal=Emergency medicine practice|date=April 2014|volume=16|issue=4|pages=1-22; quiz 22-3|pmid=25105200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and prognosis--&gt;
Syncope affects about three to six out of every thousand people each year.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; It is more common in older people and females.&lt;ref name=Kenny2013/&gt; It is the reason for one to three percent of visits to emergency departments and admissions to hospital.&lt;ref name=Kenny2013/&gt; Up to half of women over the age of 80 and a third of medical students describe at least one event at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Kenny2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenny|first1=RA|last2=Bhangu|first2=J|last3=King-Kallimanis|first3=BL|title=Epidemiology of syncope/collapse in younger and older Western patient populations.|journal=Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases|date=2013|volume=55|issue=4|pages=357–63|pmid=23472771|doi=10.1016/j.pcad.2012.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those presenting with syncope to an emergency department, about 4% died in the next 30 days.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; The risk of a poor outcome, however, depends very much on the underlying cause.&lt;ref name=Ru2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruwald|first1=MH|title=Epidemiological studies on syncope--a register based approach.|journal=Danish Medical Journal|date=August 2013|volume=60|issue=8|pages=B4702|pmid=24063058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential diagnosis==

===Central nervous system ischemia===
The central ischemic response is triggered by an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood in the brain.

The respiratory system may contribute to oxygen levels through [[hyperventilation]], though a sudden ischaemic episode may also proceed faster than the respiratory system can respond.  These processes cause the typical symptoms of fainting: pale skin,  rapid breathing, nausea and weakness of the limbs, particularly of the legs. If the ischaemia is intense or prolonged, limb weakness progresses to collapse.  An individual with very little skin pigmentation may appear to have all color drained from his or her face at the onset of an episode. This effect combined with the following collapse can make a strong and dramatic impression on bystanders.

The weakness of the legs causes most sufferers to sit or lie down if there is time to do so. This may avert a complete collapse, but whether the sufferer sits down or falls down, the result of an ischaemic episode is a posture in which less blood pressure is required to achieve adequate blood flow.  It is unclear whether this is a mechanism evolved in response to the circulatory difficulties of human bipedalism or merely a serendipitous result of a pre-existing circulatory response.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

====Vertebro-basilar arterial disease====
Arterial disease in the upper spinal cord, or lower brain, causes syncope if there is a reduction in blood supply, which may occur with extending the neck or after drugs to lower blood pressure.

===Vasovagal===
{{main|Vasovagal syncope}}
Vasovagal (situational) syncope is one of the most common types which may occur in response to any of a variety of triggers, such as scary, embarrassing or uneasy situations, during blood drawing, or moments of sudden unusually high stress. There are many different syncope syndromes which all fall under the umbrella of vasovagal syncope related by the same central mechanism, such as urination ("[[micturition syncope]]"), defecation ("defecation syncope"), and others related to trauma and stress.

Vasovagal syncope can be considered in two forms:
*Isolated episodes of loss of consciousness, unheralded by any warning symptoms for more than a few moments. These tend to occur in the adolescent age group, and may be associated with fasting, exercise, abdominal straining, or circumstances promoting vaso-dilation (e.g., heat, alcohol). The subject is invariably upright. The [[tilt-table test]], if performed, is generally negative.
*Recurrent syncope with complex associated symptoms. This is neurally mediated syncope (NMS). It is associated with any of the following: preceding or succeeding sleepiness, preceding visual disturbance ("spots before the eyes"), sweating, lightheadedness. The subject is usually but not always upright. The tilt-table test, if performed, is generally positive. It is relatively uncommon.

A pattern of background factors contributes to the attacks. There is typically an unsuspected relatively low blood volume, for instance, from taking a low-salt diet in the absence of any salt-retaining tendency. Heat causes vaso-dilation and worsens the effect of the relatively insufficient blood volume. The next stage is the adrenergic response. If there is underlying fear or anxiety (e.g., social circumstances), or acute fear (e.g., acute threat, [[Trypanophobia|needle phobia]]), the vaso-motor centre demands an increased pumping action by the heart (flight or fight response). This is set in motion via the adrenergic (sympathetic) outflow from the brain, but the heart is unable to meet requirement because of the low blood volume, or decreased return. The high (ineffective) sympathetic activity is always modulated by vagal outflow, in these cases leading to excessive slowing of heart rate. The abnormality lies in this excessive vagal response. The tilt-table test typically evokes the attack.

Much of this pathway was discovered in animal experiments by Bezold (Vienna) in the 1860s. In animals, it may represent a defence mechanism when confronted by danger ("playing possum").

Avoiding what brings on the syncope and possibly greater salt intake is often all that is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaufmann|first1=H|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=K|title=Diagnosis and treatment of neurally mediated syncope.|journal=The Neurologist|date=May 2002|volume=8|issue=3|pages=175–85|pmid=12803689|doi=10.1097/00127893-200205000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological factors also have been found to mediate syncope.  It is important for general practitioners and the psychologist in their primary care team to work closely together, and to help patients identify how they might be avoiding activities of daily living due to anticipatory anxiety in relation to a possible faint and the feared physical damage it may cause.  Fainting in response to a blood stimulus, needle or a dead body are common and patients can quickly develop safety behaviours to avoid any recurrences of a fainting response.  See link for a good description of psychological interventions and theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |hdl=10147/135366 |title=Vasovagal syncope (the common faint): what clinicians need to know |vauthors=Gaynor D, Egan J |year=2011 |journal=The Irish Psychologist |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=176–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[evolutionary psychology]] view is that some forms of fainting are non-verbal signals that developed in response to increased inter-group aggression during the [[paleolithic]]. A non-combatant who has fainted signals that she or he is not a threat. This would explain the  association between fainting and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries seen in [[blood-injection-injury type phobia]]s such as [[needle phobia]] as well as the gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bracha HS |title=Human brain evolution and the 'Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:' Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Prog.

====Deglutition (Swallowing) syncope====
Syncope may occur during [[deglutition]].  Manisty et al. note: "Deglutition syncope is characterised by loss of consciousness on swallowing; it has been associated not only with ingestion of solid food, but also with carbonated and ice-cold beverages, and even belching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manisty C, Hughes-Roberts Y, Kaddoura S |date=July 2009 |title=Cardiac manifestations and sequelae of gastrointestinal disorders |journal=Br J Cardiol |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=175–80 |url=http://bjcardio.co.uk/2009/07/cardiac-manifestations-and-sequelae-of-gastrointestinal-disorders/ |accessdate=11 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611075350/http://bjcardio.co.uk/2009/07/cardiac-manifestations-and-sequelae-of-gastrointestinal-disorders/ |archivedate=11 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardiac ===
[[File:Blausen 0100 Bradycardia Fainting.png|thumb|Syncope from bradycardia]]

====Cardiac arrhythmias====
The most common cause of cardiac syncope is cardiac [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] (abnormal [[heart]] rhythm) wherein the heart beats too slowly, too rapidly, or too irregularly to pump enough blood to the brain. Some arrhythmias can be life-threatening.

Two major groups of arrhythmias are [[bradycardia]] and [[tachycardia]]. Bradycardia can be caused by [[heart block]]s.  Tachycardias include SVT ([[supraventricular tachycardia]]) and VT ([[ventricular tachycardia]]). SVT does not cause syncope except in [[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome]]. [[Ventricular tachycardia]] originate in the ventricles. VT causes syncope and can result in sudden death. Ventricular tachycardia, which describes a heart rate of over 100 beats per minute with at least three irregular heartbeats as a sequence of consecutive premature beats, can degenerate into [[ventricular fibrillation]], which is rapidly fatal without [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) and [[defibrillation]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Typically, tachycardic-generated syncope is caused by a cessation of beats following a tachycardic episode.  This condition, called tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, is usually caused by sinoatrial node dysfunction or block or [[atrioventricular block]].&lt;ref name=Harrisons18&gt;{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Roy |editor1-first=Dan L. |editor1-last=Longo |editor2-first=Dennis L. |editor2-last=Kasper |editor3-first=J.

====Obstructive cardiac lesion====
[[Aortic stenosis]] and [[mitral stenosis]] are the most common examples.  Aortic stenosis presents with repeated episodes of syncope.  A [[pulmonary embolism]] can cause obstructed blood vessels and is the cause of syncope in less than 1% of people who present to the emergency department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oqab|first1=Zardasht|last2=Ganshorn|first2=Heather|last3=Sheldon|first3=Robert|title=Prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with syncope.

====Structural cardiopulmonary disease====
These are relatively infrequent causes of fainting. The most common cause in this category is fainting associated with an acute myocardial infarction or ischemic event. The faint in this case is primarily caused by an abnormal nervous system reaction similar to the reflex faints. In general, faints caused by structural disease of the heart or blood vessels are particularly important to recognize, as they are warning of potentially life-threatening conditions. Among other conditions prone to trigger syncope (by either hemodynamic compromise or by a neural reflex mechanism, or both), some of the most important are [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]], acute aortic dissection, pericardial tamponade, pulmonary embolism, aortic stenosis, and [[pulmonary hypertension]].

====Other cardiac causes====
[[Sick sinus syndrome]], a sinus node dysfunction, causing alternating bradycardia and tachycardia.  Often there is a long pause asystole between heartbeat.

[[Adams-Stokes syndrome]] is a cardiac syncope that occurs with seizures caused by complete or incomplete heart block. Symptoms include deep and fast respiration, weak and slow pulse and respiratory pauses that may last for 60 seconds.

[[Subclavian steal syndrome]] arises from retrograde (reversed) flow of blood in the vertebral artery or the internal thoracic artery, due to a proximal stenosis (narrowing) and/or occlusion of the subclavian artery.

[[Aortic dissection]] (a tear in the aorta) and [[cardiomyopathy]] can also result in syncope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Nallamothu BK, Mehta RH, Saint S, etal |title=Syncope in acute aortic dissection: diagnostic, prognostic, and clinical implications |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=113 |issue=6 |pages=468–71 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12427495 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(02)01254-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various medications, such as [[beta blocker]]s, may cause bradycardia induced syncope.&lt;ref name=Harrisons18/&gt;

===Blood pressure===
[[Orthostatic hypotension|''Orthostatic (postural) hypotensive faint''s]] are as common or perhaps even more common than vasovagal syncope. Orthostatic faints are most often associated with movement from lying or sitting to a standing position, standing up too quickly, or being in a very hot room. The classic example of a combination of these is seen in the frequent fainting by medical students in the operating theatre during observation of surgery.&lt;ref name=Jamjoom2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jamjoom AA, Nikkar-Esfahani A, Fitzgerald JE |title=Operating theatre related syncope in medical students: a cross sectional study |journal=BMC Med Educ |volume=9|pages=14 |year=2009 |pmid=19284564 |pmc=2657145 |doi=10.1186/1472-6920-9-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently healthy individuals may experience minor symptoms ("lightheadedness", "greying-out") as they stand up if blood pressure is slow to respond to the stress of upright posture. If the blood pressure is not adequately maintained during standing, faints may develop. However, the resulting "transient orthostatic hypotension" does not necessarily signal any serious underlying disease.

The most susceptible individuals are elderly frail individuals, or persons who are dehydrated from hot environments or inadequate fluid intake. More serious orthostatic hypotension is often the result of certain commonly prescribed medications such as diuretics, β-adrenergic blockers, other anti-hypertensives (including vasodilators), and [[nitroglycerin]]. In a small percentage of cases, the cause of orthostatic hypotensive faints is structural damage to the [[autonomic nervous system]] due to systemic diseases (e.g., [[amyloidosis]] or diabetes) or in neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).

===Other causes===
Factors that influence fainting are fasting long hours, taking in too little food and fluids, low [[blood pressure]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[G-LOC|high g-force]], emotional distress, and lack of sleep.

One theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] is that fainting at the sight of blood might have evolved as a form of [[Apparent death|playing dead]] which increased survival from attackers and might have slowed blood loss in a primitive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-babble/201302/why-do-some-people-faint-the-sight-blood |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20160801224802/http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain%2Dbabble/201302/why%2Ddo%2Dsome%2Dpeople%2Dfaint%2Dthe%2Dsight%2Dblood |archivedate=2017-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Blood-injury phobia", as this is called, is experienced by about 15% of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/swoon-at-the-sight-of-blood|title=Swoon at the Sight of Blood?

Fainting can occur in "cough syncope" following severe fits of [[cough]]ing, such as that associated with [[pertussis]] or "whooping cough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dicpinigaitis PV, Lim L, Farmakidis C |title=Cough syncope.|journal=Respiratory Medicine |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=244–51|date=February 2014 |pmid=24238768 |pmc=|doi=10.1016/j.rmed.2013.10.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnostic approach==
A [[hemoglobin]] count may indicate anemia or blood loss. However, this has been useful in only about 5% of people evaluated for fainting.&lt;ref&gt;Grubb (2001) p.83&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart. It is estimated that from 20%-50% of people have an abnormal ECG. However, while an ECG may identify conditions such as [[atrial fibrillation]], heart block, or a new or old heart attack, it typically does not provide a definite diagnosis for the underlying cause for fainting.&lt;ref&gt;Grubb (2001) pp.83-84&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, a [[Holter monitor]] may be used. This is a portable ECG device that can record the wearer's heart rhythms during daily activities over an extended period of time. Since fainting usually does not occur upon command, a Holter monitor can provide a better understanding of the heart's activity during fainting episodes.

The [[tilt table test]] is performed to elicit orthostatic syncope secondary to autonomic dysfunction (neurogenic).

For people with more than two episodes of syncope and no diagnosis on “routine testing”, an insertable cardiac monitor might be used. It lasts 28–36 months. Smaller than a pack of gum, it is inserted just beneath the skin in the upper chest area. The procedure typically takes 15 to 20 minutes. Once inserted, the device continuously monitors the rate and rhythm of the heart. Upon waking from a “fainting” spell, the patient places a hand held pager-sized device called an Activator over the implanted device and simply presses a button. This information is stored and retrieved by their physician and some devices can be monitored remotely.

===Imaging===
For people with uncomplicated syncope (without seizures and a normal neurological exam) [[computed tomography]] or [[MRI]] is not generally indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Moya A, Sutton R, Ammirati F, etal |title=Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) |journal=Eur.

===San Francisco syncope rule===
The [[San Francisco Syncope Rule|San Francisco syncope rule]] was developed to isolate people who have higher risk for a serious cause of syncope. High risk is anyone who has: congestive heart failure, hematocrit &lt;30%, electrocardiograph abnormality, shortness of breath, or systolic blood pressure &lt;90&amp;nbsp;mmHg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Quinn J, McDermott D, Stiell I, Kohn M, Wells G |title=Prospective validation of the San Francisco Syncope Rule to predict patients with serious outcomes |journal=Ann Emerg Med |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=448–54 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16631985 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2005.11.019 |laysummary=http://emergency-medicine.jwatch.org/cgi/content/full/2006/721/2 |laysource=Journal Watch |laydate=July 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The San Francisco syncope rule however was not validated by subsequent studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Birnbaum A, Esses D, Bijur P, Wollowitz A, Gallagher EJ |title=Failure to validate the San Francisco Syncope Rule in an independent emergency department population |journal=Ann Emerg Med |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=151–9 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18282636 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2007.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Recommended acute treatment of vasovagal and orthostatic (hypotension) syncope involves returning blood to the brain by positioning the person on the ground, with legs slightly elevated or leaning forward and the head between the knees for at least 10–15 minutes, preferably in a cool and quiet place. For individuals who have problems with chronic fainting spells, therapy should focus on recognizing the triggers and learning techniques to keep from fainting. At the appearance of warning signs such as lightheadedness, nausea, or cold and clammy skin, counter-pressure maneuvers that involve gripping fingers into a fist, tensing the arms, and crossing the legs or squeezing the thighs together can be used to ward off a fainting spell.  After the symptoms have passed, [[sleep]] is recommended. If fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease. In case syncope is caused by cardiac disease, the treatment is much more sophisticated than that of [[vasovagal]] syncope and may involve [[artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemakers]] and [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillators]] depending on the precise cardiac cause.

==Society and culture==
Fainting in women was a commonplace trope or stereotype in [[Victorian England]] and in contemporary and modern depictions of the period.

[[Falling-out]] is a [[culture-bound syndrome]] primarily reported in the [[southern United States]] and the [[Caribbean]].

Some individuals occasionally or frequently play the "[[fainting game]]" (also referred to in the US as the "choking game"), which involves the deliberate induction of syncope via voluntary restriction of blood flow to the brain, an action that can result in acute or cumulative brain damage and even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://wjz.com/local/local_story_307223858.html | title = 'Choking Game' Becoming Deadly Fad For Adolescents | accessdate = 2008-02-13 | date = 2005-11-04 | publisher = WJZ-TV Baltimore |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071219064633/http://wjz.com/local/local_story_307223858.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
{{more citations needed|date=October 2011}}

The term is derived from the [[Latin language|Late Latin]] ''syncope'', from [[Ancient Greek]] συγκοπή (''sunkopē'') 'cutting up', 'sudden loss of strength', from σύν (''sun'', "together, thoroughly") and κόπτειν (''koptein'', "strike, cut off").

The '''Tenerife goldcrest''', ''Regulus regulus teneriffae'', (sometimes considered a separate species, ''R. teneriffae'') is a very small [[passerine]] bird in the [[kinglet]] family, closely resembling the [[goldcrest]] but with a broader black band across the forehead, slightly darker underparts and a longer bill. It breeds in the [[Canary Islands]] of [[Tenerife]] and [[La Gomera]], where it is a non-migratory resident. It prefers [[Canary Island Pine]] forests, but also occurs in [[laurisilva]] forests.

The populations on [[La Palma]] and [[El Hierro]], previously thought to belong to this taxon, are now recognized as, at least, a distinct subspecies, the [[Western Canary Islands goldcrest]] ''R. (r.) ellenthalerae'' (Päckert ''et al.'', 2006), which evolved from an independent colonisation of the islands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1769">In [[philosophy]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] '''transcendental apperception''' is that which [[Immanuel Kant]] thought makes experience possible.&lt;ref&gt;Glendinning (1999, 26, 40-41).&lt;/ref&gt; It is where the [[Self (philosophy)|self]] and the [[World (philosophy)|world]] come together.

Transcendental apperception is the uniting and building of coherent consciousness out of different elementary inner experiences (differing in both time and topic, but all belonging to self-consciousness). E.g. the experience of "passing of time" relies on this transcendental unity of apperception, according to Kant.

There are six steps to transcendental apperception:

#All experience is the succession of a variety of contents (an idea taken from [[David Hume]]).
#To be experienced at all, the successive data must be combined or held together in a unity for consciousness.
#Unity of experience therefore implies a unity of self.
#The unity of self is as much an object of experience as anything is.
#Therefore, experience both of the self and its objects rests on acts of synthesis that, because they are the conditions of any experience, are not themselves experienced.
#These prior syntheses are made possible by the [[Category (Kant)|categories]]. Categories allow us to synthesize the self and the objects.

The term was later adapted in psychology by [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], see [[Apperception]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5265">'''Trauma risk management''' (TRiM) is a method of secondary [[PTSD]] (and other traumatic stress related mental health disorders) prevention. The TRiM process enables non-healthcare staff to monitor and manage colleagues. TRiM training provides TRiM Practitioners with a background understanding of psychological trauma and its effects.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg N, Brooks S, Dunn R - "Latest developments in post-traumatic stress disorder: diagnosis and treatment" - British Medical Bulletin. April 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

TRiM is a trauma-focused peer support system&lt;ref&gt;Creamer MC, Varker T, Bisson J, Darte K, Greenberg N, Lau W, Moreton G, O’Donnell M, Richardson D, Ruzek J, Watson P, Forbes D - "Guidelines for peer support in high risk organizations: An international consensus study using the Delphi method" – Journal of Traumatic Stress, April 2012, 25, 134–141&lt;/ref&gt; and the way it works is wholly compliant with the PTSD management guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Care and Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Guidance for employers on promoting mental wellbeing through productive and healthy working conditions. NICE Public Health Guidance no.22. London: NICE, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma risk management Practitioners are trained to carry out an interview which identifies a number of risk factors which, when present, increase the likelihood that an individual may suffer poor longer term mental health as a result of a traumatic event. The initial TRiM interview takes place with an individual, 72 hours after a traumatic incident. People who score highly on this initial interview are provided with extra support by colleagues, and where appropriate, line managers. A follow up TRiM interview is then carried out approximately one month later to assess how well people have come to terms with the traumatic event at that point. Individuals who are found to have persistent difficulties at this point are encouraged and assisted to seek a professional assessment in order to access any specific treatment they require.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg N, Brooks S, Dunn R - "Latest developments in post-traumatic stress disorder: diagnosis and treatment" - British Medical Bulletin. April 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

TRiM originated within the [[UK military]] after previously-used reactive single session models of post incident intervention, such as [[Critical Incident Stress Debriefing]], were subject to scientific scrutiny and shown to not just lack effectiveness but also have the potential to do harm.&lt;ref&gt;Rose SC, Bisson J, Wessely S. "Psychological debriefing for preventing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)". Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2002, Issue 2. Article Number CD000560, DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000560&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Neil Greenberg]] was one of the team at the forefront of developing peer-led traumatic stress support packages, now known as TRiM. He is an academic psychiatrist based at [[King's College London]] UK and is a consultant occupational and forensic psychiatrist.

Although it was first developed in the UK military, trauma risk management is now used by a range of public and commercial organisations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marchonstress.com/page/p/clients&lt;/ref&gt; This includes charities, emergency services, security firms, risk management organisations, UK Government departments including the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/35492/0392-12attachment2of2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the oil and gas industry, transport organisations and media companies including the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/safety/health/trauma-support&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence and research==
A large number of research papers have been published about the use of TRiM and its effectiveness and acceptance. This includes research about the use of TRiM by Cumbria Constabulary, following the Cumbria shootings in 2010. This research&lt;ref&gt;Hunt E, Jones N, Hastings V, Greenberg N. – "TRiM: an organizational response to traumatic events in Cumbria Constabulary"- Occup Med (Lond) 2013 Dec;63(8):549-55&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the officers and staff who received a TRiM response fared better than their colleagues who did not and were less likely to be absent from work than colleagues who did not receive a TRiM intervention.

Research has shown that the use of TRiM may assist in increasing the psychological resilience of military personnel through the facilitation of social support.&lt;ref&gt;Frappell-Cooke W, Gulina M, Green K, Hacker Hughes J, Greenberg N, "Does trauma risk management reduce psychological distress in deployed troops?" - Occupational Medicine Journal, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent research into TRiM came in a review paper, published in the Journal of Occupational Medicine in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Whybrow, D, Jones, N, Greenberg, N. "Promoting organizational well-being: a comprehensive review of Trauma Risk Management" – Journal of Occupational Medicine, 16 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[jurisprudence]], '''undue influence''' is an [[Equity (law)|equitable doctrine]] that involves one person taking advantage of a position of [[Power (social and political)|power]] over another person. This inequity in power between the parties can vitiate one party's consent as they are unable to freely exercise their independent will.&lt;ref name="56 CLR 113"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|41|1936|litigants=[[Johnson v Buttress]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/41.pdf (1936) 56 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 113] |courtname=auto |date=17 August 1936}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where it is established that a plaintiff was induced to enter into a contract or transaction by the undue influence of the defendant, the contract may be rendered voidable. If undue influence is proved in a contract, the innocent party is entitled to set aside the contract against the defendant, and the remedy is rescission.{{sfn|Paterson Robertson &amp; Duke 2016|page=729}}

As the law of undue influence was applied and developed by the Court of Chancery, it developed into two distinct classes: ‘actual’ undue influence and ‘presumed’ undue influence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R |last=Bigwood |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2230.00388/abstract |title=Undue Influence in the House of Lords: Principles and Proof}} (2002) 65 Modern Law Journal 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Australia===

In Australia, the leading case on undue influence is ''[[Johnson v Buttress]]'' (1936),&lt;ref name="56 CLR 113"/&gt; in which the approach to 'actual' and 'presumed' undue influence was at issue. 
* Actual undue influence,&lt;ref name="Farmers Co-op"&gt;{{cite AustLII|SASC|1932|1989|litigants=Farmers Co-operative Executors &amp; Trustees Ltd v Perks |parallelcite=(1989) 52 [[South Australian State Reports|SASR]] 399}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where it is proven that the defendant exerted influence over the complainant to have them enter into a contract.{{sfn|Paterson Robertson &amp; Duke 2016|page=701}}
* Presumed undue influence, made up of:
# ''deemed relationship of influence'', relationships that raise the premise, as a matter of law, that influence has been utilised;{{sfn|Paterson Robertson &amp; Duke 2016|page=701}}
# ''relationship of influence in fact'', where the complainant ensconces that trust and confidence was bestowed in the wrongdoer and therefore a presumption of influence should be recognised{{sfn|Paterson Robertson &amp; Duke 2016|page=702}}

====Presumed undue influence====

=====First subgroup=====
In the first subgroup, the relationship falls in a class of relationships that as a matter of law will raise a presumption of undue influence. Such classes include:

* Government/citizen (note this is not confirmed);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants="R" v Attorney General for England and Wales |link=R v Attorney General for England and Wales |year=2003 |court=UKPC |num=22 |parallelcite=[2004] 2 [[New Zealand Law Reports|NZLR]] 577 |courtname=auto |juris=NZ}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parent/child;&lt;ref&gt;''Bainbrigge v Bowne'' (1881) 18 Ch D 188 at 196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''London and Westminster Loan and Discount Co Ltd v Bilton'' (1911) 27 TLR 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|SAStRp|34|1942|litigants=West v Public Trustee |parallelcite=[1942] [[South Australian State Reports|SASR]] 109 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Guardian/ward;&lt;ref name="56 CLR 113"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powell v Powell [1900] 1 Ch 243&lt;/ref&gt;
* Religious adviser/member of the flock;&lt;ref&gt;''Allcard v Skinner'' (1887) 36 Ch D 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|406|2001|litigants=McCulloch v Fern |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|810|2002|litigants=Hartigan v International Society for Krishna Consciousness Incorporated |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Solicitor (attorney)/client;&lt;ref&gt;''Re P's Bill of Costs'' (1982) 45 ALR 513 at 521-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Westmelton"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|29|1983|litigants=Westmelton (Vic) Pty Ltd v Archer and Shulman |parallelcite=[1983] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 305 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicLawRp|74|1927|litigants=Haywood v Roadknight |parallelcite=[1927] [[Victorian Law Reports|VLR]] 512 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Doctor-patient relationship|Doctor/patient]];&lt;ref&gt;''Dent v Bennett'' (1839) 4 My &amp; Cr 269; 41 [[English Reports|ER]] 105; ''Williams v Johnson'' [1937] 4 All ER 34.&lt;/ref&gt; (note this excludes dentist and patient.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooks v Alca'' (1976) 60 DLR (3d) 577&lt;/ref&gt;)

In such cases, the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] lies on the first of said parties (e.g. the government, parent, or doctor) to disprove undue influence on the second party. This requires the dominant party to establish that the second party "knew and understood what he or she was doing, and that he or she was acting independently of the influence of the dominant party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|650|2010|litigants=Tulloch (deceased ) v  Braybon (No 2) |pinpoint=[40] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|3|1922|litigants=Watkins v Combes |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1922/3.pdf (1922) 30 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 180] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One influential factor in deciding whether the second party was acting independently is whether he or she was given an independent advice, while such an advice is not indispensable for rebutting the presumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Inche Noriah v Shaik Allie Bin Omar |court=UKPC |year=1928 |num=76 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1929] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 127 |courtname=auto |juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Second subgroup=====
The second subgroup covers relationships that do not fall into the first subgroup, but on the facts of case, there was an antecedent relationship between the parties that led to undue influence.  The test is one of whether "one party occupies or assumes towards another a position naturally involving an ascendancy or influence over that other, or a dependence or trust on his part".&lt;ref name="56 CLR 113"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|1159|2014|litigants=Thorn v Boyd |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|QCA|85|2011|litigants=Agripay Pty Limited v Byrne |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the plaintiff satisfies this a presumption of undue influence will arise, to which the onus of proof transfers to the defendant, who thereon, must rebut that "in all the circumstances", the relationship between the parties involved "dealings were at arm's length and that the other’s will was in no way overborne by the relationship of confidence" that existed.&lt;ref name="Westmelton"/&gt;

====Actual undue influence====
An innocent party may also seek to have a contract set aside for actual undue influence, where there is no presumption of undue influence, but there is evidence that the power was unbalanced at the time of the signing of the contract.&lt;ref name="151 CLR 447"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1983|litigants=[[Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio]] |parallelcite=(1983) 151 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 447 |date=12 May 1983 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Westmelton"/&gt; Factors such as age, mental capacity and literacy of the donee, among other considerations such as the nature of the transaction (fair or unfair) will help determine actual undue influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|41|1936|litigants=[[Johnson v Buttress]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/41.pdf (1936) 56 CLR 113] |courtname=auto}} at [3] per Starke J.&lt;/ref&gt;
There is no requirement of manifest disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|81|1956|litigants=Blomley v Ryan |parallelcite=(1956) 99 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 362 |date=28 March 1956 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Farmers' Co-Op Executors &amp; Trustees v Perks'',&lt;ref name="Farmers Co-op"/&gt; a wife transferred her interest as tenant in common on a farming property to her husband; the property was owned jointly by the husband and herself. There was evidential proof that there was a long history of brutal domestic violence inflicted by the husband on the wife, whereby he ended up murdering her. There was a presumption that the wife only transferred her interest to the husband because of undue influence and evidence proved that the transfer resulted from actual undue influence. It was because of the history of violence that resulted in the judge setting aside the transfer.{{sfn|Paterson Robertson &amp; Duke 2016|page=703}}

A contrasting case is ''Lee v Chai'', in which Mr Lee purchased an apartment and a Porsche for Ms Chai, with whom he was having an affair.{{sfn|Paterson Robertson &amp; Duke 2016|page=729}} Mr Lee argued that the gifts were given as a result of undue influence, and as such should be set aside. It was held that Mr Lee and Ms Chai were not in a relationship of influence that would attract the operation of the equitable doctrine. Mr Lee was a well-educated man with substantial experience in business affairs, while Ms Chai had a 'less forceful personality' and less business experience. This case highlights an approach taken in Australia, which is to focus on the impaired consent of the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|QSC|136|2013|litigants=Lee v Chai |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Deane J in ''[[Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio]]'' said 'Undue influence, like common law duress, looks to the quality of the consent or assent of the weaker party'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1983|litigants=[[Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio]] |parallelcite=(1983) 151 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 447 at p. 474 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|WASC|19|2012|litigants=Anderson v McPherson (No 2) |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====A special principle====

In ''[[Garcia v National Australia Bank]]'' (1998),&lt;ref name="194 CLR 395"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|48|1998|litigants=[[Garcia v National Australia Bank]] |parallelcite=(1998) 194 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 395 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the High Court of Australia approved the principle in ''Yerkey v Jones'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|3|1939|litigants=Yerkey v Jones |parallelcite=(1939) 63 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 649 |date=6 March 1939 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by distinguishing between cases of actual undue influence and situations where the transaction is set aside because the guarantor does not understand the nature of the transaction.&lt;ref name="194 CLR 395"/&gt; Although there is no presumption of undue influence, a "lender is to be taken to have understood that, as a wife, the surety may repose trust and confidence in her husband in matters of business and therefore to have understood that the husband may not fully and accurately explain the purport and effect of the transaction to his wife; and yet ... did not itself take steps to explain the transaction to the wife or find out that a stranger had explained it to her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|48|1998|litigants=[[Garcia v National Australia Bank]] |parallelcite=(1998) 194 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 395 |pinpoint=[32] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In probate law==
"Undue influence" is the most common ground for [[will contest]]s and are often accompanied by a capacity challenge. That is, someone in possession of full mental capacity is not likely to be swayed by undue influence, manipulation, or coercion. In litigation most jurisdictions place the burden of proving undue influence on the party challenging the will. Undue influence can be very difficult to prove, and the mere appearance of undue influence is inadequate to challenge the validity of a will.&lt;ref&gt;''Core v. Core's Administrators'', 124 S.E. 453 (Va. 1924).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[probate law]], undue influence is generally defined as a [[testator]]'s loss of free agency regarding property disposition through contemporaneous psychological domination by an advisor, resulting in an excessive benefit to the advisor. It is important to note that "undue influence" is an issue only when the advisor is benefiting, not when advisor is getting a benefit for someone else;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| |url=http://www.grossmanlaw.net/library/will-contest-based-on-undue-influence.cfm |title=California will contest or trust contest based on undue influence |publisher=Grossman Law Firm}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2017}} in that case it would be considered [[fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;Time Limit and  Grounds for [https://www.goinglegal.co.uk/contesting-a-will/ "Contesting a Will"]. Going Legal Limited. Accessed May 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2017}}

In Germany, to avoid undue influence it is illegal for a testator who is or has been a resident of a [[nursing home]] to bequeath any property to any employee of the nursing home.&lt;ref name="Scalise2008"&gt;Ronald J. Scalise Jr., [http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1061&amp;context=djcil "Undue Influence and the Law of Wills: A Comparative Analysis"], 19 Duke J. Comp. &amp; Int'l L. 41, 99 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
