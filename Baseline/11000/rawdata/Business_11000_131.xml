'''The Adelphi Charter on Creativity, Innovation and Intellectual Property''' is the result of a project commissioned by the [[Royal Society of Arts|Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce]], London, UK, and is intended as a positive statement of what good [[intellectual property]] [[policy]] is. The Charter was issued in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quinn|first1=Michael J.|title=Ethics for the Information Age|date=2011|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-13-213387-6|page=171|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter has subsequently influenced thinking on Intellectual Property Law, and in particular, heavily influenced a subsequent copyright manifesto [[Copyright for Creativity]] - A Declaration for Europe.

==Adelphi Charter on Creativity, Innovation and Intellectual Property==
The Adelphi Charter reads:

Humanity’s capacity to generate new ideas and knowledge is its greatest asset. It is the source of art, science, innovation and economic development. Without it, individuals and societies stagnate.

This creative imagination requires access to the ideas, learning and culture of others, past and present. And, in the future, others will use what we have done.
Human rights call on us to ensure that everyone can create, access, use and share information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and societies to achieve their full potential.

Creativity and investment should be recognised and rewarded. The purpose of intellectual property law (such as copyright and patents) should be, now as it was in the past, to ensure both the sharing of knowledge and the rewarding of innovation.

The expansion in the law’s breadth, scope and term over the last 30 years has resulted in an intellectual property regime which is radically out of line with modern technological, economic and social trends. This disconnect threatens the chain of creativity and innovation on which we and future generations depend.

We therefore call upon governments and the international community to adopt these principles:

:1. Laws regulating intellectual property must serve as means of achieving creative, social and economic ends and must not be seen as ends in themselves.

:2. These laws and regulations must serve, and never overturn, the basic human rights to health, education, employment and cultural life.

:3. The public interest requires a balance between the public domain and private rights. It also requires a balance between the free competition which is essential for economic vitality and the monopoly rights granted by intellectual property laws.

:4. Intellectual property protection must not be extended to abstract ideas, facts or data.

:5. Patents must not be extended over mathematical models, scientific theories, computer code, methods for teaching, business processes, methods of medical diagnosis, therapy or surgery.

:6. Copyright and patents must be limited in time and their terms must not extend beyond what is proportionate and necessary.

:7. Government must facilitate a wide range of policies to stimulate access and innovation, including non-proprietary models such as open source software licensing and open access to scientific literature.

:8. Intellectual property laws must take account of developing countries’ social and economic circumstances.

:9. In making decisions about intellectual property law, governments should adhere to these rules:

::• There must be an automatic presumption against creating new areas of intellectual property protection, extending existing privileges or extending the duration of rights.

::• The burden of proof in such cases must lie on the advocates of change.

::• Change must be allowed only if a rigorous analysis clearly demonstrates that it will promote people’s basic rights and economic well-being.

::• Throughout, there should be wide public consultation and a comprehensive, objective and transparent assessment of public detriments and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In 1757, van Braam joined the [[Dutch Navy]] as a midshipman, but soon left the navy for China in order to work for the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC). In 1758, van Braam arrived in China, and for the remaining eight years he was engage in trade in [[Guangzhou]] and [[Macau]]. During his sojourn in China, he left for Europe twice and married Catharina Cornelia Geertruida van Reede van Oudthoorn on his last visit.

In 1773, van Braam left China and the following year, he settled in a county-seat near [[Zutphen]] in the province of [[Gelderland]]. Inspired by the [[American Revolution]], he decided to immigrate to the [[United States]] and settled in [[Charleston, SC|Charleston]] to work as a merchant and rice planter in 1783. He became a US citizen the following year. As a consequence of a family tragedy, van Braam decided to leave the US and take up a position as chief of the Dutch factory in Guangzhou. After a long journey, with stops in the Netherlands, [[Malacca]] and [[Jakarta|Batavia]], he arrived in Guangzhou in 1790.

== Embassy to China ==
Having learned about the British [[Macartney Embassy]] to the [[Qing]] court in 1793, he requested that the commissioners-general in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] send a VOC embassy to the court of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] for the celebration of his sixtieth year on the throne. Batavia accepted the suggestion, but appointed the chief of the Dutch trading mission in [[Dejima]], [[Isaac Titsingh]] (1745–1812) as head of the Dutch embassy instead of van Braam.&lt;ref&gt;van Braam Houckgeest, Andreas Everardus. (1797). ''Voyage de l'ambassade de la Compagnie des Indes Orientales hollandaises vers l'empereur de la Chine, dans les années 1794 et 1795;'' see also 1798 English translation: [http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CTWE/B2962471X/ ''An authentic account of the embassy of the Dutch East-India company, to the court of the emperor of China, in the years 1974 and 1795,'' Vol. I.] also: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KGxCAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AfngXN9lqXcEC&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books version]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Titsingh route 1794-1795.jpg|left|thumb|Map showing route of Titsingh diplomatic mission to the Imperial Court in Peking (Beijing), traveling from Canton and returning, 1794-1795.]]
In  November 1794, the embassy, which included van Braam and [[Chrétien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes]] (son of [[Joseph de Guignes]]) left Guangzhou and it arrived in [[Beijing]] in January 1795, just in time for Chinese new year.

[[File:VanBraam 1798.jpg|right|thumb|Van Braam's account of the Titsingh mission was initially written in French and published in Philadelphia. This is the title page from the second printing in 1798.]] 
In Beijing, the embassy was received together with representatives of other tributary countries and the members of the embassy performed the [[kowtow]] in front of the emperor according to Chinese custom. Unlike British diplomats, the members of the Dutch embassy did not refuse to perform the kowtow. Van Braam distinguished himself when his hat fell off while bowing, causing the emperor to laugh.&lt;ref&gt;van Braam, ''An authentic account...,'' Vol. I (1798 English edition) pp. 238-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Braam had retained his US citizenship and thus became the first American to meet a Chinese emperor.
 
The embassy was lavishly entertained for the remainder of their stay and they were allowed to have additional audiences with the Qianlong emperor at his palace outside Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;van Braam, ''An authentic account...,'' Vol. I (1798 English edition) pp. 283-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the Titsingh mission, including van Braam, were the last European diplomats to savour the mid-winter splendor of the vast Summer Palace (the [[Old Summer Palace|''Yuangmingyuan'']], now known as the Old Summer Palace) before its destruction by the Lord Elgin's troops during the punitive Second Opium War in 1860.

== Later life ==
Upon the embassy's return to Guangzhou in March 1795, van Braam was unable to find a ship bound for the Netherlands and chose to board a ship to [[Philadelphia]], where he arrived in 1796. Van Braam's arrival in the city attracted a lot of attention and he published an account of his journey, which he dedicated to [[George Washington]]. Van Braam decided to stay in the area and settled in [[Bristol, Pennsylvania|Bristol]] outside the city. In 1798, he decided to leave the United States for unknown reasons, and after short stays in [[Germany]] and [[England]], he bought a small property in Amsterdam, where he died in July 1801.

Founded in 1877 at [[San Giuseppe Vesuviano]] in the province of [[Naples]], [[Gennaro Auricchio]] was the creator of a special [[rennet]] to produce [[provolone]].

By the 1880s it was exporting cheese to the [[United States]], for stocking in [[Little Italy]]'s shops. This growth created need for new facilities, with a dairy added in [[Cremona]] before 1900.

*[[Macomer]] (Nuoro) for [[Pecorino Romano]] D.O.P. and other fresh and mature sheep cheeses
*[[Scandiano]] (Reggio Emilia) for production of “[[caciotta]]” (roundish small soft cheese) and “[[ricotta]]”
*[[Solignano]] (Parma) specialized in the production of “[[Parmigiano Reggiano]]”
 
==Products==
The company is the largest producer of provolone cheese in Italy, and offers a significant range of dairy products:
* [[Provolone]] (sharp, mild and [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]])
* [[Parmigiano Reggiano]]
* [[Grana Padano]]
* [[Pecorino Romano]] ([[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected designation of origin]])
* A large assortment of fresh and seasoned [[Pecorino]] cheeses

'''Brand Elections''' is a periodic  [[marketing research]] conceived by Shoaib Quereshy, CEO Bullseye Group. The research has been conducted in 2010, 2013 and 2017. The latest research has been conducted by Bullseye Group in association with IPSOS Pakistan. Bullseye Group is a leading Pakistan and Middle East Marketing Solutions Provider which includes advertising agency DDB Pakistan, regional Activation network: Bullseye Communications, regional branding agency: Believe in Branding, content developer Kontent Head and brand consultancy SQ Consulting.

'''Brand Elections 2010'''

The first study was conducted by Bullseye Communications (A Bullseye Group Company) and MEMRB Pakistan.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://pakmediablog.net/2102/brand-elections-2010/ Brand Elections 2010 on PakMediaBlog], A review of the marketing research on a local marketing forum.&lt;/ref&gt; The research aims to identify the top [[brand]]s operating in numerous [[Pakistan]]i industries by polling a section of the society as a sample on different measures of brand impact.

'''Research'''

It is a [[representative sample]] based survey which aims to ascertain the power of brands for the urban population of Pakistan. From the [[consumer]]’s standpoint, it is an attempt to create a genuine [[marketing]] industry barometer for brands which is powered by the Consumer Multimedia Index initiative, a [[research project]] being carried out by the Pakistani Advertisers Society.

The Brand Elections research covers 10,000 [[respondent]]s across all [[socioeconomic class]]es through 50 urban cities of Pakistan. Over 3500 brands are featured in the study, belonging to 50+ industry product and service categories. The study identifies Overall 100 Top Brands, Top 10 Brands by 50+ Categories, Top 20 Brands by Target Audience, and Top 10 Brands by Region.

'''Methodology'''

The Brand Elections Project is built on Consumer Multimedia Index (CMi) which aims to become the Pakistani marketing industry’s ‘[[common currency]]’ with regards to statistical research. The imperatives of this study include universe representation, reliability of results, [[quality assurance]] mechanisms and wide information coverage.

'''Elections Geographical Coverage'''
The research is limited to Urban Pakistan where a population proportionate sample of 10,000 respondents has been ascertained from 50 Cities (15 Key and 35 Rest of Urban).

'''Voters Profile'''

Both Males &amp; Females aged 12+ belonging to all Socio-Economic Classes are covered in the survey to vote for their favorite brands. The sample is designed to match the universe characteristics by [[gender]], age, SEC and geographical proportions in order to make the results nationally representative in all aspects.

'''About Candidates'''

Approximately 3,500 brands of 50+ [[Product (business)|product]] categories took part in the process. The researchers behind the project claim that the selection of categories was aimed to ensure that it represents all walks of life. These 50+ categories represent the following broad areas in order to cover the entire spectrum of consumer interaction with various brands

•	Communication
•	Durables
•	Financial  
•	Food-Drinks
•	Food-Household 
•	Food-Impulsive
•	Household Care 
•	Personal Care
•	Transportation

'''Voting &amp; Scoring Process'''

A [[ranking]] mechanism is developed to ascertain winners within each category and across the entire industry which were [[benchmarking|benchmarked]] on international best practices for consumer [[Opinion poll|poll]]s on brands. This ranking mechanism was based on four key measures: Share of Heart, Share of Mind, Share of Repertoire, and Category Penetration.{{citation needed|date=December 2014|reason=this sentence, and perhaps much more in the article, receives no support from the only ref provided.}}

The '''Cabot family''' was part of the [[Boston Brahmin]], also known as the "first families of [[Boston]]."

==History==

===Family origin===
The Boston Brahmin Cabot family descended from John Cabot (b. 1680 in [[Jersey]], one of the [[Channel Islands]]), who emigrated from his birthplace to [[Salem, Massachusetts]] in 1700.&lt;ref name=Genealogy1927&gt;{{cite web|first=L. Vernon|last=Briggs|url=http://www.digital-editions.com/CABOT.htm|title=History and Genealogy of the Cabot Family, 1475–1927|publisher=C.E. Goodspeed &amp; Company|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cabot family emigrated from Jersey, where the family name can be traced back to at least 1274. In Jersey Historian the Rev George Balleine records that the Cabot is a small fish that seems all head (It gets its name from the Latin word, caput, a head).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabot - Origin|url=http://www.theislandwiki.org/index.php/Cabot|website=theislandwiki.org|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims that the Cabot family of Massachusetts descend from the Italian explorers [[John Cabot]] (c.1450 – c.1500) and his son Sebastian Cabot (c.1474 – 1557) are mistaken. John and Sebastian were both born in Italy, where their surname 'Caboto' meant 'Coastal Sailor'. They joined a community of Italian sailors based in the important English port of Bristol. John was the first explorer sent by the English to explore the North American coast, and Sebastian captained later voyages of exploration, but neither of them immigrated to America.

'''Casema''' (Centrale Antenne Systemen Exploitatie Maatschappij) was a major [[Netherlands|Dutch]] provider of cable television, internet and telephone services until the [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] with [[Multikabel]] and [[@Home Network|@Home]] to [[Ziggo]] on 16 May 2008. The company was mainly active in and around the cities of [[The Hague]], [[Amersfoort]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], [[Amstelveen]], and [[Breda]].

Casema was founded on 7 January 1970 and was at that time mainly concerned with cable television.  
Until 1998, it was owned by [[KPN]] (75%) and the Dutch the [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting]] (25%). The company was then sold to [[France Télécom]], who in turn sold Casema to the [[Carlyle Group]], [[GMT Communications]] and [[Providence Equity Partners]] in 2003.

In July 2006, [[Cinven]] and [[Warburg Pincus]] purchased the company for €2.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7fd6bab4-162e-11db-8b7b-0000779e2340|title=Cinven and Warburg Pincus snare Casema|date=2006-07-18|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new owners also bought Multikabel and [[@Home Network#@Home Benelux BV|@Home]], two other cable companies. From 16 May 2008, the three companies were merged to form [[Ziggo]].

At the time of the merger, Casema had approximately 1.4 million customers. The merged company has approximately 3.3 million customers.

'''Cubist Pharmaceuticals''' was a U.S. [[biopharmaceutical]] company with activities spanning from research and development to commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Its main products target pathogens like [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]].

Cubist was one of the few firms that continued to research in antibiotics while larger pharmaceutical companies have abandoned such research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/cubist-exec-challenges-mount-antibiotics-discovery/2014-08-26| title= Cubist exec: Challenges mount in antibiotics discovery| last= Mullin| first=Emily| date=26 Aug 2014| accessdate= 23 Nov 2014| website= Fiercebiotechresearch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company employs 638 people, with 370 in their headquarters in Lexington, MA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. homesite | work=2009 Annual Report|url=http://www.snl.com/irweblinkx/file.aspx?FID=1500026840&amp;IID=4093793 |accessdate=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2011, the company’s headquarters are under expansion and is expected to occupy {{convert|373,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} in Lexington, MA. On 8 December 2014, [[Merck &amp; Co.]] acquired Cubist for $102 per share in cash ($8.4 billion) as entree to the market for drugs that can combat [[super bug (bacteria)|superbugs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/09/us-cubist-pharma-m-a-merck-idUSKBN0JM19X20141209 Merck to take on superbugs with Cubist Pharma buy]. [[Reuters]], 9 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cubist was founded in May 1992 by John K. Clarke, [[Paul Schimmel|Paul R. Schimmel, Ph.D.]] and [[Barry Bloom]], Ph.D, all of whom were also directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SEC Form S3 Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | date=March 8, 2000 | url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/spos/filing.ashx?filingid=1123315}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cubist appeared on Fortune 2010’s List of fastest growing companies, and was named to the 2010 Deloitte Technology Fast 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortunefastestgrowing/2010/|title=100 FASTEST-GROWING COMPANIES|date=2010|accessdate=28 May 2011|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 it had the [[List of biotechnology companies|19th highest sales]] among American based biotechnology companies.

In 2011, the company acquired Adolor, maker of a drug for treatment of [[constipation]].&lt;ref name=apcubist2012/&gt;

Cubist had an ambitious growth plan laid out for the 2012-2017 quinquennium. Under this plan, the company was expected to reach 2B dollars in sales and have 4 new drugs in late stage development by 2017. As a part of this plan, sales of its flagship drug Cubicin were expected to grow to more than 1B dollars per year.

In July 2013, Cubist Pharmaceuticals agreed to purchase [[Trius Therapeutics]] and [[Optimer Pharmaceuticals]] for around $1.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/31/us-cubist-deal-idUSBRE96T1BI20130731| title= Cubist to pay up to $1.6 billion for two antibiotics makers | author= Vrinda Manocha and Zeba Siddiqui | publisher=Reuters | date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, succeeding [[Michael Bonney]] as President, Robert J. Perez, was announced to take leadership on January 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/10/20/new-cubist-pharmaceuticals-chief-executive-will-robert-perez/wf8FbqJsIQSS4HxQQmCzVM/story.html| title=New Cubist Pharmaceuticals chief executive will be Robert J. Perez | date= 20 Oct 2014| accessdate= 23 Nov 2014| last=Weisman| first=Robert| website=www.BostonGlobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015 Cubist Pharmaceuticals became a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co.

==Products==
The company markets Cubicin ([[daptomycin]]) for injection, the first antibiotic in a class of anti-infectives called [[lipopeptides]].  In 2011, Cubist settled a patent litigation with [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries]] regarding Cubicin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-04/cubist-licenses-cubicin-antibiotic-to-teva-in-patent-suit-settlement.html|title=Cubist Settles Teva Patent Litigation on Antibiotic Cubicin|date=2011-04-05|accessdate=28 May 2011|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2011 it reached a deal with Optimer Pharmaceuticals in which its class of bacterium fighting drugs will be co marketed with Optimer's Fidaxomicin/Dificid (for $15 million per year).  Optimer chose Cubist because according to its CEO, "Cubist has a proven track record and well established relations with all stakeholders involved in the antibiotics space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-06/optimer-to-co-market-dificid-drug-with-cubist-pharmaceuticals.html|title=Optimer to Market Dificid Drug With Cubist Pharmaceuticals|date=2011-04-06 | work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4344">An '''employers' organization''' or '''employers' association''' is a collective organization of manufacturers, retailers, or other [[employer]]s of [[wage labor]]. Employers' organizations seek to coordinate the behavior of their member companies in matters of mutual interest, such as during negotiations with [[trade union]]s or government bodies. Employers' organizations operate like trade unions and promote the economic and social interests of its member organisations.

==History==
[[Capitalism]] is based upon a theoretical model in which individual commercial entities [[competition|compete]] with one another in an attempt to gain advantage in the generation of [[profit (accounting)|profits]]. This rivalry between competitors naturally tends to preclude combined action for the advancement of common interests.&lt;ref name=Hilbert185&gt;F.W. Hilbert, "Employers' Associations in the United States," in Jacob H. Hollander and George E. Barnett (eds.), ''Studies in American Trade Unionism.'' New York: Henry Holt and Co., 1912; pg. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[trade union]]s and their efforts to establish [[collective bargaining]] agreements on a local or an industry-wide level ultimately paved the way for combined action by competitors employing such labor in common.&lt;ref name=Hilbert185 /&gt;

The collective entities established by commercial enterprises acting in concert on such matters are known variously as employers' organizations or employers' associations.

Historically, employers' associations were of two general types: those consisting only of employers in a single trade or industry, or those bringing together employers from across a broad spectrum of industries on a local, regional, or national basis.&lt;ref name=Hilbert185 /&gt;

As was the case for unions, the first employers' organizations emerged in large industrial cities during the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Hilbert186&gt;Hilbert, "Employers' Associations in the United States," pg. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Both unions and employers' organizations tended to be localized.&lt;ref name=Hilbert186 /&gt; As unions began to proliferate and to gain strength in negotiations over wages and conditions through the use of [[strike action]]s, employers began to unite in order to restrict wage rates and otherwise fetter the emerging organized labor movement.&lt;ref name=Hilbert186 /&gt;

==International variations==

The role and position of an employers' organization differs from country to country. In countries with an [[Anglo-Saxon economy|Anglo-Saxon economic system]] (such as the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and the [[Economy of the United States|United States]]), where there is no institutionalized cooperation between employers' organizations, trade unions and government, an employers' organization is an [[interest group]] or [[advocacy group]] that through [[lobbying]] tries to influence [[government policy]]. In these countries, employers' organizations tend to be weaker, with many of their functions taken over by [[industry trade group]]s, which are basically [[public relations]] organizations. 

In countries with a [[social market economy]], such as [[Economy of Austria|Austria]], [[Economy of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Economy of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], the employers' organizations are part of a system of institutionalized deliberation, together with government and the trade unions. In tri-partite bargaining the so-called [[social partners]] strike agreements on issues like [[price level]]s, [[wage|wage increase]]s, [[tax rate]]s and [[pension|pension entitlement]]s. In these countries [[collective bargaining]] is often done on a national level not between one corporation and one union, but national employers' organizations and national trade unions.

In countries like [[Economy of Switzerland |Switzerland]], the negotiations often take place at the cantonal level, branch by branch. The state is not involved in these negotiations, but can step in if the employers and the trade unions don't reach an agreement in a sector where salary dumping exists.

'''''Feminine Capital: Unlocking the Power of Women Entrepreneurs''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book written by [[Barbara Jayne Orser|Barbara J. Orser]] and Catherine J. Elliott. The book provides insight into how the intersection between [[entrepreneurship]] and [[feminism]] is evolving.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, L.M. (2016). Feminine Capital: Unlocking the Power of Women Entrepreneurs” International Journal of Gender and Entrepreneurship, 8(8): 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors situate women’s entrepreneurship within the broader contexts of economics and feminism, to consider how sex role stereotypes have led to entrepreneurial characteristics that are predominately masculine.&lt;ref&gt;Merridee, B. (forthcoming). Feminine Capital: Unlocking the Power of Women Entrepreneurs, International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Small Business.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Jayne Orser|Orser]] and Elliott challenge these stereotypes, asserting that women’s approaches to [[entrepreneurship]] are diverse and multi-faceted. The authors describe hurdles that women overcome to change people's perceptions and obtain the resources they need and how some women business owners improve women and girls’ quality of life and well-being through their entrepreneurial actions. They coin the phenomena [[entrepreneurial feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Orser, B.J., Elliott, C. &amp; Leck, J., 2013. Entrepreneurial Feminists: Perspectives about Opportunity Recognition and Governance, Journal of Business Ethics, 115(2): 241– 257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orser, B., Elliott, C., &amp; Leck, J., 2011. Feminist attributes and entrepreneurial identity, Gender in Management: An International Journal, 26(8): 561-589.&lt;/ref&gt; Predicated on social relationships and utilitarian outcomes, case studies illustrate how women are collaborating to create ‘by women, for women’ ventures.’ A gendered matrix of venture creation is advanced. The stories and scenarios explain the concepts and theories that are found in each chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, L.M. (2016). Feminine Capital: Unlocking the Power of Women Entrepreneurs” International Journal of Gender and Entrepreneurship, 8(8): 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt; The book closes with an overview of gender-based analysis of policies and programs to support women entrepreneurs.

The '''Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management''' (IWFM; formerly the '''British Institute of Facilities Management''', BIFM) is a [[United Kingdom]]-based [[professional association]] for the [[facility management|facilities management]] sector.

==History==
BIFM was formed in 1993&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; to promote the development of facilities management as a critical, professional and strategic business discipline.&lt;ref name="Atkin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Atkin |first1=Brian |last2=Brooks |first2=Adrian |title=Total Facilities Management |date=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=London |isbn=9781444316131 |page=4 |edition=3rd }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018 the BIFM had around 17,000 individual members.&lt;ref name="FMJ-31May2018"/&gt;

BIFM was a founding member of the [[Global Facility Management Association (Global FM)]],&lt;ref&gt;https://globalfm.org/home-3/member-organisation/&lt;/ref&gt; and a full member of the [[Construction Industry Council]].&lt;ref name="CICmem"&gt;{{cite web |title=CIC Members |url=http://cic.org.uk/about-us/cic-members.php |website=Construction Industry Council |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, the BIFM proposed changing its name to the Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management and attaining [[Royal charter|chartered]] body status.&lt;ref name="FMJ-31May2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=OBeirne |first1=Sarah |title=FM Clinic: Debate on BIFM’s proposed rebrand and application for chartered body status |url=http://www.fmj.co.uk/fm-clinic-debate-on-bifms-proposed-rebrand-and-application-for-chartered-body-status/ |accessdate=8 June 2018 |work=Facilities Management Journal |date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FMW-4Jun2018"&gt;{{cite news |title=Working up a theme |url=http://www.fm-world.co.uk/news/news-analysis/working-up-a-theme/ |accessdate=8 June 2018 |work=FM World |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name change was implemented in November 2018.&lt;ref name="Obeirne-16Nov2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Obeirne |first1=Sarah |title=BIFM makes big switch to IWFM with a new ten point plan |url=https://www.fmj.co.uk/bifm-makes-big-switch-to-iwfm-with-a-new-ten-point-plan/ |accessdate=29 November 2018 |work=Facilities Management Journal |date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivar Kreuger''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈiːvar ˈkryːɡɛr|lang}}; 2 March 1880 – 12 March 1932) was a Swedish civil engineer, financier, entrepreneur and industrialist. In 1908, he co-founded the construction company [[Kreuger &amp; Toll Byggnads AB]], which specialized in new building techniques. By aggressive investments and innovative financial instruments, he built a global [[match]] and financial empire. Between the two world wars, he negotiated match [[monopoly|monopolies]] with European, Central American and South American governments, and finally controlled between two thirds and three quarters of worldwide match production, becoming known as the "Match King".&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |title=Poor Kruger |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743409,00.html |quote=Principal Kreuger company is Swedish Match — Svenska Tändsticks. It makes 66% of the world's matches, controlling 250 plants in 43 nations. In 1930 its earnings came to $13,000,000. This company's growth was due to Ivar Kreuger's efforts and its rise paralleled his own. |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 21, 1932 |accessdate=2008-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kreuger Genius And Swindler' 1960, p.9"&gt;''Kreuger Genius And Swindler'' by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960, p.9)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kreuger's financial empire has been described by one biographer as a [[Ponzi scheme]], based on the supposedly fantastic profitability of his match monopolies.&lt;ref&gt;see in: ''The Incredible Ivar Kreuger'' by Allen Churchill (Weidenfeld, London; Rinehart &amp; Co., New York; 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a Ponzi scheme early investors are paid [[dividend]]s from their own money or that of subsequent investors. Although Kreuger did this to some extent, he also controlled many legitimate and often very profitable businesses, and owned banks, real estate, a gold mine, and [[pulp industry|pulp]] and industrial companies, besides his many match companies. Many of them have survived to this day. Kreuger &amp; Toll, for example, was composed of bona fide businesses, and there were others like it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.13;51&lt;/ref&gt; Another biographer called Kreuger a "genius and swindler",&lt;ref&gt;''Kreuger Genius And Swindler'' by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] wrote that he was the "[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]] of larcenists".&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to''Kreuger Genius And Swindler'' by John Kenneth Galbraith, p.x (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; Kreuger's financial empire collapsed during the [[Great Depression]]. The Price Waterhouse autopsy of his financial empire stated: "The manipulations were so childish that anyone with but a rudimentary knowledge of bookkeeping could see the books were falsified."&lt;ref&gt;Charles  R.  Morris, ''A Rabble of Dead Money: The Great Crash and the Global Depression: 1929-1939'' (2017), p 167.&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1932, he was found dead in the bedroom of his flat in Paris. The police concluded that he had committed suicide, but decades later, his brother Torsten claimed that he had been murdered, which spawned some controversial literature on the subject.

== Early life ==
[[File:Ivar Kreuger 1896.png|thumb|Kreuger as a graduate at the age of 16.]]
Kreuger was born in [[Kalmar]], the eldest son of Ernst August Kreuger (1852–1946), an industrialist in the match industry in that city,&lt;ref&gt;who was also Russian vice consul, a position he had inherited from his own father, Per Edward Kreuger.&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Jenny Emelie Kreuger (''née'' Forssman; 1856–1949). Ivar Kreuger had five siblings: Ingrid (born 1877), Helga (born 1878), Torsten (born 1884), Greta (born 1889) and Britta (born 1891).

At school, Ivar skipped ahead two classes by taking private lessons. At  age 16, he began studies at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], from which he graduated with combined master's degrees covering both the faculties of [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and civil engineering, at the age of 20.&lt;ref&gt;Remark: The M. Sc. degree around 1900 cannot be compared to the present demands. Today, two MSc. covering the full education program in both faculties in four years is impossible.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pickford fairbanks 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Pickford]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], Charles Magnusson and Ivar Kreuger (to the right) onboard M/Y Loris in Stockholm 1924.]]
Ivar Kreuger never married, but lived for many years in different periods with Ingeborg Eberth (1889–1977),&lt;ref&gt;Ingeborg Eberth's parents were Otto Alfred Hässler (d. 1929), publisher married to Jenny Charlotta Hässler (d. 1937).&lt;/ref&gt; family name Hässler, born in Stockholm, who worked as a [[Physical therapy|physical therapist]] in Stockholm.

They met for the first time in Stockholm in 1913. According to the book she wrote in 1932, after Krueger's death, he was not interested in marriage or children, and was very much focused on his business. She broke off the relationship in 1917 and moved to Denmark, where she married a Danish engineer with the name Eberth. They had a daughter in 1919, Grete Eberth (later to be an actress in Stockholm, married name Mac Laury 1919–2002). After some years, however, she divorced Eberth and moved back to Stockholm with her daughter, reuniting with Kreuger. Mr. Eberth once kidnapped the daughter in Stockholm and brought her back to Denmark. Shortly thereafter Ingeborg, without notifying the authorities or police, went down to Denmark and brought the daughter back to Sweden by hiring a private fishing boat in Denmark that took them over [[Öresund]] to Sweden. The new period with Kreuger lasted until around 1928; after that they just met occasionally. The last time they met was in November 1931, just before Kreuger started on his final trip to America. Eberth received the news about his death in Paris on March 12, 1932, from newspaper headlines the day after.

Kreuger had private apartments in Stockholm, New York, Paris, and [[Warsaw]], and a country place used during the summer season on the private island Ängsholmen&lt;ref&gt;Position [[WGS84]]:{{Coord|59|22|10.2|N|18|44|23.2|E|type:landmark}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the archipelago of Stockholm. On business tours in Europe, he preferred to meet his business associates in Paris and then stayed in his flat at 5, Av. Victor Emanuel III (today named Avenue Franklin D. Roosevelt). He owned several specially designed [[Yacht#Motor yachts|motor yachts]], among them ''Elsa'' built in 1906, ''Loris'' (1913), ''Tärnan'' (1925), and the most famous, ''Svalan'' (''Swallow''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Svalan_Kreuger_1928.jpg Drawing sketch Swallow]&lt;/ref&gt; built at [[Lidingö]] in 1928, a 37&amp;nbsp;ft, 4.9 ton motor yacht, equipped with a V12, 31.9 liter Hispano-Suiza engine from the US company Wright, with 650 HP output, capable of more than 50 knots. A replica of the boat has been built.&lt;ref&gt;Pampas Shipyard and Yacht Club, Stockholm&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a large private library in both his apartments in Stockholm and New York and quite a large art collection. The paintings were sold at different auctions held in September 1932, as all of Kreuger's private assets were incorporated into the bankruptcy. The collection in Stockholm comprised 88 original paintings, among them 19 by [[Anders Zorn]] and a great number by [[old master]]s from the Netherlands. The New York collection included original paintings by [[Rembrandt]] and [[Anthony van Dyck]].

Kreuger became the major shareholder when the Swedish film company [[AB Svensk Filmindustri]] (SF) was founded in 1919 and because of that, sometimes met celebrities from the film industry. In June 1924, [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] were invited by SF to Stockholm and were guided around the Stockholm archipelago in Kreuger's motor yacht ''Loris''. A five-minute film sequence of this occasion is stored in SF's film archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://svtplay.se/v/1370334/oppet_arkiv/pickford_och_fairbanks_pa_besok_i_stockholm__utan_ljud Filmsequence with Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks i Stockholm 1924.

== Early years in the United States ==
After the start of the 20th century, Kreuger spent seven years traveling and working abroad as an engineer in the USA, Mexico, South Africa and other countries, but spent most of the time in the US. In South Africa, he ran a restaurant for a short time together with his friend [[Anders Jordahl]], but they soon sold the restaurant. At an early stage, he came in contact with the patented 
[[Kahn System]] for [[reinforced concrete|concrete-steel constructions]] that was exploited by [[Julius Kahn (inventor)|Julius Kahn's]] [[Trussed Concrete Steel Company]], when working for different engineering companies, among them The Consolidated Engineering &amp; Construction Co. and Purdy &amp; Henderson in New York. This new technique had not been introduced in Sweden at that time. In 1907, he managed to get the representative rights for the system for both the Swedish and the German markets, and at the end of 1907, he returned to Sweden with the goal of introducing the new methods in both countries at the same time. At that time, one of the experts in Sweden in concrete-steel constructions was his cousin [[Henrik Kreüger]] working at [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH]] in Stockholm.

== Historical cost and prices ==
Note that multiplying historical U.S. prices of the period by 15 will result in an approximate value in today's prices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US_Historical_Inflation.svg File:US Historical Inflation.svg - Wikimedia Commons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; To appreciate the enormous sums with which he was involved and to evaluate Ivar Kreuger, it is necessary to factor out inflation. This is done in the text by giving the approximate value in today's money in parentheses. Rather than showing the source used after every conversion into today's values it is provided in this section.

== The building contractor and his innovations ==
[[File:Paul Toll, Henrik and Ivar Kreuger 1908.jpg|thumb|right|Kreuger &amp; Toll founders [[Paul Toll]] (standing), [[Henrik Kreüger]] (left) and Ivar Kreuger during an inspection of an overpass in Solna in 1908, one of the first orders for the construction company.]]

In May 1908, Kreuger formed the construction firm [[Kreuger &amp; Toll]] in Sweden with the engineer [[Paul Toll]], at that time working for the construction company Kasper Höglund AB, and his cousin [[Henrik Kreüger]], working at the faculty of civil engineering at [[KTH]], as a consulting engineer for the company. In Germany, he formed the company Deutsche Kahneisengesellschaft&lt;ref&gt;In English, German Kahn-steel Company.&lt;/ref&gt; together with a colleague from his time in America, Anders Jordahl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordahl.de/de/kontakt/ueberuns.html Jordahl Befeistungstechnik website, Jordahl history (in German).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821012430/http://www.jordahl.de/de/kontakt/ueberuns.html |date=2009-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new way of constructing buildings was not fully accepted in Sweden at that time and in order to market the new technique, Kreuger held several lectures and wrote an illustrated article on the subject in a leading engineering magazine, ''[[Teknisk Tidskrift]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Title (translated): "Experiences in concrete steel constructions in North America" by Ivar Kreuger in the magazine ''Teknisk Tidskrift'', 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

This new technology of constructing buildings was a success and the firm won several prestigious contracts, such as the construction of the [[Stockholm Olympic Stadium]] (1911–12); the foundation work for the new [[Stockholm City Hall]] (1912–13) and the department store [[Nordiska Kompaniet|NK]] (1913–14) in Stockholm. The chief engineer behind these advanced projects was Henrik Kreüger.

Innovation in the construction business also included a definite commitment to finish the building on time. Hitherto the financial risk of delays were assumed by the clients. Kreuger &amp; Toll was the first firm in Europe to commit to finish projects by a fixed date, thus shifting the risk to the builder, who after all was in the best position to reduce delays. When Kreuger won the contract to build a six-story "skyscraper", he promised that if construction wasn't finished by a particular date Kreuger &amp; Toll would give the client a partial refund of $1,200 (about $18,000 in today's currency [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:US_Historical_Inflation.svg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1])for each late day.  It is noteworthy that Kreuger &amp; Toll's entire capital would have covered just two days of being late. The client, in turn, agreed to pay a bonus for every day the building was finished before the due date. Kreuger &amp; Toll finished early and subsequently earned completion bonuses for every project. Within a few years, Kreuger &amp; Toll was seen as the best building company in Sweden and one of the top firms in all of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Within six years after its incorporation, Kreuger &amp; Toll earned annual profits of around $200,000 and was paying a substantial dividend of 15%.&lt;ref name="Kreuger Genius And Swindler' 1960 p.44"&gt;''Kreuger Genius And Swindler'' by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960)p.44&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, the company was split into two separate companies: Kreuger &amp; Toll Construction AB, with the majority of shares owned by Paul Toll. Ivar Kreuger was not among the board members in the construction company. How much of Paul Toll's company Ivar Kreuger owned has not been revealed—just that Paul Toll owned 60% in 1917 and, around 1930, 66% of the construction company. Kreuger &amp; Toll Construction Co. has never shown up in any Kreuger &amp; Toll Holding organisation charts.

Kreuger &amp; Toll Holding became his financial holding company, with Ivar Kreuger as the general manager and major share holder. He controlled it with a tight grip. The board of directors consisted of Ivar, his father, Paul Toll and two very close colleagues.&lt;ref name="Kreuger Genius And Swindler' 1960 p.44"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ivar got involved in his father's match factories in Kalmar, he became more focused on "constructing" new companies or taking control of other corporations - usually paying with his own securities instead of cash - rather than buildings and bridges. Thus, by 1927, Ivar had bought banks, mining companies, railways, timber and paper firms, film distributors, real estate in several European cities as well as a controlling stake in L.M. [[Ericsson]] &amp; Co., Sweden's leading phone company. He controlled about 50% of the world market in iron ore and cellulose. He owned mines all over the world including the [[Boliden]] mine in Sweden, which had one of the richest gold deposits outside South Africa in addition to other minerals.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.112 - 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Kreuger formed [[Swedish Match]] by merging his father's business with other match factories he had quietly bought during [[World War I]]. Its initial capital was around $10 million ({{circa|$150 million}} in today's currency [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:US_Historical_Inflation.svg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1]) and Ivar owned about half of it, held all senior positions and controlled the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish banker [[Oscar Rydbeck]] (1878–1951) became a close associate and an important teacher for Ivar in the financing business. He worked for Kreuger &amp; Toll as a consultant from around 1912 until the Kreuger Crash in 1932 and was a member of its board of directors. For not having carried out his duties as a director he went to jail for 10 months after Ivar's death.&lt;ref&gt;''Kreuger Genius And Swindler'' by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960)p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

== The match business ==
[[File:Ivar Kreuger office Stockholm.jpg|thumb|right|Ivar Kreuger in the headquarters of Swedish Match, the [[Matchstick Palace]], in Stockholm around 1930.]]
[[File:Oscar Rydbeck.jpg|thumb|right|Oscar Rydbeck, Ivar Kreuger's banker. Photo: around 1930.]]
In 1911 and 1912, the Kreuger family match factories in [[Kalmar]], [[Fredriksdal]] and [[Mönsterås]], run by his father Ernst Kreuger, uncle Fredrik Kreuger and his brother Torsten Kreuger, encountered financial problems. Kreuger was then advised by his banker Oscar Rydbeck to turn the factories into a stock corporation in order to raise more capital. This was the starting point for the reformation of the Swedish match industry as well as the major match companies in Norway and Finland. The goal was to get control of the entire match industry in Scandinavia.

With the family match factories as the base, Kreuger first founded the Swedish corporation ''AB Kalmar-Mönsterås Tändsticksfabrik'' in 1912. His father, Ernst, and uncle Fredrik, became the major shareholders and his brother [[Torsten Kreuger|Torsten]] was appointed the general manager. Ivar became a member of the board.

A merger between this company with several other small match companies in Sweden, the company ''AB Svenska Förenade Tändsticksfabriker''&lt;ref&gt;In English, "Swedish United Match Companies".&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1913 with Ivar Kreuger as the general manager. Later, by merging with the largest match company in Sweden, ''AB Jönköping-Vulcan'', Svenska Tändsticks AB ([[Swedish Match]]) was founded in 1917. Ivar had originally tried to convince ''AB Jönköping-Vulcan'' to merge in December 1912, but they had not been interested as Vulcan was the dominating match company in Sweden. Ivar then started to acquire all of the match companies as well as most of the raw material companies he could find in and around Sweden and then finally got ''AB Jönköping-Vulcan'' to accept the merger. He had been so persuasive in arguing for the merger that he managed to overvalue his side of the deal so that it was essentially the smaller organization taking over the larger one. It was his first big venture in inflating values, which became his prime tactic thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;''Kreuger Genius And Swindler'' by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960) p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main designers behind this operation, beside Ivar, was his banker Rydbeck. The total number of shares in the new company was 450,000. Ivar Kreuger personally owned 223,000 shares and his new holding company, Kreuger &amp; Toll Holding AB, 60,000.

This company group now covered the entire match industry in Sweden, including all the major companies that manufactured the production machines used in the factories. The total number of employees working in match production in Sweden in 1917 was around 9000. It also had control over major companies supplying the raw material for the match industry. During this time Kreuger also acquired the largest match manufacturing companies in Norway ([[Bryn (company)|Bryn]] and [[Halden (company)|Halden]]) and in Finland ([[Wiborgs]] and [[Kekkola]]).

However, Kreuger not only "acquired" companies but also introduced a new way of thinking in the Swedish match industry with large scale production facilities, ideas to increase efficiency in production, administration, distribution, and marketing.

He managed to unite the Swedish match industry as well as the major match companies in Norway and Finland. With this new company structure the match industry in [[Scandinavia]] became a major competitor to large manufacturers elsewhere. Ivar's methods resembled those [[John D. Rockefeller]] used in the formation of the [[Standard Oil Trust]] transforming dozens of struggling factories into a strong and profitable monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.34 - 35&lt;/ref&gt; The methods had become illegal in the USA because of [[United States antitrust law|anti-trust laws]], but were not against the law in Sweden at the time.

A German chemist had invented [[phosphorus]] matches in 1832 but they were dangerous because the yellow phosphorus used was poisonous and because it was in the match head and thus could easily light by accident. The Swedes improved on the design by using a safer red phosphorus, which they put on the striking surface of the matchbox. They called them "safety matches". They made Sweden the leading exporter of matches and made matches the most important Swedish export.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be remembered that in the early part of the 20th century matches were a necessity for smoking and the lighting of stoves and gas appliances among other uses and therefore demand for them was highly [[inelastic]], meaning that a monopolist could raise prices (and hence profits) significantly without much affecting the quantity sold.

By expanding the Swedish Match company through acquisition of government-created monopolies, the Swedish company became the world's largest match manufacturer. Kreuger set up an affiliate to Kreuger &amp; Toll AB in the United States, and together with [[Lee, Higginson &amp; Co.]] in New York, formed the [[International Match Corporation]]. This group eventually came to control almost 75% of the world production in matches.

== Other business ==
{{See also|Zündwaren monopoly}}

From 1925 to 1930, years when many countries in Europe were suffering after the [[First World War]], Kreuger's companies gave loans to governments to speed up reconstruction. As a security, the governments would grant him the match monopoly in their country. This means that Kreuger gained a monopoly in match production, sales, or distribution, or a complete monopoly. The monopoly agreements differed from country to country. The capital was raised to a large extent through loans from Swedish and American banks, combined with issuing a large amount of participating debentures. Kreuger also often moved money from one corporation he controlled to another.

Kreuger did not limit himself to matches, but gained control of most of the [[forestry]] industry in northern Sweden and planned to become head of a [[cellulose]] [[cartel]]. He also attempted to create a telephone monopoly in Sweden.

After founding the pulp manufacturer [[Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget|SCA]], in 1929 Kreuger was able to acquire the majority shares in the telephone company [[Ericsson]]; the mining company [[Boliden]] (gold); major interests in the [[ball bearing]] manufacturer [[SKF]]; the bank [[Skandinaviska Banken|Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget]] and others.

Abroad he acquired [[Deutsche Unionsbank]] in Germany and [[Union de Banques à Paris]] in France, often with the acquired company's own money. These maneuvers were made both necessary and possible by his invention, decades ahead of his time, of [[Enron scandal|Enron-style financial engineering]], which reported profits when there were none and paid out ever increasing dividends by attracting new investment and/or looting the treasury of a newly acquired company.

By 1931, Kreuger controlled some 200 companies. However, the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]] turned out to be a major factor in exposing his accounting that ultimately proved fatal to both him and his empire.

In the spring of 1930, he visited the United States and gave a lecture about the situation in world economics at the [[Industrial Club of Chicago]] with the title "The transfer problem and its importance to the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Speech held May 15, 1930. [http://www.kb.se National Library of Sweden]&lt;/ref&gt; He was invited by President [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] to the [[White House]] to discuss the subject and in June he was awarded the title [[doctorate|Doctor]] of [[Business Administration]] by [[Syracuse University]], where he had worked as a young chief engineer when [[Archbold Stadium]] was built there in 1907.

In 1929, at the peak of his career, the Kreuger fortune was thought to be worth 30 billion Swedish [[swedish krona|kronor]], equivalent to approximately US$100 billion in 2000,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and consisting of more than 200 companies. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the same year, the total loans made by Swedish banks were barely 4 billion SEK.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== Financial innovations and financial engineering ==
Obtaining a monopoly for the production and/or sale of matches in return for loans to governments was, in its essence, not a new way of doing business. Such schemes had been around for a long time (e.g. the Mississippi Bubble of [[John Law (economist)|John Law]], and the [[South Sea Bubble]]) but Keuger was very creative inventing new ways of financing business, while making sure that he kept control of his companies.

=== B-shares ===
Kreuger financed his activities by selling shares and bonds of his companies as well as through large bank loans, mainly the last two. The use of debt in addition to equity is called leverage and it magnifies both gains and losses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp Leverage], at Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to selling shares, he invented dual class ownership shares&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dualcontrol.asp Dual Control] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622110717/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dualcontrol.asp |date=2011-06-22 }}, at Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt;
since he did not want to lose control of his companies. He called the class of shares with reduced [[voting power]] B shares. One of Kreuger's biographers, [[Frank Partnoy]], called it "an ingenious piece of financial engineering". Ivar began with Swedish Match where he divided the common shares into two classes. Each class would have the same claim to dividends and profits, but the B shares would carry only 1/1000 of a vote, compared to one vote for each A share. In this way Ivar could double the size of his capital, while diluting his control by just a fraction of a percent.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently such shares are sometimes called A Shares with the B Shares having more voting power, as is the case with Google for instance where they carry ten times more voting power than the A Shares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stocks.about.com/od/advancedtrading/a/Googleshares.htm Google Shares] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624013749/http://stocks.about.com/od/advancedtrading/a/Googleshares.htm |date=2010-06-24 }}, at Stocks site&lt;/ref&gt;

As already stated, these types of shares are used to this day although, unlike in Kreuger's time, there are often restrictions in some markets and/or jurisdictions nowadays. The New York Stock Exchange, for example, allows companies to list dual-class voting shares. Once shares are listed, however, companies are not allowed to reduce the voting rights of the existing shares or issue a new class of superior voting shares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental/04/092204.asp Fundamental], at Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a wide range of dual-class share structures and their use between countries. In Canada, for example, an estimated 20% to 25% of companies currently listed on the TSX make use of some form of dual-class share structure or special voting rights. In the United States on the other hand, where rules on dual-class shares are much more restrictive and investor opposition is more vocal, just over 2% of companies issue restricted shares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0526-e.htm#What Research Publications] at PARL site&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convertible gold debentures ===
Ivar and Lee Higginson &amp; Co., his investment banker in the USA, decided to have International Match issue new securities called convertible gold debentures. "Debenture" is a debt instrument not secured by physical collateral or assets.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhart, Carmen M., Roggof, Kenneth S. This Time Is Different, Princeton University Press, Princeton and Oxford, c.2009 {{ISBN|978-0-691-14216-6}}, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; They were issued to mature in 20 years and they were payable in either dollars or gold, at the holder's option. These bonds gave investors the right to receive annual interest payments of 6.5 percent from International Match, which was an attractive rate at the time.

Finally, these debentures were convertible, which meant that they could be converted into shares. If International Match performed well and the value of the shares increased, investors could switch from the debentures to the more valuable shares. The convertible feature made these securities particularly attractive: they have both downside protection (because in the case of bankruptcy the bond holders were paid before the shareholders) and upside potential. In other words, the best of both worlds. "Ivar and Lee Higginson had designed their first financial mousetrap."

Ivar's popularity helped Lee Higginson sell $15 million of International Match gold debentures, at a price of $94.50 for each $100 of principal amount. Investors paid $94.50 in return for the right to receive interest of $6.50 per year for 20 years (6.5 percent of the hundred dollars principal amount.). The deal raised a total of $14,175,000, i.e. 94.5 percent of $15 million.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.42 - 43&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Certificates ===
Kreuger invented another financial instrument, which continues to be used and is nowadays known as [[American Depositary Receipt]]s. That issue was called Kreuger &amp; Toll "American Certificates". American investors had never seen an investment like this. It was part bond, part preferred stock, and part profit sharing option. The certificates enabled investors to gain exposure to a foreign company that had been paying dividends of 25 percent. It would be backed by the largest private loan to a foreign government (i.e. Germany) ever. Even in the midst of the growing panic investors went crazy for the issue and promised to buy 28 million dollars of the new securities.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.43&lt;/ref&gt; And this happened two days after [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Monday]] in 1929.

=== Binary foreign exchange option ===
The second Poland agreement also contained some extraordinary protection for International Match including a binary foreign exchange option, a kind of derivative contract,&lt;ref&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/d/derivatives/index.html Derivatives], at NYTimes Topics&lt;/ref&gt; to protect International Match from any declines in the value of the dollar: "International Match Corporation shall have the right to obtain payment of interest in Dutch guilders or US dollars according to its choice and for all such payments one dollar shall be counted as 2½ guilders."

To retain control of Garanta, Ivar created another innovative financial provision, which meant that during the first four years until October 1, 1929, International Match Corporation had the right to appoint the managing director of Garanta who alone was entitled to sign for the company on or after October 1, 1929, International Match Corporation had the right to acquire 60 percent of the shares at par. This option term secured both initial control over Garanta and the right to own a majority of Garanta's shares in the future.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Off balance sheet entities ===
This means that details of an enterprise do not appear in the parent company's financial statements. Some of these entities were more or less secret. The associated debt, called "off balance sheet obligations", didn't appear in any financial statements of the companies Ivar controlled other than in summary form, if at all.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.x&lt;/ref&gt;  Albert D. Berning of the firm Ernst &amp; Ernst,  International Match's auditor, rationalized it at the shareholder's meeting in 1926. He said "it is only customary to consolidate the assets and liabilities of companies in such a balance sheet when a substantial majority of the outstanding shares are owned by the parent company. Where less than such a majority is owned, the shares are included as investments."&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.58,95&lt;/ref&gt;
This invention gained rapid acceptance by others, e.g. [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Lehman Brothers]]. The former issued 250 million dollars' worth of complex securities (equivalent to about 3.75 billion in today's money) in 1929. Lehman issued similar obligations, which immediately rose 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.133&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enron]] used them extensively and in the recent financial crisis they played a major role in bringing down [[Bear Stearns]] and Lehman Brothers.

== Gambling ==
Despite the large number of ''[[bona fide]]'' companies Ivar controlled, he was an avid gambler.

He speculated with his personal funds and, especially, with the money of the corporations he controlled. Kreuger treated most of his companies as if they were exclusively his personal property. He frequently transferred funds from one corporation to another with little formality. A number of dummy corporations and holding companies  (e.g. Garanta and Continental Investment Corporation) helped him to hide what he was doing. He also used other people as front men to conceal his actions, for example when he acquired almost half of the outstanding shares of [[Diamond Match Company]] so as not to raise [[anti-trust]] concerns in the USA. Towards the end, in 1932, when he frantically gambled with the securities of corporations he controlled in the vain attempt to reverse their falling prices, he played the markets himself and had friends help him in the effort to prop up share prices. Between the end of February and early March 1932 he needed to make over $10 million (equivalent to more than $150 million in today's money) for payments, including [[Kreuger &amp; Toll]] dividends.

His speculations were in foreign currencies, equities and derivatives and he also signed loan agreements with governments not knowing where the funds would be coming from. For example, the majority stake he had bought in a chemical company in [[Griesheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Griesheim]], Germany returned 15 times his investment after two years when the company became part of [[I. G. Farben]]. Part of his attraction for investors were the high dividends Kreuger &amp; Toll paid. Therefore, he also had to make sure that he had money to pay those dividends.

It has never been established how much Kreuger lost in these frantic efforts in early 1932, but it has been estimated to be between $50 million and $100 million (c. $750 million and $1.5 billion in today's currency).&lt;ref name="Kreuger Genius and Swindler 1960 p.182"&gt;''Kreuger Genius and Swindler'' by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960) p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

His first sovereign loan went to Poland and when Kreuger signed the agreement he had no idea where the funds would come from.

He made a deal with Germany for a $125 million-dollar loan (almost $1.9 billion in today's currency) with the conditions that Germany sign the [[Young Plan]] and, of course, award him a match monopoly. (He already controlled 70% of German match production before the loan agreement.) When he signed the contract, he had no idea where he would obtain the huge amount; however, he was lucky.  Prime Minister [[Aristide Briand]] of France decided to repay before it was due a previous $75 million-dollar loan from Ivar. Incredibly, the French agreed to pay this sum by April 1930, just before Ivar's first payment to Germany was due. That payment gave Ivar enough cash to make his first installment. Either he had negotiated a sweetheart rescue deal with Prime Minister Briand, or he was incredibly lucky. He also made $5M (c. $75 million in today's currency) due to the way the loan to France was structured. (It had been discounted and although France received only $70 million it was obligated to pay back $75 million.)&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kreuger group loans to foreign states, 1925–1930 ==

Kreuger planned to issue a loan of $75m to Italy, known as the "Italian [[Bond (finance)|Bond]]" in 1930 but the deal was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;The loan to Italy has been referred to as the "Italian [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]" in the Kreuger literature.&lt;/ref&gt;

== End of the Kreuger empire and death ==
In March 1931, during a meeting at the German Ministry of Finance in Berlin, Swiss banker [[Felix Somary]] already warned of a bankruptcy of Kreuger's match company.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Somary - Erinnerungen aus meinem Leben.&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1931, rumours spread that Kreuger &amp; Toll and other companies in Kreuger's empire were financially unstable. In February 1932, Kreuger turned to [[Sveriges Riksbank]] for the second time in his life to support him in raising a large increase in his loans. At this time his total loans from Swedish banks were estimated at about half of the Swedish reserve currency, which had started to have negative effects on the value of the Swedish currency in the international financial market. In order to grant him more loans, the government required that a complete statement of accounts of Kreuger's entire company group be presented, as the bank's ([[Sveriges Riksbank]]) own calculations showed that Kreuger &amp; Toll finances were far too weak to give him more loans.

At that time, Ivar Kreuger was in the United States and was asked to return to Europe for a meeting with the chairman of the Riksbank, [[Ivar Rooth]]. He had left Sweden for the last time on 23 November 1931 and returned to Europe on the ship [[SS Île de France|''Ile de France'',]] arriving in Paris on 11 March 1932. The meeting with Ivar Rooth was scheduled to take place on 13 or 14 March in [[Berlin]]. He met with Krister Littorin (vice president of Kreuger &amp; Toll holding) and his own banker Oscar Rydbeck in Paris on 11 March to prepare for the Berlin meeting. But the day after he was found dead in bed in his apartment at Avenue Victor Emanuel III. After questioning Kreuger's servants (his French maid, Mademoiselle Barrault, and the [[janitor]] who had had contact with Kreuger in the morning) the French police and a physician came to the conclusion that he had shot himself some time between 10:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 12:10&amp;nbsp;p.m. A 9-mm semi-automatic gun was found on the bed beside the body.

He left a sealed envelope in the room, addressed to Krister Littorin, which contained three other sealed envelopes - one addressed to his sister Britta; one to Sune Schéle;&lt;ref&gt;Sune Schéle was working for Kreuger 1919–1932. Between 1925–1930  Schéle was a manager for the Kreuger business in India.&lt;/ref&gt; and one addressed to Littorin. In the letter to Littorin (for some reason written in English although Littorin was his closest Swedish colleague), he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have made such a mess of things that I believe this to be the most satisfactory solution for everybody concerned. Please, take care of these two letters also see that two letters which were sent a couple of days ago by Jordahl to me at 5, Avenue Victor Emanuel are returned to Jordahl. The letters were sent by [[RMS Majestic (1914)|Majestic]] - Goodbye now and thanks. I K.''&lt;ref&gt;''Police report-Kreuger''. [http://www.ssa.stockholm.se National Archive, Stockholm].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The other two letters to Sune Schéle and his sister Britta have not been published.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ivar Kreuger was interred in [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in Stockholm.

== Murder allegations ==
While his family believed Ivar Kreuger to have been murdered, it was only more than 30 years after Ivar Kreuger's death that many previously classified Kreuger &amp; Toll documents and Ivar Kreuger documents were made public. Based on these and his insight in his brother's business and life, Ivar's brother Torsten Kreuger wrote a book in 1963 (2nd edition) called ''Kreuger &amp; Toll'', describing how Kreuger &amp; Toll had been taken over, and how then the other Kreuger companies were taken over too. In 1965, Torsten Kreuger published ''Sanningen om Ivar Kreuger'' (published in English as: "Ivar Kreuger: The Truth at Last") claiming that his brother Ivar had been murdered. Recently, more books have been written claiming that more documents have re-appeared or were finally released to public scrutiny, and supporting Torsten Kreuger's claims that his brother was murdered: ''Därför mördades Ivar Kreuger'' ("The Reason for the Murder of Ivar Kreuger") ({{ISBN|91-7055-019-0}}) (1990), and ''Kreuger-Mordet: En utredning med nya fakta'' (translation: "The Kreuger Murder: An Investigation with New Facts") ({{ISBN|91-630-9780-X}}) (2000).

== The Kreuger Crash ==
Kreuger's death precipitated the ''Kreuger Crash'' which hit investors and companies worldwide, but particularly hard in the USA and Sweden. In 1933 and 1934, the U.S. Congress passed several security reform legislations that were meant to prevent a repeat of the Kreuger Crash. These bills were largely successful in their mission and the American financial industry did not witness frauds of the same magnitude until the [[Enron]] scandal and [[Bernard Madoff]]'s [[Ponzi scheme]].

A ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' report from 1930 had judged that of the $630m worth of assets the company claimed to have, $200m came from the match business, $30m were in the bank, and the other $400m were merely categorized as "other investments".&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Match King. |url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10278667 |quote=Ivar Kreuger was the world's greatest swindler. He would have thrived today. ... Kreuger walked to a gun-shop and bought a 9mm automatic pistol. That night, the man who had never married, who kissed women on the wrist rather than the hand for fear of germs, had a last tryst with a young Finnish girlfriend. The next day, lying on his bed in a pin-stripe suit, he shot himself, blowing out the last flicker of illusion in a hopeless age. |publisher=Economist |date=December 19, 2007 |accessdate=2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the company finally went bankrupt at the end of March 1932, claimed assets of $250m turned out to be non-existent.

Prior to the crash, Kreuger had issued thousands of participating [[debenture]]s. These were very popular, and a firm public belief in the rising Kreuger empire convinced contemporary Swedes to invest in these "Kreuger papers". Following the Kreuger crash, both the debentures and shares became worthless, and several thousand Swedes and small banks lost their savings and investments as a result. Large investors and suppliers apart from share holders, received a total of 43% back. The banks related to the [[Wallenberg family]] company group, [[Stenbeck]] company group, and [[Handelsbanken]] took over most of the companies in the Kreuger empire. Swedish Match recovered shortly after the crash as did most of the industrial companies within the Kreuger empire. Swedish Match received a large government guaranteed loan that was fully repaid after several years. IMCO in USA however did not survive. The liquidation took nine years and was eventually finished in 1941.

== Tentative conclusions ==
One biographer called him a genius and swindler.&lt;ref name="Kreuger Genius And Swindler' 1960, p.9"/&gt; [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] wrote "Boiler-room operators, peddlers of stocks in the imaginary Canadian mines, mutual-fund managers whose genius and imagination are unconstrained by integrity, as well as less exotic larcenists, should read about Kreuger. He was the Leonardo of their craft."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Shaplen's Introduction to ''Kreuger Genius And Swindler'' by John Kenneth Galbraith, (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960, p.x)&lt;/ref&gt; Ivar himself admitted to some extent that not all was above board when he said, "I've built my enterprise on the firmest ground that can be found – the foolishness of people."&lt;ref&gt;''Kreuger: Genius and Swindler'' by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960, p. 128)&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps Andrew Beattie  summed it up best: "Ivar Kreuger is still a bit of an enigma in history. ...At times it seemed that he was a solid, if ruthless, businessman, and at other times he appeared every inch a scam artist. Between those times, he either built a match monopoly that overreached or orchestrated one of the biggest pyramid schemes in history."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/09/ivar-kreuger.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his financial schemes did indeed have some parallels with a Ponzi scheme in as much as he needed to raise more and more funds in order to finance the loans he extended to governments in exchange for match monopolies. It's obvious that it's impossible to have earnings in single digits (as these sovereign loans typically paid) and continue paying dividends in double digits. Dividends were as high as 20%.&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"&gt;''Called to Account: Fourteen Financial Frauds that Shaped the American Accounting Profession, Routledge, 2008'' by Paul M. Clikeman, (Routledge, 2008) p.23. Excerpts are at: https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nn0G1wT8cagC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=related:bexGr3avgIsJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;ots=KdIOMYm6Tu&amp;sig=147GGhtVx7ieJfp68pXjr5wS0oU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; However, while paying high dividends was definitely one of the attractions of  Kreuger's companies, paying dividends to his investors did not come exclusively from new investors, which is the case in Ponzi schemes.

Balance sheets and Profit and Loss statements served one major purpose, if not the only one, for Ivar and that was they had to be helpful in his fund raising efforts. Often they were just pure fantasy to be revised at will to please investors. He also frequently treated the assets of corporations he controlled as if they were his own. However, things should be seen in the context of the time. [[IBM]], for example, consolidated all its accounts in one named Plant, Property, Equipment, Machines, Patents and Goodwill. [[American Can]] doubled its reported net earnings in 1913 by claiming only $1 million of depreciation after having claimed $2.5 million the previous year. Many companies set up arbitrary reserves in good times to be used in bad years and few holding companies published consolidated [[financial statements]].

Accounting standards and auditors' responsibility for the accuracy of financial statements evolved over time. Corporations resisted publishing audited financial statements. [[US Steel]] defied convention when it published its first audited financial statements in 1903. Indeed, accountants in the early 1900s "fiercely resisted efforts to impose strict accounting standards". It was not until the US Securities Acts' of [[Securities Act of 1933|1933]] and [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934|1934]]—both heavily influenced by Kreuger's actions—that generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) began to be established. Only in the 1970s and 1980s were auditors forced to accept more responsibility for the veracity of  financial statements but loopholes continued to exist (and probably still do).&lt;ref&gt;''Called to Account: Fourteen Financial Frauds that Shaped the American Accounting Profession'', Routledge, 2008 by Paul M. Clikeman, (Routledge, 2008) pp.3, 9, 13, 17,20, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Dishonesty was part of Ivar's behaviour almost from the beginning of his career. In the first loan for a match monopoly, Ivar's brother Torsten negotiated with Dr. Marjam Glowacki, a senior Polish finance ministry official. After the documents were signed Ivar decided that it might be useful in the future to replicate Dr. Glowacki's signature. He ordered a rubber stamp that would produce a facsimile should he need it in the future. He did not use it; however, from then on he had rubber stamps made of official signatures of almost all his match deals.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.74&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Mostly, Ivar had been skirting the edges of legal rules, to preserve his own flexibility."''&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c.2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.159&lt;/ref&gt; But the forgery of  Italian bonds was outright fraud. A lithographer
who had printed share certificates for Ivar made 42 Italian bills, which Ivar signed with the names of G. Boselli (an official in the Ministry of Finance) and A. Mosconi, (the Minister of Finance). It has never been explained why these forgeries were so crude. He even misspelled Boselli's name several times.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.161–162&lt;/ref&gt; Ivar kept them in his safe for almost two years. They would have been worth between c. 100 to 140 million dollars, if they had not been forged. (About 1.5 to 2.1 billion in today's money) When he was desperate for funds, Ivar
tried to use them claiming that they were genuine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.74,185,191. ''Called to Account: Fourteen Financial Frauds that Shaped the American Accounting Profession, Routledge, 2008'' by Paul M. Clikeman, (Routledge, 2008) p.27. Excerpts are at:
https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nn0G1wT8cagC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=related:bexGr3avgIsJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;ots=KdIOMYm6Tu&amp;sig=147GGhtVx7ieJfp68pXjr5wS0oU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet it would be a mistake to conclude that Ivar was nothing but a crook. Reality was more nuanced. For one thing disclosure rules in his days were much less stringent. Many corporations refused to reveal details for fear competitors would gain an advantage. (At least that was the claim often made.)  Some firms did not even publish quarterly results. Ivar, too, was very secretive and not only with investors. When he was on the verge of hiring somebody he usually asked: "Can he keep a secret?" He was also very fond of quoting his motto for success: "Silence, more silence, and still more silence."&lt;ref&gt;''Kreuger Genius And Swindler'' by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960, p.86)&lt;/ref&gt; Also one cannot fault him for the speculative fever in the 1920s. Without the hunger for ever larger profits many of Ivar's schemes would not have been possible. Incidentally this facilitated a transfer of capital from the USA to Europe where it was, often desperately, needed. He sold shares in the USA worth 250 million dollars (equivalent to c. 3.75 billion today) and transferred almost all of it to his holding company in Liechtenstein, Continental Investment Corporation. Shareholders of International Match had given him authority to do this so there was nothing wrong with it. There was also a tax advantage because of the advantageous deal he had negotiated with Liechtenstein. But Ivar did it above all to have the flexibility to manipulate balance sheets and financial statements so they would look more attractive to investors as well as helping him – to some extent - pay the high dividends of Swedish Match and [[Kreuger &amp; Toll]]. He got the nickname "Saviour of Europe" by lending about $400 million (equivalent to c. $6 billion today) to rebuild their shattered economies after World War I.&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"/&gt; He invented new financial instruments to help him raise funds and, of course, make him money. Indeed, many consider Ivar to be the father of modern financial schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/01/10-questions-for-the-financial-crisis-commission/%20]&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar Rydbeck, his Swedish banker, said Ivar was the third richest man in the world. He, however, claimed "money as such means nothing to me".&lt;ref&gt;''The Match King'' by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.188&lt;/ref&gt; Ivar was also a successful speculator for much of his life making lots of money until shortly before the end. Trying to support the collapsing share prices of many of his companies (including ways which were—if not illegal—questionable, e.g. using straw men for share transactions. In the case of his acquisition of [[Diamond Match Company|Diamond Match]] shares it was clearly illegal because of anti-trust laws.)

He controlled many legitimate, profitable businesses, some of which still exist to this day. (Examples include [[Swedish Match]], [[Ericsson]], [[Boliden AB]], - Europe's largest gold mine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boliden.se/ -  click on in English &amp;gt; About &amp;gt; History and navigate to ABOUT BOLIDEN / History for info on Kreuger's involvement in the company]&lt;/ref&gt; -, [[Skandinaviska Banken]] and [[SKF]].) "Kreuger &amp; Toll kept few accounting records despite the fact that it was a multibillion-dollar international conglomerate with over 400 subsidiaries."&lt;ref&gt;''Kreuger Reborn'' by Kumar, Gaurav, Flesher Dale L., Flesher Tonya, Kreuger Reborn p.2 available at: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1025525 ''Kreuger: Genius and Swindler'' by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960, p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt;

The total of bank loans and proceeds of the sale of securities was about $650 million (almost $10 billion in today's money). At the time of his death in 1932, assets were worth about $200 million, which was half of what Kreuger claimed in financial statements. Some of the shrinkage was due to depressed prices but much went into paying dividends from capital over the years.&lt;ref&gt;''Kreuger Genius And Swindler'' by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960, p.7)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swedish Match]]'s bankruptcy cost American investors over $250 million ($3.75 billion today).&lt;ref&gt;''Called to Account: Fourteen Financial Frauds that Shaped the American Accounting Profession'' by Paul M.

'''Juan Anacleto Araneta''' (July 13, 1852 – October 3, 1924), was a pioneer sugar farmer and revolutionary leader during the [[Negros Revolution]].

==Early life==
Juan was born to Romualdo Araneta and Agüeda Torres in Molo, [[Iloilo]], [[Philippines]]. The Aranetas later moved to [[Negros Island|Negros]] and settled there permanently.

At the age of 19, he was brought by his brother-in-law, Pedro Sarmiento, to [[Manila]] and was enrolled at the [[Ateneo de Manila University|Ateneo Municipal de Manila]]. He showed great promise in school, earning medals of merit for his endeavours. He graduated with a ''perito mercantil'' degree, equivalent to today's bachelor's degree in Commerce. His contemporaries in school included [[José Rizal]], [[Jose Alejandrino]], [[Cayetano Arellano]], and [[Apolinario Mabini]], among others.

Upon returning to Molo, he was elected ''Capitan del Pueblo'', like his father before him. The friars in the province, however, had become suspicious of him, and only the high regard and respect of the people of [[Bago City|Bago]] and the other towns in the province prevented his summary liquidation by the Spanish authorities.

In 1891, Juan went to [[Europe]] with his friend, Don Claudio Reina after his wife died. He had the opportunity to meet many of the Filipino leaders then living in [[Madrid]], [[London]] and [[Paris]]. As a consequence, the Spanish authorities were even more antagonistic toward him upon his return. As a result, he lost the land that he and his sisters inherited from their parents. He had to take his family to the slopes of [[Mt. Kanlaon]] where they started to farm anew. He brought many gadgets to his ''hacienda'' in Dinapalan. One popular tale was his use of a [[telescope]] to supervise his laborers in the vast hacienda from afar. It became a legend among the common people that he had magical powers, but in reality, he was only able to see their actions by using the telescope.

==Altercation with Spanish authorities==
His travels in Europe made him aware of the use of new machinery and tools for agriculture. He imported a sugar mill from [[England]] and had it installed in his [[hacienda]] in Dinapalan. From time to time, he bought farm implements like a baler for [[abaca]], a [[rice]] thresher, and plows of improved models.

This preference for modern agricultural tools, however, became his undoing. The Spanish authorities grew suspicious of the boatloads of cargo being unloaded near his land in Lumangub. He was arrested and brought to Concordia in January 1897. He was later brought to [[Himamaylan]] and then again to Ilog which was then the capital of the province. His diary hinted that even in prison, there were plans to organize the revolutionary forces in the province. There were annotations showing that he made contact with other leaders in the province. He was finally brought to [[Bacolod City|Bacolod]] where he was released in October 1897.

==The Negros Revolution==
{{main|Negros Revolution}}
On November 5, 1898, ([[Negros Revolution|Cinco de Noviembre]]) a messenger from [[Talisay City, Negros Occidental|Talisay]] brought news that the revolutionaries and the ''cazadores'' were already engaged in skirmishes. At about 1:00 in the afternoon, the revolutionary forces in Bago started marching toward Bacolod. They had only three firearms among them: a [[Remington Arms|Remington]] rifle, a [[Mauser]] rifle, and a [[shotgun]]. General Araneta, who led the rebel forces, told his men to cut [[Nypa fruticans|nipa]] stems or ''pagong'', and to shoulder these as if these were rifles. In case they contact with each other, the password was to be ''utod'' (brother) in [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]].

The Spanish authorities in Bacolod, who saw the rebels marching toward the town, thought that they wanted to surrender their arms. Surprised, the Spaniards were advised by the rebels to surrender in order to avert bloodshed. The Spaniards readily agreed. It was only when Bacolod was already in the hands of the rebels, that the Spanish reinforcements from Iloilo arrived.

The Spanish Governor of Negros Island, Don Isidro Castro, surrendered to forces under Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta at Bacolod on 6 Nov. 1898.&lt;ref name=Foreman&gt;Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|476}}

==The Republic of Negros==
:''See: [[Republic of Negros#History|Republic of Negros]]''
A cantonal form of government was set up in Bacolod with General Aniceto Lacson as President and General Juan Araneta serving as Secretary of War. When the Americans arrived in Iloilo, he counseled the cantonal government to submit to the American forces. This was vehemently opposed and ridiculed by his companions-in-arms. His idea was finally adopted, however, and the Americans occupied Negros without encountering hostilities.

==Family==
Juan Araneta was married four times to four different women:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =The Araneta Family Tree | url=http://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=araneta_lineage&amp;id=I243 | accessdate = 2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 1904, he was appointed as one of the commissioners to the [[Saint Louis Exposition (annual fair)|St. Louis Exposition]] where he put on exhibit over a thousand varieties of rice, samples of cacao, beans, abaca, and many other agricultural crops from [[Negros (island)|Negros]] and [[Panay]]. All these exhibits were of exceptional merit; as a result, he was awarded with gold and silver medallions. He also developed Buenos Aires Mountain Resort for his large family to use and enjoy. He later gave this property to his daughter Maria A. Matti.

He kept in touch with new developments in agriculture, either in tools and implements or crops. He tried to grow different crops on his farm and even planted trees that were not endemic to Negros. When the [[Ma-ao Sugar Central]] was organized, he became one of its founders. He lent to the corporation the titles of his land to back up the new enterprise. He prevailed upon his lessees to plant wide areas of land to sugar cane. Unfortunately, "Don Juan" did not live long enough to realize his dream of seeing the sugar central freed of its obligations. He died on October 3, 1924, leaving behind a large family of about 25 members.

The '''Juneau Downtown Historic District''' encompasses the historic commercial heart of the city of [[Juneau, Alaska]].  It extends along South Franklin Street, from the cruise terminal in the south to Second Street in the north, and westward along Second and Front Streets to Main Street.  This area was the center of Juneau's economic activity from its founding in 1880 as a gold mining camp, through its growth into an urbanized area in the early 20th century, including its eventual designation as the territorial capital in 1906.  In the early days of the gold mining camp business was centered in the area bounded by Front, Main and South Franklin, with maritime activities in particular eventually extending further south along the shore of the Gastineau Channel by making land using mine tailings.  The early buildings have relatively utilitarian architecture, while those of the early 20th century are somewhat more ornate, with Late Victorian details.  Notable buildings from this period include the [[Alaska Steam Laundry]] (174 S. Franklin) and the [[Valentine Building (Juneau, Alaska)|Valentine Building]] (202 Front Street).&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=94000603}}|title=NRHP nomination for Juneau Downtown Historic District|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district, comprising 42 contributing properties, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8050">'''Karina Constantino David''' is a former chairperson of the [[Civil Service Commission (Philippines)|Civil Service Commission of the Philippines]]. She also served as the chairperson of the Career Executive Service Board, a government entity supervising the top management personnel of the Philippine government. She presently sits as a member of the [[Government Service Insurance System]] (GSIS) Board of Trustees.

David is the wife of Professor Emeritus [[Randy David]] of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] and daughter of the renowned historian [[Renato Constantino]]. She is also the mother of journalist [[Kara David]] and UP Diliman geology professor Dr. Carlos Primo David.

==Early life and education==
Daughter to historian [[Renato Constantino]], David earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Sociology]] at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] in 1966. She completed academic requirements in the [[Master of Arts]] in Sociology program (orals lacking) from the same university in 1968. She obtained a [[Master of Arts]] in Economic and Social Studies from The [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in [[England]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="CSC"&gt;Record profile, Civil Service Commission, 2003......&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil service chief==
David was appointed by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] on February 23, 2001, as chairperson of the Civil Service Commission, succeeding Corazon Alma G. De Leon.&lt;ref name="CSC"/&gt;

On January 22, 2008, Karina Constantino-David stated that 40% of 3,000 government officials, including Cabinet officials, are unqualified to hold their positions: "these officials, consisting of managers, directors, assistant secretaries and undersecretaries, do not have the appropriate educational background and skills to perform their duties well; they don't have the correct educational skills and appropriate background plus experience to perform their respective duties well."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=106449  Abs-Cbn Interactive, CSC: 40% of govt officials unqualified for posts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080123-114181/CSC-chief-David-chides-Arroyo-on-appointments  newsinfo.inquirer.net, CSC chief David chides Arroyo on appointments]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

David drew flak from government workers for her comments on the qualifications of presidential appointees. In a statement, the Convergence of Vigilant, Empowered and Responsible Government Employees said David failed to professionalize the bureaucracy after serving almost as long as President Arroyo, and that her comments were "very unprofessional and uncalled for". Babae sa Kaunlaran, another organization of government workers, also criticized the statement as highly political. Public criticism centered on the fact that David's husband, broadcaster Randy David, is a known anti-Arroyo critic associated with leftist groups.

Press Secretary [[Ignacio Bunye]], meanwhile, said that David's "sweeping generalizations in a luncheon speech do a disservice to the over one million civil servants, both career and appointed, who work diligently each and every day to serve the people of the Philippines."

==Early work==
David started working in 1966 as a Teaching Assistant in the Department of Sociology of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]]. She became an assistant professor from 1970 to 1975. In 1986, she was appointed undersecretary in the [[Department of Social Welfare and Development (Philippines)|Department of Social Welfare and Development]]. From 1975, David has been a professor of community development at the University's College of Social Work and Community Development.&lt;ref name="CSC"/&gt;

==Leadership experience==
David chaired the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) from 1998 to 1999. In this capacity, she made housing and urban development goals and strategies, monitored targets, and broadened private sector participation. She also proposed legislation and made policies for asset disposition. She was heading the boards of all shelter agencies in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="CSC"/&gt;
 
From 1997 to 1998, David was the president of Eco-Shelter, Inc., a private company involved in shelter construction and development of alternative housing materials.&lt;ref name="CSC"/&gt;
 
She was also the executive director of Harnessing Self-Reliant Initiatives and Knowledge (HASIK) from 1988 to 1998. HASIK is a non-government organization involved in urban poor empowerment, gender development, protection of children and adolescents, and housing and livelihood projects.&lt;ref name="CSC"/&gt;
 
From 1999 until her appointment to the CSC, David was president of Property Solutions, Inc., a private company that offers innovative and alternative interventions to various property issues.&lt;ref name="CSC"/&gt;

==Sociocivic affairs==
David held leadership posts at the Caucus of Development NGO Networks (president, 1989–1998); Women's Action Network for Development (vice chairperson, 1990–1998); Partnership of Philippine Support Service Agencies (chairperson, 1989–1995); Independent Commission on Population and the Quality of Life (commissioner, 1992–1996); and People's Forum for Habitat II (national convenor, 1995–1996). David also served as consultant to poverty and women's program policy planning of the Asian and Pacific Development Centre.&lt;ref name="CSC"/&gt;
 
In 1989, she was a consultant for the women's mission of GTZ or Deutsche Gessellscahft Fur Technische Zusammenarbeit and the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA).&lt;ref name="CSC"/&gt;

From 1988 to 1989, David was the over-all consultant of the Philippine Development Plan for Women at the [[National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women]] (NCRFW). David rendered consultancy services at the NCRFW from 1995 to 96 for the Philippine Plan for Gender Responsive Development.&lt;ref name="CSC"/&gt;

==Organizational activities==
David is an active member of the Philippine Sociological Society, the Human Development Network, and the Asia-Pacific Development Journal.&lt;ref name="CSC"/&gt;
She is now a trustee of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).

==Singing==
Since 1981, David is the composer and guitarist of ''Inang Laya'', a female duo that performs and records progressive, feminist songs. ''Inang Laya'' has cut a number of albums in the local entertainment scene.&lt;ref name="CSC"/&gt;

==International award==
On April 15, 2008, Karina Constantino-David received the World Bank's 2008 Jit Gill Memorial Award for Outstanding Public Service. David battled "against formidable obstacles to defend meritocracy and improve civil service pay as Chair of the Civil Service Commission of the Philippines until February."&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Anna_Hazare_wins_World_Bank_award/articleshow/2955388.cms  timesofindia.indiatimes.com, Anna Hazare wins World Bank award]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamothe ([[Doctor of Letters|D.Litt.]] in Spanish Language and Literature), the founder of the [[Lope de Vega Institute]], and of [[Gisou Lamothe|Ghislaine Fortuney Lamothe]], a painter, Lamothe was born in [[Port-au-Prince]].

On 1 March 2012, Lamothe was designated as the Prime Minister of Haiti by President Martelly following the resignation of Prime Minister [[Garry Conille]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-5067-haiti-politic-laurent-lamothe-candidat-designated-for-the-position-of-prime-minister.html "Laurent Lamothe candidat designated for the position of Prime Minister"]. Haiti Libre. 1 March 2012. Retrieved on 3 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He successfully served as Prime Minister from March 2012 to December 2014, the longest tenure of any Prime Minister in the last three decades.  During his time in office, Lamothe presided over the design and implementation of an important social policy agenda that targeted the poorest sectors of the Haitian population. Lamothe also presided over the largest infrastructure development in recent history, which included the construction and rehabilitation of schools, public buildings, bridges and roads.

During Lamothe’s tenure as Prime Minister, foreign direct investment increased to the highest level since the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in the mid 1980s. Under his leadership, the government pursued reforms that made Haiti a safer and more business-friendly country with the implementation of a 15-year tax break to companies investing in the island nation.

He also pushed for an increase of the police force by 30 percent. He fought to improve the living conditions of the poorest in Haiti. He implemented social programs that benefited the most vulnerable, he spearheaded the free education program, and promoted good governance by tackling corruption.

He had an impact in the fight against extreme poverty – According to a 2014 World Bank study, from 2012 to 2014, the number of people in extreme poverty in Haiti dropped from 31% to 24% thanks to the social program EDE PEP, which benefited 2 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Extreme poverty drops in Haiti.

Lamothe implemented programs to fight corruption, and improved conditions to facilitate Foreign Direct Investments (FDI).  From 2011 t0 2013, FDI increased by 56% compared to the 2006-2010 period. Along with that, through the GOH’s free education program, elementary school attendance rate rose from 55 to 90%. Close to 1.4 million children between the ages of 6 and 12 now attend school at no charge. He initiated reform policies in the security sector such as supporting the effective coordination of law enforcement agencies and increasing women presence in the police force.

In 2010, Lamothe was largely responsible for the reconstruction of the country after the devastating earthquake. He was instrumental in relocating approximately 1.6 million people from the resulting tent camps, as well as in removing 97% of the rubble that the earthquake caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2013/01/12/haiti-three-years-after-the-quake-theres-good-news-too/|title=Haiti Three Years After the Quake: There’s Good News, Too|last=Ferreira|first=Tim Padgett with Susana|work=Time|access-date=2017-04-20|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years after the earthquake, kidnappings had decreased by 55 per cent; public investments had increased by 8 per cent; and there were almost 200 projects dedicated to rebuilding of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2014/01/12/haitian_earthquake_daunting_challenges_remain_four_years_after_disaster.html|title=Haitian earthquake: Daunting challenges remain four years after disaster {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Hurricane Matthew struck Haiti. After the hurricane, Lamothe helped rebuild communities in Haiti through the Dr. Louis G. Lamothe Foundation, which he started in memory of his late father. Lamothe is working to improve fishing and agriculture in Anse du Clerc so as to help the citizens make sustainable incomes. He has rebuilt a school in Nan Panyol, and is working on many more projects with the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/article-20346-haiti-social-mission-de-la-flgl-pour-relancer-l-economie-de-la-peche-a-anse-du-clerc.html|title=Haïti - Social : Mission de la FLGL pour relancer l'économie de la pêche à Anse du Clerc - HaitiLibre.com : Toutes les nouvelles d’Haiti 7/7|work=HaitiLibre.com|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 November 2014, Laurent Lamothe, received in Miami, the Innovative Leader of the Year Award, «Bravo Awards» established by the Latin Trade Group, to underline the initiatives and actions of the leaders of the region to develop their country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-12462-haiti-politic-lamothe-in-miami-to-receive-the-bravo-awards.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Having grown up in a country affected by poverty and lack of resources at all levels, he developed throughout his life a deep sense of social responsibility and a strong tendency to assist those in need. Lamothe is a pragmatist who, during his time in office, emphasized practical solutions over partisan politics to address the urgent needs of Haiti.

On 14 December 2014, Lamothe resigned his position as Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="reasons"/&gt;

“My Government’s top priority was to serve these vulnerable citizens who had always been forgotten by traditional politicians and the political class.”—Laurent Lamothe, January 2015.

Lamothe obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Barry University in Miami and in 1996 earned his MBA with Honors from University of St. Thomas.  In 1998, Lamothe founded Global Voice Group SA (GVG) considered today a world-leader in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) solutions for telecoms and fiscal authorities. He served as CEO of GVG until he stepped down to assume his public sector duties with the Government of Haiti. GVG earned the 2014 Frost &amp; Sullivan Best Practices Award for its outstanding innovation in the domain of IT solutions designed for governments and regulatory authorities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/press-release.pag?docid=289235777&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamothe was named as the Ernst &amp; Young’s “Entrepreneur of the Year” title in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.billionaire.com/interviews/conscious-entrepreneurs/1053/haiti-faces-up-to-a-brighter-future-an-interview-with-laurent-lamothe|title=Project Name|website=www.billionaire.com|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamothe brought to the office of Prime Minister an entrepreneurial spirit and dynamism that earned him recognition in November 2014, from the Latin Trade magazine for his innovative skills, naming him the year’s Innovative Leader of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/latin-trade-announces-haitian-prime-minister-laurent-lamothe-as-the-bravo-2014-innovative-leader-of-the-year-275628931.html|title=Latin Trade Announces Haitian Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe As The BRAVO 2014 Innovative Leader Of The Year|last=Group|first=Latin Trade|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin Trade noted that Lamothe “helped establish a paradigm shift for Haiti as a destination for investment, rather than simply for humanitarian aid”. Lamothe also received the National Alliance for the Advancement of Haitian Professionals (NAAHP) Golden Honors Award for his outstanding work, integrity and commitment to Haiti and its Diaspora in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/12/prweb13123691.htm|title=Former Republic of Haiti Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe Receives NAAHP Golden Honors Award|newspaper=PRWeb|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Social Media Person of the Year award in 2015 by the Social Media Association of Haiti.

In July 2015, Lamothe created [[LSL World Initiative]], a private enterprise providing solutions to governments in implementing their own funding mechanisms to help them deliver sustainable development programs in line with their needs and priorities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lslwi.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Lamothe founded the Dr. [[Dr. Louis G. Lamothe Foundation|Louis G Lamothe Foundation (LGLF)]] in honour and memory of his father Louis G Lamothe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-16070-haiti-social-laurent-lamothe-create-a-foundation-to-fight-against-poverty-and-exclusion-in-haiti.html|title=Haiti - Social : Laurent Lamothe create a foundation to fight against poverty and exclusion in Haiti - HaitiLibre.com : Haiti news 7/7|website=HaitiLibre.com|access-date=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Foundation will concentrate on the strategies to lead Haiti to emerging country status by 2041. With his lead, after Hurricane Matthew struck Haiti, the Dr. Louis G. Lamothe Foundation has been working in Anse du Clerc to help the town recover from the damages. The Foundation aims to rehabilitate the fishing village and revive its economic activity by repairing the damaged houses and facilitating the acquisition of fishing equipment, among others. The Foundation also aims to make various seeds for agriculture available to the farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fondationlgl.com|title=Dr Louis G Lamothe Foundation {{!}} Knowledge for transformation|website=fondationlgl.com|access-date=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether providing services as an accountant or auditor, a [[certified public accountant]] (CPA) owes a duty of care to the client and third parties who foreseeably rely on the accountant's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional liability of  accountants and auditors|url=http://www.accaglobal.com/content/dam/acca/global/PDF-members/2012/2012p/Prof_liability.pdf|website=ACCA|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accountants can be sued [[negligence]] in the performance of their duties, and for [[fraud]].

[[Certified Public Accountants]] (CPAs) opinions affect their clients and their judgments can further affect investors, stockholders, firm creditors, or even partners. Large public accounting firms perform thousands of audits annually. Ultimately they will find unmodified reports on financial statements that could appear to be misleading.  If CPAs fail to modify the audit report on financial statements that are materially misstated, investors and firm creditors may experience substantial losses.

As a result of litigation against public accounting firms, amounts in excess of $300 million have been awarded to these parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ray |last1=Whittington |first2=Kurt |last2=Pany |title=Principles of Auditing and Other Assurance Services |edition=18 |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishers |year=2012 |page=107 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;    Even with professional liability insurance to cover such losses, occasionally the total amounts granted to plaintiffs have surpassed the maximum amounts the insurance can or will cover. If investors sustain losses they will attempt to recover them as long as the price to bring suit is low and there is a chance for recovery. Any public accounting firm may find itself in litigation no matter how careful the CPAs were. CPAs are often required to make further payments for investors and creditors uninsured losses. The firm itself can make these payments, as can personnel who have worked on the engagement.

== Sources of CPAs' liability ==
In the United States, CPAs have common law liability and statutory law liability. Common law liability arises from negligence, breach of contract, and fraud. Statutory law liability is the obligation that comes from a certain statute or a law, which is applied, to society. Recoveries from these liabilities vary by their source or “theory”. Some of these theories are:
* [[Privity]]: CPAs and their clients enter into a contract with an agreement to perform certain services. Liability occurs when there is a breach of contract.&lt;ref name="wp108"&gt;Whittington and Pany 108&lt;/ref&gt;  This applies to the CPA if they don’t perform what they stated in the engagement letter and the client suffers damages.
* [[Professional negligence in English law|Professional negligence]]: [[Negligence]] may be viewed as “failure to exercise due professional care".&lt;ref name="wp108"/&gt;  Both clients and third parties can sue CPAs for the tort of negligence, which is a wrongful act, injury, or damage for which a civil action can be brought. Negligence can be referred to as ordinary negligence and gross negligence. Ordinary negligence is defined as failure of duty in accordance with applicable standards, and gross negligence is the lack of concern for the likelihood that injuries will result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Negligence and Tort Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/negligence.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fraud]]: Fraud is defined to be a misrepresentation of a material fact by a person who is aware of his or her actions, with the intention of misleading the other party with the other party injured as a result. 
* [[Statutory liability]]: CPAs have statutory liability under both federal and state securities laws. Statutory liability provides cover for defense costs, fines and penalties charged against the firm. Under statutory law, an auditor can be held civilly or criminally liable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Statutory Law Summary Diagram |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishers |chapter= 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common law ==
=== Liability to clients ===
CPAs have an obligation to their clients to exercise due professional care. With an engagement letter, it provides the client and other third parties with rights of recovery. Therefore, if the CPAs are not performing within the agreement set forth in the contract this will be considered a breach of contract. The clients may also claim negligence against the CPAs if the work was performed but contained errors or was not done professionally. This is considered a tort action.

In order to recover from an auditor under common law, the client must prove:&lt;ref&gt;Whittington and Pany 110&lt;/ref&gt;
* Duty of care
* Breach of Duty
* Losses
* Causation

CPAs may defend against a breach of contract if they can prove that the client’s loss occurred because of factors other than negligence by the auditors. If the auditor proves the loss resulted from causes other than the auditor’s negligence, a client may be accused of contributory negligence. If a state follows the doctrine of contributory negligence, the auditor may eliminate their liability to the client based on contributory negligence by the client. Many states do not follow this doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Whittington and Pany 109-110&lt;/ref&gt; Most states permit a jury to assess the fault and apply the correct percentage of fault to the parties involved. This is called comparative negligence.

=== Liability to third parties ===
Not all suits brought to an auditor are from a direct client. Third parties can also sue an auditor for fraud, in which case a contract (privity) is necessary. In order for a third party to prevail in a case, there are a number of things they must prove. First, the third party must prove that the auditor had a duty to exercise due care. Second, the third party must prove that the auditor breached that duty knowingly. Third, the third party must prove that the auditor's breach was the direct reason for the loss. Finally, the third party must prove that they suffered an actual loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. James |last=Gormley |title=The foreseen, the Foreseeable, and beyond-Accuntants’ Liability to Nonclients, (Section Hall Law Review 14, 1984) |pages=530–531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Ultramares'' (known user) approach ====
In order for the court to decide if the auditor's duty actually extended to the third party, for ordinary negligence, there are four legal approaches each state could follow. First is the Privity approach, which states the auditor is liable to a third party if an existence of a contract is in existence.{{dubious|date=December 2013}} This approach was established in ''[[Ultramares Corporation v. Touche]]'' and is the most limiting approach in respect to scope.&lt;ref&gt;Gormely 536&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ultramares'' occurred in 1933 where the defendant CPA distributed an unqualified opinion on the balance sheet of a company. In addition to the CPAs estimations, Ultramares wrote out several loans to the company shortly before the company declared bankruptcy. Ultramares sued the CPA for ordinary negligence. The New York Court of Appeals ruled that CPAs are held accountable for ordinary negligence to their clients and third parties who identify themselves as users of the CPAs reports.&lt;ref&gt;Whittington and Pany 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The "near privity" approach was established in ''Credit Alliance Corp. v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Company''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Credit Corp. v. Andersen &amp; Co.|vol= 65|reporter= N.Y.2d|opinion= 536|pinpoint= |court= |date= 1985|url= http://www.leagle.com/decision/198560165NY2d536_1546.xml/CREDIT%20CORP.%20v.%20ANDERSEN%20&amp;%20CO.|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach states that the auditor has liability under ordinary negligence if the third party is known to be using the financial statements and there has been some sort of direct communication between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;Gormely 541&lt;/ref&gt;  An example could be the auditor directly giving a report to the bank that will be providing the loan for an actual client.

==== Restatement of Torts (foreseen user) approach ====
The "foreseen" or "Restatement Standard" approach was established by the [[American Law Institute]]’s (ALI) ''[[Restatement of Torts, Second|Second Restatement of Law of Torts]]''. With this approach the auditor is liable to all third parties in which their reliance is foreseen even if the auditor doesn't know the third party.&lt;ref&gt;Gormley 547&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach came about due to ''Rusch Factors, Inc. v. Levin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Rusch Factors, Inc. v. Levin|vol= 284|reporter= F.Supp.|opinion= 85|pinpoint= |court= |date= 1968|url= http://www.leagle.com/decision/1968369284FSupp85_1362.xml/RUSCH%20FACTORS,%20INC.%20v.%20LEVIN|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the CPA was found accountable for ordinary negligence to the third party who had not been specifically identified but the CPA was aware that the financial statements were to be used by this party.

==== ''Rosenblum'' (foreseeable user) approach ====
The "reasonably foreseeable" approach which was created due to ''Rosenblum v. Adler''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Rosenblum v. Adler|vol= 93|reporter= N.J.|opinion= 324|pinpoint= |court= |date= 1983|url= http://www.leagle.com/decision/198341793NJ324_12.xml/ROSENBLUM%20v.%20ADLER|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is very liberal and broad in terms of scope, unlike the privity approach. This system holds an auditor liable to all third parties that rely on financial statements.&lt;ref&gt;Gormley 552&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statutory liability ==
The definition of statutory law is written law, created by state or federal legislative bodies. Lawsuits brought against auditors based on statutory provisions differ from those under common law. While common law can vary from state to state and has the ability to evolve or change, statutory law is constrained to a greater degree by the underlying law. The two most important laws relating to auditors’ liability are the [[Securities Act of 1933]] and the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]. CPAs must also be concerned with the application of the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) and with each state’s [[blue sky law]]s (which regulate the issuance and trading of securities within a certain state).&lt;ref&gt;Whittington and Pany 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The Securities Act of 1933 requires a company to register with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). In order to complete registration, the company must include audited financial statements and numerous other disclosures. If the registration statement was to be found materially misstated, both the company and its auditors may be held liable. Those who initially purchase a security offered for sale are the only ones protected by the 1933 Act.  These security purchasers, known as the plaintiffs, only need to prove a loss was constant and that the registration statement was misleading. They do not need to prove that they relied upon the registration or that the auditors were negligent. In order for an auditor to avoid liability, they must provide proof that the audit was performed with due diligence, the plaintiff’s losses were not caused by misstated financial statements, the plaintiffs knew of the misstatement at the time the securities were purchased, or the statute of limitations had expired (one year after the discovery of the misstatement, but no more than three years after the security was offered to the public).&lt;ref&gt;Whittington and Pany 114&lt;/ref&gt;  The due diligence defense is the defense that most auditors raise, even though it is difficult for auditors to prove their innocence.  The standing precedent on interpretation of due diligence is Escott v. BarChris Construction Corporation, decided in 1968.

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires all companies under SEC jurisdiction to file an annual audit and have quarterly review of financial statements. While the 1933 Act creates liability only to those investors involved in the initial distribution of public offerings, the 1934 Act increases that responsibility to subsequent purchasers and sellers of the stock. This act provides absolute protection to original and subsequent purchasers and sellers of securities. These plaintiffs must prove that:

#there was a substantial loss,
#the financial statements were misleading, and
#they relied upon the financial statements.

According to ''Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|425|185|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; plaintiffs must show proof of scienter (the intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud). In order to avoid liability, auditors must prove they are normally able to establish “good faith” unless they have been guilty of gross negligence or fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Whittington and Pany 115&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the auditors may rely on causation, meaning that the losses experienced by the plaintiffs were caused by factors other than the auditor’s behavior.

=== Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act ===
In 1970, Congress established the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO). This act was established as a means of making sure that CPAs who may have been involved with any illegal mob or racketeering activity were brought to justice. The RICO Act allows for triple damages in civil cases that were brought under the act. This later became an issue of liability in ''Reves vs. Ernst &amp; Young''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|494|56|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a significant court case, in that, the court decided that for accountants to be liable for damages of a company under this act, they must have participated in the operation or management of the organization. This also led to the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] which essentially eliminated securities fraud as a civil action under RICO unless prior conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Whittington and Pany 117&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal liability under the Securities Acts ===
The ''Continental Vending'' case (also known as ''United States v. Simon'')&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|397|594|1970}}, vacating {{cite court |litigants= United States v. Simon|vol= 425|reporter= F.2d|opinion= 796|pinpoint= |court= 2d Cir.|date= 1969|url= https://www.casetext.com/case/united-states-v-simon-9#.U08tE1dgz90|accessdate= |quote=}}, discussed in {{cite journal|author1=Ronald M. Mano|author2=Matthew Mouritsen|author3=Ryan Pace|title = Principles-Based Accounting:  It’s Not New, It’s Not the Rule, It’s the Law|journal = The CPA Journal|volume = 76|issue = 2|year = 2006|pages=60{{endash}}62|url = http://www.nysscpa.org/printversions/cpaj/2006/206/p60.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; has set the precedent of severe charges for accountants.  In this case, the U.S. court of appeals convicted three CPAs of gross negligence. Although the CPAs had proof to establish that they complied with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the U.S. generally accepted accounting standards, Mano states that the district court judge instructed the jury that mere compliance with professional accounting standards was not a complete defense. This led to the conviction of the three CPAs, who were later pardoned by President [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Floyd Norris|title = An Old Case Is Returning to Haunt Auditors|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/01/business/an-old-case-is-returning-to-haunt-auditors.html?ref=floydnorris|date = March 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the accounting standards and principles evolve, it is essential for those in regulation, of litigation and in the accounting profession to be aware of the principles and the potential risks affiliated with the system concerning liability. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) along with the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB) have implemented consequences for those who are involved in auditing fraud and any other illegal or unethical behavior in the field. In 1995, the SEC established the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] which in essence mandated auditors to have even stricter guidelines as they pertains to any fraudulent or misleading behavior of their clients.&lt;ref&gt;Whittington and Pany 119&lt;/ref&gt;  This act simply states that the auditors must promptly report any illegal acts of its clients to the company’s board of directors and if severe enough, to the SEC. According to the guidelines of this Act, auditors are relieved of sanctions if they report required information about clients to the SEC in a timely manner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4462">A '''line splice''' is a special type of connection of [[electrical cable]]s ('''electrical splice''') or [[optical fiber]]s ('''optical splice''') in [[telecommunication technology]].

Splices are often housed in [[Sleeve (construction)|sleeve]]s to protect against external influences.

[[Image:Kabelmuffe Blei2 600 565.jpg|thumb|Insulating sleeves]]

The splicing of copper wires happens in the following steps:

* The cores are laid one above the other at the junction.
* The wires are wrapped two to three times around each other ([[Transposition (telecommunications)|twisting]]).
* The core insulation is removed.
* The bare veins on a length of about 3&amp;nbsp;cm "strangle" or "twist". In some cases, the strangulation is soldered.
* To isolate the splice, an insulating sleeve made of paper or plastic is pushed over it.

The splicing of copper wires is mainly used on paper insulated wires.

LSA techniques (LSA: soldering, screwing and stripping free) are used to connect copper wires, making the copper wires faster and easier to connect. LSA techniques include:

* Wire connection sleeves (AVH = Adernverbindungshülsen) and other crimp connectors. The two wires to be connected are inserted into the AVH without being stripped, which is then compressed with special pliers. The about 2&amp;nbsp;cm long AVH consist of contact, pressure and insulation.
* For wire connection strips (AVL = Adernverbindungsleisten) several pairs of wires (10 = AVL10 or 20 = AVL20) are inserted, the strip is then closed with a lid and pressed together with a hydraulic press, which ensures the connection.

=={{anchor|Optical splice}}Splicing of glass fibers==

[[Image:Www.lwl-glasfaser-spleissen.de.jpg|thumb|Splicing of glass fibers by thermal [[fusion splice]]. Fiber optic cable sleeve]]
[[Image:Fiber Splice.jpg|thumb|Fiber optic cable splicer]]

[[Fiber-optic cable]]s are spliced using a special arc-splicer, with installation cables connected at their ends to respective "pigtails" - short individual fibers with [[fiber-optic connector]]s at one end. The splicer precisely adjusts the light-guiding cores of the two ends of the glass fibers to be spliced. The adjustment is done fully automatically in modern devices, whereas in older models this is carried out manually by means of micrometer screws and microscope. An experienced splicer can precisely position the fiber ends within a few seconds. Subsequently, the fibers are fused together (welded) with an electric arc. Since no additional material is added, such as gas welding or soldering, this is called a "[[fusion splice]]".

Depending on the quality of the splicing process, attenuation values at the splice points are achieved by 0.3&amp;nbsp;dB, with good splices also below 0.02&amp;nbsp;dB. For newer generation devices, alignment is done automatically by motors. Here one differentiates core and jacket centering. At core centering (usually [[single-mode fiber]]s), the fiber cores are aligned. A possible core offset with respect to the jacket is corrected. In the jacket centering (usually in multimode fibers), the fibers are adjusted to each other by means of electronic image processing in front of the splice.

When working with good equipment, the damping value is according to experience at max. 0.1&amp;nbsp;dB. Measurements are made by means of special measuring devices including [[optical time-domain reflectometry]] (OTDR). A good splice should have an attenuation of less than 0.3&amp;nbsp;dB over the entire distance. Finished fiber optic splices are housed in splice boxes.

One differentiates:&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;

'''LucidEra''' was an on-demand (aka [[Software as a service|SaaS]]) [[business intelligence]] (BI) solution provider. On June 22, 2009, it was announced that LucidEra would cease operations by the end of June 2009.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid91_gci1359897,00.html |title=SaaS BI vendor LucidEra to shut down |publisher=TechTarget |first=Jeff |last=Kelly |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
LucidEra was founded in 2005 by Ken Rudin, John Sichi, and Tai Tran.&lt;ref name="Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eigenbase.org/foundation.html |title=Foundation |publisher=The Eigenbase Project |accessdate=2008-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lucidera.com/company/executive_team.php |title=Executive Team |publisher=LucidEra |accessdate=2008-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204075754/http://www.lucidera.com/company/executive_team.php#tina |archive-date=2008-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Series A funding was led by [[Benchmark Capital]] and Matrix Partners. In 2007, LucidEra secured Series B funding led by Crosslink Capital.

The company's CEO, Ken Rudin, summarizes the vision: "Our ultimate goal is to be to BI what salesforce.com is to CRM and all kinds of transaction applications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=4598 |first=Dan |last=Farber |title=LucidEra opens for business intelligence on demand |work=ZDNet |publisher=CNET Networks |date=2007-03-06 |accessdate=2008-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Salesforce.com]] being a well-known SaaS company).

LucidEra was a privately held company headquartered in [[San Mateo, California]]. LucidEra ceased operations in June 2009.&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt; [[Birst]], and [[GoodData]] are offering safe harbor programs for LucidEra customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birst.com/about/press/06-23-lucidera.shtml |title=Birst Offers "Quick Switch" Program for LucidEra Customers |publisher=Birst |date=2009-06-23 |accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gooddata.com/blog/gooddata-offers-safe-harbor-to-lucidera-customers |title=GoodData Offers Safe Harbor to LucidEra Customers |publisher=GoodData |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2009-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
LucidEra's offering was focused on analytics of CRM and ERP data. However, the analytics applications were not special-purpose built, rather LucidEra developed a generic BI platform, upon which it built vertical solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2007/05/low_rent_etl_an.html |first=Tim |last=Oren |title=Low Rent ETL and Analytics |work=Tim Oren's Due Diligence |date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2008-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's technology was reliant on open source software such as [[JBoss application server|JBoss]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20110710064535/http://forums.bea.com/thread.jspa?threadID=600018569 jrockit dump in clsIsBeingUnloaded in JRockit Newsgroups in Newsgroups&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dojo Toolkit]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dojotoolkit.org/pipermail/dojo-interest/2006-April/006838.html [Dojo-interest&amp;#93; Dynamically loading dojo elements&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221203341/http://dojotoolkit.org/pipermail/dojo-interest/2006-April/006838.html |date=2007-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mondrian OLAP server|Mondrian]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.pentaho.org/pipermail/mondrian/2007-March/000220.html [Mondrian&amp;#93; Util.lookupCompound MatchType BEFORE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and software from the Eigenbase Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luciddb.org/projectFaq.html LucidDB Project FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; LucidEra is a key contributor to the [[LucidDB]] project, which is hosted by the Eigenbase Foundation. Two of the founders of LucidEra, John Sichi and Tai Tran, are also executives of the Eigenbase Foundation.&lt;ref name="Foundation" /&gt;

Much of the BI technology, particularly the ETL, [[metadata]], and [[Column-oriented DBMS]] technology, was based on source code acquired from Broadbase, and was extensively adapted to a modern SaaS architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esj.com/business_intelligence/article.aspx?EditorialsID=8343 |first=Stephen |last=Swoyer |title=LucidEra Touts Rip-and-Don’t-Replace Outsourced BI |work=Enterprise Systems |publisher=1105 Media |date=2007-03-07 |accessdate=2008-01-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012100702/http://esj.com/business_intelligence/article.aspx?EditorialsID=8343 |archivedate=2007-10-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacquiao has also generated approximately 19.2 million in pay-per-view buys and $1.2 billion in revenue from his 23 pay-per-view bouts.&lt;ref name="Kurt Badenhausen"/&gt; According to ''Forbes'', he was the second highest paid athlete in the world as of 2015.&lt;ref name=forbes2013/&gt;

Pacquiao started boxing at the age of 14 while living in the streets of [[Manila]] and turned professional when he was 16 years old. He had a record of 60-4 as an amateur and currently has a record of 60-7-2 as a professional, with 39 wins by knockout.

"Many of you know me as a legendary boxer, and I'm proud of that," he said. "However, that journey was not always easy. When I was younger, I became a fighter because I had to survive. I had nothing. I had no one to depend on except myself. I realized that boxing was something I was good at, and I trained hard so that I could keep myself and my family alive."&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

In July 2017, after his controversial defeat to [[Jeff Horn]], Pacquiao said: "I love this sport and until the passion is gone, I will continue to fight for God, my family, my fans and my country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manny Pacquiao: Jeff Horn defeat will not stop legend fighting|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/40579411|publisher=BBC|date=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional career===
[[File:Pacquiao - PBA-Kia Sorento player.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Pacquiao warming up before a game]]

On April 17, 2014, Pacquiao announced his intentions to join the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] as the playing coach of [[Kia Sorento (PBA team)|Kia Motors Basketball team]], an incoming expansion team for the PBA's [[2014–15 PBA season|2014–15 season]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ph.news.yahoo.com/pacquiao-picks-17-pba-jersey-number-185521218.html Manny Pacquiao will play at the PBA, picks jersey no. 17]. sports.yahoo.com.ph (November 3, 2010).

Retrieved on May 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he can be the head coach of the incoming team, the league's commissioner, Atty. [[Chito Salud]], clarified that all incoming players should join the PBA draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/364898/sports/basketball/pba-call-them-the-kia-kamao-says-pacquiao|title=PBA: Call them the 'Kia Kamao' says Pacquiao|work=gmanetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacquiao plays basketball as [[cross-training]] to keep himself in shape. He previously played in the semi-professional basketball league, [[Liga Pilipinas]], for the MP-Gensan Warriors, a team that he also owns. He made his debut in the Smart-Liga Pilipinas Conference II in January 16, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =  | first =  | title = Pacquiao can't deliver KO punch for GenSan | publisher = Manila Bulletin Online | date = January 16, 2009 | url = http://96.31.84.32/node/194795 | accessdate = May 16, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120709080351/http://96.31.84.32/node/194795 | archivedate = July 9, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the decision, he was criticized by others specifically online by [[netizens]], saying that Pacquiao could not handle boxing together with [[basketball]]. Pacquiao stated, "It will serve as a challenge for me, they do not know what they are saying, before I have also experienced this before I started boxing, but I proved them wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolante|first1=Mikkel|title=Amid criticism, Manny Pacquiao insists: 'I can coach, play for Kia in PBA'|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/amid-criticism-manny-pacquiao-insists-i-can-coach-play-for-kia-in-pba|website=Interaksyon.com|publisher=Sports5|accessdate=May 22, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526014439/http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/amid-criticism-manny-pacquiao-insists-i-can-coach-play-for-kia-in-pba|archivedate=May 26, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On July 9, 2014, he submitted his application for the upcoming [[2014 PBA draft|rookie draft]] to the commissioner's office. His camp also hopes that the board of governors "respect" his request to be not drafted until Kia's turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PacMan Sasali na sa Rookie Draft (PacMan will pursue going into the rookie draft)|url=http://pba.inquirer.net/47501/pacman-sasali-na-sa-rookie-draft|website=pba.inquirer.net|publisher=Philippine Basketball Association and INQUIRER.net|accessdate=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/pacquiao-apply-pba-drafty Boxing gym to sit next to basketball court as Manny Pacquiao prepares for Kia role, Algieri title defense], Richard Dy, spin.ph, July 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacquiao also owns a team in the [[PBA Developmental League]] (PBA D-League), the MP Hotel Warriors, which debuted in the league's 2014–15 season. He was briefly a co-owner of the [[Pacquiao Powervit Pilipinas Aguilas]] (now known as [[Pilipinas MX3 Kings]]), an [[Asean Basketball League]] team. As well as the founder of [[Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League]].&lt;ref&gt;https://sports.abs-cbn.com/basketball/news/2018/06/13/from-humble-origins-gensan-mpbl-now-nation-wide-league-42890&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kia Picanto (2014–2017)====
Pacquiao was picked 11th overall in the first round of the [[2014 PBA draft]] by the [[Mahindra Enforcer|Kia basketball team]], being the oldest rookie to be drafted in the [[Philippine Basketball Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kia selects Manny Pacquiao with 11th overall pick |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/376188/sports/basketball/2014-pba-draft-kia-selects-manny-pacquiao-with-11th-overall-pick |website=GMAnews.com |publisher=[[GMA News and Public Affairs|GMA News]] |accessdate=August 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2015, Pacquiao tallied his first career point after making a shot in the free-throw on a match they won against the then-[[Purefoods Star Hotshots]]. He never scored again in the game in five minutes of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manny Pacquiao scores first career point in the PBA against Purefoods|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/basketball/440379/manny-pacquiao-scores-first-career-point-in-the-pba-against-purefoods/story/|website=gmanetwork.com/news}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On October 25, 2015, Pacquiao made his first field goal in the [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]] in a 108-94 loss against the [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manny Pacquiao hits 1st career field goal vs. Rain or Shine|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/basketball/541916/manny-pacquiao-hits-1st-career-field-goal-vs-rain-or-shine/story/|website=gmanetwork.com/news|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Del Rosario|first1=Paolo|title=PBA: RoS banks on strong second half to blow by Kia Mahindra|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/sports/2015/10/25/PBA-Philippine-Cup-Rain-or-Shine-Kia-Mahindra-Quinahan-Ahanmisi.html|website=cnnphilippines.com|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 21, 2016, Pacquiao scored a career-high four points in a 97-88 victory against the [[Blackwater Elite]], also sinking the first three-point field goal in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sacamos|first1=Karlo|title=image: http://www.spin.ph/assets/images/www/v2/follow_us/follow_us.jpg   BASKETBALL PBA With surprise three-pointer, Manny Pacquiao surpasses his PBA career high|url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/pba/news/manny-pacquiao-knocks-down-three-pointer-to-surpass-career-total|website=spin.ph|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Pacquiao was supposedly lined-up for the Senate Defenders basketball team in the [[UNTV Cup]] Season 5, but decided that he will not play in the tournament due to his existing contract as a player and coach of Mahindra Enforcer in the PBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/pacquiao-wont-play-in-untv-cup-pineda/282425/|title=Pacquiao won't play in UNTV Cup – Pineda|publisher=[[The Manila Times]]|last=Ramos|first=Josep T.|date=August 27, 2016|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, when Pacquiao's three-year rookie deal as a player with the Picanto expired, the team didn't renew his contract again. Speculations swirled about Pacquiao possibly signing with the [[Blackwater Elite]] after its owner Dioceldo Sy said in an interview that he offered Pacquiao a roster spot and a coaching job. Four weeks later, his coaching contract with the Kia Picanto also expired, effectively making him available in the free agent market both as a coach and a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramos|first1=Gerry|title=Manny Pacquiao parts ways with Kia, stays mum on next PBA step amid offer to join Blackwater|url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/pba/news/manny-pacquiao-parts-ways-with-kia-stays-mum-on-next-pba-step-amid-offer-to-join-blackwater|website=spin.ph|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, Pacquiao took his first lead role in Violett Films' ''Lisensyadong Kamao'' (Licensed Fist).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lisensyadong kamao (2005)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478701/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie is titled so because (according to director Tony Bernal), being a boxer, Pacquiao is licensed to use his hands.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 2008, Pacquiao starred with [[Ara Mina]] and [[Valerie Concepcion]] in ''Anak ng Kumander'' (Son of Commander). The movie was not a commercial success and was panned by critics.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Upon the expiration of his contract with ABS-CBN, Pacquiao signed with [[GMA Network]] as an actor in September 2007.

In 2012, American actor [[Sylvester Stallone]] was reportedly in talks with Pacquiao over co-starring in one of Stallone's future films.

==Controversy==

===Tax evasion case===
On November 26, 2013, a few days after Pacquiao's victory over [[Brandon Rios]], the Philippine [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines)|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] (BIR) issued a freeze order on all of Pacquiao's Philippine bank accounts due to his alleged failure to pay [[Philippine peso|₱]]2.2 billion in taxes for earnings he made in his fights in the United States from 2008 to 2009. A day after the bank account freeze, the BIR also issued an order to freeze all of Pacquiao's Philippine properties, whereupon Pacquiao presented documents to the press showing the income tax for non-resident alien payment by his [[Top Rank|promoter]] to the BIR's US counterpart, the [[Internal Revenue Service]], as well as a letter from [[Bob Arum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/337272/economy/moneyandbanking/pacquiao-shows-us-tax-document-but-bir-says-it-has-no-proof-of-payment|title=Pacquiao shows US tax document but BIR says it has no proof of payment|work=gmanetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2017, Pacquiao, now a senator, approached Philippine authorities in an attempt to settle the case. The BIR had maintained that taxes were due even if all taxes had been paid to the IRS in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/04/18/17/pacquiao-says-he-wants-to-end-p22-b-tax-case|title=Pacquaio says he wants to end P2.2-B tax case}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Pacquiao, in a video statement posted by [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]], made a comment on the issue of same-sex marriage. Pacquiao, in vernacular, described people in same-sex marriages as behaving worse than animals because animals generally do not have same-sex mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.abs-cbn.com/boxing/news/2016/02/16/pacquiao-draws-flak-masahol-pa-sa-hayop-comment-8860|title=Pacquiao draws flak for "masahol pa sa hayop" comment|publisher=''[[ABS-CBN Sports]]''|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT celebrities including comedian [[Vice Ganda]], singer [[Aiza Seguerra]], TV host [[Boy Abunda]] and the party-list [[Ladlad]] criticized the statements of the senatorial candidate.

It was revealed following [[Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao|Mayweather vs. Pacquiao]] that Pacquiao had sustained an undisclosed injury to his right shoulder while training, and that while it had healed in time for the fight, he re-injured it during the 4th round. {{as of|2015}}, Pacquiao is currently facing a lawsuit of 5 million dollars filed against him by two fans for failing to disclose the shoulder injury in the lead up to his bout with [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.|Floyd Mayweather]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designntrend.com/articles/49947/20150505/manny-pacquiao-hit-with-5-million-class-action-lawsuit-after-two-fans-say-he-lied-about-his-injury-in-the-mayweather-fight.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507021746/http://www.designntrend.com/articles/49947/20150505/manny-pacquiao-hit-with-5-million-class-action-lawsuit-after-two-fans-say-he-lied-about-his-injury-in-the-mayweather-fight.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-05-07|title=Manny Pacquiao Hit With $5 Million Class-Action Lawsuit After Two Fans Say He Lied About His Injury In The Mayweather Fight|work=Design &amp; Trend}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacquiao failed to disclose the injury to the Nevada State Athletic Commission in the pre-fight injury evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/cnbc/manny-pacquiao-failed-to-disclose-shoulder-injury-440750659566 |title=Manny Pacquiao faces class action lawsuit |work=NBC News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518093717/http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/cnbc/manny-pacquiao-failed-to-disclose-shoulder-injury-440750659566 |archivedate=May 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/pacquiao-failure-disclose-injury-perjury-article-1.2210373 | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Pacquiao's failure to reveal injury may bring perjury charge | date=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission did a standard injury report with Pacquiao filling out the form saying that he had no injuries heading into the bout. Pacquiao said he had sustained the injury weeks out from the fight against Mayweather. However, after the lawsuit from the two fans was filed against him, Pacquiao has since said that he sustained the injury during the fight in which it flared up in the 3rd round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/boxing/article4431663.ece|title=Nevada State stance rubs salt into Pacquiao's wound|work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nevada State Athletic Commission stated at the post fight press conference that they had only just found out about Pacquiao's injury that evening at the post fight press conference. Speculation arose that the injury was an excuse for the loss to Mayweather because Pacquiao did not mention an injury in the post fight interview with [[Max Kellerman]]. Pacquiao's promoter [[Bob Arum]] stated that Pacquiao suffered the injury back in 2008, causing even more confusion as Pacquiao, now facing a lawsuit, had just previously stated that he suffered the injury during the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2015/05/arum-says-pacquiao-has-had-shoulder-injury-since-2008/|title=Arum says Pacquiao has had shoulder injury since 2008|work=Boxing News 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In industrial [[process engineering]], '''mixing''' is a [[unit operation]] that involves manipulation of a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] physical system with the intent to make it more [[homogeneous mixture|homogeneous]]. Familiar examples include [[pump]]ing of the water in a swimming pool to homogenize the water temperature, and the stirring of [[pancake]] batter to eliminate lumps (deagglomeration). Mixing is performed to allow heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams, components or phases. Modern industrial processing almost always involves some form of mixing.&lt;ref name=ullmann&gt;Ullmann, Fritz (2005). Ullmann's Chemical Engineering and Plant Design, Volumes 1–2. John Wiley &amp; Sons. http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/toc/id:kpUCEPDV02/ullmanns-chemical-engineering&lt;/ref&gt; Some classes of [[chemical reactor]]s are also mixers. With the right equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid or gas into another solid, liquid or gas. A [[biofuel]] fermenter may require the mixing of microbes, gases and liquid medium for optimal yield; organic [[nitration]] requires concentrated (liquid) [[nitric acid|nitric]] and [[sulfuric acid]]s to be mixed with a [[hydrophobic]] organic phase; production of pharmaceutical tablets requires blending of solid powders. The opposite of mixing is [[Separation process|segregation]]. A classical example of segregation is the [[brazil nut effect]].

==Mixing classification==
The type of operation and equipment used during mixing depends on the state of materials being mixed (liquid, semi-solid, or solid) and the miscibility of the materials being processed. In this context, the act of mixing may be synonymous with stirring-, or kneading-processes.&lt;ref name="ullmann" /&gt;

== Liquid–liquid mixing ==
Mixing of liquids occurs frequently in process engineering. The nature of liquids to blend determines the equipment used. Single-phase blending tends to involve low-shear, high-flow mixers to cause liquid engulfment, while multi-phase mixing generally requires the use of high-shear, low-flow mixers to create droplets of one liquid in [[laminar flow|laminar]], [[turbulent]] or transitional flow regimes, depending on the [[Reynolds number]] of the flow. Turbulent or transitional mixing is frequently conducted with [[turbine]]s or [[impeller]]s; laminar mixing is conducted with helical ribbon or anchor mixers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc13.htm |title=Various Mixing Experiments |publisher=Bakker.org |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2017-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626145907/http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc13.htm |archivedate=26 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single-phase blending===
Mixing of liquids that are [[miscible]] or at least [[soluble]] in each other occurs frequently in process engineering (and in everyday life). An everyday example would be the addition of milk or cream to tea or coffee. Since both liquids are water-based, they dissolve easily in one another. The momentum of the liquid being added is sometimes enough to cause enough [[turbulence]] to mix the two, since the [[viscosity]] of both liquids is relatively low. If necessary, a spoon or paddle could be used to complete the mixing process. Blending in a more viscous liquid, such as [[honey]], requires more mixing [[power (physics)|power]] per unit volume to achieve the same homogeneity in the same amount of time.

==Gas–gas mixing==
{{main article|Gas blending}}

==Solid–solid mixing==
Blending powders is one of the oldest unit-operations in the solids handling industries. For many decades powder blending has been used just to homogenize bulk materials. Many different machines have been designed to handle materials with various bulk solids properties. On the basis of the practical experience gained with these different machines, engineering knowledge has been developed to construct reliable equipment and to predict scale-up and mixing behavior. Nowadays the same mixing technologies are used for many more applications: to improve product quality, to coat particles, to fuse materials, to wet, to disperse in liquid, to agglomerate, to alter functional material properties, etc.
This wide range of  applications of mixing equipment requires a high level of knowledge, long time experience  and extended test facilities to come to the optimal selection of equipment and processes.
[[File:Machine for incorporating liquids and finely-ground solids.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Machine for incorporating liquids and finely ground solids]]
One example of a solid–solid mixing process is mulling foundry [[molding (process)|molding]] sand, where sand, [[bentonite]] [[clay]], fine coal dust and water are mixed to a [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]], [[mold]]able and reusable mass, applied for molding and pouring [[molten]] metal to obtain [[sand casting]]s that are metallic parts for automobile, machine building, construction or other industries.

In powder two different dimensions in the mixing process can be determined: convective mixing and intensive mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powderprocess.net/Mixing.html|title=Powder Mixing - Design - problem solving - Ribbon blender, Paddle mixer, Drum blender, Froude Number - PowderProcess.net|author=|date=|website=www.powderprocess.net|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928143738/http://www.powderprocess.net/Mixing.html|archivedate=28 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of convective mixing material in the mixer is transported from one location to another. This type of mixing leads to a less ordered state inside the mixer, the components that must be mixed are distributed over the other components. With progressing time the mixture becomes more randomly ordered. After a certain mixing time the ultimate random state is reached. Usually this type of mixing is applied for free-flowing and coarse materials. 

Possible threats during macro mixing is the de-mixing of the components, since differences in size, shape or density of the different particles can lead to segregation.
 
When materials are cohesive, which is the case with e.g. fine particles and also with wet material, convective mixing is no longer sufficient to obtain a randomly ordered mixture. The relative strong inter-particle forces form lumps, which are not broken up by the mild transportation forces in the convective mixer. To decrease the lump size additional forces are necessary; i.e. more energy intensive mixing is required. These additional forces can either be impact forces or shear forces.

==Liquid–solid mixing==
Liquid–solid mixing is typically done to suspend coarse free-flowing solids, or to break up lumps of fine agglomerated solids. An example of the former is the mixing granulated sugar into water; an example of the latter is the mixing of flour or powdered milk into water. In the first case, the particles can be lifted into suspension (and separated from one another) by bulk motion of the fluid; in the second, the mixer itself (or the high shear field near it) must destabilize the lumps and cause them to disintegrate.

One example of a solid–liquid mixing process in industry is concrete mixing, where cement, sand, small stones or gravel and water are commingled to a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] self-hardening [[mass]], used in the construction industry.

===Solid suspension===
Suspension of solids into a liquid is done to improve the rate of mass transfer between the solid and the liquid. Examples include dissolving a solid reactant into a solvent, or suspending catalyst particles in liquid to improve the flow of reactants and products to and from the particles. The associated [[eddy diffusion]] increases the rate of mass transfer within the bulk of the fluid, and the convection of material away from the particles decreases the size of the [[boundary layer]], where most of the resistance to mass transfer occurs. Axial-flow impellers are preferred for solid suspension, although radial-flow impellers can be used in a tank with baffles, which converts some of the rotational motion into vertical motion. When the solid is denser than the liquid (and therefore collects at the bottom of the tank), the impeller is rotated so that the fluid is pushed downwards; when the solid is less dense than the liquid (and therefore floats on top), the impeller is rotated so that the fluid is pushed upwards (though this is relatively rare). The equipment preferred for solid suspension produces large volumetric flows but not necessarily high shear; high flow-number turbine impellers, such as hydrofoils, are typically used. Multiple turbines mounted on the same shaft can reduce power draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc4.htm |title=Stirred Vessels |publisher=Bakker.org |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2017-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814175734/http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc4.htm |archivedate=14 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solid deagglomeration===
Very fine powders, such as [[titanium dioxide]] pigments, and materials that have been [[spray drying|spray dried]] may [[agglomerate]] or form lumps during transportation and storage. Starchy materials or those that form gels when exposed to solvent can form lumps that are [[wetting|wetted]] on the outside but dry on the inside. These types of materials are not easily mixed into liquid with the types of mixers preferred for solid suspension because the agglomerate particles must be subjected to intense shear to be broken up. In some ways, deagglomeration of solids is similar to the blending of immiscible liquids, except for the fact that [[coalescence (chemistry)|coalescence]] is usually not a problem. An everyday example of this type of mixing is the production of [[milkshake]]s from liquid milk and solid ice cream. 

==Liquid–gas mixing==
Liquids and gases are typically mixed to allow [[mass transfer]] to occur. For instance, in the case of [[air stripping]], gas is used to remove volatiles from a liquid. Typically, a [[packed column]] is used for this purpose, with the packing acting as a motionless mixer and the air pump providing the driving force. When a tank and impeller are used, the objective is typically to ensure that the gas bubbles remain in contact with the liquid for as long as possible. This is especially important if the gas is expensive, such as pure [[oxygen]], or diffuses slowly into the liquid. Mixing in a tank is also useful when a (relatively) slow chemical reaction is occurring in the liquid phase, and so the concentration difference in the thin layer near the bubble is close to that of the bulk. This reduces the driving force for mass transfer. If there is a (relatively) fast chemical reaction in the liquid phase, it is sometimes advantageous to disperse but not recirculate the gas bubbles, ensuring that they are in [[plug flow]] and can transfer mass more efficiently.

Rushton turbines have been traditionally used do disperse gases into liquids, but newer options, such as the Smith turbine and Bakker turbine are becoming more prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cercell.com/support/bactovessel-details/turbine-principles/ |title=Turbine principles |publisher=Cercell.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611222544/http://cercell.com/support/bactovessel-details/turbine-principles |archivedate=11 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the issues is that as the gas flow increases, more and more of the gas accumulates in the low pressure zones behind the impeller blades, which reduces the power drawn by the mixer (and therefore its effectiveness). Newer designs, such as the GDX impeller, have nearly eliminated this problem.

==Gas–solid mixing==
{{main article|Fluidization}}

Gas–solid mixing may be conducted to transport powders or small particulate solids from one place to another, or to mix gaseous reactants with solid catalyst particles. In either case, the turbulent eddies of the gas must provide enough force to suspend the solid particles, which otherwise sink under the force of [[gravity]]. The size and shape of the particles is an important consideration, since different particles have different [[drag coefficient]]s, and particles made of different materials have different [[Density|densities]].
A common unit operation the process industry uses to separate gases and solids is the [[cyclonic separation|cyclone]], which slows the gas and causes the particles to settle out.

==Multiphase mixing==
Multiphase mixing occurs when solids, liquids and gases are combined in one step. This may occur as part of a catalytic chemical process, in which liquid and gaseous reagents must be combined with a solid catalyst (such as [[hydrogenation]]); or in fermentation, where solid microbes and the gases they require must be well-distributed in a liquid medium. The type of mixer used depends upon the properties of the phases. In some cases, the mixing power is provided by the gas itself as it moves up through the liquid, [[Entrainment (hydrodynamics)|entraining]] liquid with the bubble plume. This draws liquid upwards inside the plume, and causes liquid to fall outside the plume. If the viscosity of the liquid is too high to allow for this (or if the solid particles are too heavy), an impeller may be needed to keep the solid particles suspended.

[[File:Fluidized Bed Reactor Graphic.svg|thumb|300px|Schematic drawing of a fluidized bed reactor]]

== Basic Nomenclature ==
For liquid mixing, the nomenclature is rather standardized:

* Impeller Diameter, "D" is measured for industrial mixers as the maximum diameter swept around the axis of rotation.
* Rotational Speed, "N" is usually measured in revolutions per minute(RPM) or revolutions per second(RPS).  This variable refers to the rotational speed of the impeller as this number can differ along points of the drive train.
* Tank Diameter, "T" The inside diameter of a cylindrical vessel.  Most mixing vessels receiving industrial mixers will be cylindrical.
* Power, "P" Is the energy input into a system usually by an [[electric motor]] or a [[pneumatic motor]]
* Impeller Pumping Capacity, "Q"  The resulting fluid motion from impeller rotation.

==Constitutive equations==
Many of the equations used for determining the output of mixers are empirically derived, or contain empirically-derived constants. Since mixers operate in the turbulent regime, many of the equations are approximations that are considered acceptable for most engineering purposes.

When a mixing impeller rotates in the fluid, it generates a combination of flow and shear.  The impeller generated flow can be calculated with the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; Q = Fl*N*D^3 &lt;/math&gt;

Flow numbers for impellers have been published in the North American Mixing Forum sponsored Handbook of Industrial Mixing.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Industrial Mixing: Science and Practice |editor1=Edward L. Paul |editor2=Victor Atiemo-Obeng |editor3=Suzanne M. Kresta |year=2003 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-26919-9 |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471269190.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121112810/http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471269190.html |archivedate=21 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power required to rotate an impeller can be calculated using the following equations:

&lt;math&gt; P= Po\rho N^3D^5 &lt;/math&gt; (Turbulent regime)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cercell.com/support/bactovessel-details/turbine-power/ |title=Power Number (Np) for turbines |publisher=Cercell.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611213616/http://cercell.com/support/bactovessel-details/turbine-power |archivedate=11 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; P= K_p\mu N^2D^3 &lt;/math&gt; (Laminar regime)

&lt;math&gt; Po &lt;/math&gt; is the (dimensionless) power number, which is a function of impeller geometry; &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the fluid; &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; is the rotational speed, typically rotations per second; &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; is the diameter of the impeller; &lt;math&gt; K_p &lt;/math&gt; is the laminar power constant; and &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; is the viscosity of the fluid. Note that the mixer power is strongly dependent upon the rotational speed and impeller diameter, and linearly dependent upon either the density or viscosity of the fluid, depending on which flow regime is present. In the transitional regime, flow near the impeller is turbulent and so the turbulent power equation is used.

The time required to blend a fluid to within 5% of the final concentration, &lt;math&gt; {\theta_{95}} &lt;/math&gt;, can be calculated with the following correlations:

&lt;math&gt; {\theta_{95}} = \frac {5.40} {Po^{1 \over 3} N} (\frac {T} {D})^2 &lt;/math&gt; (Turbulent regime)

&lt;math&gt; {\theta_{95}} = \frac {34596} {Po^{1 \over 3} N^2 D^2} (\frac {\mu} {\rho}) (\frac {T} {D})^2 &lt;/math&gt; (Transitional region)

&lt;math&gt; {\theta_{95}} = \frac {896*10^3 K_p^{-1.69}} {N} &lt;/math&gt; (Laminar regime)

The Transitional/Turbulent boundary occurs at &lt;math&gt; Po^{1 \over 3} Re = 6404 &lt;/math&gt;

The Laminar/Transitional boundary occurs at &lt;math&gt; Po^{1 \over 3} Re = 186 &lt;/math&gt;

==Laboratory mixing==
[[File:Magnetic Stirrer.JPG|200px|left|thumb|A magnetic stirrer]]
At a laboratory scale, mixing is achieved by [[magnetic stirrer]]s or by simple hand-shaking. Sometimes mixing in laboratory vessels is more thorough and occurs faster than is possible industrially. Magnetic stir bars are radial-flow mixers that induce [[rigid body|solid body rotation]] in the fluid being mixed. This is acceptable on a small scale, since the vessels are small and mixing therefore occurs rapidly (short blend time). A variety of stir bar configurations exist, but because of the small size and (typically) low viscosity of the fluid, it is possible to use one configuration for nearly all mixing tasks. The cylindrical stir bar can be used for suspension of solids, as seen in [[iodometry]], deagglomeration (useful for preparation of microbiology [[growth medium]] from powders), and liquid–liquid blending. Another peculiarity of laboratory mixing is that the mixer rests on the bottom of the vessel instead of being suspended near the center. Furthermore, the vessels used for laboratory mixing are typically more widely varied than those used for industrial mixing; for instance, [[Erlenmeyer flask]]s, or [[Florence flask]]s may be used in addition to the more cylindrical [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]].

== Mixing in microfluidics ==
When scaled down to the microscale, fluid mixing behaves radically different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Nam-Trung|author2=Wu, Zhigang|title=Micromixers—a review|journal=Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering|date=1 February 2005|volume=15|issue=2|pages=R1–R16|doi=10.1088/0960-1317/15/2/R01|bibcode = 2005JMiMi..15R...1N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redbudlabs.com/microfluidic-mixing/|title=Microfluidic Mixing - Redbud Labs|author=|date=|website=redbudlabs.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102092036/https://redbudlabs.com/microfluidic-mixing/|archivedate=2 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically at sizes from a couple (2 or 3) millimeters down to the nanometer range.  At this size range normal convection does not happen unless you force it.  Diffusion is the dominate mechanism whereby two different fluids come together.  Diffusion is a relatively slow process.  Hence a number of researchers had to devise ways to get the two fluids to mix.  This involved Y junctions, T junctions, three-way intersections and designs where the interfacial area between the two fluids is maximized.  Beyond just interfacing the two liquids people also made twisting channels to force the two fluids to mix.  These included multilayered devices where the fluids would corkscrew, looped devices where the fluids would flow around obstructions and wavy devices where the channel would constrict and flare out.  Additionally channels with features on the walls like notches or groves were tried.

One way to tell if mixing is happening due to convection or diffusion is by finding the Peclet number. It is the ratio of convection to diffusion.  At high Peclet numbers, convection dominates.  At low Peclet numbers, diffusion dominates.

Peclet = flow velocity * mixing path / diffusion coefficient

==Industrial mixing equipment==
At an industrial scale, efficient mixing can be difficult to achieve. A great deal of engineering effort goes into designing and improving mixing processes. Mixing at industrial scale is done in batches (dynamic mixing), inline or with help of [[static mixer]]s. Moving mixers are powered with [[electric motor]]s that operate at standard speeds of 1800 or 1500 RPM, which is typically much faster than necessary. [[Gearbox]]es are used to reduce speed and increase torque.  Some applications require the use of multi-shaft mixers, in which a combination of mixer types are used to completely blend the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hockmeyer.com/products/high-viscosity-mixers/dual-triple-shaft-mixer-detail.html |title=High Viscosity Mixers: Dual and Triple Shaft Mixers |publisher=Hockmeyer.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703141729/http://www.hockmeyer.com/products/high-viscosity-mixers/dual-triple-shaft-mixer-detail.html |archivedate=3 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to performing typical batch mixing operations, some mixing can be done continuously.  Using a machine like the Continuous Processor, one or more dry ingredients and one or more liquid ingredients can be accurately and consistently metered into the machine and see a continuous, homogeneous mixture come out the discharge of the machine.&lt;ref&gt;"Continuous Processor" http://www.dairynetwork.com/product.mvc/Continuous-Processor-0002&lt;/ref&gt;  Many industries have converted to continuous mixing for many reasons.  Some of those are ease of cleaning, lower energy consumption, smaller footprint, versatility, control, and many others.  Continuous mixers, such as the twin-screw Continuous Processor, also have the ability to handle very high viscosities.

[[File:Mixing - flusso assiale e radiale.jpg|thumb|200px|Axial flow impeller (left) and radial flow impeller (right).]]

Different types of impellers are used for different tasks; for instance, Rushton turbines are useful for dispersing gases into liquids, but are not very helpful for dispersing settled solids into liquid. Newer turbines have largely supplanted the Rushton turbine for gas–liquid mixing, such as the Smith turbine and Bakker turbine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bakker.org/cfm/bt6.htm |title=Asymmetric Blade Impeller |publisher=Bakker.org |date=1998-12-16 |accessdate=2017-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814175906/http://www.bakker.org/cfm/bt6.htm |archivedate=14 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The power number is an empirical measure of the amount of torque needed to drive different impellers in the same fluid at constant power per unit volume; impellers with higher power numbers require more torque but operate at lower speed than impellers with lower power numbers, which operate at lower torque but higher speeds.

===Close-clearance mixers===
There are two main types of close-clearance mixers: anchors and helical ribbons. Anchor mixers induce solid-body rotation and do not promote vertical mixing, but helical ribbons do. Close clearance mixers are used in the laminar regime, because the viscosity of the fluid overwhelms the inertial forces of the flow and prevents the fluid leaving the impeller from entraining the fluid next to it. Helical ribbon mixers are typically rotated to push material at the wall downwards, which helps circulate the fluid and refresh the surface at the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc10.htm |title=Helical Ribbon Impeller |publisher=Bakker.org |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2017-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814180054/http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc10.htm |archivedate=14 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===High shear dispersers===
{{main article|high-shear mixer}}
High shear dispersers create intense shear near the impeller but relatively little flow in the bulk of the vessel. Such devices typically resemble [[circular saw]] blades and are rotated at high speed. Because of their shape, they have a relatively low [[drag coefficient]] and therefore require comparatively little torque to spin at high speed. High shear dispersers are used for forming emulsions (or suspensions) of immiscible liquids and solid deagglomeration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hockmeyer.com/technical/publications/73-dispersion-tips-help.html |title=A Practical Guide to High Speed Dispersion |publisher=Hockmeyer.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610072344/http://www.hockmeyer.com/technical/publications/73-dispersion-tips-help.html |archivedate=10 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Static mixers===
{{main article| static mixer}}
Static mixers are used when a mixing tank would be too large, too slow, or too expensive to use in a given process.

===Liquid whistles===
{{main article|Liquid Whistle}}
Liquid whistles are a kind of [[static mixer]] which pass fluid at high pressure through an orifice and subsequently over a blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=David|last2=Simmons|first2=Mark|last3=Baker|first3=Michael|date=2017|title=Determination of the flow field inside a Sonolator liquid whistle using PIV and CFD|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2017.01.035|publisher=Chemical Engineering Science|accessdate=2 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subjects the fluid to high [[Turbulence|turbulent]] stresses and may result in [[Mixing (physics)|mixing]], [[emulsification]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=David|last2=Baker|first2=Michael|last3=Kowalski|first3=Adam|last4=Simmons|first4=Mark|date=2018|title=Emulsification using a “Sonolator” liquid whistle: A new correlation for droplet size from pilot-scale experiments|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000925091830366X|publisher=Chemical Engineering Science|accessdate=13 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|type=EngD.|last=Ryan|first=David|date=2015|title=Investigation of Fluid Dynamics and Emulsification in Sonolator Liquid Whistles|publisher=University of Birmingham, UK|url=http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/5696/|accessdate=1 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; deagglomeration and disinfection.

Author of ''60 Days to Change: A Daily How-To Guide with Actionable Tips for Improving Your Financial Life'' and founder of Advanced Planning Solutions (a financial education firm), Dunn is host of ''Skills Your Dad Never Taught You'' on NewsTalk 1430 (WXNT Indianapolis). As a financial expert, Dunn was a regular contributing columnist to MediaPost,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/author/2614/peter-dunn/ |title=Peter Dunn |work=MediaPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote for the ''Engage: Gen Y'' column in 2009-10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/107821/empathize-with-gen-ys-money-struggles.html |title=Empathize with Gen Y's Money Struggles |last=Dunn |first=Peter |work=MediaPost|date=June 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/109997/are-you-going-to-work-with-gen-y-or-against-them.html |title=Are You Going to Work With Gen Y or Against Them? |last=Dunn |first=Peter |work=MediaPost |date=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/111998/market-the-company-not-the-product.html |title=Market the Company, Not the Product |last=Dunn |first=Peter |work=MediaPost |date= August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/113768/channel-their-energy.html |title=Channel Their Energy |last=Dunn |first=Peter |work=MediaPost |date=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/117476/when-old-tricks-become-new-treats.html |title=When Old Tricks Become New Treats |last=Dunn |first=Peter |work=MediaPost |date= November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a speaker on financial topics, Dunn appears regularly on the [[Fox Business Network]], [[Fox News]]’s ''Studio B with Shepard Smith'', and has been a guest host of ''Abdul in the Morning'' on WXNT.

Dunn is also the creator of Green Candy, a financial assessment site for Generation Y that aims to help readers avoid the money mistakes of their parents’ generation. Green Candy, which launched in November 2008, led to Dunn’s regular appearances on [[Fox News]] and [[Fox Business Network]].

Dunn was named one of Indy’s Best and Brightest in Media, Entertainment and Sports 2009;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indysbestandbrightest.com/index.html |title=Indy's Best and Brightest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122024728/http://www.indysbestandbrightest.com/index.html |archivedate=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007, he was recognized in the Finance category;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indysbestandbrightest.com/07finalist.html |title=2007 Finalists |publisher=Junior Achievement of Central Indiana |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122024610/http://www.indysbestandbrightest.com/07finalist.html |archivedate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004, "Nuvo" magazine named Dunn one of "30 Under 30 to Watch in the Arts (Comedy)".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In February 2009 Dunn, along with his business partner Raquel Richardson, created the "60 Days to Change" financial curriculum, which evolved into a news program when [[WISH-TV]] (CBS) picked it up as a weekly news series. Dunn and WISH-TV guided three families through the curriculum, and the series was then picked up for distribution by multiple CBS affiliates. Due to the popularity of the program, Dunn was inspired to develop a book. ''60 Days to Change: A Daily How-To Guide with Actionable Tips for Improving Your Financial Life'' was published in November 2009 by Channel V Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dunn |first= Peter |title= 60 Days to Change: A Daily How-To Guide with Actionable Tips for Improving Your Financial Life|publisher= Channel V Books |location= New York|date=November 2009 |isbn= 978-0-9824739-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, AOL.com's WalletPop featured Dunn's advice in ''Secrets of the Credit Score Elite'' and in  ''Debt Diet Part 6: Holiday meals in a final weekend of shopping''. [[Dan Schawbel]] of PersonalBrandingBlog.com also featured Dunn in an interview that examined how Dunn created his personal brand and communicates with his audience across a variety of social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personalbrandingblog.com/personal-branding-interview-peter-dunn/ |title=Personal Branding Interview: Peter Dunn |first=Dan |last=Schawbel |work=Personal Branding Blog |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunn contributes regularly to ''Inside INdiana Business'', and has also been a guest on ''Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick''. Asks dumb questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfXj9sItGSg&amp;t=5m8s |title=Pete the Planner Show: 11. Million Dollar Plan - Tatiana |date=March 6, 2017 |accessdate=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education and career==
Dunn was born in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. By the time he had graduated from [[Hanover College]] in 2000, he had his stock broker’s license (Series 7). At the age of 20, Dunn started in the financial services industry. He began his financial planning career at MetLife Securities in the summer of 2000. Two years later, he left MetLife Securities and opened Advanced Planning Solutions Inc. His area of work mainly focused on teaching people the proper money skills (including budgeting, cash flow management, and debt management) that they would need in order to start their financial planning process.

In 2004 Dunn was given the nickname "Pete the Planner", which has become his onscreen persona, and in 2006 Dunn published "What Your Dad Never Taught You About Budgeting." This led to a series of local appearances on [[WISH-TV]] (CBS) that included Pete’s Money Tips. In May 2008, Dunn created the radio program "Skills Your Dad Never Taught You with Pete the Planner," which airs on 1430 AM [[WXNT]]. (The weekly podcast is available on iTunes.) Dunn also regularly appears on the nationally syndicated radio program "Your Time with Kim Iverson."

In 2011 Dunn was credited with creating the phrase "the earliest money is the best money." This term describes the power and importance of compounding interest. It means that the money you contribute now is more important than the money you contribute 1 year from now. This is because it will have more time to grow, thus it is the most powerful contribution. Just as last year's contributions are more powerful than this year's contributions.

==Publications==
Dunn is author of ''What Your Dad Never Taught You About Budgeting'' (SPS Publishing, 2006) and ''60 Days to Change: A Daily How-To Guide with Actionable Tips for Improving Your Financial Life'' (Channel V Books, 2009).

==Personal==
Dunn resides in [[Carmel, Indiana]] with his wife, Sarah, his daughter, Olivia, and son, Theodore.

'''Renato Usatîi''' (born 4 November 1978 in [[Fălești]]) is a [[Moldova]]n businessman and politician, since 13 April 2014 the chairman of [[Partidul Nostru (Moldova)|Our Party]], a left-wing populist opposition party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ru.publika.md/link_1288031.html|title=Бизнесмен Ренато Усатый стал председателем "Нашей партии"|date=14 April 2014|publisher=General Media Group|pages=Publika.md|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he was [[Moldovan local elections, 2015|elected]] the mayor of [[Bălți]] with the support of around 72% of votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ria.ru/world/20150615/1070004929.html|title=Бизнесмен Ренато Усатый лидирует на выборах мэра Бельцов в Молдавии|date=15 June 2015|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|language=Russian|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a leader of the pro-Russian opposition in Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.realitatea.net/renato-usatii-a-plecat-la-moscova-dar-promite-noi-dezvaluiri_1813799.html|title=Renato Usatîi a plecat la Moscova, dar promite noi dezvăluiri despre liderii de la guvernare|date=20 October 2015|publisher=realitatea.net|language=Romanian|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usatîi graduated in foreign languages from the [[Alecu Russo State University of Bălți|Bălți State University]]. In 2005 he started his own business, founding in Russia ″VPT-NN″, a company producing railway equipment. Since 2011, he was the major stakeholder of [[Universalbank]], one of the major banks of Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ria.ru/spravka/20150615/1069200105.html|title=Биография Ренато Усатого|date=15 June 2015|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|language=Russian|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Russian banker [[German Gorbuntsov]] accused Renato Usatîi of hiring a gunman to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-11-24/russias-project-moldova|title=Russia's Project Moldova|website=Bloombergview.com|date=24 November 2014|author=Marc Champion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 October 2015 Usatîi was arrested in [[Chișinău]] and charged with illegal tampering of phone of [[Vlad Filat]], the former prime-minister who himself was arrested for corruption charges. Usatîi confessed he indeed published the phone records but that he thinks it is a necessary measure in order to save the country from corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2015/10/23_a_7839737.shtml|title=Усатого взяли за прослушку|last=Братерский|first=Александр|date=23 October 2015|work=Gazeta.ru|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October he was released; the charges were not dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://izvestia.ru/news/593961|title=Молдавский оппозиционер Ренато Усатый освобожден из-под стражи|date=25 October 2015|publisher=[[Izvestiya]]|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016 an national and international arrest warrant was issued by a Moldovan Court for Usatîi, .&lt;ref&gt;[http://adevarul.ro/moldova/politica/renato-usatii-fost-dat-cautare-nationala-internationala-video-1_580e27de5ab6550cb8dda594/index.html Renato Usatîi a fost dat în căutare națională și internațională VIDEO] {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediafax.ro/externe/mandat-de-arestare-pe-numele-politicianului-moldovean-prorus-renato-usatii-aflat-la-moscova-15854829&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Usatîi stays in Russia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3209">Analogous to [[clinical ethics]] consultation, '''Research Ethics Consultation''' (REC) describes a formal way for researchers to solicit and receive expert ethical guidance related to [[biomedical research]]. The first REC service was established at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) Clinical Center in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Emanuel|first=EJ|title=The blossoming of bioethics at NIH|journal=[[Kennedy Inst Ethics J.]]|date=Dec 1998|volume=8|issue=4|pages=455–66|pmid=11657322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most REC services are found at academic institutions, and the majority of current services were originally launched in response to the 2006 NIH [[Clinical and Translational Science Award]] program, as applicants to that program were required to have procedures in place to address ethical concerns raised by their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Danis|first=Marion|title=Research Ethics Consultation: A Casebook|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|isbn=978-0199798032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While still a young discipline with no explicit standards, individuals serving as [[research ethics]] consultants are expected to be familiar with [[research ethics]] and ethical analysis; knowledgeable about the applicable regulations, laws, and policies; and ideally also have some [[biomedical research]] experience and scientific expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cho|first=MK|author2=Tobin SL |author3=Greely HT |title=Strangers at the benchside: Research ethics consultation|journal=[[Am J Bioeth]]|year=2008a|volume=8|pages=4–13|pmid=18570086|doi=10.1080/15265160802132951|issue=3|pmc=2585006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

REC is distinct from related services, such as those of [[Institutional Review Boards]], in that it is typically available at any point during a study (planning, conducting, interpreting, or disseminating results), and can relate to any ethical question. While little is known about the range and distribution of topics put forth for REC, such services may be particularly important and useful for studies of known regulatory and ethical uncertainty (e.g. assessment of minimal risk in pediatric studies) and frontier research for which there is little if any regulation or expert consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Havard|first=M|author2=Cho MK |author3=Magnus D |title=Triggers for research ethics consultation|journal=[[Sci Transl Med]]|date=25 Jan 2012|volume=4|issue=118|pmid=22277965|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3002734|pages=118cm1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations that result from the consultation are non-binding, meaning that the researcher may choose to follow the recommendation, or to pursue a different approach.

'''Sadegh Mahsouli''' ({{lang-fa|صادق محصولی}}, born 9 March 1959) is an [[Iran]]ian politician who was [[Ministry of Interior (Iran)|Minister of Interior]] from 2008 to 2009 and [[Minister of Welfare and Social Security of Iran|Minister of Welfare and Social Security]] from 2009 to 2011. He was appointed to this post on 19 November 2009, as part of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s second cabinet after received vote of from [[Parliament of Iran|Parliament]]. From 24 March 2008 to 9 August 2009, he was [[Ministry of Interior (Iran)|Minister of Interior]] of Ahmadinejad's first [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]].
He was succeed [[Ali Kordan]] who was impeached by Parliament in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sadegh-mahsouli/ |title=Sadegh Mahsouli |author= |date= |work="Topics" |publisher=Washington Times |accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahsouli withdrew his nomination once when the president nominated him for the position of oil minister in 2005 after admitted to [[Iranian parliament]] that he was worth $160 million.&lt;ref name="TB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/08/ahmadinejads-security-cabinet.html|title=Ahmadinejad's Security Cabinet|work=FRONTLINE - Tehran Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, it was announced that Ministry of Welfare will be merged with Ministry of Labour and Mahsouli will be leave cabinet after it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/163501/محرابیان،-محصولی-و-میرکاظمی-از-دولت-حذف-شدند/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahsouli was in charge of the Ministry of Interior when the alleged vote rigging happened in Iran's presidential election in June 2009.

== June 13 Letter ==
On June 18, a letter was presented by Iranian filmmakers [[Marjane Satrapi]] (director of the critically Acclaimed Film [[Persepolis (film)|Persepolis]]) and has since been widely circulated with Mousavi Supporters. No verification of the letter has been provided. The letter was allegedly written by Interior Minister Sadegh Mahsouli to [[Ali Khamenei|Ayatollah Khamenei]] on June 13 (a day after the elections), states the fraud and lists the authentic vote count. A quick view on the letter shows that it was fake. The letter was roughly translated as follows;

"''Salaam Aleikum.''

''Following your concerns regarding the results of the presidential election and per your given discretion to have Dr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remain as president during this sensitive juncture. Therefore, everything has been planned in a way that the public announcement will be made in accordance with the interests of the regime and the revolution. All necessary precautions have been taken to deal with any unexpected events of election aftermath and the intense monitoring of all the parties' leaders as well as the election candidates.''

''However, some believe that the real votes counted are as follows:''

''Total number of votes: 43,026,078''

''Mir Hossein Mousavi: 19,075,623''

''Mehdi Karoubi: 13,387,104''

''Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: 5,698,417''

''Mohsen Rezaee: 3,754,218''

''Void: 38,716''

''Minister of Interior''

''Sadegh Mahsouli''"

Small and Medium Enterprises in [[Afghanistan]] employ 10 to 500 employees, have sales up to US$1 million and [[paid-in capital]] of up to US$1 million. Lenders are banks, financing companies, some MFIs, local money exchange service providers ([[Hawala]] dealers), credit unions and societies. Most of these loans are disbursed against collateral of [[title deeds]], land deeds, property and automobile deeds. Some small loans are secured by neighbors, personal guarantees and character.

The SME loans that are disbursed by these lenders range from US$2,000-250,000.

The majority of SMEs operate in cities such as Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif, Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni, Jalalabad, Kunduz, Faizabad, Maimana, JawzJan and Taloqan.

[[Interest rate]]s are marked from 12% up to 24% depending on mutual deals, loan amounts and credit history. Most formal lenders charge 0.5% to 2.0% of the loan amount as an up-front processing fee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4657">{{short description|A set of detailed instructions compiled by an organization to help workers carry out operations safely and effectively }}
{{For|the 2008 documentary film|Standard Operating Procedure (film){{!}}''Standard Operating Procedure'' (film)}}

A '''standard operating procedure''' ('''SOP''') is a set of step-by-step instructions compiled by an [[organization]] to help workers carry out '''complex''' routine operations. SOPs aim to achieve efficiency, quality output and uniformity of performance, while reducing [[miscommunication]] and failure to comply with [[industry regulation]]s.

The [[military]] (e.g. in the U.S. and UK) sometimes uses the term '''standing''' (rather than ''standard'') '''operating procedure''' because a military SOP refers to a unit's unique procedures, which are not necessarily standard to another unit. The word "standard" can imply that only one (standard) procedure is to be used across all units.

==Clinical research and practice==
In clinical research, the ''[[International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|International Council for Harmonisation]]'' (ICH) defines SOPs as "detailed, written instructions to achieve uniformity of the performance of a specific function". SOPs usually get applied in pharmaceutical processing and for related clinical studies. There the focus is always set on repeated application of unchanged processes and procedures and its documentation, hence supporting the segregation of origins, causes and effects. Further application is with [[triage]], when limited resources get used according to an assessment on ranking, urgence and staffing possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/contracting/rfqs/support_ant/docs/environ_health_safety/usap_sandh_policy_man/mcmurdostandardmedicalsop-311.pdf |title=McMurdo Station Medical Standard Operating Procedures as of 2006/06 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Study director is mainly responsible for SOPs. The Quality Assurance Unit are individuals who are responsible for monitoring whether the study report and tests are meeting the SOP. 
SOPs can also provide employees with a reference to common business practices, activities, or tasks.  New employees use a SOP to answer questions without having to interrupt supervisors to ask how an operation is performed. The international quality standard [[ISO 9001]] essentially requires the determination of processes (documented as standard operating procedures) used in any manufacturing process that could affect the quality of the product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/management_standards/quality_management/iso_9001_2008/guidance_on_the_documentation_requirements_of_iso_9001_2008.htm Guidance on the Documentation Requirements of ISO 9001:2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015230555/http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/management_standards/quality_management/iso_9001_2008/guidance_on_the_documentation_requirements_of_iso_9001_2008.htm |date=October 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health safety and environment==
Procedures are extensively employed to assist with working safely. They are sometimes called safe work methods statements (SWMS, pronounced as 'Swims'). They are usually preceded by various methods of analyzing tasks or jobs to be performed in a workplace, including an approach called job safety analysis, in which hazards are identified and their control methods described. Procedures must be suited to the literacy levels of the user, and as part of this, the readability of procedures is important.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, G.A. (2012) Readability of OHS documents - A comparison of surface characteristics of OHS text between some languages, Safety Science, 50(7), 1627-1635.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
The youngest of four siblings, Taseer Badar was born October 1, 1973 in Lahore, Pakistan, where he spent the first 10 months of his life before immigrating to [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]], [[Wisconsin]]. His mother, Kausar, and father, Tanwir, were a Nuclear Medicine Technologist Professor in Chemistry at VA Medical Center in her native home in Pakistan and Professional Engineer (PE) in Chemical and Associate Professor at [[King's College London|King’s College London]] in Strand, London, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mays.tamu.edu/news/2013/02/05/thriving-businessman-paves-way-for-new-entrepreneurs/|title=Prosperous businessman paves way for new entrepreneurs|work=Mays Impacts|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In high school, he began a lawn mowing business. Later, at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], where he would earn his [[BBA|Bachelors of Business Administration]] in [[Entrepreneurship]] &amp; [[Finance]] from the Mays School of Business, he ran a toner company that shipped to clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://houston.culturemap.com/news/innovation/01-16-12-09-44-taseer-badar-changes-the-way-physicians-invest/|title=A matter of trust: Taseer Badar has changed the way physicians invest|work=CultureMap Houston|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
In 1996, Taseer began his [[Financial services|financial advisor]] career with [[Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co.]] in New York City, where he built strong relationships with his clients thanks to his passion and zeal for helping others reach and surpass their goals. But he quickly realized that he “didn’t want CNBC to dictate [his] life,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://houston.culturemap.com/news/innovation/01-16-12-09-44-taseer-badar-changes-the-way-physicians-invest/|title=A matter of trust: Taseer Badar has changed the way physicians invest|work=CultureMap Houston|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; so he returned to Houston and began a retail brokerage firm and began working with physicians who needed help investing their money.

== ZT Corporate to present ==
In 2001, an investor presented Taseer with an opportunity: new [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] technology. After some advice from his sister Dr. Tehmina Badar, a [[Pulmonology|pulmonologist]] ; brother-in-law Dr. Shahin Shirzadi, a [[Neurology|neurologist]]; and his best friend Dr. Raza Pasha, an ENT surgeon. Thus began Altus Health.

In 2014, sensing an opportunity to expand outside of healthcare, Taseer ventured into Florida and purchased several dealerships, including a Mercedes, BMW, Toyota, Kia, and Mazda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/blog/2015/08/meet-the-fast-100-houston-based-wealth-management.html|title=Meet the Fast 100: Houston-based wealth management firm blossoms in health care industry|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection would soon become ZT Motors, alongside President Garrick Hatfield, the former General Manager for Alex Rodriguez Mercedes-Benz. Seeing further opportunities, he soon diversified into [[Fast food restaurant|quick service restaurants]] (ZT Restaurants) and [[Sport management|sports management]] (ZT Sports).

Since 2008, the company has grown from $28M in portfolio revenues to more than $600 million in 2016.

== Philanthropy and Community Involvement ==
In 2017, Taseer and ZT Corporate partnered with the [[Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America]] (APPNA) to develop proactive healthcare to impoverished communities throughout the world through [[telemedicine]] initiatives and boots-on-the-ground programs. In addition, as part of Taseer’s commitment to building talent, ZT Corporate and APPNA provide educational opportunities to Pakistani students with untapped potential in the form of financial aid and housing, as well as competitive internships at ZT Corporate in the United States. “The APPNA organization has always been a shining star for [ZT Corporate],” Badar said. “It is probably one of the largest organizations within the physician community, and us being in healthcare and with a strong South Asian background, partnering with them is a big honor.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newswire.com/news/zt-wealth-goes-nationwide-by-joining-with-appna-19617959|title=ZT Wealth Goes Nationwide by Joining With APPNA|website=www.newswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taseer and his companies have also partnered in various capacities with organizations like Developments In Literacy (DIL), which provides educational opportunities to under-served students in Pakistan. In 2017, DIL thanked Taseer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kten.com/story/35980954/arthur-lawrence-hosts-taseer-badar-in-the-journey-towards-excellence|title=Arthur Lawrence Hosts Taseer Badar in the 'Journey Towards Excellence'|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his role in helping underprivileged children in Pakistan receive educational opportunities that would otherwise be out of their reach. In Houston, Taseer supports The Rose, a Houston-based organization focused on breast cancer awareness and treatment. His affinity for sports has led to exciting opportunities with athletes and their respective foundations, including the Carlos Beltran Baseball Academy Foundation, the Miguel and Vanessa Montero Foundation, and the Brandon Marshall Foundation, NFL wide receiver Brandon Marshall’s non-profit organization promoting mental health awareness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5935">'''Théodore Pescatore''' (6 February 1802 – 23 August 1878) was a [[Luxembourg]]ian politician.  One of the most important [[liberalism|liberals]] in the mid-19th century,&lt;ref name="Mersch 506"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 506&lt;/ref&gt; he was president of the [[Constituent Assembly of Luxembourg|Constituent Assembly]] that wrote [[Constitution of Luxembourg|Luxembourg's Constitution]] in 1848.  He later held the position of [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|President of the Chamber of Deputies]] for two years.

Pescatore studied law at the [[University of Liège]], but, instead of pursuing a career in the law, Pescatore attended a [[military academy]] in the [[Netherlands]], and, upon returning to Luxembourg, in 1827, he was recruited as a lieutenant into the guard of [[Luxembourg City]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 506" /&gt;  However, after three years, Pescatore's anti-[[Orangism (Luxembourg)|Orangist]] and pro-[[Belgium|Belgian]] political sympathies forced him out of the military.&lt;ref name="Mersch 506" /&gt;  Instead, he joined with his cousins to set up a [[faience]] factory in [[Eich, Luxembourg|Eich]], where his brother was mayor.&lt;ref name="Mersch 506" /&gt;  After seven years, they [[merger|merged]] into the ''Société d'industrie luxembourgeoise'',&lt;ref name="Mersch 506" /&gt; and Pescatore helped set up ''Auguste Metz &amp; Cie'' with [[Auguste Metz]] and his brothers [[Charles Metz|Charles]] and [[Norbert Metz|Norbert]].&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 550&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, he was appointed to the 'Commission of Nine' in [[the Hague]] that advised the [[King-Grand Duke]] on the Luxembourgian issues, including the drafting of a constitution.&lt;ref name="Mersch 507"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 507&lt;/ref&gt;  From 30 October 1841, he was a member of the [[Assembly of Estates]] for [[Mersch (Chamber of Deputies constituency)|Mersch]], and entered the Commission of Government under the governor, [[Gaspard-Théodore-Ignace de la Fontaine]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 507" /&gt;  Pescatore was charged with negotiating a treaty on the terms of Luxembourg's membership of the [[Zollverein]], in place of F. H. W. de Scherff, who had fallen ill.&lt;ref name="Mersch 508"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the 1848 [[Constituent Assembly of Luxembourg|Constituent Assembly]], representing [[Luxembourg (Chamber of Deputies constituency)|Luxembourg canton]].  Appointed the first chair of the constituent assembly, he advocated heavy involvement with the [[Frankfurt Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 508" /&gt;  In the elections to the first [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]] after the promulgation of the constitution, Pescatore ran for Luxembourg canton, and found himself in the unique position of being top of the electoral lists of all three parties.&lt;ref name="Mersch 509"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 509&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite having been in government before 1848, he showed no interest in returning afterwards,&lt;ref name="Mersch 508" /&gt; and remained a legislator, being elected Vice-President of the Chamber in 1852, with Charles Metz as President.&lt;ref name="Mersch 509" /&gt;  With the death of Metz the following year, Pescatore became the new [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|President of the Chamber]], whilst the [[Jean-Jacques Willmar|Willmar]] government was replaced by one under [[Charles-Mathias Simons]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 509" /&gt;

With, however, the death of Auguste Metz in 1855, and the subsequent retirement of Charles Metz, the radicals that formed Pescatore's support base withered, and he was replaced as President of the Chamber by [[Victor de Tornaco]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 510"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;  He decided to resign as deputy, as well, but returned when reelected at the head of the liberals' list in Luxembourg canton on 30 November 1857.&lt;ref name="Mersch 510"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned as President of the Chamber, being elected by 21 votes to 3.&lt;ref name="Mersch 511"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 511&lt;/ref&gt;  He held this position until 1866, when he stood down as President, and he retired as a deputy in 1869.&lt;ref name="Mersch 512"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 512&lt;/ref&gt;

Pescatore died on 23 August 1878 after a long illness.&lt;ref name="Mersch 512" /&gt;

'''Viral Marketing Research''' is a subset of [[marketing research]] that measures and compares the relative [[return on investment]] (ROI) of [[advertising]] and communication strategies designed to exploit [[social network]]s.

[[Algorithm]]s are used to derive respondent-level coefficients of '''[[Social Networking Potential]]''' (SNP). These coefficients are integrated with respondent-level data measuring 
#the ''selling effectiveness'' of specific communications and 
# the [[Viral Marketing Potential]] of those communications within specific media (e.g., Internet video, texting, print ads, television). 
Results identify strategies that are likely to drive sales among the target audience and be distributed throughout relevant social networks.
Viral marketing is more of online and when it is done offline it is called buzz marketing.

== Examples ==

An electronics manufacture is about to launch a new video console and wants to maximize new product potential. In advance of the launch, Viral Marketing Research is used to compare the relative ROI of several strategies of among high SNP respondents within the [[target audience]]. Results help the manufacturer maximize sales by identifying ''what needs to be communicated'' and ''through which media'' (e.g., print ads, Internet videos, texting, television). 

A pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug for an existing drug category and needs to build brand recognition. Viral Marketing Research could be conducted among physicians or patients to identify which communication strategies are most likely to be spread by [[word-of-mouth]], and which are likely to induce physicians/patients to prescribe/request the new drug. &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2989">{{Insolvency}}
In law, a '''voidable floating charge''' refers to a [[floating charge]] entered into shortly prior to the [[company (law)|company]] going into [[liquidation]] which is [[void (law)|void]] or [[unenforceable]] in whole or in part under applicable insolvency legislation.&lt;ref&gt;See for example section 245 of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and section 267 of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32) in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, a floating charge is only potentially vulnerable if it is entered into within the vulnerability period under applicable law. The vulnerability period is a period prescribed by statute immediately preceding the company going into liquidation. Most jurisdictions provide for alternative vulnerability periods: a longer one for parties who are "connected" to the company, and a shorter one for unrelated third parties.&lt;ref&gt; Under English law, a floating charge in favour of an unconnected third party is only vulnerable if the company goes into liquidation within the next 12 months, but a floating charge in favour of a connected person is vulnerable if the company goes into liquidation within the next 2 years.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of laws relating to voidable floating charges varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some countries simply provide that such charge are automatically void or not enforceable,&lt;ref&gt;Under English law they are stated to be "invalid", which is taken to mean unenforceable.&lt;/ref&gt; In other jurisdictions, they are only [[voidable]] and an application must be made by a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] or creditor for the floating charge to be set aside.

In most jurisdictions, a floating charge is only vulnerable to the extent that it does not secure new money for the company.&lt;ref&gt;See for example section 245(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; So if a bank has a loan of £100 outstanding to a company, and it advances a further £50 but takes an "all-monies" floating charge as security, and the company goes into liquidation 3 months later, the floating charge will validly secure the £50 advance which was made at the time, but not the earlier £100. Legislation relating to voidable floating charges is intended to prevent abuse of a [[security interest]] which catches literally all of the assets of the company, and could be used by person to strip out all of the assets from a company in difficulty from the [[unsecured creditor]]s. However, if the holder of the floating charge has inserted new money, then giving the holder a valid security up to the amount of the new money injected does not prejudice the position of the unsecured creditors.

Most legislation relating to voidable floating charges is also expressed to apply to charges which, as created, were floating charges but which subsequently crystallised into fixed charges.

The programme was established when [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]] began broadcasting in March 1994. It has been produced by the Business Programmes section of BBC Radio which produces for [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] and 5 Live in the Business and Economics unit. It began as a fifteen-minute programme, starting at 05:45, as part of the ''Morning Reports'' programme and moved to 05:30 in 2003. The format was updated in early 2014: the broadcast time was extended to 45 minutes with the show starting at 05:15.

Louise Cooper (Mon &amp; Tue) or Mickey Clarke (Wed-Fri) provides the shares news on the [[FTSE 100 Index]], the [[Commodity market|commodities price]]s and [[Foreign exchange market|currencies' market]]s, and has more knowledge of companies' financial performance, history, and corporate structure. Adam Parsons provides the personal finance (e.g. mortgages or insurance) knowledge. There is an element of (cheeky [[sarcasm]]) humour to the programme.

Executives from companies are invited for live discussions on the programme. Guests are often invited from [[Trade association|industry trade group]]s, such as the [[Confederation of British Industry|CBI]], [[Institute of Directors|IoD]], [[Federation of Small Businesses|FSB]], or government economic organisations, such as [[Business Link]], university business schools, or watchdogs.

In 2008/09, the banks featured heavily; rarely had a programme not mentioned the state of the UK banks or the [[Financial Services Authority]].

Frequent guests include [[David Buik]], and [[Justin Urquhart Stewart]] of Seven Investment Management.

{{For|whistleblower protection in the United States|Whistleblower protection in the United States}}

A '''whistleblower''' (also written as '''whistle-blower''' or '''whistle blower''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=whistleblower|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: whistleblower|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|website=www.ahdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a person who exposes any kind of information or activity that is deemed illegal, [[Ethics|unethical]], or not correct within an [[organization]] that is either private or public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Whistleblowing and Organizational Social Responsibility : A Global Assessment.|last = Vandekerckhove|first = Wim|publisher = Ashgate|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways: violation of company policy/rules, [[law]], [[regulation]], or threat to public interest/national security, as well as fraud, and [[corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Organizational dissidence: The case of whistle-blowing|last = Near|first = Janet P|date = Feb 1, 1985|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to surface either internally or externally. Internally, a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor. Externally, a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media, government, law enforcement, or those who are concerned. Whistleblowers, however, take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing.

Because of this, a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers. Some third party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far. Whistleblowers face legal action, criminal charges, social stigma, and termination from any position, office, or job. Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on: [[private sector]], or [[public sector]]. Depending on many factors, both can have varying results. However, whistleblowing in the public sector organization is more likely to result in criminal charges and possible custodial sentences. A whistleblower who chooses to accuse a private sector organization or agency is more likely to face termination and legal and civil charges.

Deeper questions and theories of whistleblowing and why people choose to do so can be studied through an [[ethical]] approach. Whistleblowing is a topic of ongoing ethical debate. Leading arguments in the ideological camp that whistleblowing is ethical maintain that whistleblowing is a form of civil disobedience, and aims to protect the public from government wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;Delmas, Candice. "The Ethics of Government Whistleblowing". ''Social Theory &amp; Practice''. Jan2015, Vol. 41 Issue 1, p77-105. 29p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alford, C. Fred. "Whistleblowers and the Narrative of Ethics". ''Journal of Social Philosophy''. Winter2001, Vol. 32 Issue 4, p402-418. 17p.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite camp, some see whistleblowing as unethical for breaching confidentiality, especially in industries that handle sensitive client or patient information.&lt;ref&gt;Firtko, Angela; Jackson, Debra. "Do the Ends Justify the Means? Nursing and the Dilemma of Whistleblowing". ''Australian Journal of Advanced Nursing''. Sep/Nov2005, Vol. 23 Issue 1, p51-56. 6p.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal protection can also be granted to protect whistleblowers, but that protection is subject to many stipulations. Hundreds of laws grant protection to whistleblowers, but stipulations can easily cloud that protection and leave whistleblowers vulnerable to retaliation and legal trouble. However, the decision and action has become far more complicated with recent advancements in technology and [[communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Ethics of Government Whisltleblowing|last = Delmas|first = Candice|date = January 2015|journal = Social Theory and Practice|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistleblowers frequently face [[reprisal]], sometimes at the hands of the organization or group they have accused, sometimes from related organizations, and sometimes under law. Questions about the legitimacy of whistleblowing, the [[moral responsibility]] of whistleblowing, and the appraisal of the institutions of whistleblowing are part of the field of [[political ethics]].

==Overview==

===Origin of term===
U.S. civic activist [[Ralph Nader]] is said to have coined the phrase, but he in fact put a positive spin on the term&lt;ref&gt;See: New Scientist 9 Dec. 1971, p. 69: "The Code [of Good Conduct of The British Computer Society] contains secrecy clauses that effectively prohibit Nader style whistle-blowing"&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1970s to avoid the negative connotations found in other words such as "informer" and "snitch".&lt;ref&gt;Nader, Petkas, and Blackwell, Whistleblowing (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the origins of the word date back to the [[19th century]].

The word is linked to the use of a [[whistle]] to alert the public or a crowd about a bad situation, such as the commission of a crime or the breaking of rules during a game. The phrase ''whistle blower'' attached itself to law enforcement officials in the 19th century because they used a whistle to alert the public or fellow police.&lt;ref name="Meaning and origin"&gt;{{cite web|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Whistle-blower|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/whistle-blower.html|website=The Phrase Finder|publisher=Gary Martin|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports referees, who use a whistle to indicate an illegal or foul play, also were called whistle blowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=whistleblower+&amp;searchmode=none |title=Etymonline.com |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/site/whistleblower/ |title=Wordorigins.org |publisher=Wordorigins.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1883 story in the ''Janesville Gazette'' called a policeman who used his whistle to alert citizens about a riot a ''whistle blower'', without the hyphen. By the year 1963, the phrase had become a hyphenated word, ''whistle-blower''. The word began to be used by journalists in the 1960s for people who revealed wrongdoing, such as Nader. It eventually evolved into the compound word ''whistleblower''.&lt;ref name="Meaning and origin" /&gt;

===Internal===
Most whistleblowers are internal whistleblowers, who report misconduct on a fellow employee or superior within their company through anonymous reporting mechanisms often called hotlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=|first=|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1305500846|location=|pages=194|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most interesting questions with respect to internal whistleblowers is why and under what circumstances do people either act on the spot to stop illegal and otherwise unacceptable behavior or report it.&lt;ref&gt;Dealing with—or reporting—"unacceptable" behavior (with additional thoughts about the "Bystander Effect") Mary Rowe MIT, Linda Wilcox HMS, Howard Gadlin NIH (2009), ''Journal of the International Ombudsman Association'' 2(1), online at [http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ ombudsassociation.org]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504071949/http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ |date=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some reasons to believe that people are more likely to take action with respect to unacceptable behavior, within an organization, if there are [[complaint systems]] that offer not just options dictated by the planning and control organization, but a ''choice'' of options for absolute confidentiality.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Rowe, "Options and choice for conflict resolution in the workplace" in ''Negotiation: Strategies for Mutual Gain'', by Lavinia Hall (ed.), Sage Publications, Inc., 1993, pp. 105–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anonymous reporting mechanisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/10/25/elements-of-an-effective-whistleblower-hotline/|title=Elements of an Effective Whistleblower Hotline|website=corpgov.law.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; as mentioned previously, help foster a climate whereby employees are more likely to report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. The coming anti-bribery management systems standard, [[ISO 37001]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=65034|title=ISO 37001:2016 - Anti-bribery management systems -- Requirements with guidance for use|website=www.iso.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes anonymous reporting as one of the criteria for the new standard.

===External===
External whistleblowers, however, report misconduct to outside persons or entities. In these cases, depending on the information's severity and nature, whistleblowers may report the misconduct to [[lawyer]]s, the [[Mass media|media]], [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or [[consumer protection|watchdog agencies]], or other local, state, or federal agencies. In some cases, external whistleblowing is encouraged by offering monetary reward.

===Third party===

The third party service involves utilizing an external agency to inform the individuals at the top of the organizational pyramid of misconduct, without disclosing the identity of the whistleblower. This is a relatively new phenomenon and has been developed due to whistleblower discrimination. International Whistleblowers is an example of an organization involved in delivering a third party service for whistleblowers.

An increasing number of companies and authorities use third party services in which the whistleblower is anonymous also towards the third party service provider. This is possible via toll free phone numbers configured not to record the whistleblower origin call, and also through web solutions which apply [[Public-key cryptography|asymmetrical encryption]].

===Private sector whistleblowing===
Private sector whistleblowing, though not as high profile as public sector whistleblowing, is arguably more prevalent and suppressed in society today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Rise of the Whistleblower and the Death of Privacy Impact of 9/11 and Enron|last = Castagnera|first = James|date = Spring 2003|journal = Labor Law Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply because private corporations usually have stricter regulations that suppress potential whistleblowers. An example of private sector whistleblowing is when an employee reports to someone in a higher position such as a manager, or a third party that is isolated from the individual chapter, such as their lawyer or the police. In the private sector corporate groups can easily hide wrongdoings by individual branches. It is not until these wrongdoings bleed into the top officials that corporate wrongdoings are seen by the public. Situations in which a person may blow the whistle are in cases of violated laws or company policy, such as sexual harassment or theft. These instances, nonetheless, are small compared to [[money laundering]] or [[fraud]] charges on the [[stock market]]. Whistleblowing in the private sector is typically not as high-profile or openly discussed in major news outlets, though occasionally, third parties expose human rights violations and [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Where am I wearing?|last = Timmerman|first = Kelsey|publisher = California: Wiley|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are organizations such as the [[United States Department of Labor]] (DOL), and laws in place such as the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] and the [[United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] for Organizations (FSGO) which protects whistleblowers in the private sector, many employees still fear for their jobs due to direct or indirect threats from their employers or the other parties involved. In an effort to overcome those fears, in 2010 [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] was put forth to provide great incentive to whistleblowers. For example, if a whistleblower gave information which could be used to legally recover over one million dollars; then they could receive ten to thirty percent of it.

Despite government efforts to help regulate the private sector, the employees must still weigh their options. They either expose the company and stand the moral and ethical high ground; or expose the company, lose their job, their reputation and potentially the ability to be employed again. According to a study at the University of Pennsylvania, out of three hundred whistleblowers studied, sixty nine percent of them had foregone that exact situation; and they were either fired or were forced to retire after taking the ethical high ground. It is outcomes like that which makes it all that much harder to accurately track how prevalent whistleblowing is in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Case 10th Edition|last=|first=|publisher=O.C. Ferrell, John Fraedich, Linda Ferrell|year=2014|isbn=978-1285423715|location=|pages=193|quote=|via=Cengage Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public sector whistleblowing===
[[File:Praha, Magistrát, konference, Libor Michálek.jpg|thumb|170px|Czech whistleblower [[Libor Michálek]] was fired from his position after exposing high-level corruption]]
Recognizing the public value of whistleblowing has been increasing over the last 50 years. In the United States, both state and Federal statutes have been put in place to protect whistleblowers from retaliation. The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that public sector whistleblowers are protected under [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights from any job retaliation when they raise flags over alleged corruption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing|url = http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Whistleblowing|access-date = 2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposing misconduct or illegal or dishonest activity is a big fear for public employees because they feel they are going against their government and country. Private sector whistleblowing protection laws were in place long before ones for the public sector. After many federal whistleblowers were scrutinized in high-profile media cases, laws were finally introduced to protect government whistleblowers. These laws were enacted to help prevent corruption and encourage people to expose misconduct, illegal, or dishonest activity for the good of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblower Retaliation in the Public Sector|last = Lee|first = Katie|date = 2011|journal = Public Personnel Management|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who choose to act as whistleblowers often suffer retaliation from their employer. They most likely are fired because they are an [[at-will employee]], which means they can be fired without a reason. There are exceptions in place for whistleblowers who are at-will employees. Even without a statute, numerous decisions encourage and protect whistleblowing on grounds of public policy. Statutes state that an employer shall not take any adverse employment actions any employee in retaliation for a good-faith report of a whistleblowing action or cooperating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or lawsuit arising under said action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Federal whistleblower legislation includes a statute protecting all government employees. In the federal civil service, the government is prohibited from taking, or threatening to take, any personnel action against an employee because the employee disclosed information that he or she reasonably believed showed a violation of law, gross mismanagement, and gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public safety or health. To prevail on a claim, a federal employee must show that a protected disclosure was made, that the accused official knew of the disclosure, that retaliation resulted, and that there was a genuine connection between the retaliation and the employee's action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Harm ===
{{Copyedit section|date=October 2018}}
Individual harm, public trust damage, and a threat of national security are three categories of harm that may come to whistleblowers. Revealing a whistleblower's identity automatically puts their life in harm. Some media outlets associate words like "traitor" and "treason" with whistleblowers, and many countries around the world associate treason with the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], even though whoever allegedly committed treason may or may not have caused anyone physical harm.  A primary reason for the death penalty is the potential endangerment of an entire people, the perpetrator therefore being responsible for any harm to come as a result. US law states{{which|date=October 2018}},

"...whoever knowingly and willfully communicates, furnishes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, or publishes, or uses in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interest of the United States or for the benefit of any foreign government to the detriment of the United States any classified information."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 18 U.S. Code § 798 - Disclosure of classified information|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798|website = LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Ethics of Government Whistleblowing|last = Delmas|first = Candice|date = January 1, 2015|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public trust dates back to the days of the Vietnam War. Henry Kissinger once said that the purpose of "those who stole" the Pentagon Papers was to "undermine confidence in their government" and "raise doubts about our reliability in the minds of other governments, friend and foe, and indeed about the stability of our political system."

Emotional strain on the accused from the whistleblower is also unconstrained.  When a leader challenges a whistleblower, there is an automatic indictment of the leader's character.&lt;ref name="tbo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbo.com/list/news-opinion-commentary/william-mcraven-a-warriors-career-sacrificed-for-politics-20160424/|title=William McRaven: A warrior’s career sacrificed for politics|date=24 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questioning the whistleblower makes the accused guilty until proven innocent.

=== Common reactions ===
Whistleblowers are sometimes seen as selfless [[Martyr (politics)|martyrs]] for public interest and organizational [[accountability]]; others view them as "traitors" or "defectors."  Some even accuse them of solely pursuing personal glory and fame, or view their behavior as motivated by greed in [[qui tam]] cases.  Some academics (such as [[Thomas Alured Faunce]]) feel that whistleblowers should at least be entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they are attempting to apply ethical principles in the face of obstacles and that whistleblowing would be more respected in [[governance]] systems if it had a firmer academic basis in [[virtue ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Faunce, T.A. "Developing and Teaching the Virtue-Ethics Foundations of Healthcare Whistle Blowing", ''Monash Bioethics Review''. 2004; 23(4): 41–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faunce, T.A. and Jefferys, S. "Whistleblowing and scientific misconduct: Renewing legal and virtue ethics foundations". ''Journal of Medicine and Law'' 2007, '''26(3)''': 567–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is probable that many people do not even consider blowing the whistle, not only because of fear of retaliation, but also because of fear of losing their relationships at work and outside work.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Mary &amp; Bendersky, Corinne, "Workplace Justice, Zero Tolerance and Zero Barriers: Getting People to Come Forward in Conflict Management Systems," in ''Negotiations and Change, From the Workplace to Society'', Thomas Kochan and Richard Locke (eds), Cornell University Press, 2002. See also "Dealing with&amp;nbsp;— or Reporting&amp;nbsp;— 'Unacceptable' Behavior (With additional thoughts about the 'Bystander Effect')" ©2009Mary Rowe MIT, Linda Wilcox HMS, Howard Gadlin NIH, ''Journal of the International Ombudsman Association'' 2(1), online at [http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ ombudsassociation.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504071949/http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ |date=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Persecution of whistleblowers'' has become a serious issue in many parts of the world:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Employees in academia, business or government might become aware of serious risks to health and the environment, but internal policies might pose threats of retaliation to those who report these early warnings. Private company employees in particular might be at risk of being fired, demoted, denied raises and so on for bringing environmental risks to the attention of appropriate authorities. Government employees could be at a similar risk for bringing threats to health or the environment to public attention, although perhaps this is less likely.&lt;ref name=late&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/late-lessons-2 |title=Late lessons from early warnings: science, precaution, innovation: Full Report |author=European Environment Agency) |date=Jan 23, 2013 |page=614 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are examples of "early warning scientists" being harassed for bringing inconvenient truths about impending harm to the notice of the public and authorities. There have also been cases of young scientists being discouraged from entering controversial scientific fields for fear of [[harassment]].&lt;ref name=late/&gt;

Whistleblowers are often protected under law from employer retaliation, but in many cases punishment has occurred, such as [[termination of employment|termination]], [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]], [[demotion]], [[wage garnishment]], and/or harsh [[mistreatment]] by other employees. A 2009 study found that up to 38% of whistleblowers experienced professional retaliation in some form, including wrongful termination.{{Citation needed|reason=previous citation of "Miceli, M. P., Near, J. P., &amp; Dworkin, T. M. (2009). Journal of Business Ethics." didn't clearly indicate a source that supports the claim.|date=January 2017}} For example, in the United States, most whistleblower protection laws provide for limited "make whole" remedies or damages for employment losses if whistleblower retaliation is proven. However, many whistleblowers report there exists a widespread "[[Shooting the messenger|shoot the messenger]]" mentality by corporations or government agencies accused of misconduct and in some cases whistleblowers have been subjected to criminal prosecution in reprisal for reporting wrongdoing.

As a reaction to this many private organizations have formed whistleblower [[legal defense fund]]s or support groups to assist whistleblowers; three such examples are the ''National Whistleblowers Center''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowers.org/ |title=whistleblowers.org |publisher=whistleblowers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States]], and ''Whistleblowers UK''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbuk.org/ |title=wbuk.org |publisher=wbuk.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Public Concern at Work]] (PCaW)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcaw.co.uk |title=pcaw.co.uk |publisher=pcaw.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United Kingdom]]. Depending on the circumstances, it is not uncommon for whistleblowers to be ostracized by their co-workers, discriminated against by future potential employers, or even fired from their organization. This campaign directed at whistleblowers with the goal of eliminating them from the organization is referred to as [[mobbing]]. It is an extreme form of [[workplace bullying]] wherein the group is set against the targeted individual.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiesen SB, Bjorkelo B, Burke RJ "Workplace Bullying as the Dark Side of Whistleblowing" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological impact ===
There is limited research on the psychological impacts of whistle blowing. However, poor experiences of whistleblowing can cause a prolonged and prominent assault upon staff well being.

The social impact of whistleblowing through loss of livelihood (and sometimes pension), and family strain may also impact on whistleblowers’ psychological well being. Whistleblowers may also experience immense stress as a result of litigation regarding detriments such as unfair dismissal, which they often face with imperfect support or no support at all from unions. Whistleblowers who continue to pursue their concerns may also face long battles with official bodies such as regulators and government departments.&lt;ref name="Eye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="first" /&gt; Such bodies may reproduce the "institutional silence" by employers, adding to whistleblowers’ stress and difficulties.&lt;ref name="Parliament"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpubacc/593/593.pdf Public Accounts Committee Report of Inquiry into Whistleblowing, Ninth Report of Session 2014–15])&lt;/ref&gt; In all, some whistleblowers suffer great injustice, that may never be acknowledged or rectified.&lt;ref name="Lennane2" /&gt; Such extreme experiences of threat and loss inevitably cause severe distress and sometimes mental illness, sometimes lasting for years afterwards. This mistreatment also deters others from coming forward with concerns. Thus, poor practices remain hidden behind a wall of silence, and prevent any organization from experiencing the improvements that may be afforded by intelligent failure.&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parliament" /&gt; Some whistleblowers who part ranks with their organizations have had their mental stability questioned, such as [[Adrian Schoolcraft]], the [[NYPD]] veteran who alleged falsified crime statistics in his department and was forcibly committed to a mental institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/10/cop-nypd-psych-ward-whistleblowing/|title=Cop hauled off to psych ward after alleging fake crime stats|website=www.rawstory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the emotional strain of a whistleblower investigation is devastating to the accused's family.&lt;ref name="tbo.com"/&gt;

=== Ethics ===
The definition of [[ethics]] is the [[moral]] [[principles]] that govern a person's or group's behavior. The ethical implications of whistleblowing can be negative as well as positive. However, sometimes employees may blow the whistle as an act of revenge. [[Rosemary O'Leary]] explains this in her short volume on a topic called [[guerrilla]] government. "Rather than acting openly, guerrillas often choose to remain "in the closet," moving clandestinely behind the scenes, salmon swimming upstream against the current of power. Over the years, I have learned that the motivations driving guerrillas are diverse. The reasons for acting range from the [[altruistic]] (doing the right thing) to the seemingly petty (I was passed over for that promotion). Taken as a whole, their acts are as awe inspiring as saving human lives out of a love of humanity and as trifling as slowing the issuance of a report out of spite or anger."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ethics of Dissent: Managing Guerrilla Government|last = O'Leary|first = Rosemary|publisher = CQ|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Washington D.C.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, of the more than 1,000 whistleblower complaints that are filed each year with the Pentagon's Inspector General, about 97 percent are not substantiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/04/25/commander-of-bin-laden-raid-blasts-senate-for-disrespecting-military-leaders/|title=Commander of bin Laden raid blasts Senate for disrespecting military leaders|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed throughout the professional world that an individual is bound to secrecy within their work sector. Discussions of whistleblowing and employee loyalty usually assume that the concept of loyalty is irrelevant to the issue or, more commonly, that whistleblowing involves a moral choice that pits the loyalty that an employee owes an employer against the employee's responsibility to serve the public interest.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing and Employee Loyalty|last = Larmer|first = Robert A.|date = Feb 1992|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert A. Larmer describes the standard view of whistleblowing in the [[Journal of Business Ethics]] by explaining that an employee possesses [[prima facie]] (based on the first impression; accepted as correct until proved otherwise) duties of loyalty and confidentiality to their employers and that whistleblowing cannot be justified except on the basis of a higher duty to the [[public good]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is important to recognize that in any relationship which demands loyalty the relationship works both ways and involves mutual enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing and Employee Loyalty|last = Duska|first = Ronald|date = Feb 1992|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of Edward Snowden's actions have been widely discussed and debated in news media and academia worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Mark. "EDWARD SNOWDEN: HERO OR TRAITOR? CONSIDERING THE IMPLICATIONS FOR CANADIAN NATIONAL SECURITY AND WHISTLEBLOWER LAW".&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Snowden released [[Classified information|classified]] intelligence to the American people in an attempt to allow Americans to see the inner workings of the government. A person is diligently tasked with the [[wikt:conundrum|conundrum]] of choosing to be loyal to the company or to blow the whistle on the company's wrongdoing. Discussions on whistleblowing generally revolve around three topics: attempts to define whistleblowing more precisely, debates about whether and when whistleblowing is permissible, and debates about whether and when one has an obligation to blow the whistle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Issues in Business Ethics|last = |first = |publisher = Springer|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = 139–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motivations ===
Many whistleblowers have stated that they were motivated to take action to put an end to unethical practices, after witnessing injustices in their businesses or organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Alexander J. "Using Scholarship on Whistleblowing to Inform Peer Ethics Reporting". Professional Psychology: Research &amp; Practice. Aug2015, Vol. 46 Issue 4: p298–305. 8p.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study found that whistleblowers are often motivated to take action when they notice a sharp decline in ethical practices, as opposed to a gradual worsening.&lt;ref&gt;Gino, F., &amp; Bazerman, M. H. (2009). When misconduct goes unnoticed: The acceptability of gradual erosion in others' unethical behavior. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 45(4), 708-719.&lt;/ref&gt; There are generally two metrics by which whistleblowers determine if a practice is unethical. The first metric involves a violation of the organization's bylaws or written ethical policies. These violations allow individuals to concretize and rationalize blowing the whistle.&lt;ref&gt;Kaptein, Muel (2011). "From Inaction to External Whistleblowing: The Influence of the Ethical Culture of Organizations on Employee Responses to Observed Wrongdoing". Journal of Business Ethics. 98: 513.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, "value-driven" whistleblowers are influenced by their personal codes of ethics. In these cases, whistleblowers have been criticized for being driven by personal biases.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, J. P., &amp; McLain, D. A. (1992). Whistleblowing: A conceptualization and model. In Wall, J. L., &amp; Jauch, K. R. (Eds.), Academy of Management Best Papers Proceedings, August 10–12, Las Vegas, NV, 350–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ethics, social and organizational pressure are a motivating forces. A 2012 study identified that individuals are more likely to blow the whistle when several others know about the wrongdoing, because they would otherwise fear consequences for keeping silent.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, S. N., Robertson, J. C., &amp; Curtis, M. B. "The Effects of Contextual and Wrongdoing Attributes on Organizational Employees' Whistleblowing Intentions Following Fraud." Journal of Business Ethics. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In cases when one person is causing an injustice, the individual who notices the injustice may file a formal report, rather than confronting the wrongdoer, because confrontation would be more emotionally and psychologically stressful.&lt;ref&gt;de Graaf, Gjalt (2010).

==Legality of whistleblowing==
Legal protection for whistleblowing varies from country to country and may depend on the country of the original activity, where and how secrets were revealed, and how they eventually became published or publicized. Over a dozen countries have now adopted comprehensive whistleblower protection laws that create mechanisms for reporting wrongdoing and provide legal protections to whistleblowers. Over 50 countries have adopted more limited protections as part of their anti-corruption, freedom of information, or employment laws.&lt;ref&gt;Banisar, "Whistleblowing: International Standards and Developments", in CORRUPTION AND TRANSPARENCY: DEBATING THE FRONTIERS BETWEEN STATE, MARKET AND SOCIETY, I.

===Australia===
{{main article|Whistleblower protection in Australia}}
There are laws in a number of states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Whistleblowers Australia |url=http://www.whistleblowers.org.au/ |publisher=Whistleblowers.org.au }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former NSW Police Commissioner Tony Lauer summed up official government and police attitudes as: "Nobody in Australia much likes whistleblowers, particularly in an organization like the police or the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Caillier |first=J.G. |date=2015 |title=Transformational Leadership and Whistle-Blowing Attitudes Is This Relationship Mediated by Organizational Commitment and Public Service Motivation? |journal=The American Review of Public Administration |volume=45(4) |pages=458-475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada (PSIC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psic-ispc.gc.ca/|title=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada|first=Web Experience|last=Toolkit|website=www.psic-ispc.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a safe and confidential mechanism enabling public servants and the general public to disclose wrongdoings committed in the public sector. It also protects from reprisal public servants who have disclosed wrongdoing and those who have cooperated in investigations. The Office's goal is to enhance public confidence in Canada's federal public institutions and in the integrity of public servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=Background, Objectives, Scope|url=http://www.psic.gc.ca/eng/content/background-objectives-scope|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandated by the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act (The Act), PSIC is a permanent and independent Agent of Parliament. The Act, which came into force on April 15, 2007, applies to most of the federal public sector, approximately 400,000 public servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=The Servants Disclosure Protection Act|url=http://www.psic.gc.ca/eng/aboutus/psdpa|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes government departments and agencies, parent Crown corporations, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other federal public sector bodies.

Not all disclosures lead to an investigation as the Act sets out the jurisdiction of the Commissioner and gives the option not to investigate under certain circumstances. On the other hand, if PSIC conducts an investigation and finds no wrongdoing was committed, the Commissioner must report his findings to the discloser and to the organization's chief executive. Also, reports of founded wrongdoing are presented before the House of Commons and the Senate in accordance with The Act. As of June 2014, a total of 9 reports have been tabled in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=Case Reports|url=http://www.psic-ispc.gc.ca/eng/wrongdoing/casereports|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also established the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal (PSDPT) to protect public servants by hearing reprisal complaints referred by the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner. The Tribunal can grant remedies in favour of complainants and order disciplinary action against persons who take reprisals.

PSIC's current Commissioner is Mr. Mario Dion. Previously, he has served in various senior roles in the public service, including as Associate Deputy Minister of Justice, Executive Director and Deputy Head of the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada, and as Chair of the National Parole Board.

===European Union===

The [[European Parliament]] approved a "Whistleblower Protection Directive" containing broad [[free speech]] protections for whistleblowers in both the public and the private sectors, including for [[journalist]]s, in all member states of the [[European Union]]. The Directive prohibits direct or indirect retaliation against employees, current and former, in the public sector and the private sector. The Directive's protections apply to employees, to volunteers, and  to those who assist them, including to [[civil society]] organizations and to journalists who report on their evidence. It provides equal rights for whistleblowers in the national security sector who challenge denial or removal of their security clearances. Also, whistleblowers are protected from criminal prosecution and corporate lawsuits for damages resulting from their whistleblowing, and provides for psychological support for dealing with harassment stress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Government Accountability Project]], 21 Nov. 2018, "[https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/11/21/european-parliament-panel-approves-whistleblower-protections-all-eu-countries European Parliament Panel Approves Whistleblower Protections for all EU Countries]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Good government]] observers have hailed the EU directive as setting "the global standard for [[best practice]] rights protecting freedom of speech where it counts the most—challenging abuses of power that betray the [[public trust]]," according to the U.S.-based [[Government Accountability Project]]. They have noted, however, that ambiguities remain in the Directive regarding application in some areas, such as "duty speech," that is, when employees report the same information as part of a job assignment, for example, to a supervisor, instead of whistleblowing as formal [[dissent]]. In fact, duty speech is how the overwhelming majority of whistleblowing information gets communicated, and where the free flow of information is needed for proper functioning of organizations. However it is in response to such "duty speech" employee communication that the vast majority of retaliation against employees occurs. These observers have noted that the Directive must be understood as applying to protection against retaliation for such duty speech because without such an understanding the Directive will "miss the iceberg of what’s needed.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Government Accountability Project]], 21 Nov. 2018, "[https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/11/21/european-parliament-panel-approves-whistleblower-protections-all-eu-countries European Parliament Panel Approves Whistleblower Protections for all EU Countries]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jamaica===

It creates a comprehensive system for the protection of whistleblowers in the public and private sector. It is based on the [[Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998]].

===India===
{{main article|Whistleblower protection in India}}
The [[Government of India]] has been considering adopting a whistleblower protection law for several years. In 2003, the Law Commission of India recommended the adoption of the Public Interest Disclosure (Protection of Informers) Act, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/179rptp2.pdf |title=Publin Interest Disclosure Bill |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, the Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 was introduced into the [[Lok Sabha]], lower house of the [[Parliament of India]].&lt;ref&gt;The Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 [http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/postoftheday/PIDPPMDBill-2010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill was approved by the cabinet in June, 2011.

The Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2011 has received the Presidential assent on May 9, 2014 and the same has been subsequently published in the official gazette of the Government of India on May 9, 2014 by the Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India.

===Ireland===
The government of [[Ireland]] committed to adopting a comprehensive whistleblower protection law in January 2012. The bill reportedly covers both the public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Whistleblower Bill to cover public and private sectors |newspaper=Irish Times |date=30 January 2011 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0130/1224310944604.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands has measures in place to mitigate the risks of whistleblowing: the whistleblower advice centre (Adviespunt Klokkenluiders) offers advice to whistleblowers, and the Parliament recently passed a proposal to establish a so-called house for whistleblowers, to protect them from the severe negative consequences that they might endure (Kamerstuk, 2013). Dutch media organizations also provide whistleblower support; on 9 September 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vanaf vandaag: anoniem lekken naar media via doorgeefluik Publeaks|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2694/Tech-Media/article/detail/3506349/2013/09/09/Vanaf-vandaag-anoniem-lekken-naar-media-via-doorgeefluik-Publeaks.dhtml|publisher=volkskrant.nl|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of major Dutch media outlets supported the launch of Publeaks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publeaks.nl|title=Publeaks - Veilig en anoniem informatie delen met de pers|website=www.publeaks.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which provides a secure website for people to leak documents to the media.

===Switzerland===
The Swiss [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Council of States]] agreed on a draft amendment of the [[Swiss Code of Obligations]] in September 2014. The draft introduces articles 321a&lt;sup&gt;bis&lt;/sup&gt; to 321a&lt;sup&gt;septies&lt;/sup&gt;, 328(3), 336(2)(d).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schutz bei Meldung von Unregelmässigkeiten am Arbeitsplatz|url=http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/federal-gazette/2013/9589.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment of article 362(1) adds articles 321a&lt;sup&gt;bis&lt;/sup&gt; to 321a&lt;sup&gt;septies&lt;/sup&gt; to the list of provisions that may not be overruled by labour and bargaining agreements.&lt;br /&gt;
Article 321a&lt;sup&gt;ter&lt;/sup&gt; introduces an obligation on employees to report irregularities to their employer before reporting to an authority. An employee will, however, not breach his duty of good faith if he reports an irregularity to an authority and
* a period set by the employer and no longer than 60 days has lapsed since the employee has reported the incident to his employer, and
* the employer has not addressed the irregularity or it is obvious that the employer has insufficiently addressed the irregularity.
Article 321a&lt;sup&gt;quarter&lt;/sup&gt; provides that an employee may exceptionally directly report to an authority. Exceptions apply in cases
* where the employee is in a position to objectively demonstrate that a report to his employer will prove ineffective,
* where the employee has to anticipate dismissal,
* where the employee must assume that the competent authority will be hindered in investigating the irregularity, or
* where there is a direct and serious hazard to life, to health, to safety, or to the environment.
The draft does not improve on protection against dismissal for employees who report irregularities to their employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Botschaft über die Teilrevision des Obligationenrechts |url=http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/federal-gazette/2013/9513.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment does not provide for employees [[Anonymity|anonymously]] filing their observations of irregularities.

===United Kingdom===
Whistleblowing in the United Kingdom is subject to the [[Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998|Public Interest Disclosure Act]] (PIDA) 1998.

The [[Freedom to Speak Up Review]] set out 20 principles to bring about improvements to help whistleblowers in the [[National Health Service|NHS]], including:
* Culture of raising concerns&amp;nbsp;– to make raising issues a part of normal routine business of a well-led NHS organization.
* Culture free from bullying&amp;nbsp;– freedom of staff to speak out relies on staff being able to work in a culture which is free from bullying.
* Training&amp;nbsp;– every member of staff should receive training in their trust's approach to raising concerns and in receiving and acting on them.
* Support&amp;nbsp;– all NHS trusts should ensure there is a dedicated person to whom concerns can be easily reported and without formality, a "speak up guardian" .

[[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]] produced a whistleblowing policy in November 2015 that all NHS organizations in England are obliged to follow.  It explicitly says that anyone bullying or acting against a whistleblower could be potentially liable to disciplinary action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monitor to reveal national whistleblowing policy|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/workforce/exclusive-monitor-to-reveal-national-whistleblowing-policy/7000188.article|accessdate=18 December 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Whistleblower protection in the United States}}
Whistleblowing tradition in the United States started with [[Benjamin Franklin]] leaking a [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|few letters Hutchinson had written to Thomas Whately]], resulting in the [[American Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- Strike this entire sentence.  Franklin leaked these letters in 1773, 16 years before the "United States" was incorporated under the ratified Constitution in 1789.  There's no way to support that Franklin "started" the "tradition" of leaking embarrassing information.  Probably more accurate to attribute that honor to John Peter Zenger, but again, we're talking about the tradition within the British empire.  Also, there are dozens of "causes" of the American Revolution.  I have never heard of anyone citing the Hutchinson letter affair as one of them.    --&gt;

To be considered a whistleblower in the [[United States]], most federal whistleblower statutes require that [[federal employee]]s have reason to believe their employer violated some law, rule, or regulation; testify or commence a legal proceeding on the legally protected matter; or refuse to violate the law.

In cases where whistleblowing on a specified topic is protected by statute, U.S. courts have generally held that such whistleblowers are protected from retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oalj.dol.gov/PUBLIC/WHISTLEBLOWER/REFERENCES/REFERENCE_WORKS/EDIG12.HTM |title=DOL.gov |publisher=Oalj.dol.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a closely divided [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision, ''[[Garcetti v. Ceballos]]'' (2006) held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] [[free speech]] guarantees for government employees do not protect disclosures made within the scope of the employees' duties.

In the United States, legal protections vary according to the subject matter of the whistleblowing, and sometimes the state where the case arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peer.org/state/index.php |title=Peer.org |publisher=Peer.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In passing the 2002 [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]], the Senate Judiciary Committee found that whistleblower protections were dependent on the "patchwork and vagaries" of varying state statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record p. S7412; S. Rep. No. 107–146, 107th Cong., 2d Session 19 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Still, a wide variety of federal and state laws protect employees who call attention to violations, help with enforcement proceedings, or refuse to obey unlawful directions. While this patchwork approach has often been criticized, it also responsible for the United States having more dedicated whistleblowing laws than any other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transatlantic Whistleblowing.|last = Gerdemann|first = Simon|publisher = Mohr Siebeck|year = 2018|isbn = 978-3-16-155917-4|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first US law adopted specifically to protect whistleblowers was the 1863 United States [[False Claims Act]] (revised in 1986), which tried to combat fraud by suppliers of the United States government during the [[American Civil War]]. The Act encourages whistleblowers by promising them a percentage of the money recovered by the government and by protecting them from employment retaliation.&lt;ref name="answers1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/whistleblower |title=Answers.com |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another US law that specifically protects whistleblowers is the [[Lloyd–La Follette Act]] of 1912. It guaranteed the right of federal employees to furnish information to the [[United States Congress]]. The first US environmental law to include an employee protection was the [[Clean Water Act]] of 1972. Similar protections were included in subsequent federal environmental laws, including the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (1974), [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (1976), [[Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976]], [[Energy Reorganization Act of 1974]] (through 1978 amendment to protect nuclear whistleblowers), [[Superfund|Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or the Superfund Law)]] (1980), and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] (1990). Similar employee protections enforced through OSHA are included in the [[Surface Transportation Assistance Act]] (1982) to protect truck drivers, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act (PSIA) of 2002, the [[Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century]] ("AIR 21"), and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, enacted on July 30, 2002 (for corporate fraud whistleblowers).

Investigation of retaliation against whistleblowers under 20 federal statutes falls under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Whistleblower Protection Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowers.gov |title=Whistleblowers.gov |publisher=Whistleblowers.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States Department of Labor|United States Department of Labor's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov |title=DOL.gov |publisher=DOL.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov |title=Osha.gov |publisher=Osha.gov |date=2012-04-28 |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; New whistleblower statutes enacted by Congress, which are to be enforced by the Secretary of Labor, are generally delegated by a Secretary's Order&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER&amp;p_id=21749 |title=Osha.gov |publisher=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to OSHA's Office of the Whistleblower Protection Program (OWPP).

The patchwork of laws means that victims of retaliation need to be aware of the laws at issue to determine the deadlines and means for making proper complaints. Some deadlines are as short as 10 days (Arizona State Employees have 10 days to file a "Prohibited Personnel Practice" Complaint before the Arizona State Personnel Board), while others are up to 300 days.

Those who report a false claim against the federal government, and suffer adverse employment actions as a result, may have up to six years (depending on state law) to file a civil suit for remedies under the US [[False Claims Act]] (FCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|31|3730}} (h)&lt;/ref&gt; Under a ''[[qui tam]]'' provision, the "original source" for the report may be entitled to a percentage of what the government recovers from the offenders. However, the "original source" must also be the first to file a federal civil complaint for recovery of the federal funds fraudulently obtained, and must avoid publicizing the claim of fraud until the [[United States Department of Justice|US Justice Department]] decides whether to prosecute the claim itself. Such ''qui tam'' lawsuits must be filed under seal, using special procedures to keep the claim from becoming public until the federal government makes its decision on direct prosecution.

[[File:Edward Snowden-2.jpg|thumb|170px|American whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]]]]
[[Espionage Act of 1917|The Espionage Act of 1917]] has been used to prosecute whistleblowers in the United States including [[Edward Snowden]] and [[Chelsea Manning]]. In 2013, Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act and sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking sensitive military documents to [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref&gt;Madar, Chase. "The Trials of Bradley Manning". Nation. 8/19/2013, Vol. 297 Issue 7/8, p12-17. 5p.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Snowden was charged with violating the Espionage Act for releasing confidential documents belonging to the [[National Security Agency|NSA]].&lt;ref&gt;Bamford, James. "Watch Thy Neighbor". Foreign Policy. Mar/Apr2016, Issue 217, p76-79. 3p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 922 of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] (Dodd-Frank) in the United States incentivizes and protects whistleblowers.&lt;ref&gt;"Dodd-Frank Section 922" (PDF). sec.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; By Dodd-Frank, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) financially rewards whistleblowers for providing original information about violations of federal securities laws that results in sanctions of at least $1M.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"Dodd-Frank Act Rulemaking: Whistleblower Program". www.sec.gov.

Spring2012, Vol. 69 Issue 2, p1201-1257. 57p.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Dodd-Frank offers job security to whistleblowers by illegalizing termination or discrimination due to whistleblowing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AGARWAL, TAPAS. "ANTI-RETALIATION PROTECTION FOR INTERNAL WHISTLEBLOWERS UNDER DODD-F RANK FOLLOWING THE FIFTH CIRCUIT'S DECISION IN ASADI". St. Mary's Law Journal.

Oct2014, Vol. 113 Issue 1, p121-149. 29p.&lt;/ref&gt; The whistleblower provision has proven successful; after the enactment of Dodd-Frank, the SEC charged KBR (company) and BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (company) with violating the whistleblower protection Rule 21F-17 by having employees sign confidentiality agreements that threatened repercussions for discussing internal matters with outside parties.&lt;ref&gt;"SEC.gov | SEC: Companies Cannot Stifle Whistleblowers in Confidentiality Agreements". www.sec.gov.

The federally recognized [[National Whistleblower Appreciation Day]] is observed annually on July 30, on the anniversary of the country's original 1778 whistleblower protection law.

===Other countries===
There are comprehensive laws in [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]. A number of other countries have recently adopted comprehensive whistleblower laws including [[Ghana]], [[South Korea]], and [[Uganda]]. They are also being considered in [[Kenya]] and [[Rwanda]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in 2008 that whistleblowing was protected as freedom of expression. And in February 2017, [[Nigeria]] also set up the whistleblowing policy against corruption and other ills in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Guja v. Moldova, Application no. 14277/04 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy for whistleblower rights and protections==
Many [[NGOs]] advocate for stronger and more comprehensive legal rights and protections for whistleblowers. Among them are the [[Government Accountability Project]] (GAP), Blueprint for Free Speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blueprintforfreespeech.net/|title=Blueprint for Free Speech – Meet the whistleblowers|website=blueprintforfreespeech.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public Concern at Work]] (PCaW) and the Open Democracy Advice Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.org.za/|title=Home|first=Super|last=User|website=www.opendemocracy.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern methods used for whistleblower protection ==
Whistleblowers that may be at risk of those they are exposing are now using [[encryption]] methods and anonymous content sharing software to protect their identity. [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], a highly accessible anonymity network, is one that is frequently used by whistleblowers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec11/tech/full_papers/Mittal.pdf|title = PIR-Tor: Scalable Anonymous Communication Using Private Information Retrieval.|last = Mittal|first = Prateek|date = 2001|journal = USENIX Security Symposium|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tor has undergone a number of large security updates to protect the identities of potential whistleblowers who may wish to anonymously leak information.&lt;ref&gt;"Security upgrade for 'anonymity network'". New Scientist. 8/11/2007, Vol. 195 Issue 2616, p23-23. 1p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently specialized whistleblowing software like [[SecureDrop]] and [[GlobaLeaks]] has been built on top of the Tor technology in order to incentivize and simplify its adoption for secure whistleblowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frediani|first1=Carola|title=After NSA Scandal, Crop of Whistleblower Communication Tools for Journalists Emerge|url=http://techpresident.com/news/24526/after-NSA-whistleblower-tools-for-journalists|website=[[TechPresident]]|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=Whistleblowers Beware: Apps Like Whisper and Secret Will Rat You Out|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/whistleblowers-beware/|website=[[Wired (website)]]|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

In 2016, the rock band [[Thrice]] released a song titled "Whistleblower" off of the album ''[[To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere]]''. The song is written from the perspective of Snowden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Montemarano|first1=Mike|url=http://www.baeblemusic.com/musicblog/4-25-2016/blood-on-the-sand-a-conversation-with-thrice.html |title='Blood on the Sand:' A Conversation With Thrice |publisher=Baeble Music |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, [[CBS]] will debut a new reality television show entitled "[[Whistleblower_(U.S._TV_program)|Whistleblower]]", hosted by lawyer, former judge and police officer [[Alex Ferrer]] which will cover [[qui tam]] suits under the [[False Claims Act]] against companies that have allegedly defrauded the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/07/17/plaintiffs-lawyers-get-tv-time-as-cbs-launches-whistleblower-reality-show/?slreturn=20180618111845|title=Plaintiffs Lawyers Get TV Time as CBS Launches Whistleblower Reality Show {{!}} The American Lawyer|work=The American Lawyer|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1682">{{Japanese name|Yasuda}}
The '''Yasuda clan''' was a [[Japan]]ese [[samurai]] kin group in the [[Sengoku period]] and [[Edo period]].&lt;ref name="morikawa61"&gt;Morikawa, Hidemasa. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=pCMHQSfAPt4C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq= ''A History of Top Management in Japan: Managerial Enterprises and Family Enterprises,'' p. 61].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The clan was established by Oe Hiromoto.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In the Sengoku period, a branch of the Yasuda clan was made responsible for the collection of duties on the cloth trade.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, Brian. (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=eOiRmUmQGbYC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=yasuda+clan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2KKCUcruIabj4AOT7YGwAg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=yasuda%20clan&amp;f=false  ''Amassing Economies: The Medieval Origins of Early Modern Japan, 1450-1700,'' p. 262].&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern history, the Yasuda are known as a "financial clan" because of their success in banking.&lt;ref&gt;Lonien, Claude. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=RbT3CC4X-BcC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq= ''The Japanese Economic and Social System: From a Rocky Past  to an Uncertain Future,'' p. 44].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zoomdata''' is a [[Reston, Virginia|Reston]], [[Virginia]]-based [[data visualization]] and [[analytics]] company founded in 2012.&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt;

==Technology==

Zoomdata markets a [[data visualization]] and analytics tool that allows customers to explore and analyze the vast quantities of data in their datastores. The product is different from other tools in the industry due to a patent the company holds around “Data Sharpening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/06/zoomdata-scores-17m-to-disrupt-the-business-intelligence-market-again/|title=Zoomdata Scores $17M to Help Update the Business Intelligence Market|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightreading.com/analytics/analytics-systems/zoomdata-raises-$17m-to-beautify-big-data/d/d-id/711258/|title=Zoomdata Raises $17m to Beautify Big Data=LightReading- Reedy, Sarah|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach involves returning the results of a query that is run instantly, while the image ‘sharpens’ and becomes clearer as more data is processed. The product includes a connector studio that directly connects to database, search, streaming, flat file and in-memory data sources. Matt Asay of readwrite.com compared it watching a streaming movie, where you see some results immediately, soon followed by the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Asay|first1=Matt|title=Finally—Business Intelligence Comes To Big Data|url=https://readwrite.com/2014/11/11/business-intelligence-big-data-zoomdata-justin-langseth|website=readwrite.com|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoomdata also gives users access to the company’s [[D3.js]]-based Visualization Studio to edit D3 code and create custom visualizations from within the tool. With the Visualization Studio, users can “live-code” and view changes they are making as they type. In July 2015, Zoomdata launched early access program for visual analysis and fusion of big data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://insidebigdata.com/2015/07/26/zoomdata-launches-early-access-program-for-visual-analysis-and-fusion-of-big-data/|title=Zoomdata Launches Early Access Program for Visual Analysis and Fusion of Big Data - insideBIGDATA|date=2015-07-26|work=insideBIGDATA|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards &amp; Recognition==

In June 2016, Zoomdata won the Big Data and Analytics Innovation Award in the annual Hot Tickets competition hosted by The Northern Virginia Technology Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-business/wp/2016/06/28/here-are-the-n-va-technology-councils-2016-hot-ticket-winners/|title=Here are the N.
