      <comment>The introduction paragraph needed some work. The AMF file format was removed, file format should be in its own section as there are a handful of formats that can be used in 3DP. The SLS and FDM references did not make sense to be there when there are so many other processes. The reference on FDM was not truly related to what FDM is, it was a research paper that for a specific application of FDM.</comment>

{{History of printing}}
'''3D printing''' is any of various processes in which material is joined or solidified under computer control to create a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] object,&lt;ref name="engineer"/&gt; with material being added together (such as liquid molecules or powder grains being fused together). 3D printing is used in both [[rapid prototyping]] and '''additive manufacturing'''. Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and typically are produced using digital model data from a [[3D modeling|3D model]]. There are many different [[3D printing processes|technologies]], used in the 3D printing process. The most common&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/560304/worldwide-survey-3d-printing-top-technologies/|title=Most used 3D printing technologies 2017-2018 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; by number of users being [[Fused filament fabrication#Fused%20deposition%20modeling|fused deposit modeling]] (FDM).  Thus, unlike material removed from a stock in the conventional machining process, 3D printing or Additive Manufacturing builds a three-dimensional object from a computer-aided design (CAD) model, usually by successively adding material layer by layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taufik|first1=Mohammad|last2=Jain|first2=Prashant K.|title= Role of build orientation in layered manufacturing: a review|journal= International Journal of Manufacturing Technology and Management|date=12 January 2014|volume=27|issue= 1/2/3|pages= 47–73|doi= 10.1504/IJMTM.2013.058637}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bin Hamzah|first=Hairul Hisham|last2=Keattch|first2=Oliver|last3=Covill|first3=Derek|last4=Patel|first4=Bhavik Anil|date=|year=2018|title= The effects of printing orientation on the electrochemical behaviour of 3D printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)/carbon black electrodes |url= https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27188-5 |publisher=Nature Publishing group|volume=8|pages=9135|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27188-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "3D printing" originally referred to a process that deposits a [[binder material]] onto a powder bed with [[inkjet printer]] heads layer by layer. More recently, the term is being used in popular vernacular to encompass a wider variety of additive manufacturing techniques. United States and global [[technical standard]]s use the official term ''additive manufacturing'' for this broader sense.

== Terminology ==
The [[umbrella term]] ''additive manufacturing (AM)'' gained wide currency in the 2000s,&lt;ref name="Ngram_additive_manufacturing" /&gt; inspired by the theme of material being added together ([[3D printing processes|in any of various ways]]). In contrast, the term ''subtractive manufacturing'' appeared as a [[retronym]] for the large family of [[machining]] processes with material ''removal'' as their common theme. The term ''3D printing'' still referred only to the polymer technologies in most minds, and the term ''AM'' was likelier to be used in metalworking and end use part production contexts than among polymer, inkjet, or stereolithography enthusiasts.

By the early 2010s, the terms ''3D printing'' and ''additive manufacturing'' evolved [[word sense|senses]] in which they were alternate umbrella terms for additive technologies, one being used in popular vernacular by consumer-maker communities and the media, and the other used more formally by industrial end-use part producers, machine manufacturers, and global technical standards organizations. Until recently, the term ''3D printing'' has been associated with machines low-end in price or in capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/69669.html|title=ISO/ASTM 52900:2015 - Additive manufacturing -- General principles -- Terminology|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both terms reflect that the technologies share the theme of material addition or joining throughout a 3D work envelope under automated control. Peter Zelinski, the editor-in-chief of ''Additive Manufacturing'' magazine, pointed out in 2017 that the terms are still often [[synonym]]ous in casual usage&lt;ref name="Zelinski_2017-08-04"&gt;{{Citation |last=Zelinski |first=Peter |date=4 August 2017 |title=Additive manufacturing and 3D printing are two different things |journal=Additive Manufacturing |url=http://www.additivemanufacturing.media/columns/additive-manufacturing-and-3d-printing-are-two-different-things |accessdate=2017-08-11 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that some manufacturing industry experts are increasingly making a sense distinction whereby Additive Manufacturing [[hyponymy and hypernymy|comprises]] 3D printing plus other technologies or other aspects of a [[manufacturing process]].&lt;ref name="Zelinski_2017-08-04"/&gt;

Other terms that have been used as synonyms or [[hyponymy and hypernymy|hypernyms]] have included ''desktop manufacturing'', ''rapid manufacturing'' (as the logical production-level successor to ''[[rapid prototyping]]''), and ''on-demand manufacturing'' (which echoes ''[[print on demand|on-demand printing]]'' in the 2D sense of ''printing''). That such application of the adjectives ''rapid'' and ''on-demand'' to the noun ''manufacturing'' was novel in the 2000s reveals the prevailing [[mental model]] of the long industrial era in which almost all production manufacturing involved long [[lead time]]s for laborious tooling development. Today, the term ''subtractive'' has not replaced the term ''machining'', instead [[wikt:complement#Verb|complementing]] it when a term that covers any removal method is needed. [[Agile tooling]] is the use of modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods to enable quick [[Prototype|prototyping]] and responses to tooling and fixture needs. Agile tooling uses a cost effective and high quality method to quickly respond to customer and market needs, and it can be used in [[Hydroforming|hydro-forming]], [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamping]], [[Injection molding machine|injection molding]] and other manufacturing processes.

== History ==
'''1981''' : Early additive manufacturing equipment and materials were developed in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="3D opp" /&gt; In 1981, Hideo Kodama of [[Nagoya]] Municipal Industrial Research Institute invented two additive methods for fabricating three-dimensional plastic models with photo-hardening [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset polymer]], where the [[UV exposure]] area is controlled by a mask pattern or a scanning fiber transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;Hideo Kodama, "A Scheme for Three-Dimensional Display by Automatic Fabrication of Three-Dimensional Model," IEICE Transactions on Electronics (Japanese Edition), vol. J64-C, No. 4, pp. 237–41, April 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hideo Kodama, "Automatic method for fabricating a three-dimensional plastic model with photo-hardening polymer," ''Review of Scientific Instruments'', Vol. 52, No. 11, pp. 1770–73, November 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1984''' : On 16 July 1984, [[Alain Le Mehaute|Alain Le Méhauté]], [[Olivier de Witte]], and [[Jean Claude André]] filed their patent for the [[stereolithography]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bases-brevets.inpi.fr/fr/document/FR2567668/publications.html|title=Disdpositif pour realiser un modele de piece industrielle|last=Jean-Claude|first=Andre|newspaper=National De La Propriete Industrielle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the French inventors was abandoned by the [[French General Electric Company]] (now Alcatel-Alsthom) and [[CILAS]] (The Laser Consortium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3dprint.com/65466/reflections-alain-le-mehaute/|title=Alain Le Méhauté, The Man Who Submitted Patent For SLA 3D Printing Before Chuck Hull|last=Mendoza|first=Hannah Rose|date=15 May 2015|publisher=3dprint.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claimed reason was "for lack of business perspective".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.primante3d.com/inventeur|title=Interview d’Alain Le Méhauté, l’un des pères de l’impression (Interview of Alain Le Mehaute, one of the 3D printinf technologies fathers) 3D|last=Moussion|first=Alexandre|date=2014|newspaper=Primante 3D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks later in 1984, [[Chuck Hull]] of [[3D Systems]] Corporation&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-1" /&gt; filed his own patent for a [[stereolithography]] fabrication system, in which layers are added by curing [[photopolymers]] with [[ultraviolet light]] [[laser]]s. Hull defined the process as a "system for generating three-dimensional objects by creating a cross-sectional pattern of the object to be formed,".&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-5" /&gt; Hull's contribution was the [[STL (file format)|STL (Stereolithography) file format]] and the digital slicing and infill strategies common to many processes today.

'''1988''': The technology used by most 3D printers to date—especially hobbyist and consumer-oriented models—is [[fused deposition modeling]], a special application of plastic [[extrusion]], developed in 1988 by [[S. Scott Crump]] and commercialized by his company [[Stratasys]], which marketed its first FDM machine in 1992.

AM processes for metal sintering or melting (such as [[selective laser sintering]], [[direct metal laser sintering]], and selective laser melting) usually went by their own individual names in the '''1980s''' and '''1990s'''. At the time, all metalworking was done by processes that we now call non-additive ([[casting]], [[metal fabrication|fabrication]], [[stamping (metalworking)|stamping]], and [[machining]]); although plenty of [[automation]] was applied to those technologies (such as by [[robot welding]] and [[numerical control|CNC]]), the idea of a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of [[raw material]] into a desired shape with a toolpath was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal (rather than adding it), such as CNC [[milling (machining)|milling]], CNC [[electrical discharge machining|EDM]], and many others. But the automated techniques that ''added'' metal, which would later be called additive manufacturing, were beginning to challenge that assumption. By the mid-1990s, new techniques for material deposition were developed at [[Stanford]] and [[Carnegie Mellon University]], including microcasting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amon|first=C.

'''1993''' : The term ''3D printing'' originally referred to a powder bed process employing standard and custom [[inkjet]] print heads, developed at [[MIT]] in 1993 and commercialized by Soligen Technologies, Extrude Hone Corporation, and [[Z Corporation]].

The year 1993 also saw the start of a company called [[Solidscape]], introducing a high-precision polymer jet fabrication system with soluble support structures, (categorized as a "dot-on-dot" technique).

'''1995''': In 1995 the [[Fraunhofer Institute]] developed the [[selective laser melting]] process.

'''2009''': Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printing process patents expired in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/15/how-expiring-patents-are-ushering-in-the-next-generation-of-3d-printing/|title=How expiring patents are ushering in the next generation of 3D printing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the various additive processes matured, it became clear that soon metal removal would no longer be the only [[metalworking]] process done through a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer.  The '''2010s''' were the first decade in which metal end use parts such as engine brackets&lt;ref name="GrabCAD_GE_bracket" /&gt; and large nuts&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-6" /&gt; would be grown (either before or instead of machining) in [[job production]] rather than [[wikt:obligate#Adjective|obligately]] being machined from [[bar stock]] or plate.  It is still the case that casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining are more prevalent than additive manufacturing in metalworking, but AM is now beginning to make significant inroads, and with the advantages of [[design for additive manufacturing]], it is clear to engineers that much more is to come.

As technology matured, several authors had begun to speculate that 3D printing could aid in [[sustainable development]] in the developing world.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-27" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=r.Ishengoma|first2=Fredrick|year=2014|title=3D Printing: Developing Countries Perspectives|journal=International Journal of Computer Applications|volume=104|issue=11|page=30|bibcode=2014IJCA..104k..30R|doi=10.5120/18249-9329|last1=b.

=== Modeling ===

[[File:Fantasitron photo booth at Madurodam can scan up to two people at a time IMG 3797 FRD.jpg|thumb|3D models are generated from 2D pictures taken at the Fantasitron 3D photo booth at [[Madurodam]]]]

{{Main|3D modeling}}
3D printable models may be created with a [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) package, via a [[3D scanner#Hand-held laser scanners|3D scanner]], or by a plain [[digital camera]] and [[photogrammetry software]]. 3D printed models created with CAD result in reduced errors and can be corrected before printing, allowing verification in the design of the object before it is printed.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rapid Prototyping &amp; Manufacturing: Fundamentals of Stereolithography|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=HvcN0w1VyxwC}}|publisher=Society of Manufacturing Engineers|date=1 January 1992|isbn=978-0-87263-425-1|first=Paul Francis|last=Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting. 3D scanning is a process of collecting digital data on the shape and appearance of a real object, creating a digital model based on it. 

CAD models can be saved in the [[STL (file format)|stereolithography file format (STL)]], a de facto CAD file format for additive manufacturing that stores data based on triangulations of CAD models. STL is not tailored for additive manufacturing because it generates large file sizes of topology optimized parts and lattice structures due to the large number of surfaces involved. A newer CAD file format, the [[Additive manufacturing file format|Additive Manufacturing File format (AMF)]] was introduced in 2011 to solve this problem. It stores information using curved triangulations. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azman|first=Abdul Hadi|last2=Vignat|first2=Frédéric|last3=Villeneuve|first3=François|date=2018-04-29|title=CAD TOOLS AND FILE FORMAT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION IN DESIGNING LATTICE STRUCTURES FOR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING|url=https://jurnalteknologi.utm.my/index.php/jurnalteknologi/article/view/12058|journal=Jurnal Teknologi|language=en|volume=80|issue=4|issn=2180-3722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before printing a 3D model from an [[STL (file format)|STL]] file, it must first be examined for errors. Most [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] applications produce errors in output STL files,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://print.limitstate.com/ |title=3D solid repair software – Fix STL polygon mesh files – LimitState:FIX |publisher=Print.limitstate.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellowgurl.com/best-3d-pens-reviews/ |title= 3D Printing Pens |publisher=yellowgurl.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the following types:
#holes;
#faces normals;
#self-intersections;
#noise shells;
#manifold errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://modelrepair.azurewebsites.net/ |title=Model Repair Service |publisher=Modelrepair.azurewebsites.net |date= |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A step in the STL generation known as "repair" fixes such problems in the original model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://software.materialise.com/magics |title=Magics, the Most Powerful 3D Printing Software &amp;#124; Software for additive manufacturing |publisher=Software.materialise.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netfabb.com/netfabbcloud.php |title=netfabb Cloud Services |publisher=Netfabb.com |date=15 May 2009 |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally STLs that have been produced from a model obtained through [[3D scanner|3D scanning]] often have more of these errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anamarva.com/how-to-repair-a-3d-scan-for-printing/ |title=How to repair a 3D scan for printing |publisher=Anamarva.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to how 3D scanning works-as it is often by point to point acquisition, reconstruction will include errors in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fausto Bernardini, [[Holly Rushmeier|Holly E. Rushmeier]] |title=The 3D Model Acquisition Pipeline GAS |journal=Comput. Graph. Forum |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=149–72 |year=2002 |url=http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~allen/PHOTOPAPERS/pipeline.fausto.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1111/1467-8659.00574}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Once completed, the STL file needs to be processed by a piece of software called a "slicer," which converts the model into a series of thin layers and produces a [[G-code]] file containing instructions tailored to a specific type of 3D printer ([[Fused deposition modeling|FDM printers]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This G-code file can then be printed with 3D printing client software (which loads the G-code, and uses it to instruct the 3D printer during the 3D printing process).

Printer resolution describes layer thickness and X–Y resolution in [[dots per inch]] (dpi) or [[micrometer]]s (µm). Typical layer thickness is around {{convert|100|pitch|dpi|lk=on}}, although some machines can print layers as thin as {{convert|16|pitch|dpi}}.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-17" /&gt; X–Y resolution is comparable to that of [[laser printer]]s. The particles (3D dots) are around {{convert|50|to|100|pitch|dpi}} in diameter.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} For that printer resolution, specifying a mesh resolution of {{nowrap|0.01–0.03 mm}} and a chord length {{nowrap|≤ 0.016 mm}} generate an optimal STL output file for a given model input file.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/340051/Design_Guides/Xometry_DesignGuide_3DPrinting.pdf?submissionGuid=d1681094-eb0b-46c0-9e8a-b265cf26f5be|title=Design Guide: Preparing a File for 3D Printing|last=|first=|date=|website=Xometry|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifying higher resolution results in larger files without increase in print quality.

Construction of a model with contemporary methods can take anywhere from several hours to several days, depending on the method used and the size and complexity of the model. Additive systems can typically reduce this time to a few hours, although it varies widely depending on the type of machine used and the size and number of models being produced simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.3dprinterprices.net/advantages-of-3d-printing-over-traditional-manufacturing-2/|title=Advantages of 3D printing over traditional manufacturing|date=10 July 2013|newspaper=3DPrinterPrices.net|access-date=2017-02-16|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional techniques like [[injection moulding]] can be less expensive for manufacturing [[polymer]] products in high quantities, but additive manufacturing can be faster, more flexible and less expensive when producing relatively small quantities of parts. 3D printers give designers and concept development teams the ability to produce parts and concept models using a desktop size printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to 3D-print super-fast and have an awesome finishing|url=https://3dprinterchat.com/2016/02/how-to-print-super-fast-and-have-a-awesome-finishing-check-out/|access-date=5 May 2016|work=3dprinterchat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finishing ===
Though the printer-produced resolution is sufficient for many applications, printing a slightly oversized version of the desired object in standard resolution and then removing material&lt;ref name="smooth" /&gt; with a higher-resolution subtractive process can achieve greater precision.

The layered structure of all Additive Manufacturing processes leads inevitably to a strain-stepping effect on part surfaces which are curved or tilted in respect to the building platform. The effects strongly depend on the orientation of a part surface inside the building process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delfs|first=P.|last2=T̈ows|first2=M.|last3=Schmid|first3=H.-J.|date=October 2016|title=Optimized build orientation of additive manufactured parts for improved surface quality and build time|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2214860416301142|journal=Additive Manufacturing|volume=12|pages=314–320|doi=10.1016/j.addma.2016.06.003|issn=2214-8604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some additive manufacturing techniques are capable of using multiple materials in the course of constructing parts. These techniques are able to print in multiple colors and color combinations simultaneously, and would not necessarily require painting.

Some printing techniques require internal supports to be built for overhanging features during construction. These supports must be mechanically removed or dissolved upon completion of the print.

All of the commercialized metal 3D printers involve cutting the metal component off the metal substrate after deposition. A new process for the [[GMAW]] 3D printing allows for substrate surface modifications to remove [[aluminum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/3dp.2014.0015 |title=Substrate Release Mechanisms for Gas Metal Arc Weld 3D Aluminum Metal Printing |journal=3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing |volume=1 |issue=4 |page=204 |year=2014 |last1=Haselhuhn |first1=Amberlee S. |last2=Gooding |first2=Eli J. |last3=Glover |first3=Alexandra G. |last4=Anzalone |first4=Gerald C. |last5=Wijnen |first5=Bas |last6=Sanders |first6=Paul G. |last7=Pearce |first7=Joshua M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[steel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2015.06.038 |title=In situ formation of substrate release mechanisms for gas metal arc weld metal 3-D printing |journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology |volume=226 |page=50 |year=2015 |last1=Haselhuhn |first1=Amberlee S. |last2=Wijnen |first2=Bas |last3=Anzalone |first3=Gerald C. |last4=Sanders |first4=Paul G. |last5=Pearce |first5=Joshua M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of additive processes are available. The main differences between processes are in the way layers are deposited to create parts and in the materials that are used. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, which is why some companies offer a choice of powder and polymer for the material used to build the object.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-7" /&gt; Others sometimes use standard, off-the-shelf business paper as the build material to produce a durable prototype. The main considerations in choosing a machine are generally speed, costs of the 3D printer, of the printed prototype, choice and cost of the materials, and color capabilities.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-8" /&gt; Printers that work directly with metals are generally expensive. However less expensive printers can be used to make a mold, which is then used to make metal parts.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-9" /&gt;

ISO/ASTM52900-15 defines seven categories of Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes within its meaning: binder jetting, directed energy deposition, material extrusion, material jetting, powder bed fusion, sheet lamination, and vat photopolymerization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astm.org/Standards/ISOASTM52900.htm Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing – General Principles – Terminology]. ASTM International. September 2013, Retrieved 2016-07-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Some methods melt or soften the material to produce the layers. In [[Fused filament fabrication]], also known as [[Fused deposition modeling]] (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of [[thermoplastic]], metal wire, or other material is fed into an [[extrusion]] nozzle head ([[3D printer extruder]]), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Selective Heat Sintering Works |url=https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/powder-bed-fusion/selective-heat-sintering-shs |publisher=THRE3D.com |accessdate=3 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203071153/https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/powder-bed-fusion/selective-heat-sintering-shs |archivedate=3 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, FFF/FDM has expanded to 3-D print directly from pellets to avoid the conversion to filament. This process is called fused particle fabrication (FPF) (or fused granular fabrication (FGF) and has the potential to use more recycled materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woern|first=Aubrey|last2=Byard|first2=Dennis|last3=Oakley|first3=Robert|last4=Fiedler|first4=Matthew|last5=Snabes|first5=Samantha|date=2018-08-12|title=Fused Particle Fabrication 3-D Printing: Recycled Materials’ Optimization and Mechanical Properties|url=https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/11/8/1413|journal=Materials|language=en|volume=11|issue=8|pages=1413|doi=10.3390/ma11081413|pmc=6120030|pmid=30103532|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laser sintering techniques include [[selective laser sintering]], with both metals and polymers, and [[direct metal laser sintering]].&lt;ref name="DMLS" /&gt; [[Selective laser melting]] does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties similar to those of conventional manufactured metals. [[Electron beam melting]] is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. [[titanium alloy]]s). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto3D-13" /&gt; Another method consists of an [[Powder bed and inkjet head 3D printing|inkjet 3D printing]] system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder ([[plaster]], or [[resin]]s) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With [[laminated object manufacturing]], thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [[File:Schematic representation of Stereolithography.png|thumb|Schematic representation of Stereolithography; a light-emitting device ''a)'' (laser or DLP) selectively illuminate the transparent bottom ''c)'' of a tank ''b)'' filled with a liquid photo-polymerizing resin; the solidified resin ''d)'' is progressively dragged up by a lifting platform ''e)'']] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as [[stereolithography]]. [[Photopolymerization]] is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the ''Objet PolyJet'' system spray [[photopolymer]] materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30&amp;nbsp;µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is [[Curing (chemistry)|cured]] with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in [[two-photon absorption|multiphoton]] photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100&amp;nbsp;nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-15" /&gt; Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using [[LED]]s.&lt;ref name="Auto3D-16" /&gt;

In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it in the shape of the layer.&lt;ref name="k1113" /&gt; [[Continuous liquid interface production]] begins with a pool of liquid [[photopolymer]] [[resin]]. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to [[ultraviolet light]] (the "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object.&lt;ref name="St. Fleur"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/3d-printing-just-got-100-times-faster/388051/|title=3-D Printing Just Got 100 Times Faster|last=St. Fleur|first=Nicholas|date=17 March 2015|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11837-015-1759-z |title=Review of Mechanical Properties of Ti-6Al-4V Made by Laser-Based Additive Manufacturing Using Powder Feedstock |journal=JOM |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=724 |year=2015 |last1=Beese |first1=Allison M. |last2=Carroll |first2=Beth E. |bibcode=2016JOM....68c.724B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3 |title=Additive Manufacturing Technologies |year=2015 |last1=Gibson |first1=Ian |last2=Rosen |first2=David |last3=Stucker |first3=Brent |isbn=978-1-4939-2112-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2017, additive manufacturing systems were on the market that ranged from $99 to $500,000 in price and were employed in industries including aerospace, architecture, automotive, defense, and medical replacements, among many others. For example, [[General Electric]] uses the high-end model to build parts for [[turbine]]s.&lt;ref name="cfr2013" /&gt; Many of these systems are used for rapid prototyping, before mass production methods are employed. Higher education has proven to be a major buyer of desktop and professional 3D printers which industry experts generally view as a positive indicator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bold.global/jordan-brehove/2015/12/02/despite-market-woes-3d-printing-has-a-future-thanks-to-higher-education/|title=Despite Market Woes, 3D Printing Has a Future Thanks to Higher Education - Bold|date=2 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Libraries around the world have also become locations to house smaller 3D printers for educational and community access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2015/03/technology/umass-amherst-library-opens-3d-printing-innovation-center/#_|title=UMass Amherst Library Opens 3-D Printing Innovation Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several projects and companies are making efforts to develop affordable 3D printers for home desktop use.

Vanessa Friedman, fashion director and chief fashion critic at The New York Times, says 3D printing will have a significant value for fashion companies down the road, especially if it transforms into a print-it-yourself tool for shoppers. "There's real sense that this is not going to happen anytime soon," she says, "but it will happen, and it will create dramatic change in how we think both about intellectual property and how things are in the supply chain." She adds: "Certainly some of the fabrications that brands can use will be dramatically changed by technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alvarez|first1=Edgar|title=Fashion and technology will inevitably become one|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/23/the-future-of-fashion-and-technology/|website=Engagdet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3D printed soft [[actuators]] is a growing application of 3D printing technology which has found its place in the 3D printing applications. These soft actuators are being developed to deal with soft structures and organs especially in biomedical sectors and where the interaction between human and robot is inevitable. The majority of the existing soft actuators are fabricated by conventional methods that require manual fabrication of devices, post processing/assembly, and lengthy iterations until maturity in the fabrication is achieved. To avoid the tedious and time-consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes, researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for effective fabrication of soft actuators. Thus, 3D printed soft actuators are introduced to revolutionise the design and fabrication of soft actuators with custom geometrical, functional, and control properties in a faster and inexpensive approach. They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external [[joint]]s, [[adhesive]]s, and [[fastener]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sna.2016.09.028 |title=Evolution of 3D printed soft actuators |journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical |volume=250 |pages=258–272 |year=2016 |last1=Zolfagharian |first1=Ali |last2=Kouzani |first2=Abbas Z. |last3=Khoo |first3=Sui Yang |last4=Moghadam |first4=Amir Ali Amiri |last5=Gibson |first5=Ian |last6=Kaynak |first6=Akif }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal aspects ==

=== Intellectual property ===
{{See also|Free hardware}}
3D printing has existed for decades within certain manufacturing industries where many legal regimes, including [[patent]]s, [[industrial design right]]s, [[copyright]], and [[trademark]] may apply. However, there is not much [[jurisprudence]] to say how these laws will apply if 3D printers become mainstream and individuals or hobbyist communities begin manufacturing items for personal use, for non-profit distribution, or for sale.

Any of the mentioned legal regimes may prohibit the distribution of the designs used in 3D printing, or the distribution or sale of the printed item. To be allowed to do these things, where an active intellectual property was involved, a person would have to contact the owner and ask for a licence, which may come with conditions and a price.  However, many patent, design and copyright laws contain a standard limitation or exception for 'private', 'non-commercial' use of inventions, designs or works of art protected under intellectual property (IP).  That standard limitation or exception may leave such private, non-commercial uses outside the scope of IP rights.

Patents cover inventions including processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter and have a finite duration which varies between countries, but generally 20 years from the date of application. Therefore, if a type of wheel is patented, printing, using, or selling such a wheel could be an infringement of the patent.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-82" /&gt;

Copyright covers an expression&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; in a tangible, fixed medium and often lasts for the life of the author plus 70&amp;nbsp;years thereafter.&lt;ref name="deal" /&gt; If someone makes a statue, they may have copyright on the look of that statue, so if someone sees that statue, they cannot then distribute designs to print an identical or similar statue.

When a feature has both artistic (copyrightable) and functional (patentable) merits, when the question has appeared in US court, the courts have often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can be separated from the functional aspects of the item.&lt;ref name="deal" /&gt; In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing, for example, the design of a useful device to be registered (as a whole) as an industrial design on the understanding that, in case of unauthorized copying, only the non-functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a valid patent.

=== Gun legislation and administration ===
{{main|3D printed firearms}}
The US [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and the [[Joint Regional Intelligence Center]] released a memo stating that "significant advances in three-dimensional (3D) printing capabilities, availability of free digital 3D printable files for firearms components, and difficulty regulating file sharing may present public safety risks from unqualified gun seekers who obtain or manufacture 3D printed guns" and that "proposed legislation to ban 3D printing of weapons may deter, but cannot completely prevent, their production. Even if the practice is prohibited by new legislation, online distribution of these 3D printable files will be as difficult to control as any other illegally traded music, movie or software files."&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-83" /&gt;

Attempting to restrict the distribution of gun plans via the Internet has been likened to the futility of preventing the widespread distribution of [[DeCSS]], which enabled DVD [[ripping]].&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-90" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-92" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-93" /&gt; After the US government had Defense Distributed take down the plans, they were still widely available via the [[The Pirate Bay|Pirate Bay]] and other file sharing sites.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-94" /&gt; Downloads of the plans from the UK, Germany, Spain, and Brazil were heavy.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-88" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-89" /&gt; Some US legislators have proposed regulations on 3D printers to prevent them from being used for printing guns.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-95" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-96" /&gt; 3D printing advocates have suggested that such regulations would be futile, could cripple the 3D printing industry, and could infringe on free speech rights, with early pioneer of 3D printing Professor [[Hod Lipson]] suggesting that gunpowder could be controlled instead.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-100" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-101" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-102" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-103" /&gt;

Internationally, where gun controls are generally stricter than in the United States, some commentators have said the impact may be more strongly felt since alternative firearms are not as easily obtainable.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-84" /&gt; Officials in the United Kingdom have noted that producing a 3D printed gun would be illegal under their gun control laws.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-85" /&gt; [[Europol]] stated that criminals have access to other sources of weapons but noted that as technology improves, the risks of an effect would increase.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-86" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-87" /&gt;

=== Aerospace regulation ===
In the United States, the FAA has anticipated a desire to use additive manufacturing techniques and has been considering how best to regulate this process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spacenews.com/faa-prepares-guidance-for-wave-of-3d-printed-aerospace-parts/ Debra Werner, ''FAA prepares guidance for wave of 3D-printed aerospace parts'' (20 October 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The FAA has jurisdiction over such fabrication because all aircraft parts must be made under FAA production approval or under other FAA regulatory categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5;node=14:1.0.1.3.9#se14.1.21_19|title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations|website=www.ecfr.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2016, the FAA approved the production of a 3D printed fuel nozzle for the GE LEAP engine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/faa-launch-eight-year-additive-manufacturing-road-map-123108/ Beau Jackson, ''FAA to launch eight-year additive manufacturing road map'' (21 October 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Aviation attorney Jason Dickstein has suggested that additive manufacturing is merely a production method, and should be regulated like any other production method.&lt;ref name="arsa.org"&gt;[http://arsa.org/news-media/newsletters/2017-edition-4/ Jason Dickstein, ''Additive Manufacturing – Does it Fit into the Regulations?'', ARSA Hotline (5 May 2017) (explaining how to treat additive manufacturing under the FAA's existing production regulations)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mro-network.com/safety-regulatory/embracing-drones-and-3d-printing-regulatory-framework See Brett Levanto, ''Embracing Drones and 3D Printing In The Regulatory Framework'', MRO Network (10 Jan 2018) (describing the Dickstein article)]&lt;/ref&gt;  He has suggested that the FAA's focus should be on guidance to explain compliance, rather than on changing the existing rules, and that existing regulations and guidance permit a company "to develop a robust quality system that adequately reflects regulatory needs for quality assurance."&lt;ref name="arsa.org"/&gt;

Research on the health and safety concerns of 3D printing is new and in development due to the recent proliferation of 3D printing devices.  In 2017 the [[European Agency for Safety and Health at Work]] has published a discussion paper on the processes and materials involved in 3D printing, potential implications of this technology for occupational safety and health and avenues for controlling potential hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://osha.europa.eu/en/highlights/3d-printing-and-monitoring-workers-new-industrial-revolution|title=3D Printing and monitoring of workers: a new industrial revolution?|last=EU-OSHA|first=European Agency for Safety and Health|date=7 June 2017|website=osha.europa.eu|accessdate=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most concerns involve gas and material exposures, in particular nanomaterials, material handling, static electricity, moving parts and pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.additivemanufacturing.media/articles/changing-the-rules|title=Changing the Rules|last=Fuges|first=Christina M.|website=www.additivemanufacturing.media|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) study noted particle emissions from a [[Fused filament fabrication|fused filament]] peaked a few minutes after printing started and returned to baseline levels 100 minutes after printing ended.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/research-rounds/resroundsv1n12.html|title=Control Measures Critical for 3D Printers|last=|first=|date=June 2016|website=NIOSH Research Rounds|publisher=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emissions from fused filament printers can include a large number of [[ultrafine particle]]s and [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azimi|first=Parham|last2=Zhao|first2=Dan|last3=Pouzet|first3=Claire|last4=Crain|first4=Neil E.|last5=Stephens|first5=Brent|date=2 February 2016|title=Emissions of Ultrafine Particles and Volatile Organic Compounds from Commercially Available Desktop Three-Dimensional Printers with Multiple Filaments|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1260–1268|doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b04983|pmid=26741485|issn=0013-936X|bibcode=2016EnST...50.1260A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stefaniak|first=Aleksandr B.|last2=LeBouf|first2=Ryan F.|last3=Yi|first3=Jinghai|last4=Ham|first4=Jason|last5=Nurkewicz|first5=Timothy|last6=Schwegler-Berry|first6=Diane E.|last7=Chen|first7=Bean T.|last8=Wells|first8=J.

The [[Nanotoxicology|toxicity]] from emissions varies by source material due to differences in size, chemical properties, and quantity of emitted particles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Excessive exposure to [[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]] can lead to irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headache, loss of coordination, and nausea and some of the chemical emissions of fused filament printers have also been linked to [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aiha.org/about-aiha/Press/2017PressReleases/Pages/Is-3D-Printing-Safe.aspx|title=Is 3D Printing Safe|last=|first=|date=3 May 2017|website=American Industrial Hygiene Association|language=en-us|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[Animal testing|animal studies]], [[carbon nanotube]]s and [[carbon nanofiber]]s sometimes used in fused filament printing can cause pulmonary effects including [[inflammation]], [[granuloma]]s, and [[pulmonary fibrosis]] when at the nanoparticle size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-145/|title=Current Intelligence Bulletin 65: Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Nanofibers|last=|first=|date=2013|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|03||post=,}} the US Government has set 3D printer emission standards for only a limited number of compounds. Furthermore, the few established standards address factory conditions, not home or other environments in which the printers are likely to be used.&lt;ref name="Pelley 2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pelley|first=Janet|date=2018-03-26|title=3-D printer emissions raise concerns and prompt controls|url=https://cen.acs.org/materials/3-d-printing/3-D-printer-emissions-raise/96/i13|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|volume=96|issue=13|issn=1520-605X|oclc=244304576|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon [[nanoparticle]] emissions and processes using [[Metal powder|powder metals]] are highly combustible and raise the risk of [[dust explosion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turkevich|first=Leonid A.|last2=Fernback|first2=Joseph|last3=Dastidar|first3=Ashok G.|last4=Osterberg|first4=Paul|date=1 May 2016|title=Potential explosion hazard of carbonaceous nanoparticles: screening of allotropes|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nioshtic-2/20047783.html|journal=Combustion and Flame|volume=167|pages=218–227|doi=10.1016/j.combustflame.2016.02.010|pmid=27468178|pmc=4959120|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one case of severe injury was noted from an explosion involved in metal powders used for fused filament printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/osha/OSHA20140817.htm|title=After explosion, US Department of Labor's OSHA cites 3-D printing firm for exposing workers to combustible metal powder, electrical hazards|last=|first=|date=20 May 2014|website=U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration|access-date=2017-07-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803005222/https://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/osha/OSHA20140817.htm|archive-date=3 August 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other general health and safety concerns include the hot surface of UV lamps and print head blocks, [[high voltage]], [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] from UV lamps, and potential for mechanical injury from moving parts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/ehs/fact-sheets/3D-Printing-Safety.pdf|title=3D Printing Safety|last=|first=|date=|website=Carnegie Mellon University Environmental Health &amp; Safety|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problems noted in the NIOSH report were reduced by using manufacturer-supplied covers and full enclosures, using proper [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], keeping workers away from the printer, using [[respirators]], turning off the printer if it jammed, and using lower emission printers and filaments. At least one case of severe injury was noted from an explosion involved in metal powders used for fused filament. [[Personal protective equipment]] has been found to be the least desirable control method with a recommendation that it only be used to add further protection in combination with approved emissions protection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Hazards to health and safety also exist from post-processing activities done to finish parts after they have been printed. These post-processing activities can include chemical baths, sanding, polishing, or vapor exposure to refine surface finish, as well as general [[Machining|subtractive manufacturing]] techniques such as drilling, milling, or turning to modify the printed geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fictiv.com/hwg/fabricate/ultimate-guide-to-finishing-3d-printed-parts|title=Ultimate Guide to Finishing 3D Printed Parts {{!}} Fictiv - Hardware Guide|website=www.fictiv.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any technique that removes material from the printed part has the potential to generate particles that can be inhaled or cause eye injury if proper personal protective equipment is not used, such as respirators or safety glasses. Caustic baths are often used to dissolve support material used by some 3D printers that allows them to print more complex shapes. These baths require personal protective equipment to prevent injury to exposed skin.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Health regulation===

Although no [[occupational exposure limit]]s specific to 3D printer emissions exist, certain source materials used in 3D printing, such as [[carbon nanofiber]] and [[carbon nanotube]]s, have established [[occupational exposure limit]]s at the nanoparticle size.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahm|first=Matthew M.|last2=Evans|first2=Douglas E.|last3=Schubauer-Berigan|first3=Mary K.|last4=Birch|first4=Eileen M.|last5=Fernback|first5=Joseph E.|date=1 July 2012|title=Occupational Exposure Assessment in Carbon Nanotube and Nanofiber Primary and Secondary Manufacturers|url=https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/56/5/542/159798/Occupational-Exposure-Assessment-in-Carbon|journal=The Annals of Occupational Hygiene|language=en|volume=56|issue=5|pages=542–56|doi=10.1093/annhyg/mer110|issn=0003-4878|pmc=4522689|pmid=22156567|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 3-D imaging creates items by fusing materials together, there runs the risk of layer separation in some devices made using 3-D Imaging. For example, in January 2013, the US medical device company, DePuy, recalled their knee and hip replacement systems. The devices were made from layers of metal, and shavings had come loose – potentially harming the patient. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/proposed-new-regulations-for-3d-printed-medical-devices-must-go-further-90314|title=Proposed new regulations for 3D printed medical devices must go further|last=Matthews|first=Richard|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Additive manufacturing, starting with today's infancy period, requires manufacturing firms to be flexible, [[continuous improvement process|ever-improving]] users of all available technologies to remain competitive. Advocates of [[additive manufacturing]] also predict that this arc of technological development will counter [[globalization]], as end users will do much of their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations.&lt;ref name="3D opp" /&gt; The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production, however, is more a matter of complementing traditional subtractive methods rather than displacing them entirely.&lt;ref name="Albert_2011-02_MMS_column" /&gt;

The [[futurologist]] [[Jeremy Rifkin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thethirdindustrialrevolution.com/|title=Jeremy Rifkin and The Third Industrial Revolution Home Page|date=|publisher=The third industrial revolution.com|access-date=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that 3D printing signals the beginning of a [[third industrial revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21552901|title=A third industrial revolution|date=21 April 2012|work=The Economist|access-date=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeding the [[production line]] assembly that dominated manufacturing starting in the late 19th century.

=== Social change ===
[[File:3D Printing-skylt.jpg|thumb|Street sign in [[Windhoek]], [[Namibia]], advertising 3D printing, July 2018.]]
Since the 1950s, a number of writers and social commentators have speculated in some depth about the social and cultural changes that might result from the advent of commercially affordable additive manufacturing technology.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-104" /&gt; Amongst the more notable ideas to have emerged from these inquiries has been the suggestion that, as more and more 3D printers start to enter people's homes, the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-105" /&gt; Likewise, it has also been suggested that, as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe, so the need for high-speed freight services might also become less.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-106" /&gt; Finally, given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated, it remains to be seen whether changes will be made to current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available.

As 3D printers became more accessible to consumers, online social platforms have developed to support the community.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-107" /&gt; This includes websites that allow users to access information such as how to build a 3D printer, as well as social forums that discuss how to improve 3D print quality and discuss 3D printing news, as well as social media websites that are dedicated to share 3D models.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-108" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-110" /&gt; RepRap is a wiki based website that was created to hold all information on 3d printing, and has developed into a community that aims to bring 3D printing to everyone. Furthermore, there are other sites such as [[Pinshape]], [[Thingiverse]] and [[MyMiniFactory]], which were created initially to allow users to post 3D files for anyone to print, allowing for decreased transaction cost of sharing 3D files. These websites have allowed greater social interaction between users, creating communities dedicated to 3D printing.

Some call attention to the conjunction of [[Commons-based peer production]] with 3D printing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques.&lt;ref name="triple-c.at" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-112" /&gt; The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope, and here, society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customized productivity.&lt;ref name="triple-c.at" /&gt; Further, it is true that many issues, problems, and threats arise due to the democratization of the means of production, and especially regarding the physical ones.&lt;ref name="triple-c.at" /&gt; For instance, the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned; weapons manufacturing could become easier; not to mention the implications for counterfeiting&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-113" /&gt; and on IP.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-114" /&gt; It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale, [[Commons-based peer production]] 3D printing could develop economies of scope. While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation, the economies of scope share infrastructure costs (intangible and tangible productive resources), taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools.&lt;ref name="triple-c.at" /&gt; And following Neil Gershenfeld&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-115" /&gt; in that "some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies," Commons-based peer production and 3D printing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but acting locally in response to certain needs.

[[Larry Summers]] wrote about the "devastating consequences" of 3D printing and other technologies (robots, artificial intelligence, etc.) for those who perform routine tasks. In his view, "already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing. And the trends are all in the wrong direction, particularly for the less skilled, as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white-collar as well as blue-collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead." Summers recommends more vigorous cooperative efforts to address the "myriad devices" (e.g., tax havens, bank secrecy, money laundering, and regulatory arbitrage) enabling the holders of great wealth to "avoid paying" income and estate taxes, and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring "great social contributions" in return, including: more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws, reductions in "excessive" protection for intellectual property, greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation, strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements, improvements in corporate governance, strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity, easing of land-use restrictions that may cause the real estate of the rich to keep rising in value, better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers, and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development—e.g., in energy production and transportation.&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-116" /&gt;

[[Michael Spence]] wrote that "Now comes a … powerful, wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and [[disintermediation]] has been underway for some time in service sectors—think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading to the production of goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor." In his view, the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. 3D printers) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. "Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [in digital technologies] are compelling."&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-117" /&gt;

Spence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies "is cost reduction via the replacement of labor." For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is "easy to imagine" that production may become "extremely" local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear in both developed and developing countries. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion. Spence writes that "the world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital, not goods, services, and traditional capital. Adapting to this will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution."&lt;ref name="AutoSQ-117" /&gt;

[[Naomi Wu]]  regards the usage of 3D printing in the Chinese classroom (where rote memorization is standard) to teach design principles and creativity as the most exciting recent development of the technology, and more generally regards 3D printing as being the next [[desktop publishing]] revolution.&lt;ref name="3D Printing in the Chinese Classroom"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://womenin3dprinting.com/2017/11/29/naomi-wu-my-visibility-allows-me-to-direct-more-attention-to-important-issues-and-other-deserving-women/ |title=Naomi Wu – "My visibility allows me to direct more attention to important issues and other deserving women" |last=Andre |first=Helene |date=29 November 2017 |website=Women in 3D Printing |access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9084">'''6-3-5 Brainwriting''' (or 635 Method, Method 635) is a group-structured [[brainstorming]] technique &lt;ref name=PDF1&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNicholas|first1=Carolyn|title=COEUR - Business Creativy Module Aberdeen Business School|url=https://is.vsfs.cz/el/6410/zima2012/E_CEP/2_BC_Lec_Creativity_not_hide_1_2011.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at aiding innovation processes by stimulating creativity developed by Bernd Rohrbach who originally published it in a German sales magazine, the [[Absatzwirtschaft]], in 1968.&lt;ref name=Bernd&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rohrbach|first1=Bernd|title=Kreativ nach Regeln – Methode 635, eine neue Technik zum Lösen von Problemen". (Creative by rules - Method 635, a new technique for solving problems)|journal=Absatzwirtschaft|date=1969|volume=12|pages=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In brief, it consists of 6 participants supervised by a moderator who are required to write down 3 ideas on a specific worksheet within 5 minutes, this is also the etymology of the methodology's name. The outcome after 6 rounds, during which participants swap their worksheets passing them on to the team member sitting at their right, is 108 ideas generated in 30 minutes. The technique is applied in various sectors but mainly in [[business]], [[marketing]], [[design]], [[writing]] as well as everyday real life situations.&lt;ref name=PDF1 /&gt;

==Introduction==

6-3-5 Brainwriting is a particular form of brainstorming through the medium of graphics;&lt;ref name=simone&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piperno|first1=Simone|title=Brainwriting, la creatività grafica (Brainwriting graphical creativity)|url=http://simonepiperno.blogspot.co.uk/2009/10/brainwriting-la-creativita-grafica.html|website=Coaching e creatività - formazione al pensiero creativo (Coaching and creativity - training to creative thinking)|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular, it is classified under the intuitive and progressive methodologies as it involves driving inspiration from other members in a cyclical way.&lt;ref name=Shah&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=Jahan|title=Evaluation of Idea Generation Methods for Conceptual Design: Effectiveness Metrics and Design of Experiments|journal=Journal of Medical Design|date=2000|volume=122|page=377|doi=10.1115/1.1315592}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grounding of such technique is the belief that the success of an idea generation process is determined by the degree of contribution and integration to each other's suggestions, and specifically it is meant to overcome the possible ''creativity barriers'' brought up by issues such as interpersonal conflicts, different cultural backgrounds &lt;ref name=vangundy&gt;{{cite journal|last1=VanGundy|first1=Arthur|title=Brain Writing for New Product Ideas: An alternative to Brainstorming|journal=Journal of Consumer Marketing|date=1984|volume=2|pages=67–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reasons of intellectual properties.&lt;ref name=Bernd /&gt;

==Procedure==
* The optimum application of the technique would require 6 participants, as too many would make the session unmanageable,&lt;ref name=uok&gt;{{cite web|last1=University of Oklahoma|title=What is "brain writing"?|url=http://www.uco.edu/academic-affairs/cqi/files/docs/facilitator_tools/brainhan.pdf|website=University of Central Oklahoma Office of Academic Affairs|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however sessions may be carried out also in teams of 4, 5 or 7 and the number of ideas generated would respectively be 48, 75 and 147.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mathys European Orthopaedics|title=Tecniche creative Per una maggiore ricchezza di idee e per realizzare soluzioni innovative|url=http://www.mathysmedical.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf_download/Arztforum/Kreativitaetstechniken_I.pdf|website=www.mathysmedical.com|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is fundamental to assure that all participants share a deep background knowledge on the topic of the brainwriting session since even a single not well informed individual can significantly affect the quality of the output.&lt;ref name=Blogsession&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacNaught|first1=Stacey|title=108 IDEAS IN 30 MINUTES – THE 6-3-5 METHOD OF BRAIN-WRITING por|url=http://blogsession.co.uk/2014/03/635-method-brainwriting/|website=Blogsession|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, it is recommended that through a preliminary discussion, the group focuses on identifying the problem to be solved or the aim to be pursued. This can either occur through as independent initiative of the group or guided by the supervisor.&lt;ref name=simone /&gt;
*Once the topic of the session is narrowed down to a problem statement, this is announced and written on top of the Idea Form. This is a worksheet that has to be handed out to each participant and consists of a grid where the heading of the columns are Idea 1, Idea 2 and Idea 3 and the rows identify the name of who has contributed to that particular suggestion.&lt;ref name=Inno /&gt;
* At this point, the session is ready to start and participants are given 5 minutes to complete the first row and write down the first ideas working in silence.&lt;ref name=Inno /&gt;&lt;ref name=625bw&gt;{{cite web|last1=635brainwriting.com|title=108 Solutions or Ideas in 30 Minutes!|url=http://www.635brainwriting.com/studio|website=635 Brainwriting|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may be expressed in any graphical form: written, drawn, through a symbol or however the author prefers.&lt;ref name=simone /&gt;
* The supervisor signals the end of time, and the sheet is passed on to the next participant on the right. Now the process is repeated and each participant is free to get inspired from the idea he reads on the sheet written by his neighbour and contribute to them by integrating or completing them, or decide to ignore them and start a new one from scratch.&lt;ref name=gustavo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bangel|first1=Noemi|title=Brainwriting|url=http://blog.gustavkaser.com.au/brainwriting/|website=Gustav Kaser Australia|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The process goes on until the worksheet is completely filled in but if the supervisor deems it necessary, the time for each round may be extended to a maximum of 10 minutes.
* The conclusion of the brainstorming session is a preliminary screening of the ideas that have been gathered where exact duplicates are deleted, and a team evaluation perhaps using the [[Nominal Group Technique]] or [[Seven_management_and_planning_tools#Prioritization_matrix|Prioritization matrix]] to select 1 to 3 ideas the group can focus on.&lt;ref name=gustavo /&gt;

==Pros==

One of the main advantages of using 6-3-5 brainwriting is that it is a very straightforward method and therefore is easy and quick to learn. In addition to this, no particular training for the supervisor is required.&lt;ref name=Inno&gt;{{cite web|last1=innoSupport|title=Supporting ideas in SME|url=http://www.innosupport.net/index.php?id=2034|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, it valorises the possible different backgrounds of participants since it encourages sharing and exchanging knowledge. Differently than traditional brainstorming, it assures an active participation from all members and at the same time avoids issues of domination over introverts that are also likely to feel more free about expressing their own ideas instead of risking to have their potential inhibited by those who shout louder.&lt;ref name=uok /&gt;

All ideas are recorded on the worksheet, this means that nobody has to be in charge of taking notes throughout the session and this adds a motivational factor since it is possible to keep track of the author of a particular idea.&lt;ref name=Blogsession /&gt;

Overall this leads to a gain of efficiency that might imply an economic benefit since by hiring 6 members 108 possible content ideas are generated.&lt;ref name=Blogsession /&gt;

==Cons==

Expressing ideas in a written form may lead to issues in clarity due to participants having trouble summarising their ideas or reading their colleagues' handwriting or graphical representations.&lt;ref name=Inno /&gt;

Stress due to time constraints might cause quality of ideas to decrease,&lt;ref name=scuola&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campi Scuola|title=Corso di formazione per educatori di gruppi giovanili (Training course for educators of youth groups)|url=http://www.campiscuola.ch/download/files/CS%20-%20Tecniche%20animazione/Il%20metodo%20635.pdf|website=www.capiscuola.ch|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this might require some people time to become familiar with the methodology.&lt;ref name=Blogsession /&gt;

There is a risk of clash of similar ideas since there is no immediate group discussion which constitutes a loss of possible innovation.&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beitz|first1=Wolfgang|title=Engineering Design: A Systematic Approach|date=1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=3540199179|edition=Design Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==

===Childhood===
Khoo was born Adam Khoo Yean Ann on 8 April 1974, to Vince Khoo and Betty L. Khoo-Kingsley. At age eight, Khoo was expelled from [[Saint Stephen's School, Singapore|St Stephen's Primary School]]&lt;ref name = "NewPaper" /&gt; for misbehavior, partly due to poor academic results.&lt;ref name = "MasterMind"&gt;{{cite book | last = Khoo | first = Adam |author2= Tan, Stuart | title = Master Your Mind, Design Your Destiny | publisher = Adam Khoo Learning Technologies Group Pte Ltd | year = 2004 | pages = 348 | isbn = 978-9810508562}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[parents]] hunted for a primary school willing to accept him and finally found [[Ngee Ann Primary School]].&lt;ref name="NewPaper" /&gt; Due to his poor results at the [[Primary School Leaving Examination|Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE)]], he did not qualify to enter any of the six secondary schools his parents had chosen.&lt;ref name="MasterMind" /&gt; He eventually enrolled in a [[government school]], Ping Yi Secondary School, where he passed only five out of eight academic subjects&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; and finished 156th out of 160 Secondary 1 Express Stream students.&lt;ref name="SundayTimes"&gt;"I want to be a millionaire by 26", The Sunday Times, 21 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewPaper" /&gt;

Khoo's parents and teachers described him back then as capable but [[laziness|lazy]], [[apathy|indifferent]] and [[Behavioral addiction|addicted]] to television.&lt;ref name="NewPaper" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "STLife"&gt;"Lousy at learning? Take heart", The Straits Times LIFE!, 6 August 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He described himself as being totally uninterested in [[learning]] (he was frustrated as he felt he could not learn),&lt;ref name = "STLife" /&gt; extremely unmotivated,&lt;ref name = "TheEdge"&gt;"From underachiever to millionaire", The Edge Singapore, 18 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; physically weak and mentally lethargic.&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; His [[Stepfamily|stepsister]] was a straight-As student in the [[Gifted Education Programme (Singapore)|Gifted Education Programme]] at [[Raffles Girls' School (Secondary)|Raffles Girls' School]]&lt;ref name = "NewPaper" /&gt; while cousins from his close-knit [[extended family]] were from the best schools in Singapore.&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; He had poor [[social skill]]s,&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; did not enjoy [[reading education|reading]] anything but comics&lt;ref name = "TheEdge" /&gt; and was addicted to [[arcade game]]s and TV programs.&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; He tried to join the [[Scout Movement]], but was thrown out six months later for not passing the basic qualifying test, the 'Scout Standard', as he did not bother to try.&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt;

===Turning point in education===
In 1987, when Khoo was 13, his parents enrolled their [[Underachiever|"under-achiever"]] son for a five-day residential program at Ladyhill Hotel called Super-Teen Camp.&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NewPaper" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; The man responsible for spotting Khoo's "gifted talent" in Super-Teen was Dr. Ernest Wong, [[Entrepreneur|founder]], principal consultant and master teacher of Ernesco, the Centre for Motivational Language Learning based in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; (the Super-Teen Camp is now under Learning Mastery Pte. Ltd.) Dr. Wong's [[teaching]] tools incorporated and adapted an American-developed [[learning technology]] called [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), as well as whole-brain learning.&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; This was the beginning of Khoo's interest and journey in mastering motivational techniques,&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; which formed the foundation of many of his books and [[seminars]].

Within three months of the program, Khoo climbed to among the top 18 in his secondary school.&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; He went on to rank among the top 10 in Ping Yi Secondary within a year,&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; topped his school in the [[Singaporean GCE 'O' Level|GCE 'O' Level examinations]] with the lowest scoring aggregate, and was the first in Ping Yi Secondary to qualify for the then-top [[junior college]] in Singapore, [[Victoria Junior College]].&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; At Victoria Junior College, he was president of the Economics Society&lt;ref name = "STLife" /&gt; and scored three A's for his [[GCE Advanced Level|GCE 'A' Level examinations]].&lt;ref name = "STLife" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; He entered the [[Administration (business)|business administration]] [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] at the [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS) and continued his notable academic achievements by making it to the [[dean's list]] every year,&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt; ranked among the top 1 percent of academic achievers&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; and became a pioneer in the university's Talent Development Programme (TDP), the tertiary equivalent of the gifted education programme for secondary schools.&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt; He graduated with an honours degree in business administration from NUS.

==Career==
At age 15, Khoo was devouring books on [[Warren Buffett]]'s investment techniques.&lt;ref name = "TheEdge" /&gt; While still in secondary school, he formed a [[mobile disco]] company with his [[friendship|friends]], using his grandmother's house to re-create a [[disco]] and charged [[teenagers]] who attended a [[fee]]. He even took over the [[Job (role)|job]] of the deejay that he [[employment|hired]], after studying him.&lt;ref name = "NewPaper" /&gt; At 16, he began investing most of his time and money to read and undergo training sessions in NLP&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; in the United States. At 17, he became a freelance [[Motivational speaker|motivational trainer]] by visiting schools in Singapore, making the bold proposition of turning the worst students around for no charge in the beginning. Eventually, he started charging S$25 per student for half a day's training.&lt;ref name = "TheEdge" /&gt;

After completing [[National Service]] in the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] at age 21, Khoo went into partnership with three NUS friends and registered an event management company, Creatsoul Entertainment.&lt;ref name = "STLife" /&gt; The company organised [[Dance (event)|hops, jams]] and other entertainment activities&lt;ref name = "NewPaper" /&gt; for clients like [[individuals]], companies and organisations at NUS and [[Nanyang Technological University|Nanyang Technological University (NTU)]].&lt;ref name = "STLife" /&gt; This was later re-registered as Event Gurus Pte Ltd, an event management company.

At 23, Khoo obtained his [[licence]] in NLP in [[Seattle]], Washington.&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; At 24, he became a trainer at SuperTeen,&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt; conducting courses for organisations like the [[Chinese Development Assistance Council|Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC)]], [[Association of Muslim Professionals|Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP)]], [[Nanyang Girls' High School]] and the Universitas Pelita Harapan (UPH) in [[Jakarta]].&lt;ref name = "STLife" /&gt; At 25, Khoo was coaching top insurance agents and marketing managers twice his age on how to boost sales.&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt; At this time, his father, Vince Khoo, who owned the [[advertising agency]] Adcom, bought out all partners and offered the younger Khoo the opportunity to run it.&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt; Within three months, he turned it around from making losses in 1998–1999 to clinching a pitching rate of 80 percent&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt; with the first monthly [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], and went on to increase margins by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cargonewsasia.com.hk/timesnet/data/ab/docs/ab3202.html "Driving Ambition" by James Lee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912165338/http://www.cargonewsasia.com.hk/timesnet/data/ab/docs/ab3202.html |date=12 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their clients have included AIA, [[Dumex]], [[Mobil]] (lost during the [[Exxon]] [[merger]]), Phillip Wain slimming centres, Sobe Fresh Soya Milk, [[Tabasco sauce|Tabasco]], [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], Sinsin, [[Night Safari, Singapore]] and [[MobileOne|MobileOne (M1)]].&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adasiaonline.com/listingsEntry2.asp?ID=407&amp;cid=339&amp;t=articles&amp;PT=articles&amp;PTS=Featured+Agency%2FBranding+Specialist&amp;F=articles "Following father's footsteps to take a leap forward"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 26, Khoo earned his first million, from giving motivational training at schools and companies (the most lucrative, earning him up to S$1000 an hour), his entertainment company and shrewd investments in [[equities]], [[unit trusts]] and [[Real property|property]].&lt;ref name = "NewPaper" /&gt;

==Portfolio==

===Investments===
Inspired by the book ''Buffettology'', he started dabbling in the stock market while in the army.&lt;ref name="ST Feb2009"&gt;"Big investor but frugal spender", Me &amp; Money, The Straits Times, 22 February 2009 [http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090223-123961.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a conservative and long-term investor,&lt;ref name = "ST Feb2009" /&gt; Khoo goes for investments with very low [[risk]] and high [[Return (finance)|returns]],&lt;ref name = "TheEdge" /&gt; favouring cash-rich companies with low [[debts]] and the potential to consistently increase their [[earnings]].&lt;ref name = "ST Feb2009" /&gt; He prefers investing in [[stock]]s and [[Option (finance)|options]], using a variety of investing strategies including [[momentum investing|momentum]] and [[value investing]].&lt;ref name = "TheEdge" /&gt;

===Property===
Khoo's [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] consists of [[property]] that he [[renting|rents]] out. In 1998, he bought a [[condominium]] in East Coast for S$480,000 and rented it out for about S$3,000. He sold it for S$650,000 in 2004. Other properties he owns include a house in East Coast and a condominium at Robertson Quay.&lt;ref name = "ST Feb2009" /&gt;

===Businesses===
Khoo does not believe in taking on [[consumer debt]] and prefers starting businesses with zero [[Financial capital|capital]], paying freelance fees or stocks in the beginning until [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] is generated.&lt;ref name = "TheEdge" /&gt;

'''Aw Boon-Haw''' ({{zh|c=胡文虎|p=Hú Wénhǔ|poj=''Ô͘ Bûn-hó͘''}}; 1882 in [[Rangoon]], [[British Burma]] &amp;ndash; 1954 in [[Hawaii]]), [[Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|OBE]], was a [[Burmese Chinese]] entrepreneur and philanthropist best known for introducing [[Tiger Balm]]. He was a son of [[Hakka people|Hakka]] [[Chinese herbology|herbalist]] [[Aw Chu-Kin]], with his [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]] in [[Yongding County]], [[Fujian Province]], China.

'''Barloworld Limited''' is an industrial [[brand management]] company, founded in [[South Africa]].  Once a large [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] with many unrelated businesses, ranging at various times from [[mining]], [[information technology]] and building materials to motor vehicles, it has repositioned itself as an industrial brand management company and [[unbundling|unbundled]] many of its assets. Its headquarters are at the sprawling [[Barlow Park (Sandton)|Barlow Park]] campus in [[Sandton]], [[Johannesburg]]. It had been sponsor of the [[Barloworld (cycling team)|Barloworld cycling team]].

==History==
Barloworld was founded in [[Durban]] by Major [[Ernest (Billy) Barlow]] in 1902, selling wool products, and later engineering equipment. It was expanded by his son [[Charles Barlow (businessman)|Charles Sydney (Punch) Barlow]] who expanded into the sale and service of [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] products. Barlow entered the motor business, and eventually expanded into the manufacture of [[cement]], [[paint]], [[stainless steel]] and [[household appliances]], as well as [[mining]], through the acquisition of [[Rand Mines Limited]], with the new company called Barlow Rand. In November 2016, Barloworld and German company BayWa entered into a joint venture (JV) to expand their agriculture and materials handling operations in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/barloworld-baywa-extend-collaboration-in-southern-africa-2016-11-18|title=Barloworld, BayWa extend collaboration in Southern Africa|last=Wyngaardt|first=Megan van|work=Engineering News|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsidiaries==
The group's subsidiaries include [[Barloworld Automotive]], [[Barloworld Handling]], [[Barloworld Logistics]] and [[Barloworld Equipment]]. Barloworld unbundled its interests in [[Pretoria Portland Cement]] and [[Barloworld Coatings]] (best known for the [[Plascon]] brand) in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Litigation==
===Barloworld Handling Ltd v. Unilift South Wales Ltd===
On 24 March 2009, Barloworld Handling Ltd applied under s.69(1) [[Companies Act 2006]] for a change of name for the company called Unilift South Wales Ltd.

Barloworld Handling Ltd argued that since they already acquired a company called Unilift Ltd, Unilift South Wales Ltd should change their name as Unilift Ltd had goodwill and reputation for the marketing, hiring and servicing of [[Forklift truck|fork lift trucks]] in [[Swansea]] and [[Cardiff]]. The problems came from the fact of Unilift South Wales Ltd marketing similar products to those marketed by Unilift Ltd and as evidence of confusion, Unilift Ltd had received invoices intended for Unilift South Wales Ltd.

Barloworld Handling Ltd represented to the Company Names Tribunal that Unilift South Wales Ltd was [[passing off]] as Unilift Ltd and so they should be ordered to change their name so that there is nothing even similar to ''Unilift'' in their name or [[trading name]].

The litigation was struck out because the Adjudicator found that the respondent had already registered its name on 18 December 2007 and was operating and had not registered a similar name to the applicant's for the purpose of trying to extort money or to prevent them from registering the name themselves. The Tribunal is there to hear complaints that respondents have been [[Company Names Tribunal#Opportunistic registrations|opportunistic]] but they do not decide on claims in the tort of passing off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/o12709.pdf Barloworld Handling Ltd v. Unilift South Wales Ltd] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103023944/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/o12709.pdf |date=November 3, 2012 }} Retrieved 19 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caproni''' was an Italian [[aircraft manufacturer]] founded in 1908 by [[Giovanni Battista Caproni|Giovanni Battista "Gianni" Caproni]].
It was initially named, from 1911, '''Società de Agostini e Caproni''', then '''Società Caproni e Comitti'''. Caproni made the first aircraft of Italian construction in 1911. The manufacturing facilities were based in [[Taliedo]], a peripheral district of [[Milan]], close to [[Linate Airport]], and for the Caproni Vizzola division, in [[Vizzola Ticino]], close to [[Milan–Malpensa Airport]].

During World War I, Caproni developed a series of successful heavy bombers, used by the Italian, French, British and US air forces. Between the world wars, Caproni evolved into a large syndicate named '''Società Italiana Caproni, Milano''', which bought some smaller manufacturers. The main subdivisions were Caproni Bergamasca, Caproni Vizzola, [[Reggiane]] and engine manufacturer [[Isotta Fraschini]].

Between the world wars, Caproni produced mostly bombers and light transport planes. The Società Italiana Caproni ceased to exist in 1950, although one of its divisions, Caproni Vizzola endured until 1983 when it was bought by [[Agusta]].

==Criticism==

In October 21, 2014, [[Truth in Advertising (organization)|Truth in Advertising]] published "Who is ConsumerAffairs.com Really Advocating For?" In the article, Unbeatablesale.com complained to the [[Electronic retailing self-regulation program|Electronic Retailing Self-Regulation Program]], a division of the [[Better Business Bureaus]] and [[National Advertising Review Council]], that ConsumerAffairs "creates biased and negative portrayals of companies that don't pay for its service called ConsumerAffairs for Brands." The service collects reviews from customers and gives brands an opportunity to respond. The ERSP "determined that ConsumerAffairs did not adequately disclose its paid affiliation with company members on its website and recommended it do it in a more clear and conspicuous manner." After reviewing ERSP's recommendations, a banner disclosing paid affiliation or non-paying affiliation was added to the ConsumerAffairs website. ConsumerAffairs reported that, of the 115 paying companies, 80% of paying companies received a 3.5 star or higher rating and 20% of paying companies received a rating lower than 3.5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO IS CONSUMERAFFAIRS.COM REALLY ADVOCATING FOR?|url=https://www.truthinadvertising.org/consumer-affairs-com/|publisher=[[Truth in Advertising (organization)|Truth in Advertising]]|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2918">The '''Customer Service Excellence''', (previously the "'''Charter Mark'''") is an [[accreditation]] for organisations, intended to indicate an independent validation of achievement.

==History==
The Charter Mark was an award demonstrating the achievement of ''national standard for excellence in customer service'' in [[United Kingdom]] [[public sector]] organisations. Introduced in 1991, it was replaced in 2008 by Customer Service Excellence standard, with the last issued Charter Marks expiring in 2011. The Charter Mark was one of the consequences of a political initiative, the [[Citizen's Charter]], by [[Prime Minister]] [[John Major]] in 1991, to improve the face of government.

In 2005, the system was reviewed, and it was recommended the scheme be replaced. Accordingly, the Customer Service Excellence standard was launched, and a phased transfer was initiated. Applications for Charter Marks were officially closed on 30 June 2008, with the official final validity date becoming 30 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/chartermark/new_standard.aspx Cabinet Office FAQ page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006093444/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/chartermark/new_standard.aspx |date=2007-10-06 }} Accessed 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipients==
The scope of public sector organisations includes departments of local councils, voluntary organisations having more than 10% public funding, and also private subcontractors on public contracts. It also includes public transport operators and the gas, electricity and water utilities. A number of [[Park and Ride bus services in the United Kingdom|Park and Ride bus schemes]] gained Charter Marks, displaying the mark on their [[bus]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allcustomerservice.in/redbus-customer-care/ all customer related issues and customer care number]{{date=nov 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Council in the UK to achieve the Corporate Customer Service Excellence award was Fenland District Council,Cambridgeshire, see www.fenland.gov.uk

==Assessment==
The Customer Service Excellence Standard is made up of 5 criteria with 57 elements in total. Assessment is carried out via a desktop review by an authorised assessor followed by an on site visit lasting one, two or three days (sometimes more) depending on the size of the department or organisation being assessed. As well as viewing physical documentation, and carrying out observations, the assessor speaks to customers, staff and partners to review the company's attitudes and working practices along with details of their customer focussed initiatives and performance.

The '''Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency''' ('''DARPA''') is an agency of the [[United States Department of Defense]] responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.

Originally known as the '''Advanced Research Projects Agency''' ('''ARPA'''), the agency was created in February 1958 by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in response to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] launching of [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957. By collaborating with academic, industry, and government partners, DARPA formulates and executes research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, often beyond immediate [[U.S. military]] requirements.&lt;ref name="Commission2008"&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower and Science &amp; Technology, (2008). Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101027163454/http://eisenhowermemorial.org/onepage/IKE%20%26%20Science.Oct08.EN.FINAL%20%28v2%29.pdf Source].&lt;/ref&gt;

DARPA-funded projects have provided significant technologies that influenced many non-military fields, such as [[computer networking]] and the basis for the modern Internet, and [[graphical user interface]]s in information technology.

DARPA is independent of other military research and development and reports directly to senior Department of Defense management. DARPA has about 220 employees, of whom approximately 100 are in management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/about-darpa|title=About DARPA|website=www.darpa.mil|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the organization first changed from its founding name ARPA to DARPA in March 1972, momentarily changing back to ARPA in February 1993, only to revert to DARPA in March 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mil-embedded.com/guest-blogs/arpa-darpa-and-jason/|title=ARPA, DARPA, and Jason - Military Embedded Systems|website=mil-embedded.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
Currently, DARPA's mission statement is "to make pivotal investments in breakthrough technologies for national security".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/about-us/mission |title=DARPA Mission |last= |first= |date= |website=www.darpa.mil |language=en-US |access-date=2017-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430171501/http://www.darpa.mil/about-us/mission |archivedate=2017-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

==History==
[[File:DARPA through 50 years.ogv|thumb|right|DARPA achievements for the past 50 years]]

===Early history (1959–1969)===
The creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was authorized by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1958 for the purpose of forming and executing research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, and able to reach far beyond immediate military requirements,&lt;ref name="Commission2008"/&gt; the two relevant acts being the Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fiscal_year_1958_supplemental_military_c.html?id=N-IPAAAAIAAJ |title = Fiscal Year 1958 Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force): Hearings, Eighty-fifth Congress, Second Session, on H.R. 9739 |date=1958|author1 = Subcommittee On Military Construction |first1 = United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Armed Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Public Law 85-325) and Department of Defense Directive 5105.15, in February 1958. Its creation was directly attributed to the launching of [[Sputnik]] and to U.S. realization that the [[Soviet Union]] had developed the capacity to rapidly exploit military technology. Initial funding of ARPA was $520 million.&lt;ref name = Wizards20 &gt;"$ 520 million appropriation and a $ 2 billion budget plan." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 20). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA's first director, Roy Johnson, left a $160,000 management job at General Electric for an $18,000 job at ARPA.&lt;ref name = Wizards21 &gt;"Roy Johnson, ARPA’s first director, was, like his boss, a businessman. At age fifty-two, he had been personally recruited by McElroy, who convinced him to leave a $160,000 job with General Electric and take an $18,000 job in Washington." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 21). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert York]] from [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] was hired as his scientific assistant.&lt;ref name = Wizards21a &gt;"Herbert York, whom Killian had been keen on, was given the job and moved to ARPA from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 21). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson and York were both keen on space projects, but when [[NASA]] was established later in 1958 all space projects and most of ARPA's funding were transferred to it. Johnson resigned and ARPA was repurposed to do "high-risk", "high-gain", "far out" basic research, a posture that was enthusiastically embraced by the nation's scientists and research universities.&lt;ref name = Wizards21,22 &gt;"The staff of ARPA saw an opportunity to redefine the agency as a group that would take on the really advanced "far-out" research....The scientific community, predictably, rallied to the call for a reinvention of ARPA as a "high-risk high-gain" research sponsor— the kind of R&amp; D shop they had dreamed of all along" Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (pp. 21,22). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA's second director was Brigadier General Austin W. Betts, who resigned in early 1961. He was succeeded by [[Jack Ruina]] who served until 1963.&lt;ref name = Wizards23,24 &gt;"In early 1961 ARPA’s second director, Brigadier General Austin W. Betts, resigned" Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (pp. 23,24) Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruina, the first scientist to administer ARPA, managed to raise its budget to $250 million.&lt;ref name = Wizards23 &gt;"Ruina raised ARPA’s annual budget to $ 250 million." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 23). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Ruina who hired [[J. C. R. Licklider]] as the first administrator of the [[Information Processing Techniques Office]], which played a vital role in creation of [[ARPANET]], the basis for the future Internet.&lt;ref name = Wizards27-39  &gt;"J. C. R. Licklider." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (pp. 27–39). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the political and defense communities recognized the need for a high-level Department of Defense organization to formulate and execute R&amp;D projects that would expand the frontiers of technology beyond the immediate and specific requirements of the Military Services and their laboratories. In pursuit of this mission, DARPA has developed and transferred technology programs encompassing a wide range of scientific disciplines that address the full spectrum of national security needs.

From 1958 to 1965, ARPA's emphasis centered on major national issues, including space, [[ballistic missile defense]], and [[nuclear test]] detection.&lt;ref name = Wizards23a &gt;projects in ballistic missile defense and nuclear test detection, couched in terms of basic research, were the top priorities." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet'' (p. 23). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1960, all of its civilian space programs were transferred to the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) and the military space programs to the individual services.

This allowed ARPA to concentrate its efforts on the [[Project Defender]] (defense against ballistic missiles), [[Project Vela]] (nuclear test detection), and [[Project AGILE]] ([[counterinsurgency]] R&amp;D) programs, and to begin work on computer processing, [[behavioral sciences]], and materials sciences. The DEFENDER and AGILE programs formed the foundation of DARPA sensor, [[surveillance]], and directed energy R&amp;D, particularly in the study of [[radar]], [[infrared]] sensing, and [[x-ray]]/[[gamma ray]] detection.

ARPA at this point (1959) played an early role in [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]] (also called NavSat) a predecessor to the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Transit to Tomorrow.

TRANSIT, sponsored by the Navy and developed under the leadership of Dr. Richard Kirschner at Johns Hopkins, was the first satellite positioning system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2565 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629003311/http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2565 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-29 |title=The Story of GPS |author=Catherine Alexandrow |date=Apr 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gap&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.darpa.mil/about/history/first_50_years.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506103713/http://www.darpa.mil/About/History/First_50_Years.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-06 |title=DARPA: 50 Years of Bridging the Gap |date=Apr 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s, with the transfer of these mature programs to the Services, ARPA redefined its role and concentrated on a diverse set of relatively small, essentially exploratory research programs. The agency was renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972, and during the early 1970s, it emphasized direct energy programs, information processing, and tactical technologies.

Concerning information processing, DARPA made great progress, initially through its support of the development of [[time-sharing]] (all modern operating systems rely on concepts invented for the [[Multics]] system, developed by a cooperation among [[Bell Labs]], [[General Electric]] and [[MIT]], which DARPA supported by funding [[Project MAC]] at MIT with an initial two-million-dollar grant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2001/AILab.pdf |author1=Stefanie Chiou |author2=Craig Music |author3=Kara Sprague |author4=Rebekah Wahba |date=5 Dec 2001 |title=A Marriage of Convenience: The Founding of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514101306/http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2001/AILab.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DARPA supported the evolution of the [[ARPANET]] (the first wide-area packet switching network), Packet Radio Network, Packet Satellite Network and ultimately, the [[Internet]] and research in the [[artificial intelligence]] fields of speech recognition and signal processing, including parts of [[Shakey the robot]].&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghn.ieee.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Bertram_Raphael |title=Oral History: Bertram Raphael |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |accessdate=2012-02-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516195054/http://ghn.ieee.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History%3ABertram_Raphael |archivedate=2013-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DARPA also funded the development of the [[Douglas Engelbart]]'s NLS computer system and [[The Mother of All Demos]]; and the [[Aspen Movie Map]], which was probably the first [[hypermedia]] system and an important precursor of [[virtual reality]].

===Later history (1970–1980)===
The [[Mike Mansfield|Mansfield Amendment]] of 1973 expressly limited appropriations for defense research (through ARPA/DARPA) only to projects with direct military application. Some{{Who|date=September 2009}} contend that the amendment devastated American science, since ARPA/DARPA was a major funding source for basic science projects of the time; the [[National Science Foundation]] never made up the difference as expected.

The resulting "[[Human capital flight|brain drain]]" is also credited with boosting the development of the fledgling personal computer industry. Some young computer scientists left the universities to startups and private research laboratories such as [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]].

Between 1976 and 1981, DARPA's major projects were dominated by air, land, sea, and space technology, tactical armor and anti-armor programs, infrared sensing for space-based surveillance, high-energy laser technology for space-based missile defense, antisubmarine warfare, advanced cruise missiles, advanced aircraft, and defense applications of advanced computing. These large-scale technological program demonstrations were joined by integrated circuit research, which resulted in submicrometer electronic technology and electron devices that evolved into the [[Very-large-scale integration|Very-Large-Scale Integration]] (VLSI) Program and the Congressionally-mandated charged particle beam program.

Many of the successful programs were transitioned to the Services, such as the foundation technologies in [[automatic target recognition]], space based sensing, propulsion, and materials that were transferred to the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Strategic Defense Initiative Organization]] (SDIO), later known as the [[Ballistic Missile Defense Organization]] (BMDO), now titled the [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA).

===Recent history (1981–present)===
During the 1980s, the attention of the Agency was centered on information processing and aircraft-related programs, including the [[Rockwell X-30|National Aerospace Plane (NASP)]] or [[Hypersonic Research Program (DARPA)|Hypersonic Research Program]]. The [[Strategic Computing Program (DARPA)|Strategic Computing Program]] enabled DARPA to exploit advanced processing and networking technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the [[Vietnam War]]. In addition, DARPA began to pursue new concepts for small, lightweight satellites ([[LIGHTSAT (DARPA)|LIGHTSAT]]) and directed new programs regarding defense manufacturing, submarine technology, and armor/anti-armor.

On October 28, 2009 the agency broke ground on a new facility in Arlington, Virginia a few miles from the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Washington Times]]'', "Pentagon Agency Breaks Ground", October 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2011, DARPA hosted the [[100 Year Starship|100-Year Starship]] Symposium with the aim of getting the public to start thinking seriously about interstellar travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2012/01/28/fmoon-colony-newt-darpa-has-100-year-starship/|title=Forget the Moon Colony, Newt: DARPA Aims for 100 Year Starship|first=Tina|last=Casey|publisher=CleanTechnica|date=2012-01-28|accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2016, NASA and DARPA announced that it planned to build new X-planes with NASA's plan setting to create a whole series of X planes over the next 10 years.&lt;ref name="Building X Planes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasa-darpa-reveal-radical-future-160000121.html |title=NASA and DARPA plan to release new X-Planes |last=Grady |first=Mary |date=June 5, 2016 |website=[[Yahoo Tech]] |access-date=June 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611120846/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasa-darpa-reveal-radical-future-160000121.html |archivedate=June 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, it was announced that DARPA would bring a group of top-notch computer security experts to search for security vulnerabilities and create a fix that patches those vulnerabilities and it is called the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/darpa-grand-cyber-challenge-hacking-000000417.html |title=Darpa to create Cyber Grand Challenge to fight security vulnerabilities |last=Howley |first=Daniel |date=17 July 2016 |access-date=17 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718190614/https://www.yahoo.com/tech/darpa-grand-cyber-challenge-hacking-000000417.html |archivedate=18 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, DARPA leaders demonstrated a number of new technologies that were developed within the framework of the GXV-T program. The goal of this program is to create a lightly armored combat vehicle of not very large dimensions, which, due to maneuverability and other tricks, can successfully resist modern [[anti-tank weapon]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newatlas.com/darpa-gxv-t-demonstration-military-vehicle-technology/55198/ "DARPA demonstrates 6 new technologies behind the agile combat vehicles of tomorrow"] New Atlas, June 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

===Current program offices===
DARPA has six technical offices that manage the agency's research portfolio, and two additional support offices that manage special projects and transition efforts.{{clarify |reason= there are seven offices listed, instead the expected eight|date=September 2017}} All offices report to the DARPA director:

* The [[Adaptive Execution Office (DARPA)|Adaptive Execution Office (AEO)]] is one of two new DARPA offices created in 2009 by the DARPA Director, [[Regina Dugan]]. The office's four project areas include technology transition, assessment, rapid [[productivity]] and [[adaptive system]]s. AEO provides the agency with robust connections to the warfighter community and assists the agency with the planning and execution of technology demonstrations and field trials to promote adoption by the warfighter, accelerating the transition of new technologies into DoD capabilities. 
* The [[Defense Sciences Office|Defense Sciences Office (DSO)]] vigorously pursues the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and develops those technologies into important, radically new military capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/DSO/ |title=DARPA/DSO Home Page |date=2 December 1998 |website=archive.org |accessdate=6 June 2017 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981202153000/http://www.darpa.mil/DSO/ |archivedate=2 December 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DSO identifies and pursues high-risk, high-payoff fundamental research initiatives across a broad spectrum of science and engineering disciplines – sometimes reshaping existing fields or creating entirely new disciplines – and transforms these initiatives into radically new, game-changing technologies for U.S. national security.&amp;nbsp;
* The [[Information Innovation Office|Information Innovation Office (I2O)]] aims to ensure U.S. technological superiority in all areas where information can provide a decisive military advantage. Some of the program managers in I2O are Wade Shen (as of December 2014), Stuart Wagner (as of September 2014), Steve Jameson (as of August 2014), Angelos Keromytis (as of July 2014), and David Doermann (as of April 2014). Brian Pierce is currently the office director.
* The [[Microsystems Technology Office|Microsystems Technology Office (MTO)]] mission focuses on the heterogeneous microchip-scale integration of electronics, photonics, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Their high risk/high payoff technology is aimed at solving the national level problems of protection from biological, chemical and information attack and to provide operational dominance for mobile distributed command and control, combined manned/unmanned warfare, and dynamic, adaptive military planning and execution.
* The [[Strategic Technology Office (DARPA)|Strategic Technology Office (STO)]] mission is to focus on technologies that have a global theater-wide impact and that involve multiple Services.&lt;ref name="darpa.mil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darpa.mil/offices.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015051855/http://www.darpa.mil/offices.html |archivedate=2009-10-15 |df= }} DARPA Offices. Retrieved 2009-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Tactical Technology Office (DARPA)|Tactical Technology Office (TTO)]] engages in high-risk, high-payoff advanced military research, emphasizing the "system" and "subsystem" approach to the development of aeronautic, space, and land systems as well as embedded processors and control systems. 
* The [[Biological Technologies Office (DARPA)|Biological Technologies Office (BTO)]] fosters, demonstrates, and transitions  breakthrough fundamental research, discoveries, and applications that integrate biology, engineering, and computer science for national security. Created in April 2014 by then director [[Arati Prabhakar]], taking programs from the MTO and DSO divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2014-04-01|title=DARPA Launches Biological Technologies Office |date=1 April 2014 |website=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former offices===
* [[Information Awareness Office]]: 2002–2003
* The [[Advanced Technology Office (DARPA)|Advanced Technology Office (ATO)]] researched, demonstrated, and developed high payoff projects in maritime, communications, special operations, command and control, and information assurance and survivability mission areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* The [[Special Projects Office (DARPA)|Special Projects Office (SPO)]] researched, developed, demonstrated, and transitioned technologies focused on addressing present and emerging national challenges. SPO investments ranged from the development of enabling technologies to the demonstration of large prototype systems. SPO developed technologies to counter the emerging threat of underground facilities used for purposes ranging from command-and-control, to weapons storage and staging, to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. SPO developed significantly more cost-effective ways to counter proliferated, inexpensive cruise missiles, UAVs, and other platforms used for weapon delivery, jamming, and surveillance. SPO invested in novel space technologies across the spectrum of space control applications including rapid access, space situational awareness, counterspace, and persistent tactical grade sensing approaches including extremely large space apertures and structures.
* The [[Information Systems Office| Information Systems Office (ISO)]] in the 1990s developed system applications of advanced information technologies.  It was a predecessor to the Information Exploitation Office.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
A 1991 reorganization created several offices which existed throughout the early 1990s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_n27_v171/ai_n28601257/ | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708012812/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_n27_v171/ai_n28601257/ | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-07-08 | work=Defense Daily | title=DARPA restructures/creates new offices | year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Electronic Systems Technology Office]] combined areas of the Defense Sciences Office and the Defense Manufacturing Office. This new office will focus on the boundary between general-purpose computers and the physical world, such as sensors, displays and the first few layers of specialized signal-processing that couple these modules to standard computer interfaces.
* The [[Computing Systems Technology Office]] combined functions of the old Information Sciences and Tactical Technology office. The office "will work scalable parallel and distributed heterogeneous computing systems technologies", DoD said.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* The [[Software and Intelligent Systems Technology Office]] and the [[Computing Systems office]] will have responsibility associated with the Presidential High-Performance Computing Initiative. The Software office will also be responsible for "software systems technology, [[machine intelligence]] and software engineering".
* The [[Land Systems Office]] was created to develop advanced land vehicle and anti-armor systems, once the domain of the Tactical Technology Office
* The [[Undersea Warfare Office]] combined areas of the Advanced Vehicle Systems and Tactical Technology offices to develop and demonstrate submarine stealth and counterstealth and automation.
Reorganization in 2010 merged two offices:
* The [[Transformational Convergence Technology Office (DARPA)|Transformational Convergence Technology Office (TCTO)]] mission was to advance new crosscutting capabilities derived from a broad range of emerging technological and social trends, particularly in areas related to computing and computing-reliant subareas of the life sciences, social sciences, manufacturing, and commerce. The TCTO was folded into the I2O in 2010.&lt;ref name="darpa.mil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcwire.com/2010/09/22/embedded_clouds_a_look_back_at_hpec_2010/ |title=Embedded Clouds: A Look Back at HPEC 2010 |work=HPCwire |accessdate=7 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707185535/http://www.hpcwire.com/2010/09/22/embedded_clouds_a_look_back_at_hpec_2010/ |archivedate=7 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Information Processing Techniques Office|Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO)]] focused on inventing the networking, computing, and software technologies vital to ensuring DOD military superiority. The IPTO was combined with TCTO in 2010 to form the I2O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/2014/events/event_IAP28839 |title=Schedule – sxsw.com |work=SXSW Schedule 2014 |accessdate=7 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909201234/http://schedule.sxsw.com/2014/events/event_IAP28839 |archivedate=9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
A list of DARPA's active and archived projects is available on the agency's website. Because of the agency's fast pace, programs constantly start and stop based on the needs of the U.S. government.

* DARPA is well known as a high-tech government agency, and as such has many appearances in popular fiction.  Some realistic references to DARPA in fiction are as "ARPA" in ''[[Tom Swift]] and the Visitor from Planet X'' (DARPA consults on a technical threat),&lt;ref&gt;Victor Appleton II, 1961.

'''Demetrios Vikelas''' (also ''Demetrius Bikelas''; {{lang-el|Δημήτριος Βικέλας}}; February 15, 1835&lt;ref&gt;Some sources use the date 1832 (Llewellyn Smith, ''Olympics in Athens.'', 84)&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; July 20, 1908) was a Greek businessman and writer; he was the first [[President of the International Olympic Committee|President]] of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), from 1894 to 1896.

After a childhood spent in Greece and [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]), he found fortune in [[London]], where he married. He then moved to [[Paris]], on account of his wife. Abandoning business, he dedicated himself to literature and history, and published numerous novels, short stories and essays, which earned him a distinguished reputation.

Because of his reputation and the fact that he lived in Paris, he was chosen to represent Greece in a congress called by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] in June 1894, which decided to re-establish the [[Olympic Games]] and to organise them in [[Athens]] in 1896, designating Vikelas to preside over the organisation committee. After the Games were over, he stepped down, remaining in Athens until his death in 1908.

==Childhood==
Vikelas was born in [[Ermoupoli]], on the island of [[Syros]] in [[Greece]]. His father was a merchant, originally from [[Veria]] (then part of the Ottoman Empire, today capital of the northern Greek province of [[Imathia]] in [[Central Macedonia]]) and his mother, Smaragda, was a member of the rich Melas family. He was educated at home by his mother,&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 84"&gt;Llewellyn Smith, ''Olympics in Athens'', 84&lt;/ref&gt; possibly due to his fragile health.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

When he was six, the family moved to [[Constantinople]], and ten years after that to [[Odessa]]. There he started working for his father's business.

Already he showed signs of his literary potential. At the age of 17 he translated ''[[Esther (drama)|Esther]]'', a tragedy by [[Jean Racine]].&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 84" /&gt;

==London, from business to literature==
While aged 17, in 1852, he left home to live in [[London]] with his uncles Leon and Vasileios Melas, where he worked for their business, Melas Bros, first as a bookkeeper and then as a partner. He also began to maintain a weekly correspondence with his mother.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 84" /&gt;

This correspondence, which was kept, is one of the most important in establishing his biography. He also kept a journal in which he recorded not only facts about his daily life but also advice from his uncle Leon and his thoughts on books he had read and plays he was able to attend.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 84-85"&gt;Llewellyn Smith, ''Olympics in Athens'', 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

After his day's work at his uncles' business, he took evening classes at [[University College London]] (the only university in London which did not require students to be [[Anglican]]). There, he obtained a degree in [[botany]] (the only subject which offered evening classes).&lt;ref name="Dolianitis 106-107"&gt;Dolianitis, ''Demetrius Vikelas'', 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; He learned German and Italian. He also took part in fencing, horse-riding and rowing, although circumstances did not allow him to keep these up.&lt;ref name="Dolianitis 107"&gt;Dolianitis, ''Demetrius Vikelas'', 107&lt;/ref&gt; He had also become very scholarly, and started to publish &amp;mdash; an anthology of poems in 1862 and numerous articles in London periodicals, on the British press and the growing of cotton in Greece.

[[File:Prosopografia Dimitriou Vikela.jpg|thumb|200px|A portrait of Vikelas by [[Nikolaos Xydias Typaldos]].]]

During the political events of 1863 in Greece, following the revolution which led to the eviction of [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] and the enthronement of [[George I of Greece|George I]], Vikelas led fundraising efforts in support of the provisional government. He also wrote letters to the main newspapers of the time to demand that Greece's rights be respected.&lt;ref name="Dolianitis 107-108"&gt;Dolianitis, ''Demetrius Vikelas'', 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; He became definitively known in the British intellectual world in 1866 when he contacted authors and academics to gain their support for the [[Crete|Cretan]] cause during the [[Cretan Revolt (1866–1869)|Cretan Revolt of 1866-1867]], for which he raised more fundraising.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 85"&gt;Llewellyn Smith, ''Olympics in Athens'', 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dolianitis 108"&gt;Dolianitis, ''Demetrius Vikelas'', 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1866, he married Kalliope Geralopoulou, a young sister of Katerini, the wife of one of his uncles, also a member of a rich merchant family in London.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 85" /&gt; He also became a titular partner in his uncles' business.&lt;ref name="Dolianitis 108" /&gt;

He also met and became friends with [[Charilaos Trikoupis]] - the son of the Greek ambassador to Britain [[Spyridon Trikoupis]], himself destined to become [[Prime Minister of Greece]]. At the time they met, Charilaos Trikoupis was just starting his diplomatic and political career as an attaché, then ''chargé d'affaires'', of the Greek legation. The two men kept a busy correspondence.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 85" /&gt;

Demetrius Vikelas continued to gain favour in Greece &amp;mdash; in 1868 he published a 30-page statistical article on the [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]] following a conference at the [[Royal Statistical Society]]; in 1870 he founded a school for Greek children living in England. All his work &amp;mdash; polemic, political, journalistic, historical or literary &amp;mdash; had a double objective: to elevate the morals and level of intellect of his country but also to change its reputation with respect to the rest of the world. In his historical essay of 1874, ''On the Byzantines'', he wrote that he wanted to restore the reputation of the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name="Dolianitis 108" /&gt;

In 1876, in the wake of the economic crisis that had started in 1873, and in order not to lose the profits of their work, Vikelas and his uncles dissolved their business (now called "Melas Bros - D. Vikelas"). He thus found himself in command of a comfortable fortune, which allowed him to fully dedicate his time to literature.&lt;ref name="Dolianitis 109"&gt;Dolianitis, ''Demetrius Vikelas'', 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paris, the illness of his wife, and literature==
In 1874, following the death of her father, Vikelas' wife Kalliope began to suffer from mental problems and showed a number of suicidal tendencies.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 85" /&gt; The couple tried travelling to ease the illness. In Paris, following another scare, doctors declared Kalliope mad and she stayed for seven and a half months in [[Jules Bernard Luys]]' asylum in [[Ivry-sur-Seine]]. True to his character, Vikelas recorded the progress of his wife's mental health daily during the twenty years which followed.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 85" /&gt;

In his journal, from 1872 Vikelas expressed the wish to move to Athens. In 1877, while Kalliope's condition was in remission, they took the opportunity to make the move. Vikelas started to build a home around the corner from the streets of [[Panepistimiou Street|Panepistimiou]] (on which the [[University of Athens|University]] was situated) and [[Voukourestiou Street|Voukourestiou]].&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 16"&gt;Llewellyn Smith, ''The exemplary life of Dimitrios Vikelas'', 16&lt;/ref&gt; However, his wife's health worsened again and he accompanied her to France where she again stayed in Ivry-sur-Seine.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 85" /&gt;

During his stays in Paris, Vikelas embarked on translating [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] plays into Greek: ''[[King Lear]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]'' during his wife's first stay (1878), and ''[[Macbeth]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]'' during the second (1881). The public readings of his translations received an enthusiastic welcome in the literary community in Athens. He then also wrote his main literary work: ''Loukis Laras''.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 85" /&gt; The book first appeared in Athens as a series starting in 1879. The same year, it was translated into French and German. The French translation (which had its first republication in 1880) was included by the Education Minister [[Jules Ferry]] in the list of works which could be given as prizes to good students.&lt;ref name="Dolianitis 109-110"&gt;Dolianitis, ''Demetrius Vikelas'', 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Julietteadam.jpg|thumb|[[Juliette Adam]]]]

Vikelas spent the following fifteen years in Paris, building up contacts with the surrounding intellectuals and literati of the French capital. Consequently, [[Juliette Adam]] dedicated her anthology ''Poètes grecs contemporains'' ("Contemporary Greek poets"), published in 1881, to him, and he published in her ''Nouvelle Revue''.&lt;ref name="Basch 229"&gt;Basch, ''Le Mirage Grec'', 229&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote for it, as before, numerous articles (on Byzantine history, Eastern issues and Greek political life), novels (a compendium in French and Greek came out in 1887) and even travel guides.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 86"&gt;Llewellyn Smith, ''Olympics in Athens'', 86&lt;/ref&gt;

In the linguistic controversy in Greece between ''[[Katharevousa]]'' and ''[[Dimotiki]]'', Vikelas chose the middle ground, rejecting the excesses of the Dimotikists just as much as the fierce defenders of the more intellectual language. He suggested using ''Katharevousa'' for parliamentary proceedings, for example, but popular language for poetry.&lt;ref name="Basch 231"&gt;Basch, ''Le Mirage Grec'', 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1877 and 1892, he travelled, since at the worst of her crises, his wife could not bear his presence. He returned to Greece, visited Scotland, Switzerland, Spain and Constantinople.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 86" /&gt;

In 1892, he bought a new plot in Athens (between the streets of Kriezotou and Valaoriti) where he built a new residence which was also his final home.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 86" /&gt;

In 1893, he helped finance the construction of the {{ill|Greek Orthodox Cathedral, Paris|fr|Cathédrale grecque Saint-Étienne de Paris|lt=Greek Orthodox church in Paris}}.&lt;ref name="Dolianitis 111"&gt;Dolianitis, ''Demetrius Vikelas'', 111&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1894, he received a request from the [[Panellinios Gymnastikos Syllogos|Pan-Hellenic Gymnastic Club]], asking him to assist at a congress on amateurism convened the following month by [[Pierre de Coubertin]]. After hesitation, he agreed to represent the association.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 86" /&gt; Following the congress it was decided to recreate the [[Olympic Games]] and to organise them in [[Athens]].

Originally, it had been De Coubertin's idea to hold the first celebration of the modern [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympics]] in [[Paris]] in 1900, but Vikelas convinced him and the newly created [[International Olympic Committee]] that they should be held in [[Athens]], in order to symbolically link them to the [[Ancient Olympic Games|original Games]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} As the constitution of the IOC at that time required the IOC president to be from the country which would host the next Games, Vikelas became the IOC's first president.

==Permanent return to Greece==
With his responsibility for the [[1896 Summer Olympics]], Vikelas returned to Greece for just ten days in autumn 1894. On October the 14th, he received a telegram from doctor Luys informing him that the condition of his wife had worsened. She had [[œdema]]s in her thighs, calves and stomach. She could no longer feed herself. He urgently returned to Paris.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 95"&gt;Llewellyn Smith, ''Olympics in Athens'', 95&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that she then died.

In November 1894, a number of young nationalist officers, advocates of the [[Megali Idea]], created a secret society, [[Ethniki Etairia]], whose aim was to revive the morale of the country and prepare the liberation of Greek peoples still under the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 49-50"&gt;Llewellyn Smith, ''Olympics in Athens'', 49-50&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1895, they recruited civilians, all linked to the organisation of the Olympic Games, including Vikelas himself, although he claimed only to have given in to friendly pressure, playing a solely financial role and then quickly resigning from it.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 149-150"&gt;Llewellyn Smith, ''Olympics in Athens'', 149-150&lt;/ref&gt; At this point he was still attracted by the possibility of rebuilding his country.

After the Games, which proved a success, Vikelas withdrew from the IOC, replaced as a member by the Count Alexander Mercati and as president by Coubertin. The defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] which came soon after dealt a serious blow to his morale. He decided to leave Paris to move permanently to Athens. There he dedicated himself to popular education. In 1899 he founded the "Society for the Spread of Useful Books" in Athens, to help the country to recover from its defeat.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, ''Εύλλογος πρὸς διάδοσιν ὠφελίμων βιβλίων'', 117&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, he represented the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]] at the third [[Olympic Congress]] and seventh [[List of IOC meetings|IOC Meeting]] in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="Revue Olympique 132"&gt;Revue Olympique, ''Demetrius Bikelas'', 132&lt;/ref&gt; He also remained an active member of the [[Hellenic Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref name="Olympic Review"&gt;Olympic Review, ''Greece and Olympism'', 253&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Athens on 20 July 1908 "from an afflicting illness".&lt;ref name="Revue Olympique 131"&gt;Revue Olympique, ''Demetrius Bikelas'', 131&lt;/ref&gt;

He had been made a knight of the [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honour]] on 31 December 1891, and [[Honorary degree|honorary doctor]] of the [[University of St Andrews]] in November 1893 (the first Greek to receive this honour).&lt;ref name="Dolianitis 111" /&gt; He was a member (from 1874, and Vice-President from 1894&lt;ref name="Dolianitis 111" /&gt;) of the French "Association for the Promotion of Greek Studies", and of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in London.

==Legacy==
He left his immense library collection to the city of [[Heraklion]] in [[Crete]], founding the Vikelaia Municipal Library.&lt;ref name="Heraklion"&gt;{{cite web

Though in fact he did not live much of his life in [[Syros]], the island counts him among its most well-known sons. Today, the Sports Center (Stadium) in [[Ermoupoli]] bears Demetrios Vikelas' name. The stadium seats 2000 people, and has an Olympic-size [[swimming pool]], four [[tennis]] courts, two gym halls, [[Basketball|basket]] and [[volleyball]] courts, [[track and field]], floor football court and [[Football (soccer)|soccer]] field.

Also the [[Syros Island National Airport]] is named for him.

== The Olympic Movement ==

===First Olympic Congress===
[[Image:Coubertin.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre de Coubertin]]]]
[[Pierre de Coubertin]] had already attempted to restart the Olympic Games at the Congress for the fifth anniversary of the [[Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques]] in 1892. While he may have raised the enthusiasm of the public, he didn't manage to establish a proper commitment.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 87"&gt;Llewellyn Smith, ''Olympics in Athens'', 87&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BASA-3K-7-422-5-1896 Summer Olympics.jpg|thumb|left|The [[International Olympic Committee]] at the first Olympic Games in Athens. Vikelas is seated in the center]]
He decided to reiterate his efforts at the Congress in 1894 which followed, which would openly address the issue of amateur sports, but also with the sub-text of the recreation of the Olympic Games. Six of the seven points which would be debated pertained to amateurism (definition, disqualification, betting, etc.) and the seventh on the possibility of restoring the Games. Coubertin also sought to give an international dimension to his congress. He gained support from several personalities: the [[Leopold II of Belgium|King of the Belgians]], the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], the [[Constantine I of Greece|Diadochus Constantine]] (hereditary prince of Greece) and [[William Penny Brookes]], the founder of the "Olympian Games" in Shropshire, England, and Ioannis Phokianos.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 79-81"&gt;Llewellyn Smith, ''Olympics in Athens'', 79–81&lt;/ref&gt; Phokianos was a professor of mathematics and physics and a college principal. Phokianos was also one of the propagators of sport in Greece and the organizer of an Olympic Games sponsored by [[Evangelis Zappas]] in 1875. In 1888, Phokianos organized an elite and private Games as the founder of the [[Panellinios Gymnastikos Syllogos|Pan-Hellenic Gymnastic Club]].&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 61"&gt;Llewellyn Smith, ''Olympics in Athens'', 61&lt;/ref&gt; Phokianos could not travel to Paris for financial reasons and because he was finalizing the construction of his new college. He turned to one of the more eminent representatives of the Greek community in Paris, Demetrios Vikelas, to whom he wrote to ask him to take part in the Congress.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn Smith 88"&gt;Llewellyn Smith, ''Olympics in Athens'', 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Design Institute of Australia''' ('''DIA''') is an [[Australian]] organisation that represents [[designers]] in Australia.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dia.org.au/index.cfm?id=10 | title=The DIA | accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DIA acts as a professional body representing all disciplines of design, and undertakes work such as the promotion of ethical standards for the design industry, as well as promoting co-operation between individual designers.&lt;ref name="StrategicPlan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.design.org.au/index.cfm?id=12 | title=The DIA Strategic Plan | accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The organisation was founded as the Society of Designers for Industry in 1947, and first incorporated as the Industrial Design Institute of Australia on 15 August 1958, with chapters in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]]. The institute joined the [[International Council of Societies of Industrial Design|ICSID]]&lt;ref name="ICSID"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.design.org.au/index.cfm?id=78 | title=ICSID | accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967. They joined [[International Council of Design]] in 1980 and then, on 20 December 1982, the organisation was again renamed to the Design Institute of Australia, as it is today. On 1 July 1998, the organisation merged with the Society of Interior Designers of Australia, and the Australian Textile Design Association; becoming a National rather than Federal body.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.design.org.au/index.cfm?id=204 | title=History of the DIA | accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a member of the [[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, and later joined the [[National Religious Party]]. In 1946 he was amongst the founders of kibbutz [[Ein Tzurim]]. After the kibbutz was conquered by the [[Jordan]]ian Army, he was a [[prisoner of war]] for ten months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=659 Gershon Shafat: Public Activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; When released, he was a member of the group that re-established Ein Tzurim in a new location.

In 1974 he became a member of the [[Gush Emunim]] [[Israeli settlement|settlement]] movement's secretariat, and held the post of political secretary between 1976 and 1979.

'''ISO 10962''' defines the structure and format for classification of [[financial instrument]]s approved by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).
There are many types of Financial Instruments used for saving, investing, trading, hedging and speculating.  These instruments are generally organized in groups called "asset classifications." The most common asset classifications are generally described using terms like "Equities (Stocks)," "Debt (Bonds)," "Derivatives (Contracts)," "Currencies," and a few other generalized terms. 

ISO 10962 provides a global standard for these classifications in the form of specific codes.  Classification of financial instrument (CFI) Code is used to define and describe [[financial instruments]] as a uniform set of codes for all market participants.&lt;ref name="annaweb"&gt;{{Cite web
  | title = CFI &amp; ISO 10962 on ANNA website
  | publisher = Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA)
  | url = http://www.anna-web.org/standards/cfi-iso-10962
  | accessdate = 30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The code is issued by the members of [http://www.anna-web.org/standards/cfi-iso-10962 ANNA, the Association of National Numbering Agencies].  The group is currently working to simplify the structure so that it can be adopted more widely by non-governmental market participants.

The [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s from the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] in each position of this 6 character code reflect specific characteristics intrinsic to the financial instruments that are defined at the issue of the instrument, and which in most cases remain unchanged during the lifetime of the instrument (or by the market on which the instrument trades).&lt;ref name="fix"&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of ISO 10962 Modification==
* Standard was first accepted and published in 1997
* The last revised and accepted version of the standard is ISO 10962:2015 and was published by ISO in 2015.&lt;ref name="iso1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/44799.html|title=ISO 10962:2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Organization for Standardization (ISO)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302082529/https://www.iso.org/standard/44799.html|archive-date=2017-03-02|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 2006 [[FIX Protocol|FIX Protocol group]] published a proposal for changes of the standard for Consultation, but the changes have not yet been accepted.&lt;ref name="fix"/&gt; 
* As of May 17, 2013 an update of the standard is under development &lt;ref name="iso2"&gt;{{Cite web
  | title = ISO/CD 10962
  | publisher = International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
  | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=44799
  | accessdate = 30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and Goals of Introduction==

Where distinct entities transact it is seen as helpful to establish a common transaction language. The CFI code is meant to provide the most comprehensive information possible, while at the same time maintaining the code manageability, provides a standard for identification of type of instrument and their main high level characteristics, determined by the intrinsic characteristics of the financial instrument, which would be independent of the individual names or conventions of a given country or financial institution. This principle avoids confusion arising from different linguistic usage as well as redundancy, while allowing an objective comparison of the instruments across markets.&lt;ref name="fix"/&gt;

CFI codes also aim to simplify electronic communication between participants, improve understanding of the characteristics of financial instruments for the investors, and allow securities grouping in a consistent manner for reporting and categorization purposes.&lt;ref name="annaweb"/&gt;

==Structure of CFI Code==

==Early career==
From 1988 to 1999 Garibashvili attended the secondary school No. 1 in [[Dedoplistsqaro]]. From 1999 to 2005 Garibashvili studied International Relations at [[Tbilisi State University]] (TSU), where he graduated with a master's degree. He also studied at the [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University]] from 2002 to 2004. Since 2004, he has worked with the multi-billionaire [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]]. He started by working for logistics division of the construction company Burji, owned by Ivanshvili's Cartu Group. He became Director General of Ivanishvili's charity foundation Cartu in 2005, a member of the supervisory board of Ivanishvili's Cartu Bank in 2007 and director of the label Georgian Dream founded by Ivanishvili's pop-star son [[Bera Ivanishvili|Bera]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="netgazeti - biography"&gt;{{cite news|title=ირაკლი ღარიბაშვილის ბიოგრაფია|url=http://netgazeti.ge/2013/11/02/25089/|accessdate=December 23, 2015|agency=Netgazeti.ge|language=Georgian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of the Prime Minister|url=http://gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=202|publisher=Government of Georgia|accessdate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Georgia: Interior Minister Irakli Gharibashvili Proposed as PM|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/67718|accessdate=December 24, 2015|agency=Eurasianet|date=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==

Garibashvili became involved in the politics of Georgia when Ivanishvili founded his political party [[Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia]] in February 2012. Garibashvili was one of the founding members and initially headed the party’s revision committee.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He was included in the party list of [[Member of Parliament|MP]] candidates for the [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|October 2012 parliamentary election]]. After the coalition won the 2012 parliamentary election on October 1, Irakli Garibashvili became a party-list representative of the Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia party in the 2012 convocation of the [[Parliament of Georgia]].&lt;ref name=netgazeti.ge&gt;{{cite web|title=Gharibashvili biography| url=http://www.netgazeti.ge/GE/105/News/25089/| publisher=netgazeti.ge|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minister of Internal Affairs==
After Georgian Dream's victory in the 2012 parliamentary election, Garibashvili was appointed as Minister of Internal Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Ivanishvili on October 25, 2012. Garibashvili, then 30 years old and described by the [[Georgian media]] as "Ivanishvili's right-hand man", became the youngest member of Georgia's new government. Reforming the [[Interior Ministry]], an agency overseeing Georgian police, security and intelligence services, as well as the border guard and [[Coast Guard of Georgia|navy]], was a part of the Georgian Dream's pre-election agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25403 New Interior Minister Names his Deputies]. ''Civil Georgia''. October 30, 2012. Retrieved December 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  

From 2012 through 2013, the Interior Ministry arrested several high-ranking officials from the previous government, including the former ministers [[Bachana Akhalaia]] and [[Ivane Merabishvili]]. This led to concerns regarding selective justice and political vengeance and drew criticism from the domestic opposition and the international media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25495 Ivanishvili: Saakashvili's Lobbying 'Will Not Stop Restoring Justice']. ''Civil Georgia''. November 30, 2012. Accessed December 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Garibashvili's agency also faced the post-election spike in crime in Georgia. Garibashvili defended the arrests as being in strict accordance with the law and justice and claimed that the rate of minor crime, albeit increased, was not alarming.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131103141522/http://georgiaonline.ge/news/a1/politics/1353376810.php Interior Minister: Recent arrests are fair].

November 30, 2012. Accessed December 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime Minister==
On November 2, 2013, Prime Minister [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]], who had declared his intention to quit the government following the [[Georgian presidential election, 2013|October 2013 presidential election]], named Garibashvili as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Garibashvili Named as Next PM|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26653|accessdate=November 2, 2013|newspaper=Civil Georgia|date=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[Cabinet of Irakli Garibashvili|his cabinet]] won in a vote of 93-19&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia's Parliament Approves New Prime Minister|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/georgias-parliament-approves-prime-minister-20952201|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Parliament of Georgia]] on November 20, 2013. Garibashvili thus occupied the most powerful political office in the country as the [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|constitution]] amendments had transferred power from the president to the prime minister and the government. At heated parliamentary debates with the [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] minority during the vote, Garibashvili promised economic improvement and stressed that Georgia's EU and NATO aspiration would remain his foreign priorities.&lt;ref name="civil-1"/&gt; On November 24, 2013, he was elected chairman of the Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia party, succeeding Ivanishvili.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26721 Ivanishvili: 'I Quit Politics, But Remain Active Citizen']. ''Civil Georgia''. November 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Garibashvili announced his resignation on December 23, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=28876|title=PM Irakli Garibashvili Resigns|author=Civil.ge|date=December 23, 2015|publisher=Civil.ge|accessdate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While no reason was given for the sudden move, it was reported that he may have done so due to low levels of support for the Georgian Dream among the populace, with it polling at 18% in November, and [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2016|parliamentary elections scheduled for 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/georgia-pm-address-nation-coalition-discusses-replacement-141241289.html|title=Georgia prime minister resigns after two years|last=Metreveli|first=Irakli|date=December 23, 2015|publisher=Yahoo.com|accessdate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition politicians, analysts and media speculated that falling support for the ruling Georgian Dream coalition, pressure from the previous prime minister [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]], or tensions with the president [[Giorgi Margvelashvili]] were possible explanations for Garibashvili's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fuller|first1=Liz|title=Did Georgia's 'Informal Leader' Pressure Prime Minister To Resign?|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/caucasus-report-georgia-garibashvili-resigns/27447558.html|accessdate=December 27, 2015|agency=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garibashvili was succeeded as prime minister by [[Giorgi Kvirikashvili]], who had been his [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], with the transfer of power taking effect on December 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=28892|title=Kvirikashvili Confirmed as New PM|author=Civil.ge|date=2015-12-29|publisher=Civil.ge|accessdate=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgian Government initiated, and the [[European Union]] directly supported, the development of the Human Rights Strategy and Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia Advances in Human Rights|url=http://www.ge.undp.org/content/georgia/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2014/02/13/georgian-government-presents-national-strategy-and-action-plan-on-human-rights.html|website=UNDP in Georgia|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relevant statement was made by Prime Minister Garibashvili at the Human Rights Conference, on December 4, 2013. The Human Rights Strategy covers seven years and will not depend on the political cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Human Rights Strategy of Georgia|url=http://yourhumanrights.ge/about-us/national-human-rights-strategy-of-georgia/|website=Georgian Government for Your Rights|accessdate=27 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203001730/http://yourhumanrights.ge/about-us/national-human-rights-strategy-of-georgia/|archivedate=February 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
During his tenure, Garibashvili visited the neighboring countries Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkey, several European nations, the United States, Israel, the People's Republic of China, and participated in several international summits and forums. While relations to Russia improved, there was no state visits to and from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prime Minister's Visits and Meetings|url=http://gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=40|publisher=Government of Georgia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Relations to the European Union were a priority, culminating in the EU-Georgia Association Agreement, initiated at the Vilnius summit and signed on June 27, 2014. This association agreement included a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement between Georgia and the European Union and paved the way for the abolition of visa for travel from Georgia to the [[Schengen area]], planned for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU-Georgia relations|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/georgia/index_en.htm|website=European External Action Service|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prime Minister congratulates the Georgian people on EU’s positive conclusion regarding visa liberalization action plan|url=http://commersant.ge/index.php?m=5&amp;news_id=30594&amp;cat_id=7|agency=Commersant.ge|date=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Garibashvili is married to Nunuka Tamazashvili (born 1983), with three sons, Nikoloz (born 2005), Andria (born 2010), Gabriel (born 2015) and one daughter Nino (born 2016). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset Declaration|url=https://declaration.gov.ge/eng/declaration.php?id=44067|publisher=Government of Georgia|accessdate=December 24, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225052231/https://declaration.gov.ge/eng/declaration.php?id=44067|archivedate=December 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Third son born to Georgian PM’s family|url=http://en.trend.az/scaucasus/georgia/2381349.html|accessdate=December 24, 2015|agency=Trend.az}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father-in-law, Tamaz Tamazashvili, is a former police general who was arrested on charges of illegally carrying and keeping weapon and explosives in October 2011. Garibashvili, a member of then-opposition Georgian Dream party, claimed the arrest was politically motivated. After the Georgian Dream acceded to power in October 2012, Tamazashvili was released from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Political Motives of General Tamaz Tamazashvili's Imprisonment Was Doubtlessly Proved"|url=http://www.humanrights.ge/index.php?a=main&amp;pid=16968&amp;lang=eng|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=Humanrights.ge|date=August 16, 2013|agency=PirWeli Information Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jalan M.H. Thamrin''' or '''Jalan Thamrin''' ('''M.H. Thamrin Road''' or '''Thamrin Road''') is a major thoroughfare in Jakarta. The road is located at the center of Jakarta, running from [[Selamat Datang Monument|Bundaran HI]] at the south end to the roundabout near [[Arjuna Wijaya Statue]] at the north end. Developed in the 1950s, the road was a landmark of post-colonial Indonesia and continue to have a prominent importance in Jakarta.

==Description==
Thamrin Road is classified as a secondary arterial road in Jakarta. 

The road passes through five urban administrative villages:
*[[Gambir, Gambir]], [[Central Jakarta]]
*[[Kebon Sirih, Menteng]], [[Central Jakarta]]
*[[Gondangdia, Menteng]], [[Central Jakarta]]
*[[Menteng, Menteng]], [[Central Jakarta]]
*[[Kebon Melati, Tanah Abang]], [[Central Jakarta]]

Thamrin Road is closed to traffic every Sunday from 6:00 until 11:00 as part of [[Car-Free Days|Jakarta Car Free Days]] campaign.

==History==
===Before Thamrin Road===
The road that would become Thamrin Road first appear around late 1910s as a small lane running from Koningsplein West (now Medan Merdeka Barat) to Kebon Sirih. This lane was known as Gang Timboel.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=102}} Prominent landmark near this small lane was a 19th-century Armenian Church for the [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian community]] of Batavia.&lt;ref name="armenianindien"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imexbo.nl/armenen-in-nederlandsch-indie.html |title=De Armeniërs, een volk waar ik deels van afstam. |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=imexbo.nl |publisher=imexbo.nl |accessdate=June 21, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church has been demolished. The former location of the Armenian Church is the green within the complex of Bank Indonesia.

===1950s Kebayoran Baru===
The development of the suburb [[Kebayoran Baru|Kebayoran]] in 1949 raised the need to link the suburb with the city center of Jakarta, and thus work on a new "highway" began in the same year. The northern half of this new highway received the name Jalan M.H. Thamrin by January 1951, after Indonesian [[National Hero of Indonesia|National Hero]] [[Mohammad Husni Thamrin]].{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=102}} To avoid the occupation of the newly opened lands by illegal squatters - a major problem at the time - the government sold these lands cheaply to those who committed to build on it within three to six months. Despite this, time extensions had to be granted because buyers could not arrange finance or procure building materials.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=103}} 

Among the early projects situated in Thamrin Road were [[Sarinah|Sarinah Department Store]], Bank Dagang Negara building (now Wisma Mandiri), Ministry of Religion building, [[Wisma Nusantara]], [[Hotel Indonesia]] and the prominent [[Selamat Datang Monument|Bundaran Hotel Indonesia]].{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=103}} Thamrin Road was largely completed by 1953.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=102}}

===1962 Asian Games expansion===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gezicht over de Jalan Thamrin en Jakarta TMnr 20018022.jpg|thumb|right|View of the southern half of Thamrin Road from Hotel Kartika Plaza in the 1970s.]] 
With the arrival of the [[1962 Asian Games]], President [[Sukarno]] imagined the VIP visitors for the Asian Games arriving at [[Kemayoran Airport]], drove along Thamrin Road, be greeted by the [[Selamat Datang Monument|Welcome Monument]] and stayed at [[Hotel Indonesia]]. For the Games itself, the same VIP visitors would be driven along [[Jalan Jenderal Sudirman|Sudirman Road]] over the [[Semanggi Interchange|Semanggi cloverleaf bridge]] into the newly-opened [[Gelora Bung Karno Stadium|Gelora Bung Karno sports complex]] where the competitions would take place.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=99}} For the purpose of the game, both Thamrin and Sudirman Road were widened in the early 1960s.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=102}} A regulation was also established which requires buildings along Thamrin Road to be minimum five-stories-high. This was difficult to achieve due to lack of funding and commercial building expertise at that time, and the fact that there were already several two-story government buildings along Thamrin Road.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=103}}

In the beginning of 1970s, Thamrin Road was already a major thoroughfare of Jakarta as envisaged by Sukarno. Buildings reached a minimum height of five stories e.g. ICA building (later the United Nations), Hotel Asoka, the Australian Embassy, and the state-owned developer Pembangunan Perumahan. Sudirman Road was still relatively devoid of development during the early 1970s compare with Thamrin Road, with the exception of the [[Gelora Bung Karno]] sports complex.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=21}} 

Several parades were enacted along the major thoroughfare, including Jakarta's anniversary parade and [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Independence Day]] parade.

===TransJakarta===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Jalan Thamrin TMnr 20018355.jpg|thumb|right|Thamrin Road in 1993 before the introduction of [[TransJakarta]] [[bus rapid transit|BRT]].]]
Up until the 2000s, Thamrin Road consisted of four [[carriageway]]s consisting of [[local-express lanes]], 3 lanes for the express lane and 2 lanes for the local lane. With the introduction of [[TransJakarta]] [[bus rapid transit|BRT]] in 2004, one of the lane of the express lanes was converted into a dedicated lane for the BRT. Eventually, Thamrin Road was made a [[dual carriageway]] by removing the separator of the local and express lanes.

===Motorcycle===
The Jakarta administration in December 2014 introduced a ban on motorcycles from using Jalan Thamrin and the adjoining Jalan Medan Merdeka Barat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Folmer|title=City Revised Motorcycle Ban Passing Regulation on Jalan Thamrin|url=http://www.beritajakarta.id/en/read/5350/city-revised-motorcycle-ban-passing-regulation-on-jalan-thamrin|accessdate=4 August 2017|publisher=Beritajakarta.id|date=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ban was reverted by governor [[Anies Baswedan]].

The '''KPMG tax shelter fraud''' scandal involves allegedly illegal U.S. tax shelters by [[KPMG]] that were exposed beginning in 2003. In early 2005, the United States member firm of KPMG International, KPMG [[Limited liability partnership|LLP]], was accused by the [[United States Department of Justice]] of fraud in marketing abusive [[tax shelter]]s.

==Deferred prosecution agreement==
Under a [[deferred prosecution agreement]], KPMG LLP admitted criminal wrongdoing in creating fraudulent tax shelters to help wealthy clients dodge $2.5 billion in taxes and agreed to pay $456 million in penalties. KPMG LLP will not face criminal prosecution as long as it complies with the terms of its agreement with the government. On January 3, 2007, the criminal conspiracy charges against KPMG were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/03/AR2007010301883.html&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Federal Attorney [[Michael J. Garcia]] stated that the charges could be reinstated if KPMG does not continue to submit to continued monitorship through September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/03/business/NA_FIN_US_KPMG_Tax_Shelters.php&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 2005, nine individuals, including six former KPMG partners and the former deputy chairman of the firm, were criminally indicted in relation to the multibillion-dollar criminal tax fraud conspiracy. The nine individuals named in the indictment were:
* Jeffrey Stein, former Deputy Chairman of KPMG, former Vice Chairman of Tax Services, and former KPMG tax partner, a lawyer with a Master's in tax law.
* John Lanning, former Vice Chairman of Tax Services, and former KPMG tax partner, a CPA (Certified Public Accountant).
* Richard Smith, former Vice Chairman of KPMG in charge of Tax, a former leader of KPMG's Washington National Tax, and former KPMG tax partner, a lawyer.
* Philip Wiesner, former Partner-In-Charge of KPMG's Washington National Tax and former KPMG tax partner, a lawyer with a Master's in tax law and a CPA.
* John Larson, a lawyer, CPA and former KPMG Senior Tax Manager who left KPMG to form a series of entities with defendant Robert Pfaff, which entities participated in certain tax shelter transactions as the purported investment advisor.
* Robert Pfaff, a lawyer, CPA and former KPMG tax partner, who left KPMG to form a series of entities with defendant John Larson.
* Raymond J. Ruble, also known as R.J. Ruble, a lawyer and former tax partner in the New York, New York, office of [[Sidley Austin]], a prominent national law firm.
* Mark Watson, former Partner-in-Charge of the Personal Financial Planning division in KPMG'S Washington National Tax, and former KPMG tax partner, a CPA.

On 17 October 2005, another ten individuals were indicted on criminal conspiracy and tax evasion charges:
*

The four tax shelters at issue were known as [[BLIPS]], or bond linked issue premium structure; Flips, or foreign leveraged investment program; OPIS, or offshore portfolio investment strategy and a variant of Flips; and SOS, or short option strategies.

==Chronology==
In August 2005, former official of the German bank Bayerische Hypo-Und Vereinsbank AG (HVB) Domenick DeGiorgio, who worked with KPMG to sell the shelters, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and fraud charges.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/22/AR2005082201484.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 February 2006, HVB admitted to criminal wrongdoing for its participation in the KPMG tax shelter fraud. The prosecution against the company was deferred by agreement with the U.S. Attorney. Under its deferred prosecution agreement, the company will pay $29.6 million in fines, restitution and penalties.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.law.virginia.edu/Garrett/prosecution_agreements/press_release/German_Bank_HVB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2006, U.S. District Judge [[Lewis A. Kaplan]] released former KPMG accounting executive David Greenberg on $25 million bail.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/09/business/kpmg.php&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan's ruling reversed his previous denial of bail to Greenberg.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accountancy.com.pk/newsprac.asp?newsid=620&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge Kaplan ordered Greenberg to live in Manhattan under electronic monitoring until his trial for tax fraud begins, and warned his family that they would be financially ruined if Greenberg attempted to flee the country. Kaplan also said that Greenberg's finances were in such disarray that it was impossible to figure out where his assets were and how much he was worth. Called a flight risk by federal prosecutors, Greenberg was the only defendant to be arrested by authorities when the indictments were handed down in October 2005.

On 28 March 2006, David Rivkin pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and tax evasion in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/28/business/kpmg.php&lt;/ref&gt;  "I knew that the losses should not have been claimed on the tax forms," Rivkin told Judge Kaplan. Rivkin admitted that he conspired with others between January 1999 and May 2004 to prepare and execute false documents so that clients could file false tax returns. He also admitted that he took steps to conceal the existence of fraudulent tax shelters from the Internal Revenue Service and avoided registering the shelters with the IRS by claiming attorney-client [[privilege (law)|privileges]]. Rivkin signed an agreement to cooperate with prosecutors, who could then ask the judge to consider giving Rivkin a more lenient sentence rather than the years he might face in prison. Sentencing was set for Feb. 9, 2007.

On 27 June 2006, Judge Kaplan ruled that by threatening KPMG with indictment unless the firm reneged on its policy of paying the defense costs of partners who were indicted for work performed in the course of the firm's tax shelter business, the Department of Justice violated the constitutional rights of employees. In his opinion, Judge Kaplan agreed with the defendants' contention that KPMG was improperly pressured not to pay their legal expenses, "because the government held the proverbial gun to its head."

In the meantime, related rulings were handed down in a civil case that had been brought against the Internal Revenue Service in late 2004 by two Texas lawyers, Harold W. Nix and C. Cary Patterson. Nix and Patterson sued the IRS for refunds after the tax agency denied each of their claims for nearly $67 million in deductions stemming from their use of the [[BLIPS]] tax shelter in 2000. Their lawsuit was thought to be relevant to the KPMG tax shelter fraud case, because BLIPS is one of the tax shelters alleged to be abusive by the prosecution in that matter. On 20 July 2006, Judge [[T. John Ward]] of United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ruled that the use of BLIPS by Nix and Patterson was essentially legitimate, because the I.R.S.'s application of tougher Treasury Department rules in 2003 to liabilities that occurred in BLIPS was "ineffective" and "not enforceable" because it was [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]]. The Internal Revenue Code generally prohibits retroactive regulations. In response to this ruling, prosecutors in the KPMG case have indicated that they will argue that the BLIPS shelter itself was technically valid, but that the way the defendants carried it out was fraudulent. In turn, lawyers for the defendants argue that no court of law has ever ruled that the tax shelters in question were illegal. And in February 2007, Judge Ward essentially reversed himself and ruled the tax shelter consisted of fake bank loans and therefore illegitimate, despite his previous ruling identified in the link above.

On 8 February 2007, [[Deutsche Bank]] reached a settlement with hundreds of investors to whom it sold aggressive U.S. tax shelters similar to those attacked by prosecution in the KPMG tax fraud case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/08/business/tax.php&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement came a year after US DOJ prosecutors in Manhattan announced their investigation of Deutsche Bank's role in questionable tax shelters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/15/business/tax.php&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2007, the Second Circuit dismissed a complaint against accounting firm KPMG to recover fees and expenses arising from criminal tax fraud charges involving former KPMG partners and employees.  The court held that the district court, which presides over the criminal case, erred in extending "ancillary" jurisdiction to the civil dispute between the defendants and non-party KPMG.  Treating KPMG's appeal as a petition for writ of mandamus, the court issued the writ, vacated the district court's orders, and dismissed the civil complaint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA2LTQzNTgtY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/06-4358-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://10.213.23.111:8080/isysquery/irl30c2/2/hilite ''Stein v. KPMG, LLP'', No. 06-4358 (2d Cir. May 23, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 2007, Judge Kaplan dismissed charges against 13 former KPMG employees, ruling that he had no alternative because the government had strong-armed KPMG into not paying the legal fees of defendants and had violated their rights.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/business/17kpmg.html?ei=5088&amp;en=090bf767b7bcf7ec&amp;ex=1342324800&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;pagewanted=print&lt;/ref&gt;  "This indictment charges serious crimes. They should have been decided on the merits as to every defendant," Kaplan wrote. "But there are limits on the permissible actions of even the best prosecutors." Barring KPMG from paying its former employees' legal bills "foreclosed these defendants from presenting the defenses they wished to present, and, in some cases, even deprived them of the counsel of their choice. This is intolerable in a society that holds itself out to the world as a paragon of justice," Kaplan wrote in his ruling. Kaplan's decision did not affect the prosecution of R.J. Ruble, a former law partner at [[Sidley Austin]] LLP, and three former KPMG partners, including David Greenberg, who worked in the firm's Orange County office and released KPMG from any obligation to him when he left its employ. John Larson and Robert Pfaff, the other two former partners still facing charges, left KPMG eight years before the criminal action was filed and did not initially seek to have the accounting firm pay their legal bills.

On 20 August 2007, the prosecutors announced that one of the aiders and abetters of tax fraud, David Amir Makov, agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with prosecution of his former colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/20/business/20tax.html?ex=1345348800&amp;en=8685cbeba4e14ad3&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink&lt;/ref&gt; In the preceding week, the federal court in Manhattan received $150,000 from Mr. Makov as part of a bail modification agreement that allows him to travel to Israel. Because Makov never worked for KPMG, he was unaffected by Judge Kaplan's dismissal of charges against 13 of his codefendants.

On 10 September 2007, Makov entered a guilty plea to one information count of conspiracy. He agreed to pay a $10 million penalty and provided new details on those involved. Makov gave a brief explanation on the workings of [[BLIPS]], or Bond Linked Issue Premium Structure, which he said he helped create. In previous hearings, Judge Kaplan had chastised prosecutors for failing to explain clearly how BLIPS worked. According to Makov's testimony, the BLIPS shelters were created to generate artificial losses that were then used by wealthy investors to offset gains in legitimate income. The shelter involved a purported investment component as well as banks, extending purported loans to investors. According to prosecutors, BLIPS were marketed and sold around 1999 and 2000 to at least 186 wealthy investors and generated at least $5.1 billion in phony tax losses. The Presidio entities that Makov formed, owned, and operated with co-defendants Robert Pfaff and John Larson, both former KPMG employees, made at least $134 million selling BLIPS. The IRS regards a tax shelter as abusive if it has no legitimate business purpose or genuine economic substance, in contrast to real loans, with money at risk, or real investments. According to Makov, although BLIPS were created on paper to look like seven-year investments, they involved neither real loans nor real investment components. "There was no economic substance," Makov testified. "Instead, we created the appearance of economic substance, rather than the reality." Makov claimed that although he initially thought that BLIPS were legitimate, "as part of the deception" he was eventually "asked by representatives of Bank A," among others, "to come up with an investment rationale." He added that he was "clearly told by Bank A, KPMG" and others "that the loan was not at risk." According to ''The New York Times'', people close to the case have identified "Bank A" as [[Deutsche Bank AG]]. The bank has not been charged, but is expected to reach a settlement with the government. A graduate of the [[Harvard Business School]] and a one-time employee of [[Long-Term Capital Management]], prior to founding Presidio around 1999, Makov worked at [[Deutsche Morgan Grenfell]], an investment banking arm of Deutsche Bank AG. Makov was originally charged with dozens of counts of fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy, with each count carrying five years in jail. Prosecutors are expected to drop all of the other charges if he cooperates throughout the trial.

Jury selection for the KPMG tax shelter fraud trial began on 9 October 2007. However, on 18 October 2007, Judge Kaplan postponed indefinitely the trial set to begin in five days, discharging jurors he had already selected to hear the case, and removing Steven Bauer of [[Latham &amp; Watkins]], a lawyer for former KPMG executive John Larson. The government had previously asked the judge to decide whether Bauer should be removed because he worked as a lawyer for Makov and may have a conflict of interest. Larson had declined to waive his right to have an attorney free of conflicting interests. Kaplan ruled to disqualify Bauer as trial counsel for Larson, and pledged to address the issue of whether Latham &amp; Watkins should also be disqualified if Larson seeks to be represented by another lawyer at that firm.

On 28 August 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the dismissal of criminal charges against 13 former executives at KPMG. The Court held that the government prosecutors "unjustifiably interfered with defendants' relationship with counsel and their ability to mount a defense, in violation of the Sixth Amendment...." by pressuring KPMG to refrain from paying their legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Stein'', 541 F.3d 130 (2d Cir. 2008), at [https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?q=%22541+F.3d+130%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,44&amp;case=10923022403932047606&amp;scilh=0].&lt;/ref&gt; Separately on the same day, Deputy U.S. Attorney General Mark Filip announced new prosecution rules aimed at not penalizing companies as noncooperative for protecting attorney-client material or paying for their employees' attorneys in probes. "No corporation is obligated to cooperate or to seek cooperation credit by disclosing information to the government," Filip said at a press conference at the New York Stock Exchange. "Refusal by a corporation to cooperate, just like refusal by an individual to cooperate, is not evidence of guilt."

On 15 October 2008, opening arguments began in the trial of David Greenberg and Robert Pfaff, former KPMG tax partners; John Larson, former KPMG senior tax manager; and Raymond Ruble, former partner at law firm Sidley Austin. The four defendants are charged with conspiring to evade taxes for more than 600 clients in a case that was touted as the largest criminal tax prosecution when it started in 2005 with 19 defendants, but is being tried on a much smaller scale. Assistant U.S. attorney John Hillebrecht told the jury in Manhattan federal court that the four men lied and cheated "by making the tax bills of some of our nation's richest citizens disappear." In turn, Larson's defense lawyer, Thomas Hagemann, stated that his client believed in good faith that what he did was allowed under the law, openly conducted his dealings, and acted with "good faith disclosure". Hagemann called David Makov, a former colleague of Larson, turned one of the government's main witnesses, "a liar and perjurer". The trial is expected to last three to four months.

On 24 November 2008, two of the remaining four defendants, former KPMG tax partner Robert Pfaff and former senior tax manager John Larson, filed a motion  to dismiss the charges against them or declare a mistrial. The motion said that during the trial prosecutors elicited testimony from a witness accusing Pfaff and Larson of concealing information from KPMG and its tax department to obtain KPMG approval for BLIPS, thus transforming a tax fraud conspiracy with KPMG against the IRS into an [[honest services fraud]] conspiracy against KPMG. The motion said the defense had received no notice of such a change in the prosecution's theory and could not prepare a defense and so sought to have the judge to dismiss the indictment or grant a mistrial. The motion claimed  that the government's alleged deceitful procurement of KPMG's confidential tax returns through a parallel civil tax fraud investigation by the DOJ was a violation of due process.  The defendants relied on three cases where district courts dismissed indictments or suppressed evidence "where the Government has brought a civil action solely to obtain evidence for its criminal prosecution, or has failed to advise the defendant in its civil proceeding that it contemplates his criminal prosecution."  (Two of these cases were later reversed on appeal.) The prosecution responded that the government has always alleged, and still contends, that KPMG as an entity was a conspirator, not a victim of any kind of fraud. "That for a period of time there was an effort to keep certain facts from certain individual KPMG employees is of no moment whatever," the government said. Judge Kaplan rejected the motion, finding that neither of the circumstances invoked by the defendants applied to their case: "Defendants do not deny that there was a bona fide civil investigation, they complain merely that there was a criminal investigation as well.  And defendants, who were not the targets of the civil investigation, do not claim to have been deceived by the government."  In a footnote, the court notes that the defendants relied in part on the fact that four of the now dismissed defendants had given deposition testimony while unaware of the criminal investigation.  Judge Kaplan added that they "do not suggest that the government deceived these individuals," suggesting perhaps that if the government had engaged in some deceptive conduct, the defendants' motion might have had more traction.

1 December 2008 marked the expiration of the deadline for the federal prosecutors to seek [[certiorari]] by asking the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] to reconsider the 28 August 2008 [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2nd Circuit appeals court]]'s decision that upheld the 17 July 2007 ruling by Judge Kaplan in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District Court of New York]], dismissing criminal charges against 13 of the 19 original defendants.

From 8 to 10 December 2008, the jury heard closing arguments in the KPMG tax shelter case. Raymond Ruble's lawyer Jack S. Hoffinger told jurors that it was impossible to conclude that the defendants purposefully tried to break the law in helping at least 600 wealthy people trim their taxes, since they did not try to hide what they were doing from the Internal Revenue Service or others. "What do we have, a massive suicide pact?" he asked. He said that the defendants would not have designed something criminal and then "put it out there so that the IRS will see it, the government will see it and we will end up in court charged with a crime." Assistant U.S. Attorney Margaret Garnett retorted that the defendants created tax shelters that were actually shams meant to appear to be legitimate investments: "These defendants sold these so-called investments for years and years and not a single one of these defendants' clients ever made a dime of profit." She said that the only purpose of the fraudulent tax shelters marketed from 1997 until 2000 was to "generate artificial tax losses to evade millions and millions of taxes." She speculated that the defendants may have had a false sense of safety from the law, and claimed that "their greed and ambition overcame their sense of right and wrong."

On 18 December 2008, lawyer Raymond Ruble, who once was a partner at Brown &amp; Wood, was convicted on 10 counts of tax evasion while investment consultants Robert Pfaff and John Larson were convicted on 12 counts. They were acquitted of conspiracy. David Greenberg, deemed by the prosecution an "ongoing danger to the community" and a flight risk, was acquitted of all charges. Greenberg was jailed for five months and required to wear electronic monitoring for two and a half years afterward. His acquittal came as a result of Steve Acosta, a key government witness, being "utterly incapable of giving a straight answer on cross examination", as conceded by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Hillebrecht in closing arguments. Acosta has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and tax evasion in a cooperation deal aimed at leniency at sentencing, a possibility the government said was now in jeopardy. Without leniency, he could face three years in prison. Judge Kaplan ordered that electronic monitoring begin for Pfaff at his Golden, Colo., home and for Larson at his New York City home, though the judge said he would reassess the need at a bail hearing next month, especially after what happened with Greenberg. Six people, including former KPMG tax partner David Rivkin; David Amir Makov, a one-time currency and fixed-income derivatives trader at Presidio; and Domenick DeGiorgio, a former managing director at German bank HVB, or Bayerische Hypo &amp; Vereinsbank, have pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the matter.

Some of KPMG's tax shelter clients are now suing KPMG for the liability exposure.

[[File:Kunstmesse München No58 Main Entrance 02.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Main entrance of ''{{lang|de|Kunstmesse München}} 58'' in 2013]]
The '''{{lang|de|Kunstmesse München}}''' (''[[Munich]] Art Fair'') is the oldest art and antiques fair in [[Germany]]. Held annually in the autumn with a run-time of ten days, it is a fair for the general public, attended by leading national and international exhibitors. For some time now its venue is the historic {{lang|de|Postpalast}} in Munich, on Wredestraße near the [[Hackerbrücke]]. The offer ranges from [[Protohistory]] and Ancient History (such as [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egypt]]) via the [[arts and crafts]] of the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] through to [[Modern art|art and design of Modernism]] until approximately 1970, with occasional exceptions. The fair is organised by ''Expo Management Kiel'', its conceptual sponsor is, in continuation of the {{lang|de|[[Bundesverband Deutscher Galerien und Kunsthändler|Deutscher Kunsthandelsverband]]}}, the newly founded {{lang|de|Kunsthändlerverband Deutschland}} (a [[Eingetragener Verein|registered association]]).&lt;ref&gt;Annegret Erhard: [http://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/kunsthandel-auktionen/die-traditionelle-kunstmesse-muenchen-im-eleganten-postpalast-1.18169790 ''Die traditionelle Kunstmesse München im eleganten Postpalast.''] [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung|NZZ]], 18 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The {{lang|de|Kunstmesse München}} set out in 1956 as {{lang|de|Deutsche Kunst und Antiquitätenmesse}} under the conceptual sponsorship of the {{lang|de|Deutscher Kunsthandelsverband}}. Until 1988, the leading event of its kind, it took place in the {{lang|de|[[Haus der Kunst]]}} in Munich. Thereafter it was, for reasons of space, relocated to the {{lang|de|Messe München}} (Munich Trade Fair), finally in the [[Neue Messe München|fairground at Riem]].&lt;ref&gt;Brita Sachs: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunstmarkt/messen/kunstmesse-muenchen-mit-leichter-hand-ein-museales-ambiente-schaffen-1490461.html ''Kunstmesse München, Mit leichter Hand ein museales Ambiente schaffen.''] [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], 13 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After a re-organization (and a transitory name change to ''Fine Art &amp; Antiques'' for legal reasons), the historic {{lang|de|Postpalast}} in Munich was determined as the venue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiornaledellarte.com/articoli/2011/10/110638.html ''"Oktoberfest".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9406">A '''land contract''' — often described by [[#Other names|other terminology listed below]] — is a contract between the buyer and seller of [[real property]] in which the seller provides the buyer [[credit (finance)|financing]] in the purchase, and the buyer repays the resulting loan in [[Hire purchase|installments]]. Under a land contract, the seller retains the legal [[Title (property)|title]] to the property, while permitting the buyer to take possession of it for most purposes other than legal ownership. The sale price is typically paid in periodic installments, often with a [[balloon payment]] at the end to make the [[timelength]] of payments shorter than in the corresponding fully [[Amortization|amortized]] loan (i.e., a loan without a final balloon payment). When the full purchase price has been paid including any [[interest]], the seller is obligated to [[Conveyancing|convey]] (to the buyer) legal title to the property. An initial [[down payment]] from the buyer to the seller is usually also required.  

The [[land contract law|legal status of land contracts]] varies between jurisdictions.{{vague|date= October 2016|reason = implausible that correlation between "region[s]" and "legal status[es]" is more than — well, let's call it "a vague" — tendency.}}

Since a land contract specifies the sale of a specific item of [[real estate]] between a seller and buyer, a land contract can be considered a special type of [[real estate contract]]. In the usual, more conventional real estate contracts, a seller does not provide a loan to the buyer; the contract either does not specify a loan or includes provisions for a loan from a different "third party" lender, usually a financial institution in practice. When third party lenders are involved, typically a [[lien]], as part of a [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] or [[trust deed (real estate)|trust deed]], is placed on the property, in which the property serves as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] until the loan is repaid.

{{anchor|Other names}}Other terms for a land contract include:
* terms contract&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/sola1962100/s29a.html SALE OF LAND ACT 1962 - Section 29A] (Vic, Australia)&lt;/ref&gt;
* contract for deed
* agreement for deed
* land installment contract
* installment sale agreement

==Installment payments==
It is common for the installment payments of the purchase price to be similar to mortgage payments in amount and effect.  The amount is often determined according to a mortgage [[amortization schedule]]. In effect, each installment payment is partial payment of the purchase price and partial payment of interest on the unpaid purchase price. This is similar to mortgage payments which are part repayment of the principal amount of the mortgage loan and part interest.  As the buyer pays more toward the principal of the loan over time, his(her) equity (equitable title or equitable interest) in the property increases. For example, if a buyer pays a $2000 down payment and borrows $8000 for a $10000 parcel of land, and pays off in installments another $4000 of this loan (not including interest), the buyer has $6000 of equity in the land (which is 60% of the equitable title), but the seller holds legal title to the land as recorded in documentation ([[deed]]s) in a government [[Recorder of deeds|recorder's office]] until the loan is completely paid off.  However, if the buyer defaults on installment payments, the land contract may consider the failure to timely pay installments a [[breach of contract]] and the land equity may revert to the seller, depending on the land contract provisions.

Since land contracts can easily be written or modified by any seller or buyer; one may come across any variety of repayment plans. Interest only, [[negative amortization]]s, short balloons, extremely long amortizations just to name a few.  It is not uncommon for land contracts to go unrecorded. For several reasons, the buyer or seller may decide that the contract is not to be recorded in the register of deeds. This does not make the contract invalid, but it does increase exposure to undesirable side effects.  Some states, such as Minnesota, issue contracts without an [[acceleration clause]], which in the case of a default leaves the seller in a position to either cancel the contract, discharging any principal deficiency, as in the case of deprecation, or to litigate for 18 months or more while letting the buyer, if not a corporation, retain their rights to the property while collection attempts are made, by which time the buyer will often qualify for bankruptcy, making the contract, when lacking said [[acceleration clause]], effectively an installment option, when the buyer has no other lienable assets.  In bankruptcy, some regions will interpret it as an [[executory contract]] that can be rejected, while others will treat it as a debt to be paid out of the bankruptcy trust.  This and a wide variety of other legal ambiguities has led to a trend toward eliminating the use of Land Contracts to remove any incentives, and as a result, the disadvantages that these contracts have compared to the standard note and mortgage, which are more clearly defined in, and regulated by, law.  &lt;ref name="nature of contract"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3736/is_199801/ai_n8759824/pg_19/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912193027/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3736/is_199801/ai_n8759824/pg_19/ |archivedate=2010-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for a land contract==
Although most land contracts can be used for a variety of reasons, their most common use is as a form of short-term seller financing. Usually, but not always, the date on which the full amount of the purchase price is due will be years sooner than when the purchase price would be paid in full according to the amortization schedule.  This results in the final payment being a large [[balloon payment]].  Since the amount of the final payment is so large, the buyer may obtain a conventional mortgage loan from a bank to make the final payment.  Land contracts are sometimes used by buyers who do not qualify for conventional mortgage loans offered by a traditional lending institution, for reasons of unestablished or poor credit or an insufficient down payment.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}  Land contracts are also used when the seller is eager to sell and the buyer is not given enough time to arrange for conventional financing.

There can be other advantages of using a land contract too.  When a third-party lender, such as a financial institution, provides a loan, this third party has its own interests to protect against the other two parties involved, the seller and buyer.  Establishing the correct title and value of the property to be used as collateral is important to the lender.  Thus, the lender commonly requires title service including title search and [[title insurance]] by an independent title company, [[Real estate appraisal|appraisal]] and termite inspection of the property to ensure it has sufficient value, a [[Cadastre|land survey]] to ensure there are no encroachments, and use of lawyers to ensure the [[closing (real estate)|closing]] is done correctly.  These third party lender requirements add to [[closing costs]] which the lender requires the seller and/or buyer to pay.  If the seller is also the lender, these costs are usually not required by the seller and may result in closing cost savings and fewer complications.  It may also be the seller's position that if the buyer requires any of these services, he could pay for the costs and make arrangements himself.  For properties where only relatively undeveloped land is involved and if the seller is willing to finance, the price of the empty land may be so low that the conventional closing costs are not worthwhile and can be an impediment to a quick, simple sale.  Easy financing and a simple sale transaction may be a good selling point for a seller to offer a buyer.

A land contract is a unilateral contract and cannot be assigned to another buyer without the consent of the seller providing the financing.

== Consumer-protection concerns {{anchor|Concerns Growing}} ==
Because of growing concerns that sales via land contract might violate [[truth in lending]] laws, the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) is considering regulating these real estate sales.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/business/dealbook/contract-for-deed-lending-gets-federal-scrutiny.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, Texas law was changed to automatically place the legal title to the property with the buyer by filing the contract with the deed records office of the county where the property is located.  While the seller loses title, the seller retains a vendor's lien in the property for the outstanding balance of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edinburgpolitics.com/2015/06/01/protections-for-low-income-texas-homeowners-including-thousands-who-live-in-colonias-approved-by-the-legislature-says-rep-canales/&lt;/ref&gt;

Management is a type of labor but with a special role-coordinating the activities of inputs and carrying out the contracts agreed among inputs, all of which can be characterized as "decision making."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://business.illinois.edu/josephm/BA549_Fall%202010/Session%205/Fama%20(1980).pdf|title = Agency Problems and the Theory of the Firm|last = Fama|first = Eugene|date = 2008-08-24 &lt;!--  12:58 --&gt; |journal = The Journal of Political Economy|access-date = 2015-10-30|doi=10.1086/260866|volume=88|issue = 2|pages=288–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers usually face disciplinary forces by making themselves irreplaceable in a way that the company would lose without them. A manager has an incentive to invest the firm's resources in [[asset]]s whose value is higher under him than under the best alternative manager, even when such investments are not value-maximizing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304405X89900998|title = Management entrenchment: The case of manager-specific investments|last = Shleifer|first = Andrei|date = November 1989|journal = Journal of Financial Economics|access-date = 2015-10-30|doi=10.1016/0304-405X(89)90099-8|volume=25|pages=123–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Managerial entrenchment theory ==
When managers hold little [[Equity (finance)|equity]] and shareholders are too dispersed to take action against non-value maximization behavior, insiders may deploy corporate actions to obtain personal benefits, such as shirking and perquisite consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dividend Policy, Corporate Governance and the Managerial Entrenchment Hypothesis: An Empirical Analysis|journal = Journal of Business Finance &amp; Accounting|date = 2003-12-01|issn = 1468-5957|pages = 1173–1209|volume = 30|issue = 9–10|doi = 10.1111/j.0306-686X.2003.05624.x|first = Jorge|last = Farinha}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ownership and control is divided within a company, [[agency costs]] arise. However [[agency costs]] decline if the ownership within the company increases as managers are responsible for a larger cost of these [[shares]]. On the other hand, given ownership to a manager within a company may translate into greater voting power which makes the manager's workplace more secure. Hence, they gain protection against takeover threats and the current managerial market.

[[File:Stakeholder (en).png|thumb|Stakeholders]]

=== Examples of entrenchment strategies ===
There are a variety of entrenchment practices that managers may employ, such as poison pills, super majority amendments, anti-takeover devices, or the so-called golden parachutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://e-archivo.uc3m.es/bitstream/handle/10016/6611/indemwp0901.pdf?sequence=5|title = IS MANAGERIAL ENTRENCHMENT ALWAYS BAD? A CSR APPROACH|date = |accessdate = 2015-03-11|website = |publisher = |last = Ballester|first = Carmen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Poison pills - There are two types of poison pills:  1. A "flip-in" allows existing shareholders (except the acquirer) to buy more shares at a discount.  2. A "flip-over" allows stockholders to buy the acquirer's shares at a discounted price after the merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Poison Pill Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poisonpill.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-03|language = en-US|date = 2003-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Golden parachutes are contracts given to key executives and can be used as a type of antitakeover measure taken by a firm to discourage an unwanted takeover attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Golden Parachute Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldenparachute.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-03|language = en-US|date = 2003-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anti-takeover devices-Companies have many different options for preventing takeovers. Continuous provisions include stipulations in the corporate covenant and issues of participating preferred stock. The sporadic measures include the pac-man and macaroni defenses, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anti-Takeover Measure Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anti-takeovermeasure.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US|date = 2003-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A corporate amendment in a company's charter requiring a large majority (anywhere from 67-90%) of shareholders to approve important changes, such as a merger.  This is sometimes called a "supermajority amendment". Often a company's charter will simply call for a majority (more than 50%) to make these types of decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Supermajority Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supermajority.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US|date = 2003-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Managerial entrenchment and capital structure decision ==

=== Associations between the two ===
There are associations between managerial entrenchment and capital structure decisions which mostly result on the fact that [[CEO]]s are reluctant to go into [[debt]] when funding an investment. The capital structure is the way that the company chooses to fund its own operations and growth. Debt comes in the form of [[bond issues]] or long-term notes payable, while equity is classified as [[common stock]], [[preferred stock]] or [[retained earnings]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Capital Structure Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-01|language = en-US|date = 2004-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many models suggest that the manager keeps the [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] level according to where the firm mostly maximizes its value. The efficient choice of debt (optimal for shareholders) generally differs from the entrenchment choice (optimal for managers whose objective is to maximize tenure).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Research ===
[[Cross-sectional studies]] suggest that there is low leverage on firms where the CEO has characteristics associated with entrenchment. A characteristic would be if the CEO has years of experience in the same company. Low leverage was also persistent in companies which had no pressure or strong discipline over their CEOs. Events like the involuntary departure of the CEO and the arrival of a new large [[stockholder]] would gradually increase the levels of leverage comparing to before the events were to occur. Leverage also increases after CEOs are subjected to greater performance incentives in the form of increased inventories of [[stock options]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Managerial Entrenchment and Capital Structure Decisions on JSTOR|jstor = 2329441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, during takeover threats, managers tend to increase debt in order to increase the firm's value, making it more difficult for the takeover to occur. However, this does not necessarily mean that the manager's job is secure. In a sample of target firms that levered up the most, 37 percent of the managers lost their jobs within a year of the failed takeover attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Managerial Turnover and Leverage under a Takeover Threat|journal = The Journal of Finance|date = 2002-12-01|issn = 1540-6261|pages = 2619–2650|volume = 57|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/1540-6261.00508|first = Walter|last = Novaes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conclusions ===
According to the above research, there are three possible actions managers could take to entrench themselves in association with the [[gearing ratio]]:
* Managers are reluctant towards leverage as it concerns the firm's growth and activity. At the same time, they have the tendency to protect under-diversified human capital.
* Managers increase leverage above optimal point to increase their voting power of their stocks/shares with the aim of minimizing placement attempts.
* Managers sometimes allow excess leverage which is a temporary sign that assets are being sold and reorganized. This prevents attempts from outsiders as they might have different projects on how the company should grow.

Corporate governance essentially involves balancing the interests of the many stakeholders in a company - these include its shareholders, employees,  management, customers, suppliers, financiers, government and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Corporate Governance Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporategovernance.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-03|language = en-US|date = 2003-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger corporate governance is associated with a higher firm valuation and corporate governance mechanisms can be classified into a number of categories such as regulatory mechanisms, disclosures, shareholder rights, ownership structures, and board monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://thejournalofbusiness.org/index.php/site/article/viewFile/228/228|title = Governance, Managers' Entrenchment and Performance: Evidence in French Firms Listed in SBF 120|last = Moussa|first = sonia|date = 2009|journal = The Journal of Business|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 04/11/2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However through management entrenchment, ownership structure (one of the corporate governance mechanisms) changes in that way which benefits the managers. We already know from the above information that managers have a greater voting power while they are entrenched. A study carried out by Mock et al. on the relationship between manager ownership and firm's value found that as manager ownership increases, the firm's value increases as well, however not in the case where the manager is entrenched. The convergence-of-interest hypothesis suggests that a firm's market valuation should rise as its management owns an increasingly large portion of the firm. On the other hand, the entrenchment hypothesis suggests that as management increases its ownership, the incentive to maximize value declines as market discipline becomes less effective against a larger shareholding manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is your Management Aligned with Shareholders or Entrenched?|url = http://www.fusioninvesting.com/2011/04/is-your-management-aligned-with-shareholders-or-entrenched/|website = Fusion Investing and Analysis|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US|date = 2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence the entrenchment effect will dominate the incentive effect only for medium concentrated levels of management ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kinds of ownership structures in large firms|url = http://e.viaminvest.com/A5OwnershipStructures/Exhi_MorckEtAl.asp|website = e.viaminvest.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate governance in credit unions ===
[[Credit union]]s have a different approach towards management entrenchment and [[corporate governance]]. Since credit unions lack principal-agent governance between shareholders and other members, managers already enjoy benefits and job entrenchments that are not based on their performance. Given the theoretical predictions of Fudenberg and Tirole (1995) and the empirical research by Kanagaretnam, Lobo and Mathieu (2003) we predict that credit union managers with higher comparative levels of salary and [[perquisites]] (and limited outside opportunities) will aggressively engage in accounting manipulations when job security is threatened.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.efmaefm.org/0EFMSYMPOSIUM/2005/papers/40-Allan_Hodgson_paper.pdf|title = MANAGEMENT ENTRENCHMENT, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE and ACCOUNTING ARBITRAGE|date = |accessdate = 2015-01-11|website = |publisher = |last = Hodgson|first = Allan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Why managers engage in accounting manipulations ===
But to what extent are these managers willing to manipulate when [[capital requirements]] of credit unions are not met?

Triggering regulations to meet capital requirements for a credit union is very costly, but censuring accounting arbitrage is very costly at the same time. However,  some argue the expected costs of regulatory violation are larger than the reputation costs of censure from capital management.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Therefore, managers have three good reasons to involve and censure their accounting manipulations:
# Credit unions lack [[equity capital]].
# Lack of opportunities to increase raw capital because managers are unwilling to rise earning as in [[credit unions]] it is against their philosophical background ([[non-profit organisations]])
# Weak agency relationship between shareholders, members, boards etc.
Nowadays, there are several articles and essays on how to accomplish a proper entrenched management exercise without hurting shareholders, yet not abuse them–for example–when a board of directives is given the power to take corporate decisions in certain matters, where the corporation will be protected against hostile takeovers. Nonetheless, this form of corporate governance may cause distinct reaction on shares prices, which is why entrenchment management is not an easy concept to accomplish. Along with corporate governance, entrenchment management requires a lot of research and good management from the corporate market.

== Unions vs. entrenched managers ==
In practice, entrenched CEOs tend to get higher salary than non-entrenched CEOs. A survey has been conducted. which results suggest that entrenched CEO give higher salaries to their workers compared to non-entrenched CEOs. Because [[cash flow]] rights ownership by the CEO and better [[corporate governance]] are found to mitigate such behaviour, we interpret the higher pay as evidence of agency problems between [[shareholder]]s and managers affecting workers' pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Do Entrenched Managers Pay Their Workers More?|ssrn = 883717|date = 2005-12-01|location = Rochester, NY|first = Henrik|last = Cronqvist|first2 = Fredrik|last2 = Heyman|first3 = Mattias|last3 = Nilsson|first4 = Helena|last4 = Svaleryd|first5 = Jonas|last5 = Vlachos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a very real sense, [[Trade union|unions]] and managers compete to offer benefits to employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unions, Executive Pay, and Management Entrenchment|url = http://www.professorbainbridge.com/professorbainbridgecom/2006/11/unions-executive-pay-and-management-entrenchment.html|website = ProfessorBainbridge.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since entrenched CEO pay their workers high salaries, the CEO-worker relationship improves, making workers less likely to unionize. Often workers perceive managers' benefits to be more beneficial for them than unions. This leads us to the conclusion that entrenched CEOs have the characteristic of being very competitive when it comes to work loyalty.

'''Milan Mandarić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Милан Мандарић}}; born 5 September 1938) is a Serbian-American business tycoon who has owned a string of successful businesses and [[association football]] clubs, including [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. He is currently the owner of Slovenian club [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (2005)|NK Olimpija Ljubljana]]. He was born near [[Gospić]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (today [[Croatia]]), on 5 September 1938, and grew up in [[Novi Sad]], [[Serbia]].

==Business activities==

===Yugoslavia and Serbia===
Mandarić took control of his father's machine shop aged 21, and by the age of 26 had turned it into one of the largest businesses in the country.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slater|first1=Matt|title=Milan Mandaric: Football’s Mr Fixit says farewell|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31897956|accessdate=17 March 2015|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Yugoslavia was a socialist country, but a relatively free one.

===United States===
In 1969, worried by the Yugoslav government's view of his business, Mandarić left Yugoslavia and settled in the United States. He had to leave most of his fortune behind, and got a job for an American computer component manufacturer in [[California]]. When two of the senior managers left to start their own firm, Mandarić was invited to be their third partner. The firm was successful, but disagreements over manufacturing processes led to Mandarić leaving to form his own company, Lika Corporation, in 1971. In 1976, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the U.S. By 1976, Lika Corp. was the largest manufacturer of computer components in the U.S., and Mandarić was pioneering the boom that led to the creation of California's [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/simon_barnes/article745149.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Why does a successful man want to risk looking like a bloody fool | first=Simon | last=Barnes | date=3 December 2005 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sold the company to the [[Tandy Corporation]] in 1980 and set up a new company, [[Sanmina]], which manufactured [[printed circuit boards]]. In 2001, the company acquired SCI Systems,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zdnet.com/news/sanmina-acquires-sci-in-6-billion-deal/119716&lt;/ref&gt; a much larger competitor, becoming [[Sanmina-SCI Corporation]]. Mandarić also began branching out into investment banking operations, such as Behrman Capital. He also became owner of the [[St. Louis Storm]], a [[Major Indoor Soccer League (1978–1992)|Major Indoor Soccer League]] franchise which ceased operations in 1992 when the MISL also folded. He was ranked 1,049 in the times top 2,000 rich list, worth [[Pound sterling|£]]75&amp;nbsp;million.

On 23 December 2009, Mandarić was charged with two counts of [[tax evasion]] by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city/6973744/Former-Portsmouth-chairman-Milan-Mandaric-to-face-tax-charges.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Former Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandaric to face tax charges | first=Jonathan | last=Liew | date=12 January 2010 | accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however he was found not guilty on 8 February 2012.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Football==

===United States===
Around the same time he had begun using his money to invest in football, Mandarić's passion since childhood (as a young man he had played for Novi Sad). He set up firstly [[F.C. Lika]], then [[San Jose Earthquakes (1974–88)|San Jose Earthquakes]] which played in the United States' first professional league. In 1978, he purchased a [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] franchise called the [[Connecticut Bicentennials]] and moved them to [[Oakland]], California, to play as the [[Oakland Stompers|Stompers]]. After one year in the East Bay, the team was moved to [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], to become the [[Edmonton Drillers (1979–82)|Drillers]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

===Europe===
Sceptical about the future of the sport in the U.S., Mandarić looked to European football, owning first Belgian club [[R. Charleroi S.C.]] then French side [[OGC Nice]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

===Portsmouth===
In 1998, Mandarić sold Nice and took over English club [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in May 1999, to whom he had been introduced by ex-player [[Preki]].

After struggling for a number of years in the [[English football league system|second tier of English football]] (now the [[EFL Championship]]), Portsmouth won promotion as champions to the [[Premier League]], arguably the richest football division in the world. This was due in large part to Mandarić's appointment of the experienced manager [[Harry Redknapp]]. Mandarić appointed [[Velimir Zajec]] as executive director, a move which caused tension between Redknapp and Mandarić. Shortly afterwards, Redknapp resigned from Portsmouth.

In January 2006, Mandarić sold a 50% stake in the club to French-Israeli businessman [[Alexandre Gaydamak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/4574618.stm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402162522/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/4574618.stm |archivedate=2 April 2012 |title=Portsmouth confirm takeover plans |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2 January 2006 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the club's survival that season, Mandarić sold his remaining share of Portsmouth to Gaydamak, but stayed on as a figurehead in his role as non-executive chairman.

Mandarić resigned as chairman of Portsmouth on 21 September 2006. Since then, Portsmouth appeared to prosper, with successive top-ten Premier League finishes and an [[FA Cup]] win in [[2008 FA Cup Final|2008]]. The club, however, was relegated in 2010 and have since dropped dramatically, suffering the ignominy of successive relegation in [[2011–12 Portsmouth F.C. season|2011–12]] and [[2012–13 Portsmouth F.C. season|2012–13]], ending in the fourth tier of English football, [[EFL League Two|League Two]].

[[Portsmouth City Council]] conferred the [[Freedom of the City]] of Portsmouth on Mandarić in 2003.

=== Leicester City ===
On 24 February, Mandarić made a bid for [[East Midlands]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], believed to be in the region of £25&amp;nbsp;million.  He had wanted to remain outside of football for a longer period, however he "had to accelerate takeover plans" because of bids for the club by at least two other parties. On 18 November 2006, Leicester City accepted his approach to take over the club at an [[extraordinary general meeting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/6098724.stm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408073711/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/6098724.stm |archivedate=8 April 2008 |title=Mandaric confirms Leicester bid |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite setting an initial takeover deadline of 15 December, negotiations stalled, reportedly after hidden debts in the club's accounts surfaced during the [[due diligence]] period. Both parties, however, dismissed reports that the takeover bid was in danger of collapse, stating that it had merely been delayed. Indeed, on 2 January the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'' reported that the deal was in fact close to completion after Mandarić's revised terms were accepted by the club's board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebluearmy.co.uk/details.asp?back=true&amp;key=1D29%7C0%7C2185366269754%7CR%7C536%7C545923212007425757931&amp;parentkey=1D29%7C0%7C2185366269754%7Cp%7C536%7C0 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080425230517/http://www.thebluearmy.co.uk/details.asp?back=true&amp;key=1D29%7C0%7C2185366269754%7CR%7C536%7C545923212007425757931&amp;parentkey=1D29%7C0%7C2185366269754%7Cp%7C536%7C0 |archivedate=25 April 2008 |title=
It's a deal! |publisher= ''[[Leicester Mercury]]''|date=2 January 2007 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 15 January, the paper reported that an official announcement confirming the takeover "will probably be on Thursday".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=132385&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=132378&amp;contentPK=16403201&amp;folderPk=77460&amp;pNodeId=132401 Milan Deal: It's almost there!]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by [[Leicester Mercury]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January, Mandarić put his bid for Leicester on temporary hold after news of his mother's illness back in Serbia. There were wild rumours that suggested he was on the verge of pulling out and, indeed, the delay guaranteed that manager [[Rob Kelly]] would not enjoy the benefit of a cash injection before the season's transfer window closed on 31 January. Mandarić, however, returned from Serbia to complete the deal the following week.

On 13 February 2007, Mandarić was officially unveiled as owner of Leicester City. However, that the club were still a [[public limited company]] (PLC) meant he did not acquire the title of chairman for a further 23 days. In April 2007, he sacked manager Kelly and replaced him with [[Nigel Worthington]] as caretaker manager for the last five games of the season. At the end of the season, [[Martin Allen (footballer)|Martin Allen]] was named the club's new permanent manager but Allen left after only three months in charge in August as a result of deteriorating relations with Mandarić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/6969388.stm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112021840/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/6969388.stm |archivedate=12 November 2012 |title=Allen ends brief Leicester reign |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=29 August 2007 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Megson]] was then appointed in September, becoming the third manager since Mandarić took over the club. Megson left after only six weeks in charge to take control of Premier League team [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. [[Ian Holloway]] was Mandarić's fourth permanent manager, appointed in November 2007. Leicester, however, was relegated to [[EFL League One|League One]] at the end of the season for the first time in the club's history; many observers attributed this to the large turnover in managers since Mandarić took control of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/7384017.stm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509032617/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/7384017.stm |archivedate=9 May 2008 |title=Leicester drop to an all-time low |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandarić was arrested on 28 November 2007 over allegations of corruption in football, along with Harry Redknapp, [[Peter Storrie]], [[Willie McKay]] and [[Amdy Faye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7116823.stm|title=Redknapp held in football inquiry|accessdate=28 November 2007|date=28 November 2007|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later released without charge.

[[File:Nigel and Milan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nigel Pearson|Pearson]] and Mandarić after winning the [[EFL League One|League One]] title with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].]]

After tumultuous times, however, things started to look up for Mandarić in the form of Leicester being crowned champions of League One on 18 April 2009 under the stewardship of [[Nigel Pearson]]. The Foxes came close to achieving a second successive promotion [[2009–10 in English football|the following season]] (something not achieved by any club at this level for a decade) as they finished fifth in the Championship but lost to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the playoff semi-finals.

During the close season, it was reported that Mandarić had agreed to sell Leicester City to a consortium of Thai businessmen, but these reports were swiftly denied by club officials. Just weeks later, however, he sold the club for a reported £40&amp;nbsp;million to [[Vichai Raksriaksorn]] and his son Aiyawatt. It later emerged that Mandarić was a shareholder in the consortium and he was re-appointed chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/3053766/Leicester-deny-sale-rumours.html|title=Foxes deny sell-off rumours | location=London | work=The Sun|date=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sheffield Wednesday ===
On 29 November 2010, Mandarić agreed to purchase [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. The purchase was completed after an extraordinary general meeting of Sheffield Wednesday shareholders on 14 December 2010, during which 99.7% of shareholders voted to sell the company to Mandarić's UK Football Investments for £1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swfc.co.uk/page/TheChairman/0,,10304~2243885,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329034513/http://www.swfc.co.uk/page/TheChairman/0%2C%2C10304~2243885%2C00.html |archivedate=29 March 2012 |title=Club Announcement – Sheffield Wednesday PLC ("the Company") |publisher=Sheffield Wednesday F.C. |date=14 December 2001 |accessdate=24 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandarić had agreed to settle the club's outstanding debts as part of the largely confidential deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_wed/9226161.stm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002224325/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_wed/9226161.stm |archivedate=2 October 2013 |title=Milan Mandaric completes Sheffield Wednesday takeover |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=14 December 2010 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandarić also stepped down as chairman of Leicester City, due to Football League rules preventing him from being the Chairman of two different clubs.

=== NK Olimpija Ljubljana ===
On 15 June 2015 Milan Mandarić agreed to purchase [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (2005)|NK Olimpija Ljubljana]] from Izet Rastorder for about 4 million euros. He was very successful in his first  2015/2016 season and managed to win the league title with Olimpija, finishing 6 points ahead of fierce rivals [[NK Maribor]]. In his third season, 2017/2018, Olimpija won the double, both the championship and the cup.

'''Pierre Brasseur''' (21 June 1832 – 7 February 1918) was a [[Luxembourg]]ian entrepreneur, businessman, and mining magnate, being involved in founding a number of industrial concerns in southern Luxembourg.  Amongst them was one of the steel companies that would become [[ARBED]], and, after many mergers and consolidations, [[Arcelor Mittal]].

Pierre was a member of the [[Brasseur family]], born the eleventh son of Alexis Brasseur in [[Esch-sur-Alzette]].&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with a number of other associates, Pierre founded the Society for the Extraction of Minerals of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ({{lang-fr|Société pour l'Exploitation des Minières du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg}}).&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; in 1861.  The following year, he was awarded a [[Concession (contract)|concession]] to mine an area of {{convert|77|ha|sqmi}} near [[Rumelange]], in Luxembourg's [[Red Lands]].&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  He was appointed [[Civil law notary|notary]] in Esch-sur-Alzette in 1864.

His success allowed him to establish in 1870 the Society of Blast Furnaces of Luxembourg ({{lang-fr|S.A. des Hauts Fourneaux Luxembourgeois}}), along with twenty-six other subscribers.  He was one of the members of the first administrative council of the company, which directed the company until 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  The company opened two [[blast furnace]]s in Esch in 1872 and 1873.  In about 1874, he left the administrative council.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his name would forever be attached to the furnaces in Esch.  After mergers with German operations, and expansion in Esch-sur-Alzette and into [[Alsace-Lorraine]], the company would become the second-largest industrial business in the [[Zollverein]] (after [[Krupp]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1920, the firm would become [[ARBED]], which would form a major part of [[Arcelor Mittal]], the world's largest steel-maker.

In 1875, he was appointed notary in [[Differdange]].  Brasseur was appointed director of mines in Dudelange, which were to become the Society of Blast Furnaces and Forges of Dudelange.  In 1894, he founded the first [[cement]] company in Luxembourg, at Rumelange, which became the Society of Blast Furnaces of Rumelange in 1897.  He died on 7 February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 1864, he married Hélène Wurth,&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of [[François-Xavier Wurth-Paquet]], who had been a famous Luxembourgian politician and [[Minister for Justice of Luxembourg|Administrator-General for Luxembourg]].  Pierre's family played a key role in politics itself.  His son, [[Xavier Brasseur|Xavier]], was a [[Socialist Party (Luxembourg)|Socialist]] member of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]] (1902–12).  Pierre's younger brother, [[Dominique Brasseur|Dominique]],  was also a [[deputy (legislator)|deputy]] (1866–99) and [[mayor of Luxembourg City]] (1891–94).  Dominique's son, and Pierre's nephew, [[Robert Brasseur|Robert]], was a deputy (1899–1925) and founder of the [[Liberal League (Luxembourg)|Liberal League]].&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''public-sector trade union''' (or '''public-sector labor union''') is a [[trade union]] which primarily represents the interests of employees within [[public sector]] or governmental organizations.

==History and recent developments==

===Costa Rica===
{{Main|Trade unions in Costa Rica}}

In the late 1800s, trade unions first appeared to support workers in a variety of urban and industrial jobs.&lt;ref name=SITRAPEQUIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Historia del Sindicalismo|url=http://sitrapequia.or.cr/gestor/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52|work=SITRAPEQUIA website|publisher=Sindicato de Trabajadores(as) Petroléros Químicos y Afines|accessdate=4 May 2014|location=San José|language=es|year=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505020834/http://sitrapequia.or.cr/gestor/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52|archivedate=5 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After facing violent repression, such as during the 1934 United Fruit Strike, unions gained more power following the 1948 [[Costa Rican Civil War]], and public sector unions appeared.&lt;ref name=SITRAPEQUIA /&gt; Previous administrations and assesmblies paid very little attention to Costa Rica's trade unions;,&lt;ref name="gana voces"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sequeira|first1=Aarón|title=Sindicalismo gana voces en el Congreso e impulsa su agenda|url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/politica/Sindicalismo-voces-Congreso-impulsa-agenda_0_1418258197.html|accessdate=2 June 2014|publisher=La Nacion|date=2 June 2014|location=San Jose|language=Es}}&lt;/ref&gt; however when the [[Luis Guillermo Solís]] and the 2014 legislative assembly took office, Solís and eight members of the [[Citizens' Action Party (Costa Rica)|Citizens' Action Party]] and [[Broad Front (Costa Rica)|Broad Front]] promised to listen to unions. Libertarian [[Otto Guevara]] expressed concern.&lt;ref name="gana voces" /&gt; Today, Costa Rican unions are strongest in the public sector, including the fields of education and medicine.&lt;ref name=SITRAPEQUIA /&gt; There is also a strong presence in agricultural sectors for unions.&lt;ref name=SITRAPEQUIA /&gt; In general, Costa Rican unions support government regulation of the banking, medical, and education fields, as well as improved wages and working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Herrera|first=Manuel|title=Sindicatos alzarán la voz contra modelo neoliberal en celebraciones del 1° de mayo|url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/trabajo/Sindicatos-alzaran-modelo-neoliberal-celebraciones_0_1411658998.html|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=La Nacion|date=30 April 2014|location=San Jose|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important issue for public sector unions is passage of the Código Procesal Laboral (Procedural Labor Law), which former president [[Laura Chinchilla]] vetoed.&lt;ref name=cambios&gt;{{cite news|last=Sequeira|first=Aarón|title=Presidente del Congreso se reúne con sindicatos y promete cambios al Código de Trabajo|url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/politica/Presidente-Congreso-sindicatos-Codigo-Trabajo_0_1412058926.html|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=La Nacion|date=2 May 2014|location=San Jose|language=Es}}&lt;/ref&gt; If passed, Chinchilla said it would allow emergency service workers, such as police, medical service staff and doctors to strike. President [[Luis Guillermo Solís]] said that the issue of the Procedural Labor Law should be finalized within his first year in office.&lt;ref name=avala&gt;{{cite news|last=Oveido|first=Estaban|title=Luis Guillermo Solís avala plazo de un año para resolver veto a reforma laboral|url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/politica/Luis-Guillermo-Solis-resolver-reforma_0_1412858729.html|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=La Nacion|date=6 May 2014|location=San Jose|language=Es}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica|Legislative Assembly]] president [[Henry Mora Jiménez]], also supported the law, as do the public sector unions.&lt;ref name=cambios /&gt;

===Europe===
There are public-sector trade unions in Europe that negotiate agreements between public employees and the institutions for which they work. In 2010, severe financial crises forced several governments to cut back on wages and benefits in austerity measures, leading to protests, most notably in Greece. In Greece, a one-day protest was held because of requirements placed by the EU on Greece's public spending.&lt;ref&gt;See "Greece hit by nationwide strike over austerity" [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8507551.stm BBC News 10 February 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Public-sector trade unions in the United States}}
Labor unions generally bypassed government employees because they were controlled mostly by the patronage system used by the political parties before the arrival of civil service. 
Post Office workers did form unions. The [[National Association of Letter Carriers]] started in 1889 and grew quickly. By the mid-1960s it had 175,000 members in 6,400 local branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Morris S. Ogul|title=Congress Oversees the Bureaucracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxHpmVLxj1kC&amp;pg=PA65|date=15 May 1976|publisher=U. of Pittsburgh Press|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several competing organizations of postal clerks emerged starting in the 1890s. Merger discussions dragged on for years, until finally the NFPOC, UNMAPOC and others merged in 1961 as the United Federation of Postal Clerks.  Another round of mergers in 1971 produced the [[American Postal Workers Union]] (APWU).  In 2012 the APWU had 330,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Gary M Fink, ed., ''Labor Unions'' (1977)  pp 291-94&lt;/ref&gt;  The various postal unions did not engage in strikes.

{{main|Boston Police Strike}}
Historian Joseph Slater, says, "Unfortunately for public sector unions, the most searing and enduring image of their history in the first half of the twentieth century was the Boston police strike. The strike was routinely cited by courts and officials through the end of the 1940s."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Slater, "The Boston Police Strike'' in Aaron Brenner et al. eds. ''The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History'' (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=EHzk54IjNpEC&amp;pg=PA241]&lt;/ref&gt;  Governor [[Calvin Coolidge]] broke the strike and the legislature took control of the police away from city officials.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Russell, ''A city in terror: Calvin Coolidge and the 1919 Boston police strike'' (Beacon Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

The police strike chilled union interest in the public sector in the 1920s. The major exception was the emergence of unions of public school teachers in the largest cities; they formed the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT), affiliated with the AFL.  In suburbs and small cities, the [[National Education Association]] (NEA) became active, but it insisted it was not a labor union but a professional organization.&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Murphy, ''Blackboard Unions: The AFT and the NEA, 1900-1980'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Deal era====

In the mid 1930s efforts were made to unionize  WPA workers, but were opposed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Alan Goldberg, "Contesting the Status of Relief Workers during the New Deal The Workers Alliance of America and the Works Progress Administration, 1935-1941." ''Social Science History'' (2005) 29#3 pp: 337-371.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moe points out that Roosevelt, "an ardent supporter of collective bargaining in the private sector, was opposed to it in the public sector."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moe|title=Special Interest: Teachers Unions and America's Public Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDFz6oYRtuIC&amp;pg=PA33|year=2011|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roosevelt in 1937 told the nation what the position of his government was: "All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service.... The very nature and purposes of government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with government employee organizations.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15445#axzz1Jy35UQb9 "Letter on the Resolution of Federation of Federal Employees Against Strikes in Federal Service August 16, 1937"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===="Little New Deal" era====
Change came in the 1950s. In 1958 New York mayor [[Robert Wagner, Jr.]] issued an executive order, called  "the little Wagner Act," giving city employees certain bargaining rights, and gave their unions with exclusive representation (that is, the unions alone were legally authorized to speak for all city workers, regardless of whether or not some workers were members.)  Management complained but the unions had power in city politics.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Russo, "Management's View of the New York City Experience," ''Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science'' Vol. 30, No. 2, "Unionization of Municipal Employees" (Dec., 1970), pp. 81-93 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1173366 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s and 1970s public-sector unions expanded rapidly to cover teachers, clerks, firemen, police, prison guards and others. In 1962, President [[John Kennedy]] issued [[Executive Order 10988]], upgrading the status of unions of federal workers.&lt;ref&gt;David Schultz, ''Encyclopedia of public administration and public policy'' (2004) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent years====
After 1960 public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and high pensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming steadily declined, state- and local-government employment quadrupled from 4 million workers in 1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census Bureau,  [https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/governments/cb10-132.html "Census Bureau Reports State and Local Government Employment Remains at 16.6 Million" (press release Aug. 10, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the U.S. membership of public sector unions surpassed membership of private sector unions for the first time, at 7.9m and 7.4m respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-trouble-with-public-sector-unions&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 states faced a growing fiscal crisis and the Republicans had made major gains in the 2010 elections. Public sector unions came under heavy attack [[2011 Wisconsin budget protests|especially in Wisconsin]], as well as Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio from conservative Republican legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;John Logan, "Is this the end for organised labour in the US?," [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/mar/11/us-unions-wisconsin guardian.co.uk, March 11, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/18/the-first-blow-against-public-employees "Public employees"]&lt;/ref&gt; 2012 update.&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/state-budget-crisis/index.html "Budget crisis"]&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative state legislatures tried to drastically reduce the abilities of unions to collectively bargain.  Conservatives argued that public unions were too powerful since they helped elect their bosses, and that overly generous pension systems were too heavy a drain on state budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Theda Skocpol|author2=Vanessa Williamson|title=The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gm56Pg3um2IC&amp;pg=PA192|year=2012|publisher=Oxford UP|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''revolving fund''' is a fund or account that remains available to finance an organization's continuing operations without any [[fiscal year]] limitation, because the organization replenishes the fund by repaying money used from the account. Revolving funds have been used to support both government and non-profit operations.

In the case of revolving funds for a government project whose budget goes through annual parliamentary or other legislative appropriations that relate to a fiscal year then the unutilized balance may lapse after the close of the financial year. However it is restored the next year provided the agency concerned includes the amount in next year's appropriation.

Within federal and state governments, law establishes revolving funds. Revolving funds, established for the purpose of carrying out specific activities, institute a basis under which financing for the cost of goods or services furnished to or by a government agency originate. Revolving funds are to be replenished through charges made for such goods or services.

Revolving funds can be especially valuable for non-profit organizations because they afford both the donor and the non-profit significant advantages. Often a non-profit must announce a program, engage personnel, extend invitations or sign contracts well ahead of raising the donations or receiving the program revenue that will cover the costs. In such cases a revolving fund allows the non-profit to commit to programs early so that it can ensure professional execution and the program's success.  The non-profit then can work to generate the revenue, donations, or other support that will repay the money spent.

There are several situations in which such funds would be particularly helpful.  One example would be funding sources for historic preservation projects. A non-profit preservation organization would establish a fund to receive donations and other capital which is used by the organization to purchase endangered property which is then resold with [[easement]]s. Some organizations also make [[loan]]s for [[building renovation]]s, which then replenish the revolving funds as those loans are repaid. The Providence Revolving Fund is one of the largest local revolving funds in the US.

Another example would be a revolving fund established to provide support for programs that require a long-term commitment for planning well ahead of the non-profit's fund raising cycle.  By accessing money in the revolving fund, the non-profit can commit to the project, including signing contracts or issuing invitations, knowing that funding is available from the revolving fund.  As the project is funded through donations or through revenue the project may generate, the funds can be repaid to the revolving fund.  This ensures the fund is available for future programming.

Such a revolving fund offers several advantages to the donor.  The donor's commitment is limited and the gift can be restricted for the sole purpose of supporting the program(s) for which it is intended.  At the same time the funds committed to a revolving fund may be multiplied several fold as the non-profit repays money it may have taken from the fund.  The non-profit will have a great incentive to repay the money to the revolving fund, in order to continue to enjoy the advantages of the revolving fund for future years.

==United States government==

According to "A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05734sp.pdf|title=A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process|date=September 2005|publisher=GAO}}&lt;/ref&gt; a revolving fund is established by Congress to finance a cycle of businesslike operations through amounts received by the fund. A revolving fund charges for the sale of products or services and uses the proceeds to finance its spending, usually on a self-sustaining basis.

The '''semiconductor industry''' is the aggregate collection of companies engaged in the [[Electronic design automation|design]] and [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|fabrication]] of [[semiconductor]] devices. It formed around 1960, once the fabrication of semiconductors became a viable business. It has since grown to be a $412.2 billion industry in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.semiconductors.org/news/2018/02/05/global_sales_report_2017/annual_semiconductor_sales_increase_21.6_percent_top_400_billion_for_first_time//&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry structure==
The global semiconductor industry is dominated by [[South Korea]], the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[China]] and the [[European Union]]. 

Unique features of the industry include continuous growth but in a cyclical pattern with high volatility. While the current 20 year annual average growth of the semiconductor industry is on the order of 13%, this has been accompanied by equally above-average market volatility, which can lead to significant if not dramatic cyclical swings. This has required the need for high degrees of flexibility and innovation in order to constantly adjust to the rapid pace of change in the market as many products embedding semiconductor devices often have a very short life cycle. 

At the same time, the rate of constant price-performance improvement in the semiconductor industry is staggering. As a consequence, changes in the semiconductor market not only occur extremely rapidly but also anticipate changes in industries evolving at a slower pace. The semiconductor industry is widely recognized as a key driver and technology enabler for the whole electronics value chain.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, ReportLinker. “[http://www.reportlinker.com/p01360863-summary/Global-Semiconductor-Market-Outlook-to.html Global Semiconductor Market Outlook 2022].” January 13, 2016.

In 1990, Teresa Heinz met Senator Kerry at an [[Earth Day]] rally. This was the only reported time the two met before Senator Heinz died in a plane crash on April 4, 1991. In 1992, Teresa Heinz met Kerry again, this time at the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Heinz was a member of a [[United States Department of State|State Department]] delegation appointed by then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]]. The two began courting in 1993 and were married May 26, 1995, in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]]. Choosing to remain registered as a Republican until [[John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004|John Kerry's presidential bid in 2004]], Heinz retained the name Teresa Heinz. In May 2004, she said: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"My legal name is still Teresa Heinz. Teresa Heinz Kerry is my name... for politics. Just so people don't ask me questions about so and so is so and so's wife or this and that. Teresa Heinz is what I've been all my growing-up life, adult life, more than any other name. And it's the name of my boys, you know ?... So, that's my legal name and that's my office name, my Pittsburgh name."&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition to Portuguese (her native language),&lt;ref&gt;http://old.post-gazette.com/nation/20020605teresanat1p1.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Heinz speaks English, Spanish, French, and Italian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/on_the_trail/2004/09/the_foreign_wives_club.html&lt;/ref&gt; She is Roman Catholic.&lt;ref name="Thurman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/09/27/the-candidates-wife|title=The Candidate's Wife|last=Thurman|first=Judith|publisher=The New Yorker|access-date=August 24, 2018|date=September 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, with Kerry and environmentalist academic Dr. [[Anthony Cortese]], she co-founded Second Nature, which brings "Education for Sustainability" to college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secondnature.org/aboutsn/aboutsn.htm Second Nature | About SN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209103932/http://www.secondnature.org/aboutsn/aboutsn.htm |date=February 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, she founded the [[Heinz Award]]s, including a category for Outstanding Contributions to the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heinzawards.net/ |title=The Heinz Awards |publisher=The Heinz Awards |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, with a $20 million grant, the Heinz Endowments provided initial funding for The Heinz Center,&lt;ref name="dep" /&gt; "a nonprofit institution dedicated to improving the scientific and economic foundation for environmental policy through multisectoral collaboration among industry, government, academia, and environmental organizations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heinzctr.org/index.shtml |title=The Heinz Center – Home Page |publisher=Heinzctr.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080409142050/http%3A//www.heinzctr.org/index.shtml |archivedate=April 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's economic security programs and advocacy===
In 1995, the book ''Pensions in Crisis: Why the system is failing America and how you can protect your future'' (later republished as ''The Pension Book'') was published, with support from the Teresa and H. John Heinz III Foundation, and a foreword by Heinz.&lt;ref name="hfp_retirement"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hfp.heinz.org/programs/womensretirement.html|title=Heinz Family Philanthropies - Women's Retirement Initiative|date=2003-12-19|access-date=2017-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031219200600/http://www.hfp.heinz.org/programs/womensretirement.html|archivedate=December 19, 2003|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblio.com/books/37833981.html|title=Pensions in Crisis: Why the system is failing America and how you can protect your future - Karen and Blackwell, Kate Ferguson|date=2007-09-26|access-date=2017-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222803/http://www.biblio.com/books/37833981.html|archivedate=September 26, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred by the issues uncovered by ''Pensions in Crisis'', Heinz and her foundation created the Women's Retirement Initiative to "extend that investigation and examine how the dynamics of our pension and retirement system contribute to the disproportionate rate of poverty among older women."&lt;ref name="hfp_retirement" /&gt;

In 1996, the Heinz Foundations created WISER, the Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heinzfamily.org/issues/womensecosec_02.html |title=Heinz Family Philanthropies – WISER |publisher=Heinzfamily.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth==
Heinz and Kerry signed a prenuptial agreement and have kept their premarital assets separate{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}.
Heinz has declined to disclose her personal tax returns, citing family trusts and privacy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} She is estimated to be worth between $750 million and $1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jun/27/nation/na-heinz27|title=Estimate of Heinz Fortune Doubled|last=Vartabedian|first=Ralph|date=2004-06-27|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her most recently released income tax of 2003, Kerry and Heinz paid an effective federal income tax rate of 12%{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}.

Heinz and Kerry live an affluent life. They own a six-floor, $7 million townhome in Boston's [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood, an ocean-front home on [[Nantucket]] recently listed for sale at $25 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Balling |first=Joshua |url=http://www.ack.net/Kerry-Heinzhouse060916.html |title=Kerry-Heinz house on market for $25 million - News - The Inquirer and Mirror - Nantucket, MA |website=Ack.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a $5 million ski retreat in [[Idaho]], a $4 million estate in [[Fox Chapel, Pennsylvania]], near the Heinz family's home base of Pittsburgh, and a $5 million home in the [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Politics==
Like her first husband, Heinz was a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for most of her voting life, and she remained a registered Republican despite being married to Kerry. In January 2003, she changed her registration to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

In 2003, Heinz was named to the [[PoliticsPA]] list of "Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women| work = [[PoliticsPA]]| publisher = The Publius Group| year = 2001| url = http://www.politicspa.com/features/mostpoliticallypowerfulwomen.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040209095936/http://politicspa.com/features/mostpoliticallypowerfulwomen.htm|archivedate=February 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinz is said to have been encouraged to run for her first husband's vacant Senate seat after his death. Heinz declined and refused to endorse Republican Congressman [[Rick Santorum]]'s [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 1994|1994 bid]] for the seat. She publicly denounced him as the "antithesis" of her late husband, and later called him "[[Forrest Gump (character)|Forrest Gump]] with attitude." It was rumored she would challenge Santorum in [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2006|2006]] (as a Democrat), but she did not enter the race, and the Democratic nomination went to [[Treasurer of Pennsylvania|State Treasurer]] [[Bob Casey, Jr.]], who went on to defeat Santorum.

Heinz has a reputation in the media as a very direct personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Making of a Non-President | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49993-2004Nov14.html | author = Kurtz, Howard |work=Washington Post | page = C01 | date = November 15, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 | authorlink = Howard Kurtz }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6407226/site/newsweek | title = How Bush Did It |work=Newsweek | date = November 15, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060619172718/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6407226/site/newsweek |archivedate = June 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview published in ''[[USA Today]]'' in July 2004, Heinz was asked about the differences between then-First Lady [[Laura Bush]] and herself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Well, you know, I don't know Laura Bush. But she seems to be calm, and she has a sparkle in her eye, which is good. But I don't know that she's ever had a real job—I mean, since she's been grown up. So her experience and her validation comes from important things, but different things. And I’m older, and my validation of what I do and what I believe and my experience is a little bit bigger–because I’m older, and I’ve had different experiences. And it’s not a criticism of her. It’s just, you know, what life is about.
"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The real running mates |work=USA Today | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/2004-10-19-teresa_x.htm | date = October 20, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Heinz retracted the statement later, saying she was "sincerely sorry" for the remark. "I had forgotten that Mrs. Bush had worked as a schoolteacher and librarian, and there couldn't be a more important job than teaching our children", Heinz said. "As someone who has been both a full time mom and full time in the workforce, I know we all have valuable experiences that shape who we are. I appreciate and honor Mrs. Bush's service to the country as first lady, and am sincerely sorry I had not remembered her important work in the past."&lt;ref name = Apology&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/20/theresa.apologizes.laura | title = Heinz Kerry apologizes for remark | publisher = CNN | date = October 21, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush brushed it off, saying, "It didn't matter to me. It didn't hurt my feelings. It was perfectly all right that she apologized. She didn't have to apologize. I know how tough it is. And actually I know those trick questions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = CNN | url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/21/laura.teresa/ | title = Laura Bush brushes aside Heinz Kerry's remarks | date = October 21, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tuariki John Edward Delamere''' (born 9 December 1951) is a former New Zealand politician. He served as an MP from 1996 to 1999, and was a member of [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] for the duration of his term.

==Early life==
Delamere was born in 1951 at a military hospital in [[Papakura]], and was educated in [[Tauranga]], attending [[Tauranga Boys' College]]. In 1967 and 1969, he was recognised as the top [[Māori people|Māori]] student in New Zealand. He then attended [[Washington State University]] on an athletic scholarship. Delamere obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1974. He later obtained an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Long Island University]].

For a time, Delamere served in the [[United States Army]], stationed at [[Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri]]. He later joined the staff at the [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] military academy. After leaving the United States, Delamere worked as chief financial officer for [[Polynesian Airlines]]. He also held a number of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] roles.

Delamere has also been successful in sporting events; setting records{{clarify|date=July 2013}} in [[long jump]] and [[triple jump]], and representing New Zealand in those events in the [[1974 Commonwealth Games]] at Christchurch. At Washington State,  he pioneered the technique of a full somersault in long jump competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reid|first1=Ron|title=The Flip that lead to a Flap|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1974/07/29/616167/the-flip-that-led-to-a-flap|website=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=20 March 2018|language=EN|date=29 July 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand First==
{{NZ parlbox header}}
{{NZ parlbox|term=45th|start=1996|end=1998|party=New Zealand First|electorate=[[Te Tai Rawhiti]]|list=18}}
{{NZ parlbox allegiance|start=1998|end=1999|party=Te Tawharau}}
{{NZ parlbox footer}}
Delamere entered politics in the [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996 elections]], when he successfully stood as a candidate for the [[New Zealand First]] party in the [[Te Tai Rawhiti]] electorate, defeating Sir [[Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician)|Peter Tapsell]] and becoming one of the group known as the ''[[Tight Five]]''. Immediately after being elected, he was appointed to [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] as part of New Zealand First's coalition deal with the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]. Among the roles he held during his ministerial career were those of Minister of Immigration, Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Associate [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]], and Associate [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Minister of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tuariki-delamere.epik.com/bio Tuariki Delamere Bio]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Epik. Accessed 3 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the coalition between New Zealand First and the National Party began to break apart, and significant tensions emerged in New Zealand First itself. On 11 August, it was claimed by [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] MP [[Rodney Hide]] that Delamere was planning a coup against New Zealand First leader [[Winston Peters]], an allegation which Delamere denied. Two days later, Delamere acknowledged that he had been exploring the possibility a new political party based around the so-called "tight five", New Zealand First's group of Māori MPs (not counting Peters himself). When Peters was sacked from Cabinet, Delamere openly supported the move, and pledged his support to the National Party government regardless of his party's stance. Delamere formally resigned from New Zealand First on 18 August 1998, saying that the party would be better known as "Winston First".

==Independent and Te Tawharau==
As an independent, Delamere continued to support the National government, and retained his ministerial portfolios.

On 22 December 1998, Delamere announced gay and lesbian couples applying for [[permanent residency]] would have the same rights as straight de facto couples: a change [[Max Bradford]], when Minister of Immigration, stated was too difficult.

In late 1999, however, he lost his role as Minister of Immigration after a scandal regarding the application of immigration rules. Specifically, it emerged that Delamere had approved [[permanent residency]] for a group of [[China|Chinese]] businessmen provided they invested generously in various Māori development schemes. Delamere was widely criticised for using his authority to ensure that money was given to certain groups. Delamere himself claimed that his actions were a perfectly reasonable method of addressing Māori development needs. Although he lost the immigration portfolio, he retained his other roles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0404/S00248.htm A Second Look At The Leadership Of Richard Prebble]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999 elections]], Delamere joined the small Māori [[Te Tawharau]] party, giving it its first representation in Parliament. He had previously declined to join the [[Mauri Pacific]] party, established by five other former New Zealand First MPs (including three of his "tight five" colleagues). Shortly prior to the election, Delamere announced that his party would support only a Labour Party government on confidence and supply if it won seats in the new Parliament. This was at odds with Delamere's unwavering support of the legislative programme of the Shipley Administration. In the elections, Delamere contested the new [[Waiariki (New Zealand electorate)|Waiariki]] electorate &amp;mdash; he placed second, with 20.01% of the vote. The winner was [[Mita Ririnui]] of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]. He was also placed second on the [[party list]] of the [[Mana Māori Movement]], which Te Tawharau was affiliated with, but the party did not win any seats.

==Private sector==
Since leaving Parliament, Delamere has established himself as an immigration consultant, founding the company of Tuariki Delamere &amp; Associates. He also owns a successful cabaret restaurant in Auckland, Finale Restaurant and Cabaret.

In 2000 Delamere rejoined the [[New Zealand National Party]], the party he had started his political career with. However he ruled out a return to Parliament to concentrate on his business concerns.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_148326"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=148326 |title=National's waka nets Waitai |author=Young, Audrey |date=19 August 2000 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March and November 2005, Delamere appeared in court on charges of fraud. The trial began in the High Court in Auckland on 7 February 2007.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10422848"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10422848 |title=Former minister in court for fraud |date=7 February 2007 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a 4-week trial, the jury found him not guilty of all charges after less than 2 hours of delibiration on 2 March 2007.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10426672"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10426672 |title=Ex-immigration minister cleared of fraud |date=2 March 2007 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Day in the Life of a Shop Steward- Factory work in Britain, 1942 D10113.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|A British shop steward discusses an issue with a foreman during WWII]]

A '''union representative''', '''union steward''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Union-Stewards-Complete-Guide-Updated/dp/098398719X The Union Steward's Complete Guide], David Prosten, Union Communication Services, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''shop steward''' is an employee of an organization or company who represents and defends the interests of her/his fellow employees as a [[trade union|labor union]] member and official. [[wikt:rank and file|Rank-and-file]] members of the union hold this position voluntarily (through [[democracy|democratic]] [[election]] by fellow workers or sometimes by appointment of a higher union body) while maintaining their role as an [[employee]] of the firm. As a result, the union steward becomes a significant link and conduit of information between the union leadership and rank-and-file workers.

The duties of a union steward vary according to each labor union's [[constitution]]al mandate for the position. In general, most union stewards perform the following functions:
*Monitor and enforce the provisions of the [[collective bargaining]] agreement (labor contract) to ensure both the firm and union worker are not violating the terms of the agreement.
*Ensure that the firm is in compliance with all federal, state and local [[law]]s and [[regulation]]s.
*Represent and defend fellow workers whom the firm believes violated company policy or the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement, often through the [[grievance]] process.
*Communicate and disseminate official union policy, memos and directives to workers in the shop.
*Popularize and promote union consciousness and values in the workplace.

'''5.6 Stewards.'''

'''(a)''' The Home agrees to recognize such Union stewards, duly appointed by and acting as agents of the Union, who may receive complaints and process grievances through the grievance procedure. The Union shall provide the Home with a written list of such stewards and alternates, if any.

'''(b)''' Union stewards shall be permitted to use a reasonable amount of work time with pay, as approved in advance by the Administrator (which approval will not be unreasonably denied), for the purpose of handling and processing grievances.

'''(c)''' The Union steward shall not direct any worker how to perform or not perform his/her work, shall not countermand the order of a supervisor and shall not interfere with the normal operations of the Home or any other worker.

'''(d)''' The Home's designated representative shall be required to meet with only one Union steward and/or the Union Chairperson on any grievance.

'''5.7 Handling of Contract Matters.'''

The Union Chairperson(s) will be allowed up to four scheduled hours per week (or more if needed) with pay to handle matters under this contract, provided that it does not interfere with patient care or with the operating needs of the Home.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1409">'''Václav Junek''' (born June 17, 1951) is a Czech businessman.

Junek was a chairman of bankrupt conglomerate Chemapol Group.

Junek's company Chemapol Reality (C.H.R.) purchased from [[Václav Havel]] his 50 percent stake in a legendary dance-hall [[Lucerna Palace]] on [[Wenceslas Square]] for CZK 200 mio.  It sold it two years later to Dagmar Havlová for CZK 145 mio. Later, the company went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Czech Radio, [http://www.radio.cz/cz/zpravy/72319 Spor o Lucernu nekončí, konkurzní správce však myslí na smír], 2005-11-02 (in Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commercial register at justice.cz, identification number (IČ) 25056808, C.H.R., a.s., the company was registered on June 10, 1996, bankruptcy declared on January 31, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Junek publicly admitted Chemapol bribed the politicians of [[Czech Social Democratic Party]] (ČSSD). The ruling ČSSD politicians secretly used gas cards issued to name of Chemapol to get gas for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://carolina.cuni.cz/archive-en/Carolina-E-No-346.txt |title= Social Democrats Accused of Tax Evasion |work= Carolina |author= Ondrej Maly |author2=Zuzana Janeckova  |date=1999-10-08 |issue=346 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6078">[[File:World Currency Unit (symbol).jpg|thumb|alt=symbol of the Wocu.|The symbol of the WOCU]] 
The World Currency Unit '''WOCU''' (XCU) is an EU trademarked synthetic global currency quotation. It is derived from a weighted [[Currency basket|basket of currencies]] of fiat currency pairs covering the top 20 economies of the world. Each country’s currency representation is weighted by its relative proportion of the top 20 economies as measured by [[GDP]]. The WOCU’s nearest comparator was the more narrowly constructed ECU, the European Currency Unit basket that preceded the successor Euro.

The WOCU offers a transparent, relatively stable currency quotation as a hub currency reference for cross border trade to reduce volatility and risk. It reacts to the economic growth and decline of constituent country economies, adjusting the prominence of their respective currencies. The WOCU is outputted in up to real time, in sub second updates. Input FX data is sourced from global aggregated FX data providers.

Countries within the Euro zone (those that have replaced their national currencies with the Euro) are treated as individual countries in the WOCU weighting calculation. This means that some countries within the Euro zone are included, such as Germany, whilst others are excluded, such as Ireland, purely on the basis of that country’s top 20 GDP qualification or disqualification.
The GDP values of each country issued by the [[International Monetary Fund]] in its [[World Economic Outlook]] forecast are reviewed as these figures become available and a biannual re-weighting of the benchmark basket performed. This means that the member countries included in the basket, and therefore their currencies, may change up to twice a year either by the weighting for their currency being adjusted (up or down) or by their fiat currency being promoted into or demoted out of the basket. This generally results in the basket consisting of 15 separate currencies, the Euro currency being common to normally 6 nation states included in the WOCU basket. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wocu.com/wocu/wocuvaluecalculation.php Wocu website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409055055/http://www.wocu.com/wocu/wocuvaluecalculation.php |date=2010-04-09 }} Wocu&lt;/ref&gt;

Review and approval of weighting adjustments is subject to a confirmation process overseen by the WOCU Oversight Committee, a body consisting of a majority of independent persons qualified and authorised to approve or reject any change to the constitution of the WOCU. In the circumstance of a reweighting where a country changes its currency, the replacement country currency FX data will form exactly the same proportion of the WOCU and the former currency will be dropped (or reduced in the case of the Euro) in the same proportion at the same time that the relevant country officially introduces its new currency, which shall be assessed and approved by the WOCU Oversight Committee.

The WOCU is used to price commodities such as [[bunker fuel]] and as a reference currency for global investors and companies seeking to mitigate bilateral [[exchange rate]] volatility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankingtech.com/bankingtech/article.do;jsessionid=1A80AC1022032D42EAAC26803B17FBB5.5d25bd3d240cca6cbbee6afc8c3b5655190f397f?articleid=20000173102 Singapore firm to price marine fuel in Wocu ] Wocu&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbol==
The currency's symbol comprises a Capital W within a circle. This characterizes the WOCU as a global currency.

==The relative value of the WOCU==
Since September 10, 2009 the value of the WOCU is calculated in real-time 24 hours per day 7 days per week and the weighting of the basket adjusted on the third Thursday of May and November each year.

'''Melvin Walter Kissling Gam''' (April 25, 1931 – January 28, 2002) was a [[Costa Rica]]n businessman who became one of the first [[Central American]]s to lead a [[Fortune 500]] company. He is also known for having played an important role in the founding of the [[INCAE|INCAE Business School]] campus in [[Costa Rica]], as well as founding the Costa Rican non-profit organization Asociación de Empresarios para el Desarrollo.

==Early life==
Walter Kissling was born to Walter Kissling Rickli and Adela Gam Secen in [[Limón]], [[Costa Rica]] on April 25, 1931. His father was of Swiss descent, and his mother came from [[Vienna, Austria]].  In a newspaper interview in 1998 he mentioned his mother as driving force in his life. “She was a fighting woman. She descended from wealthy family from Vienna, who had lost it all in the First World War. During all of my infancy, one of very limited means, it was through my mother’s efforts that I was able to study and get ahead.”&lt;ref name="Financiero1"&gt;{{cite news |title=La herencia de una vida bien invertida|first=José Rodolfo |last=González Ulloa |newspaper=El Financiero|location = Costa Rica |date=2002-02-04 |page=16|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kissling graduated from Colegio Seminario in San José in 1948. After graduation he worked selling cheese and as a receptionist in the Hotel Europa in downtown San José. During his work at the hotel, he met a North American businessman who gave him 2 pamphlets and told him that if he learned them by heart he would hire him as a [[pharmaceutical sales representative]]. This is how he started working at [[Wyeth|Wyeth International]], he worked there for 7 years.&lt;ref name="Financiero1"/&gt;

Kissling never graduated from college, he advanced professionally through hard work and taking advantage of the opportunities he was offered.&lt;ref name="Financiero1"/&gt;

==Work in Kativo and H.B. Fuller==
Seeking to advance his career, Kissling joined Kativo Chemical in 1953. At that time the company was a small business that fabricated the Protecto brand of paints in a workshop in Sabana Sur, [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]]. He worked there for 10 years and was tasked with leading the expansion of the company to the [[Central American]] markets.&lt;ref name="Financiero1"/&gt;

With the acquisition of Kativo Chemical by [[H.B. Fuller]] in 1967, Kissling was appointed as vicepresident for Latin America, all the while maintaining his role as general manager at Kativo Chemical. He then led the opening of several H.B Fuller manufacturing plants throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name="Financiero1"/&gt;

He went on to serve the company in significant leadership positions, including senior vice president of international operations, and executive vice president and [[chief operating officer]]. In 1995 he was named [[chief executive officer]] of [[H.B. Fuller]], serving in this capacity until his retirement in 1998. He also was a 34-year member of Fuller's board of directors.&lt;ref name="BusinessWire"&gt;{{cite news |title=Retired H.B. Fuller CEO Walter Kissling Dies. |author=Business Editors |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-management/company-structures-ownership/5888049-1.html |journal=All Business |publisher=Business Wire |accessdate=2010-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
Kissling had an active role in the founding of the [[Costa Rica]]n Campus (now named after him) of the [[INCAE|INCAE Business School]] in 1984, after the situation of the [[INCAE]] campus in Nicaragua became unstable due to the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. He was also president and a 16-year member of the board of directors of [[INCAE]].&lt;ref name="Financiero2"&gt;{{cite news |title=La Cátedra Empresarial Walter Kissling Gam |author=El Financiero |url=http://www.elfinancierocr.com/ef_archivo/2003/noviembre/23/editorial1.html |newspaper=El Financiero |location=Costa Rica |accessdate=2010-03-17 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wong Yip Yan''', also known as Y.Y.

==Career==

When Wong was 26, he became the first Singaporean [[director (business)|director]] at [[Borneo Company Limited]], a British trading company. Wong said his boss told him that a Chinese couldn't get promoted to the company's main board of directors, causing Wong to start his own business.&lt;ref name="still hungry" /&gt;

To start the Wywy Group, Wong got funding from executives of [[Fujifilm]], who had worked with Wong at Borneo. They helped him get a credit line of $178,000 from [[The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ]], which allowed him to start the Wywy Group as a distributor of copy machines.&lt;ref name="still hungry" /&gt;

Wong also served as the Chairman of [[Yeo Hiap Seng]], Singapore's largest drink manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEA FOR TWO|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/95/0728/biz1.html|publisher=Asiaweek|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Wong is married and has three grown children.&lt;ref name="directors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Directors|url=http://www.internationalforum.com/Directory%20Links/Directors.htm|publisher=The International Forum|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wong's oldest son, Dr. Wong Meng Ee, contracted [[retinitis pigmentosa]] when he was 11 years old.&lt;ref name="still hungry" /&gt;  The condition resulted in permanent blindness. Dr. Wong Meng Ee is currently the president of the Retinitis Pigmentosa Society Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://retina-singapore.org/about_us.html|publisher=Retinitis Pigmentosa Society Singapore|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong is the brother of Wong Yip Chong and uncle of Wong Meng Cheong. Meng Cheong is a prominent Singaporean physician who famously took his father's [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] to court over his $7 million house after his passing. He ultimately lost his case against his father's mistress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sons lose $7 million house to father's mistress|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20110809-293609.html|work=Asia One|publisher=Asia One|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Young Enterprise''' is a not-for-profit business and enterprise education [[Charitable organization|charity]] in [[England &amp; Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.y-e.org.uk/pub/public_aboutUs.do |title=Young Enterprise About Us |accessdate=2008-06-10 |df= }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is made up of three organisations, Young Enterprise, Young Enterprise Scotland and Young Enterprise Northern Ireland, the latter two operating individually under a licence agreement to the former. Young Enterprise's mission statement is "to inspire and equip young people to learn and succeed through enterprise."&lt;ref name="missionstatement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.young-enterprise.org.uk/pub/public_aboutUs_missionStatement.do |title=Young Enterprise Mission Statement |accessdate=2008-06-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529054018/http://www.young-enterprise.org.uk/pub/public_aboutUs_missionStatement.do |archivedate=2008-05-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Sir [[Walter Salomon]] founded Young Enterprise in the 1962/1963 [[academic year]], based on the American [[Junior Achievement]] programme.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.young-enterprise.org.uk/pub/public_aboutUs_history.do|title=History of Young Enterprise|accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1973/1974 academic year, there were twenty-two area boards across the UK running Young Enterprise programmes.  In 1977, the European Federation of Young Enterprise was formed, with the [[UK]], [[France]] and [[Belgium]] amongst the founding members. This was then renamed in 2002 to 'Junior Achievement/ Young Enterprise Europe'.

In the 1980s, the Company Competition began to take on the form it has today. Young Enterprise companies would submit reports to judges who selected the best from each region. The six regional winners were then invited to attend the National Finals in London, where they would deliver a presentation. Midland Bank (now [[HSBC]]) also took on the Chairmanship of Young Enterprise in 1988.

=== Decentralisation and the introduction of new programmes ===

During the 1990s, Young Enterprise became less [[centralised]]. On August 26, 1991, [http://yes.org.uk Young Enterprise Scotland] became an independent charity operating under licence from the main UK organisation. Similarly, Young Enterprise Northern Ireland was formed in August 1997. Wales followed suit, with its own organisation in October 1999. Aside from decentralising its operation, Young Enterprise also introduced new programmes during the 1990s. Project Business was launched in 1995, International Trading and Entrepreneurship Masterclass in 1997, and a Graduate Programme in 1998.

In the 2000s, Young Enterprise continued to launch new programmes and reorganise its regional structure. The Primary Programme, originally run in Northern Ireland, was introduced the rest of the UK in 2000. In 2002, the charity's structure was finalised, with 12 autonomous regional organisations throughout the country. 2003 saw the introduction of a further two programmes, Learn to Earn and Enterprise in Action. Young Enterprise's ninth programme, Personal Economics, then launched in 2005.

== Programmes ==

Young Enterprise currently runs a number of programmes for different age groups and durations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.young-enterprise.org.uk/pub/public_aboutUs_programmes.do |title=Young Enterprise Programmes |accessdate=2008-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511110154/http://www.young-enterprise.org.uk/pub/public_aboutUs_programmes.do |archivedate=May 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are split up into company-based programmes and classroom-based programmes.
