The '''Aquila Italiana''' founded as the "Società Anonima Aquila" and quickly renamed as "Società Anonima Italiana Aquila" was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[automobile]] manufacturer from 1906 to 1917. The company was named again in 1909 after it was bought by bank as 
"Aquila Anonima Italiana di L. Marsaglia", the Marsaglia part came from the name of bank owner's son Vincenzo Marsaglia, talented automobile driver.

Designed by [[Giulio Cesare Cappa]], the cars were big [[four-cylinder|four-]] and [[straight-6|six-cylinder]] models with [[ioe]] engines of an advanced type.  There was an interruption in construction after 1908, but the company introduced new models in 1911; these featured 4192 cc six-cylinder engines and proved to be successful in many races.  Among Aquila Italiana drivers were [[Meo Constantini]] (later to join [[Bugatti]] at [[Molsheim]], where he became first a racing driver and later the [[Chef d'Equipe]]) and [[Carlo Masetti]] (count [[Giulio Masetti]]'s elder brother).

== Production ==
The company Aquila Italiana produced a total of approximately 1,500 copies of its cars, all models combined.

[[File:Pancha narayan asta narayan.jpg|thumb|200px|The shop of Pancha Narayan Asta Narayan in 1975.]]
'''Asta Narayan Manandhar''' ([[Devanagari]]: अष्ट नारायण मानन्धर) (1900 - 1960) was a Nepalese entrepreneur who established the first bicycle shop in [[Kathmandu]] in 1925 A.D. He imported bicycles from [[Kolkata]], India and transported them over the mountains into Kathmandu by [[coolie]].&lt;ref name="bicycleman"&gt;{{cite news|last= Tuladhar |first= Kamal Ratna |title=The bicycle man |url= http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2012/09/28/onsaturday/the-first-word-the-bicycle-man/240186.html |accessdate=13 October 2012|newspaper= The Kathmandu Post
|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Asta Narayan was born in Maru Dhoka near [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]] to father Pancha Narayan and mother Prem Maya Manandhar. Pancha Narayan was a supplier of foodstuffs to the government. The family moved to [[Asan, Kathmandu|Asan]] Kamalachhi in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Manandhar, Tirtha Narayan (2007). ''Jigu Lumantii Yendey Mhigah Wa Thaun'' (Kathmandu in My Memory Yesterday and Today). Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parishad. {{ISBN|9789994623457}}. Pages 184-191.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Into business==

Asta Narayan was a bicycle enthusiast as a young man, and chose to become a bicycle seller when he decided to go into business for himself. He set up a store on the ground floor of his house at Kamalachhi and named it [http://pancbike.com Pancha Narayan Asta Narayan].

He traveled out of Kathmandu on foot, and then by train to Kolkata to procure his first stock—six [[Hercules Cycle and Motor Company|Hercules]] machines made in Britain. There were no motorables roads into Kathmandu then, and coolies had to be hired to carry the crates over the mountains. From 1934, the firm started selling [[Raleigh Bicycle Company|Raleigh]] bicycles too.

Asta Narayan's three sons continued the family business which was subsequently taken over by their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Sugata, Rachel Kellett (2004). ''Bird of passage''. Mandala Publications. {{ISBN|9993310263}}, 9789993310266. Page 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Asta Narayan's pioneering venture resulted in Kamalachhi being turned into a street of [[local bike shop]]s.&lt;ref name="bicycleman" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3841">'''BOP Studios''' (originally '''Bophuthatswana Recording Studios''' and also referred to as '''BOP''' or '''BRS''') is a [[recording studio]] located in the outskirts of [[Mafikeng]],  [[South Africa]]. It was established in 1991 by the Sefalana Employee Benefits Organization (SEBO), a government pension fund in the [[Republic of Bophuthatswana]]. Artists who have recorded there include [[Laura Branigan]] for her album ''Over My Heart'', [[Brenda Fassie]], [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]], [[Miriam Makeba]], [[Stimela]], and the Soweto String Quartet. The [[Lion king soundtrack|''Lion King'']] soundtrack was also recorded and produced at the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UK |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct13/articles/bop.htm |title=The BOP Studios Story — Out of Africa |publisher=SOS Ltd. |date= |accessdate=2015-04-20 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
When BOP Studios first opened, there was a lack of Western artists visiting because the [[South African apartheid]] referendum was underway.
Because BOP Studios was located in a [[Bantustan]] amidst a politically charged climate and funded by private investments, most musicians in Africa would not use it out of political conviction and most could not afford the recording costs necessary to ensure investor profit.&lt;ref&gt;Bridger, Jon (14 November 1992). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QhAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA56 "BOP Works to Overcome Challenges"], p. 56. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The studios were then taken over by the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]], which ended in 2003. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/millions-lost-in-bop-studio-sale-fiasco-1.214628 |title=Millions Lost in BOP Studio Sale Fiasco |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studios were reopened in 2006 after being purchased by a consortium based in the North West Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gov.za/e-molewa-sale-bop-recording-studios |title=E Molewa on Sale of BOP Recording Studios |publisher=Government of South Africa |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities and layout==
BOP Studios was the first recording facility to be equipped with infrasonic monitoring designed by Kinoshita. The acoustic design and building construction were specially made to produce infrasonic energy across a wide frequency spectrum, giving the space an unmatched sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newell |first=Philip |date=2007 |title=”Recording Studio Design” |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier/Focal Press |page=336 |isbn= 0240520866 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Hidley and Tom Rast were responsible for the architecture of the studios, which are equipped with custom-made monitors. The consoles in each of the three control rooms are custom built, including a Neve, SSL, and Focusrite. [[Phil Dudderidge]], Chairman of Focusrite Audio Engineering, sold BOP one of ten [[Focusrite]] consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/Contents.php?Month=10&amp;Year=2013 |title=Sound on Sound October 2013 Issue |publisher=SOS Ltd. |date=2013 |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an aerial view, BOP's layout follows that of a rhinoceros with Studio 3 being the head, and Studios 1 and 2 being the legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/49130-1017-53-Bop_studios_auctioned_for_R10m/?switcher=1 |title=BOP Studios Auctioned |accessdate=2015-04-21}}{{dl|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
Saj Chaudry is the managing director and sole shareholder of BOP Studios.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

It was first released under the name ''Seagate Analysis'' as a free application written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] released in 1999. After disappointing application performance, a decision was made to rewrite using [[Active Template Library|ATL]] [[Component Object Model|COM]] in [[C++]]. The initial rewrite only supported [[Microsoft Analysis Services]], but support for other vendors soon followed, with [[Holos]] [[OLAP cube|cubes]] in version 8.5, [[Essbase]], [[IBM DB2]] and [[SAP BW]] following in later releases. The web client was rewritten using an [[XSLT]] abstraction layer for the version 9.0 release, with better standards compliance to support [[Mozilla]] based browsers—this work also set the building blocks for support for [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]].

Crystal Analysis relies on [[Crystal Enterprise]] for distribution of analytical applications created with it.

'''Del Monte Motor Works, Inc.'''., also known as '''Del Monte Motors''', or '''DMMW''', is a [[bus]] and [[truck]] manufacturer, headquarters in [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]]. It assembles truck and bus bodies under the different brands (including bus chassis and spare parts).

== History ==
In 1950, it started manufacturing bus and truck bodies mounted on leading US brands, being International Harvester, Ford, Chevrolet, and the Dodge Chassis. Also, in the 1950s, its sister company, the Emcos Development &amp; Supply Co., Inc. was the leading distributor of International Harvester Macleod, Inc. in Northern Luzon marketing bus chassis, trucks, tractors, agricultural and farm implements.

At present, it is solely responsible for the introduction of Volvo articulated and [[bi-articulated bus]]es in the Philippines. Philtrak, Volvo, and Del Monte have signed a supply and transfer of technology agreement wherein Volvo will supply its products, mainly the articulated and the bi-articulated bus chassis, and Del Monte will manufacture and assemble the bus body and deliver the finished bus product to Philtrak. Volvo agreed to transfer its technology in the assembly of its articulated and bi-articulated bus chassis to Philtrak and Del Monte jointly constituting a tri-partite agreement among the aforestated parties. Together, they intend to introduce the system not only in Metro Manila but all over the Philippines where the need arises especially on traffic clogged areas.

It is also responsible in re-activating the sale of [[Isuzu]] buses in the Philippines when the combined resources of [[General Motors|General Motors Corporation]], the Yutivo group and its local subsidiary  folded up in the middle 1980s by importing directly from the factory of Japan's [[Isuzu]] and supplying different bus operators. It is still authorized to import bus and truck chassis on CBU basis and packaging it with the bus or truck body manufactured from its plant. In October 2010 the chairman and owner Narciso O. Morales created a bus company called [[DLTBCo|Del Monte Land Transport Bus Company (DLTBCO)]]. Their buses are also made from the company with High Class Greyhound facilities.

== Facilities ==
It has three existing plants and facilities in the Philippines. Two of them are located in [[Quezon City]] and the third one at [[Pampanga|Sto. Tomas, Pampanga]]. It has a tested capacity of a minimum of sixty units of bus and truck bodies a month. It has supplied the majority of bus bodies for the government-owned corporations like the Metro Manila Transit Corporation and the [[Philippine National Railways|PNR (Phil. National Railways)]] Motor Service. Before the introduction of these articulated buses, Del Monte has pioneered in the manufactured of bus trailers with a capacity of 200 passengers which were operated by MMTC in EDSA and by a private bus operator in the long stretch Marcos Highway. It was also involved in the assembly and rehabilitation of the British Leyland double deckers used to be operated by the same MMTC.

A '''deposit slip''' is a form supplied by a [[Bank of America|bank]] for a [[deposit (finance)|depositor]] to fill out, designed to document in categories the items included in the deposit transaction. The categories include type of item, and if it is a [[cheque]], where it is from such as a local bank or a [[U.S. state|state]] if the bank is not local. The teller keeps the deposit slip along with the deposit (cash and cheques), and provides the depositor with a receipt. They are filled in a store and not a bank, so it is very convenient in paying.

'''Discoverability''' is the degree to which of something, especially a piece of content or information, can be found in a search of a file, database, or other information system. Discoverability is a concern in [[library and information science]], many aspects of digital media, software and web development, and in marketing, since something (e.g., a website, product, service, etc.) cannot be used if people cannot find it or do not understand what it can be used for. [[Metadata]], or "information about information," such as a book's title, a product's description, or a website's keywords, affects how discoverable something is on a database or online. In the 2010s, adding metadata to a product that is available online can make it easier for [[end user]]s to find the product. For example, if a song file is made available online, making the title, name of the band, genre, year of release, and other pertinent information available in connection with this song file will make it easier for users to find this song file. Organizing information by putting it into alphabetical order or including it in a search engine is an example of how to improve discoverability. Discoverability is related to, but different from, [[accessibility]] and [[usability]], other qualities that affect the usefulness of a piece of information.
==Etymology==
The concept of "discoverability" in an information science and online context is a loose borrowing from the concept of the similar name in the legal profession. In law, "discovery" is a pre-trial procedure in a [[lawsuit]] in which each party, through the law of [[civil procedure]], can obtain evidence from the other party or parties by means of discovery devices such as a request for answers to [[interrogatories]], [[Request for production|request for production of document]]s, request for admissions and [[Deposition (law)|deposition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Conducting Discovery in a Civil Lawsuit|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/civil-litigation/conducting-discovery-civil-lawsuit|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=30 September 2017|date=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discovery can be obtained from non-parties using [[subpoena]]s.  When a discovery request is objected to, the requesting party may seek the assistance of the court by filing a [[motion to compel]] discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwarzner|first1=William W.|title=The Federal Rules, the Adversary Process, and Discovery Reform|journal=University of Pittsburgh Law Review|date=1988|volume=50|page=703|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/upitt50&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The usability of any piece of information directly relates to how discoverable it is, either in a "[[walled garden (technology)|walled garden]]" database or on the open Internet. The quality of information available on this database or on the Internet depends upon the quality of the meta-information about each item, product, or service. In the case of a service, because of the emphasis placed on service reusability, opportunities should exist for reuse of this service. However, reuse  is only possible if information is discoverable in the first place. To make items, products, and services discoverable, the following set of activities need to be performed:

# Document the information about the item, product or service (the metadata) in a consistent manner.
# Store the documented information (metadata) in a searchable repository.
# Enable yourself and others to search for the documented information in an efficient manner.

Regarding number 2, storing the information in a searchable repository: while technically a human-searchable repository, such as a printed paper list would qualify, in the 2010s, "searchable repository" is usually taken to mean a computer-searchable repository, such as a [[database]] that a human user can search using some type of [[search engine]] or "find" feature. Number 3 further supports this analysis of number 2, because while reading through a printed paper list by hand might be feasible in a theoretical sense, it is not time and cost-efficient in comparison with computer-based searching.

Apart from increasing the reuse potential of the services, discoverability is also required to avoid development of solution logic that is already contained in an existing service. To design services that are not only discoverable but also provide interpretable information about their capabilities, the service discoverability principle provides guidelines that could be applied during the [[Service-oriented modeling|service-oriented analysis]] phase of the service delivery process.

===Specific to digital media===
In relation to audiovisual content, according to the meaning given by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) for the purpose of its 2016 Discoverability Summit, discoverability can be summed up to the intrinsic ability of given content to "stand out of the lot", or to position itself so as to be easily found and discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discoverability Summit|url=http://www.discoverability.ca|website=Discoverability Summit|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A piece of audiovisual content can be a movie, a TV series, music, a book ([[eBook]]), an audio book or podcast. When audiovisual content such as a digital file for a TV show, movie, or song, is made available online, if the content is "tagged" with identifying information such as the names of the key artists (e.g., actors, directors and screenwriters for TV shows and movies; singers, musicians and record producers for songs) and the genres (e.g., for movies genres such as action, drama or comedy; for songs, genres such as heavy metal music, hip hop music, etc.), this makes it easier for end users to find the content they are interested in.

In the 2010s, when users interact with online content, [[algorithm]]s typically determine what types of content the user is interested in, and then a computer program suggests "more like this", which is other content that the user may be interested in. Different websites and systems have different algorithms, but one approach, used by Amazon for its online store, is to indicate to a user, once the user searches for or looks at content/product ''x'' that "other users who purchased ''x'' also purchased the following items". This example is oriented around online purchasing behaviour, but an algorithm could also be programmed to provide suggestions based on other factors (e.g., searching, viewing, etc.). 

In the 2010s, discoverability is typically referred to in connection with [[search engine]]s. A highly "discoverable" piece of content (e.g., a certain movie) would be a movie that appears at the top, or near the top of a user's search results. A related concept is the role of "recommendation engines", which are computer programs which give a user recommendations based on his/her online activity. In the 2010s, "discoverabilty" applies to desktop and laptop computers and do the increasingly widening range of devices that can access the Internet, including various [[console video game]] systems and mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. When organizations make an effort to promote certain content (e.g., a TV show, film, song, or video game), they can use "traditional marketing" (billboards, TV ads, radio ads) and digital ads (pop-up ads, pre-roll ads, etc.), or a mix of traditional and digital marketing.

Even before the user’s intervention by searching for a certain content or type of content, discoverability is the prime factor which contributes to whether a piece of audiovisual content will be likely to be found in the various digital modes of content consumption. As of 2017, modes of searching include looking on [[Netflix]] for movies, [[Spotify]] for music, Audible for audio books, etc., although the concept can also more generally be applied to content found on [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Instagram]] and other websites. It involves more than a content’s mere presence on a given platform; it can involve associating this content with "keywords" (tags), search algorithms, positioning within different categories, metadata, etc. Thus, discoverability enables as much as it promotes. For audiovisual content broadcast or streamed on digital media using the Internet, discoverability includes the underlying concepts of information science and programming architecture, which are at the very foundation of the search for a specific product, information or content.

==Applications==

===Within a webpage===
Within a specific webpage or software application ("app"), the discoverability of a feature, content or link depends on a range of factors, including the size, colour, highlighting features, and position within the page. When colour is used to communicate the importance of a feature or link, designers typically use other elements as well, such as shadows or bolding, for individuals who cannot see certain colours. Just as traditional paper printing created other physical locations that stood out, such as being "above the fold" of a newspaper versus "below the fold", a web page or app's screenview may have certain locations that give features additional visibility to users, such as being right at the bottom of the web page or screen. 

The positional advantages or disadvantages of various locations depend on different cultures and languages (e.g., left to right vs. right to left). Some locations have become established, such as having toolbars at the top of a screen or webpage. Some designers have argued that commonly used features (e.g., a print button) should be much more visually prominent than very rarely used features. Some features cannot be seen, but there is a convention that if the user places the mouse cursor in a certain area, then a toolbar or function option will become visible. In general, because of the smaller screen of mobile devices, controls are often not placed right in the centre of the screen, because that is where the user views content or text.

Some organizations try to increase the discoverability of a certain feature by adding animation, such as a moving "click here" icon. As of 2017, the addition of motion sensors and geotracking to mobile devices has made webpage design for discoverability more complex, because smartphones and tablets are typically capable of having many more inputs from the user than a 1980s era desktop, including "swiping" the [[touchscreen]], touching images on the screen, or tilting the device. One of the challenges in webpage and app design is that the degree of sophistication and experience of users with navigating in the webpage or app environment varies a great deal, from individuals who are new to using these applications at one extreme to experienced computer users.

===Internet search===
For items that are searched for online, the goal of discoverability is to be at or near the top of the search results. Organizations may make efforts to make it more likely that "their" content or webpages are at the top, or close to the top, of search results; these approaches are often collectively called [[search engine optimization]] (SEO). Note that when an organization takes action to increase the SEO of its website, this does not normally involve changes to the search engine itself; rather, it involves adding metadata tags and original content, among other strategies, to increase the "visibility" of the website to search engine algorithms.

====Services====
In a service delivery context, the application of this principle requires collecting information about the service during the service analysis phase as during this phase; maximum information is available about the service’s functional context&lt;ref name="FuncContext"&gt;The overall purpose of the service&lt;/ref&gt; and the capabilities of the service. At this stage, the domain knowledge of the business experts could also be enlisted to document meta-data about the service. In the [[Service-oriented modeling|service-oriented design]] phase, the already gathered meta-data could be made part of the service contract.&lt;ref name='servicecontract'&gt;[http://www.whatissoa.com/p11.php Service Contract]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[OASIS SOA Reference Model|OASIS SOA-RM]] standard specifies ''service description'' as an artifact that represents service meta-data.&lt;ref name='Michael Poulin'&gt;Michael Poulin. [http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/service_oriented/2009/02/evolution_of_principles_of_service_orientation_service_composability_and_discoverability_part_7.php Evolution of principles of Service Orientation: Service Composability and Discoverability, part 7]. Date accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

To make the service meta-data accessible to interested parties, it must be centrally accessible. This could either be done by publishing the service-meta to a dedicated 'service registry'&lt;ref name='Reddy'&gt;Reddy, et al. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/36107373037136n2/fulltext.pdf Evaluating legacy assets in the context of migration to SOA]. pp 58. Date accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or by simply placing this information in a 'shared directory'.&lt;ref name='DW'&gt;Dennis Wisnosky.[http://www.soamag.com/I25/0109-2.php Principles and Patterns at the U.S. Department of Defense]. Date Accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In case of a 'service registry', the repository can also be used to include QoS, SLA and the current state of a service.&lt;ref name='VS'&gt;.Vinod Sarma, Srinivas Rao Bhagavatula. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753196.1753204&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=85839924&amp;CFTOKEN=41778190 Freeway patterns for SOA systems]. Date accessed: 28 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metadata types==

===Functional===
This is the basic type of meta-information that expresses the functional context of the service and the details about the product, content, or service’s capabilities. The application of the [[standardized service contract]] principle helps to create the basic functional meta-data in a consistent manner. The same standardization should be applied when the same meta-information is being outside the technical contract&lt;ref name='technicalcontract'&gt;[http://www.whatissoa.com/p11.php technical contract]&lt;/ref&gt; of the service e.g. when publishing information to a service registry.&lt;ref name="SvcRegistry"&gt;A repository that contains meta-data about services in a specific format e.g. classification of service, its location, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

For general items, the data that might be used to categorize them may include:
* Name of product, content or service (for audiovisual content, this would be song name, or TV show/movie title)
* Name of manufacturer, designer, creators (for audiovisual content, this would be names of director/producer/artists)
* Technical data (size, weight, height for physical items, or in the case of digital files, compression approach, file size)
* For items which can identify their location via embedded sensors (such as with [[Internet of things]] [[geolocation]] data), location of use/access)

===Quality of service===
For services, to know about the service behavior and its limitations,&lt;ref name='Jim Murphy'&gt;Jim Murphy. [http://www.soamag.com/I5/0307-2.php Essential Components of an SOA Quality Foundation]. Date accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and about the user's service experience, all of this information needs to be documented within the service registry. This way potential consumers can use this meta-information by comparing it against their performance requirements.

==Considerations==
===Services===
The effective application of this design principle requires that the meta-information recorded against each service needs to be consistent and meaningful. This is only possible if organization-wide standards exist that enforce service developers to record the required meta-data in a consistent way. The information recorded as the meta-data for the service needs to be presented in a way so that both technical and non-technical IT experts can understand the purpose and the capabilities of the service, as an evaluation of the service may be required by the business people before the service is authorized to be used.

This principle is best applied during the service-oriented analysis phase as during this time, all the details about the service’s purpose and functionality are available. Although most of the service design principles support each other in a positive manner, however, in case of [[service abstraction]] and service discoverability principle, there exists an inversely proportional relationship. This is because as more and more details about the service are hidden away from the service consumers, less discoverable information is available for discovering the service. This could be addressed by carefully recording the service meta-information so that the inner workings of the service are not documented within this meta-information.
===Algorithms===
In the online economy, sophisticated computer programs called algorithms analyse the ways that end users search for, access and use different content or products online. Thus, not only is metadata created regarding the content or product (e.g., the author and genre of an e-book), but also data is generated about specific human users' interaction with this content. If an organization such as a [[social media]] website has a user profile for a given person, indicating demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location of residence, employment status, education, etc.), then this social media website can collect and analyse information about tendencies of a given user or a given subcategory of users. When social media websites are collecting data about human users' online activities and preferences, this may raise potential privacy concerns. 

Algorithms have been called “[[black box]]es”, because the factors used by the leading  websites in their algorithms are typically proprietary information which is not released to the public. While a number of [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) firms offer the services of attempting to increase the ranking of a client’s web content or website, these SEO firms do not typically know the exact algorithms used by Google and Facebook. Ghosh et al found that algorithm "[[web crawler]]"s can only access 26% of new online content "...by recrawling a constant fraction of the entire web". &lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Anirban; Ghosh, Arpita; Kumar, Ravi; Olston, Christopher; Pandey, Sandeep; and Tomkins, Andrew. ''The Discoverability of the Web''. http://www.arpitaghosh.com/papers/discoverability.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, one concern raised with the increasing role of algorithms on search engines and databases, is that once a specific person indicates a preference for a certain type of content or product, the computer algorithm may increasingly focus on making recommendations in this type of content. To give a practical example, if a person searches for comedy movies online, a search engine algorithm may start mainly recommending comedies to this user, and not showing him or her the range of other films (e.g., drama, documentary, etc.). On the positive side, if this person only likes comedy films, then this restricted "filter" will reduce the information load of scanning through vast numbers of films. However, various cultural stakeholders have raised concerns about how these filter algorithms may restrict the diversity of material that is discoverable to users. Concerns about the dangers of "filter bubbles" have been raised in regards to online news services, which provide types of news, news sources, or topics to a user based on his/her previous online activities. Thus a person who has previously searched for Fox TV content will mainly be shown more Fox TV content and a person who has previously searched for PBS content will be shown more PBS search results, and so on. This could lead to news readers becoming only aware of a certain news source's viewpoints.

The search behaviour of video content viewers has changed a great deal since the widespread popularity of video sharing websites and video streaming. Whereas a typical TV show consumer of the 1980s would read a print edition of ''[[TV Guide]]'' to find out what shows were on, or click from channel to channel ("channel surfing") to see if any shows appealed to them, in the 2010s, video content consumers are increasingly watching on screens (either [[smart TV]]s, [[tablet computer]] screens or [[smartphone]]s) that have a computerized search function and often automated algorithm-created suggestions for the viewer. With this search function, a user can enter the name of a TV show, producer, actor, screenwriter or genre to help them find content of interest to them. If the user is searching on a search engine on a device (laptop, tablet computer, smartphone) they own, the device may transmit information about the user's preferences and previous online searches to the website. Continuing with this 1980s to 2010s comparison, in the 1980s, the type or brand of television a user was watching on did not affect his/her viewing habits. However, a person searching for TV shows in the 2010s on different brands of computerized [[smart TV]]s will probably get different search results for the same search term.

===Limitations===
For organizations that are trying to get maximal user uptake of their product, content or service online, discoverability has become an important goal. However, achieving discovery does not automatically translate into market success. For example, if the hypothetical online game "xyz" is easily discoverable, but it will not function on most mobile devices, then this video game will not perform well in the mobile game market, despite it being at the top of search results. As well, even if the product functions, that is it runs or plays properly, as well, users may not like the product. 

In the case that a user does like a certain online product or service, the discoverability has to be repeatable. If the user cannot find the product or service on a subsequent search, she or he may no longer look for this product/service, and instead shift to a substitute that is easily and reliably findable. It is not enough to make the online product or service discoverable for only a short period, unless the goal is only to create “viral” content as part of a short-term marketing campaign.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13217">'''Food prices''' refer to the (averaged) [[price level]] for [[food]] in particular countries or regions or on a global scale. The [[food industry]]'s contribution to the price levels and fluctuations come from the [[food production]] process, [[food marketing]] and [[food distribution]]. Source of uncontrollable [[price fluctuation]]s are varying [[crop yield]] from [[excess supply]] to [[harvest failure]] and [[food speculation]] activities. It is speculated that already the global [[climate change]] could be a major factor behind rising food prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5434|title=Climate Change: The Unseen Force Behind Rising Food Prices?|date=2013|publisher=World Watch Institute|accessdate=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A continuing drought in South Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Economy/sa-drought-persists-despite-may-rainfall-20160530|title=SA drought persists despite May rainfall|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; may - amongst other factors - have [[food inflation]] soar 11% until end of 2016 according to the [[South African Reserve Bank]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|title= SA’s ticking food price bomb
|author=Thandi Skade
|date=2016-03-29
|url=http://www.destinyman.com/2016/03/29/sas-ticking-food-price-bomb/|journal=destiny man}} &lt;/ref&gt; To a certain extent, adverse price trends can be counteracted by [[food politics]]. When food commodities become too expensive on the world market, [[food security]] is in danger especially for [[developing countries]]. In keeping with the [[supply and demand]]-principle, global prices will [[Market trend|on average continue]] to rise with the growing [[world population]].

==Global differences==
Sharp dramatic rises in the food inflation as happened during the [[2007-08 world food price crisis]] have been more pronounced in developing countries than in the [[OECD]] and [[North America]] in particular, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/economic-and-financial-indicators/21607872-consumer-food-price-inflation|title=Consumer food-price inflation|publisher=The Economist|date=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-economic/cpi/en/|title=FAO Global and regional consumer food inflation monitoring|publisher=FAO}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consumer price index|Consumer prices]] in the [[rich country|rich countries]] are massively influenced by the power of [[discount store]]s and constitute only a small part of the entire [[cost of living]]. In particular, [[Western pattern diet]] constituents like those that are processed by [[fast food chain]]s are comparatively cheap in the Western hemisphere. [[Profit (economics)|Profits]] rely primarily on quantity (see [[mass production]]), less than high-price quality. For some product classes like [[dairy industry|dairy]] or [[meat industry|meat]], [[overproduction]] has twisted the price relations in a way utterly unknown in underdeveloped countries ("[[butter mountain]]"). The situation for poor societies is worsened by certain [[free trade agreement]]s that allow easier export of food in the "southern" direction than vice versa. A striking example can be found in tomato exports from Italy to [[Ghana]] by virtue of the [[Economic Partnership Agreements]] where the artificially cheap vegetables play a significant role in the destruction of indigenous agriculture and a corresponding further decline in the already ailing [[economic power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2015/51/afrika-eu-handelspolitik-subventionen-armut-flucht|title=Afrika: Ein Mann pflückt gegen Europa|first1=Matthias|last1=Krupa|first2=Caterina|last2=Lobenstein|date=30 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2016|via=Die Zeit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.die-gdi.de/uploads/media/Economic_Partnership_Agreements_and_Food_Security.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===World bank food price watch===
The [[World Bank]] releases the quarterly ''Food Price Watch report'' which highlights trends in domestic food prices in [[low-income country|low- and middle-income countries]], and outlines the ([[food policy|food]]) policy implications of food price fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/publication/food-price-watch-home|title=Food Price Watch:|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grocery Foods Economics==
In the long term, prices are expected to stabilize.&lt;ref name="cnn24march2008"/&gt; Farmers will grow more grain for both [[fuel]] and food and eventually bring prices down.&lt;ref name="cnn24march2008"/&gt; This has already occurred with [[wheat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kimball |first=Jack |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE57652C20090807 |title=World food prices stabilize, no drop in sight: WFP |agency=Reuters |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/185426/inflation-slows-in-feb-as-food-prices-stabilize |title=Inflation slows in Feb. as food prices stabilize |publisher=GMA News |date=2010-03-05 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more [[crops]] planted in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Europe]] in 2009. However, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] projects that consumers still have to deal with more expensive food until at least 2018.&lt;ref name="cnn24march2008"/&gt;

It is rare for the spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once. Food prices rose 4% in the United States in 2007, the highest increase since 1990, and are expected to climb as much again in 2008. As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. In China, the price of [[pork]] jumped 58% in 2007. In the 1980s and 1990s, farm subsidies and support programs allowed major grain exporting countries to hold large surpluses which could be tapped during food shortages to keep prices down. However, new trade policies have made agricultural production much more responsive to market demands, putting global food reserves at their lowest since 1983.&lt;ref name="cnn24march2008"&gt;"Food prices rising across the world", CNN. 24 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Food prices are rising, wealthier Asian consumers are westernizing their diets, and farmers and nations of the third world are struggling to keep up the pace. Asian nations have contributed at a more rapid growth rate in the past five years to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry. In 2008, this accounted for more than 30% of production with China accounting for more than 10% of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry. The trend is similarly evident in industries such as soft drink and bottled water manufacturing, as well as global cocoa, chocolate, and sugar confectionery manufacturing, forecast to grow by 5.7% and 10.0% respectively during 2008 in response to soaring demand in Chinese and Southeast Asian markets.

Rising food prices over recent years have been linked with social unrest around the world, including rioting in [[Bangladesh]] and [[Mexico]],&lt;ref name="Ind"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-real-hunger-games-how-banks-gamble-on-food-prices--and-the-poor-lose-out-7606263.html | title=The real hunger games: How banks gamble on food prices – and the poor lose out | newspaper=The Independent | accessdate=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;Food and the Arab Spring http://www.economist.com/node/21550328&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Overseas Development Institute]] researchers showed that [[rice]] has more than doubled in price since 2000, rising by 120% in real terms. This was as a result of shifts in trade policy and restocking by major producers. More fundamental drivers of increased prices are the higher costs of fertiliser, diesel and labour. Parts of Asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the 1.3 billion (2008 estimate) of Asia's poor in reducing the poverty they face. However, this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who don't share in the economic boom, especially in Asian and African coastal cities. The researchers said the threat means social-protection policies are needed to guard against price shocks. The research proposed that in the longer run, the rises present opportunities to export for Western African farmers with high potential for rice production to replace imports with domestic production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7687-end-cheap-rice-prices-rural-labour-wages |title=The end of cheap rice: a cause for celebration? |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |accessdate=2015-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619005820/http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7687-end-cheap-rice-prices-rural-labour-wages |archivedate=2014-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SolarGIS-Solar-map-Germany-en.png|thumb|Solar Electricity Potential in Germany]]
With more than 800 member companies&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.solarwirtschaft.de/ueber-uns.html BSW Website, 20. August 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; BSW-Solar acts as an informant, intermediary and communication channel between the solar businesses and the German government. BSW-Solar represents the common commercial interests of businesses within the solar energy value chain and exerts decisive influence on creating and securing a suitable policy framework for stable growth, and thus on ensuring investment security throughout the solar industry. It is the association’s objective to establish solar energy as a firm pillar of a global energy supply.

BSW-Solar assists its members with legal issues, informs about support policies, and secures stable framework conditions for the industry. The aim is to support the implementation of solar energy as a crucial part of the [[energy mix]] and to strengthen the competitiveness of the solar technologies compared to other energy sources. BSW-Solar also initiates internal market research and feasibility studies to provide first hand information to its members. It delivers international business contacts, publishes guidelines and provides policy advice on how to develop new solar markets. 

According to its own reference the association tries to establish a positive corporate- and in-dustry identity.&lt;ref&gt;1Bundesverband Solarwirtschaft e.V., http://www.solarwirtschaft.de/?518&lt;/ref&gt; BSW-Solar has initiated the largest national solar campaign “Week of the sun (ger: Woche der Sonne)” to enhance public awareness. The campaign is supported by the Federal Ministry for the Environment (ger: [[Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit]]) and distributes comprehensive informative material in many German cities and local communities as well as to manufactures, companies and installers.&lt;ref&gt;2Woche-der-sonne.de, http://www.woche-der-sonne.de/.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilead Sciences was founded in June 1987 by Michael L. Riordan, a medical doctor who was 29 years old at the time.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/gilead-sciences-inc-history/|title=History of Gilead Sciences, Inc. – FundingUniverse|work=fundinguniverse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riordan graduated from Washington University in St. Louis, the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] and the [[Harvard Business School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1996 Alumni Achievement Awards|url=http://engineering.wustl.edu/alumniawards.aspx?year=1996|publisher=Washington University in St. Louis|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821175910/http://engineering.wustl.edu/alumniawards.aspx?year=1996|archivedate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three core scientific advisers worked with Riordan to create the company and establish its scientific vision.  These were [[Peter Dervan]] of [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], [[Douglas A. Melton|Doug Melton]] of [[Harvard University|Harvard]], and Harold Weintraub of the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]]. Riordan served as CEO from inception until 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2003/1027/090.html#1c843b13753b|title=The Golden Age of Antiviral Drugs|last=Moukheiber|first=Kerry A.

Varmus|Harold Varmus]], a Nobel laureate who later became Director of the [[National Institutes of Health]], and [[Jack W. Szostak|Jack Szostak]], recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2009.{{cn|date=August 2017}}
 
The company's primary therapeutic focus was, and continues to be, in antiviral medicines, a field that interested Riordan because he contracted [[dengue fever]], an untreatable viral disease, while working in malnutrition clinics as a [[Henry Luce Scholar]] in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moukheiber|first1=Zina|last2=Dolan|first2=Kerry A.|title=The Golden Age of Antiviral Drugs|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2003/1027/090.html|work=Forbes|date=27 October 2003|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Riordan recruited [[Donald Rumsfeld]] to join the board of directors in 1988, followed by [[Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.]], [[Gordon Moore]], and [[George P. Shultz]]. Riordan tried to recruit [[Warren Buffett]] as an investor and board member, but was unsuccessful.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Under the technical leadership of scientist Dr. Mark Matteucci, the company focused its early discovery research on making small strands of DNA (oligomers) to assess the potential of genetic code blockers ([[gene therapy]]). Its development of small molecule antiviral therapeutics began in 1991 when CEO Riordan and R&amp;D head John C. Martin in-licensed a group of nucleotide compounds discovered in two European academic labs; one of the compounds was [[tenofovir]], a pro-drug of which, trade named Viread, became one of the most widely used anti-retroviral drugs.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

===1990-1999: IPO===
In 1990, Gilead entered into a collaborative research agreement with [[GlaxoSmithKline|Glaxo]] for the research and development of genetic code blockers, also known as [[antisense]]. This collaboration was terminated in 1998, and Gilead's antisense intellectual property portfolio was sold to [[Ionis Pharmaceuticals]]. Gilead debuted on the [[NASDAQ]] in January 1992. Its [[initial public offering]] raised $86.25 million in proceeds.

In June 1996, Gilead launched Vistide ([[cidofovir]] injection) for the treatment of [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) [[retinitis]] in patients with [[AIDS]]. The company cooperated with [[Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn]] to market the product outside the United States.

In January 1997, [[Donald Rumsfeld]], a Board member since 1988, was appointed Chairman,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite press release |title=Donald H. Rumsfeld Named Chairman of Gilead Sciences |publisher=Gilead Sciences |date=1997-01-03 |url=http://www.gilead.com/wt/sec/pr_933190157/ |accessdate=2007-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619044137/http://www.gilead.com/wt/sec/pr_933190157/ |archivedate=2007-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but left the Board in January 2001 when appointed [[United States Secretary of Defense]] at the start of [[George W. Bush]]'s first term as President.

In March 1999, Gilead acquired NeXstar Pharmaceuticals of [[Boulder, Colorado]] following two years of negotiations with the company. At the time, NeXstar's annual sales of $130 million was three times Gilead's sales.  NeXstar's two revenue-generating drugs were AmBisome, an injectable fungal treatment, and DaunoXome, an [[oncology]] drug taken by [[HIV]] patients.  Also in 1999, [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] announced first approval of [[Tamiflu]] ([[oseltamivir]]) for the treatment of [[influenza]]. Tamiflu was originally discovered by Gilead and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing. Viread ([[tenofovir]]) achieved first approval in 2001 for the treatment of HIV.

===2000 to 2009===
In 2002 Gilead changed its corporate strategy to focus only on antivirals, and sold its cancer assets to [[OSI Pharmaceuticals]] for $200 million.&lt;ref name=LAT2002/&gt;

In December 2002, Gilead and Triangle Pharmaceuticals announced that Gilead would acquire Triangle for around $464 million; Triangle's lead drug was [[emtricitabine]] that was near FDA approval, and it had two other antivirals in its pipeline.&lt;ref name=LAT2002&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gellene|first1=Denise|title=Gilead Sciences to Buy Triangle Pharmaceuticals|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/05/business/fi-gilead5|work=Los Angeles Times|date=5 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gilead to Pay $464 Million For Triangle Pharmaceuticals|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1039013783682043153|work=Wall Street Journal|date=4 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also announced its first full year of profitability. Later that year Hepsera ([[adefovir]]) was approved for the treatment of chronic [[hepatitis B]], and Emtriva ([[emtricitabine]]) for the treatment of HIV.

In 2004, Gilead launched Truvada, a fixed-dose combination of [[tenofovir]] and [[emtricitabine]].

In 2006, Gilead completed two acquisitions that allowed the company to branch out from its historical antiviral franchise into the [[cardiovascular]] and [[respiratory]] therapeutic arenas. Under an agreement with [[GlaxoSmithKline]], Myogen marketed [[Flolan]] ([[epoprostenol sodium]]) in the United States for the treatment of [[primary pulmonary hypertension]]. Additionally, Myogen was developing (in Phase 3 studies) darusentan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/search?term=darusentan&amp;submit=Search |title=ClinicalTrials.gov - Information on Clinical Trials and Human Research Studies: Darusentan |accessdate=2007-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; also an endothelin receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of resistant [[hypertension]].

In 2006, the company acquired Corus Pharma, Inc. for $365 million. The acquisition of Corus signaled Gilead's entry into the respiratory arena. Corus was developing aztreonam lysine for the treatment of patients with [[cystic fibrosis]] who are infected with ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''. In July 2006, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved [[Atripla]], a once a day single tablet regimen for HIV, combining Sustiva ([[efavirenz]]), a [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] product, and Truvada ([[emtricitabine]] and [[tenofovir disoproxil]]), a Gilead product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Pollack | first = Andrew | title = F.D.A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilead purchased Raylo Chemicals, Inc. in November 2006 for a price of $133.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title= Gilead Sciences Completes Acquisition of Raylo Chemicals Inc.|publisher= Gilead Sciences|date= 2006-11-03|url= http://www.gilead.com/wt/sec/pr_926645|accessdate= 2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raylo Chemical, based in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], was a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Degussa AG]], a German company.  Raylo Chemical was a custom manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced intermediates for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Later in the same year Gilead acquired Myogen, Inc. for $2.5 billion (then its largest acquisition). With two drugs in development (ambrisentan and darusentan), and one marketed product (Flolan) for pulmonary diseases, the acquisition of Myogen has solidified Gilead's position in this therapeutic arena.

Gilead expanded its move into respiratory therapeutics in 2007 by entering into a licensing agreement with Parion for an [[epithelial sodium channel]] inhibitor for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, including cystic fibrosis, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] and [[bronchiectasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Parion Sciences and Gilead Sciences Sign Agreement to Advance Drug Candidates for Pulmonary Disease | publisher = Gilead Sciences | date = 2007-08-15 | url = http://www.gilead.com/pr_1040975 | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the company  acquired CV Therapeutics, Inc. for $1.4 billion, bringing Ranexa and Lexiscan into Gilead. Ranexa is a cardiovascular drug used to treat chest pain related to coronary artery disease, with both of these products and pipeline building out Gilead's cardiovascular franchise.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, via the New York Times. 12 March 2009. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/business/13biotech.html?_r=0 Gilead, a White Knight, to Buy CV Therapeutics]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the same year the company received the award for one of the Fastest Growing Companies by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''. In the same year they were also named as one America's Top Companies to work for by ''[[Forbes]]''.

===2010 to 2019===
In 2010, the company acquired CGI Pharmaceuticals for $120 million, expanding Gilead's research expertise into kinase biology and chemistry. Later that year, the company acquired Arresto Biosciences, Inc. for $225 million, obtaining developmental-stage research for treating fibrotic diseases and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Gilead Sciences to Acquire Arresto Biosciences for $225 Million; Deal Adds Pipeline Candidates for Fibrotic Diseases | publisher   = Gilead Sciences | url = http://www.gilead.com/pr_1509319 | date = 2010-12-20 | accessdate = 2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the company acquired Calistoga Pharmaceuticals for $375 million ($225 million plus milestone payments). The acquisition boosted Gilead's oncology and inflammation areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Gilead Sciences to Acquire Calistoga Pharmaceuticals for $375 Million; Deal Adds Pipeline Candidates in Oncology and Inflammation -- | publisher  = Gilead Sciences | url = http://investors.gilead.com/preview/phoenix.zhtml?c=69964&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1531190&amp;highlight= | date = 2011-02-22 | accessdate = 2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Gilead made its most important acquisition — and most expensive to date — with the $10.4 billion purchase of  [[Pharmasset]], Inc. This transaction helped cement Gilead as the leader in treatment of the [[hepatitis C virus]] by giving it control of [[sofosbuvir]] (see below).

On July 16, 2012, the FDA approved Gilead's [[Truvada]] for prevention of HIV infection (it was already approved for treating HIV). The pill was a preventive measure ([[Pre-exposure prophylaxis#PrEP for HIV|PrEP]]) for people at high risk of getting HIV through sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perrone|first=Matthew|title=FDA approves first pill to help prevent HIV|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/48198452/ns/today-today_health/t/fda-approves-first-pill-help-prevent-hiv/#.UARSd_VdDvY|work=Today Health|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the company acquired YM Biosciences, Inc. for $510 million. The acquisition brings drug candidate [[CYT387]], an orally-administered, once-daily, selective inhibitor of the [[Janus kinase]] (JAK) family, specifically JAK1 and JAK2, into Gilead's oncology pipeline. The JAK enzymes have been implicated in myeloproliferative diseases, inflammatory disorders, and certain cancers.

In 2015, the company made a trio of acquisitions:
*It bought Phenex Pharmaceuticals for $470 million. Its Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) program used small-molecule FXR agonists in the treatment of liver diseases such as [[nonalcoholic steatohepatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/gilead-to-acquire-phenex-s-fxr-program-for-up-to-470m/81250770/|title=Gilead to Acquire Phenex's FXR Program for Up-to-$470M|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It bought EpiTherapeutics for $65 million. This acquisition gave Gilead first-in-class small molecule inhibitors of [[Demethylase#Histone demethylation|histone demethylases]] involved in regulating gene transcription in cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/gilead-boosts-cancer-pipeline-with-65m-epitherapeutics-buy/81251237/|title=Gilead Boosts Cancer Pipeline With $65M EpiTherapeutics Buy|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It paid $425 million for a 15% equity stake in Galapagos NV, with additional payments for Gilead to license the experimental anti-inflammatory drug [[filgotinib]], which may treat rheumatoid arthritis, [[ulcerative colitis]], and [[Crohn's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=N/A|first1=Zack's Market Research|title=Gilead (GILD) Collaborates with Galapagos for Filgotinib|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gilead-gild-collaborates-galapagos-filgotinib-214009221.html|website=Yahoo Finance|publisher=Yahoo/Zack's|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the company acquired Nimbus Apollo, Inc. for $400 million, giving Gilead control of the compound NDI-010976 (an ACC inhibitor) and other preclinical ACC inhibitors for the treatment of [[non-alcoholic steatohepatitis]] and for the potential treatment of [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investors.gilead.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=69964&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2153767#sthash.J8GnM3pl.dpuf|title=Gilead - Investors - News Release|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentherald.com/articles/35157/20160406/gilead-sciences-nimbus-drug-acquired-offering-cure-fatty-liver.htm|title=Gilead Sciences: Nimbus Drug Acquired, Offering Cure For Fatty Liver|work=Parent Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2016, the company was named the most generous company on the 2016 Fortune list of The Most Generous Companies of the [[Fortune 500]]. Charitable donations to HIV/AIDS and liver disease organizations totaled over 440 million in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/22/fortune-500-most-charitable-companies/|title=The Giving 20: The Most Generous Companies in America|work=Fortune|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, the company announced it would acquire [[Kite Pharma]] for $11.9 billion,&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-kite-pharma-m-a-gilead-sciences-idUKKCN1B810Y&lt;/ref&gt; equating to $180 cash per share, a 29% premium over the closing price of the shares. The deal will add the promising [[CAR-T]] candidate to the companys existing portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/gilead-grabs-kite-for-11-9b-thrusting-itself-to-front-car-t-field |title=Growth-hungry Gilead finally pivots from flagging hep C with $12B Kite buy |website=fiercepharma.com |date=2017-08-28 |accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the company announced it will acquire [[Cell Design Labs]] for up to $567 million, after it indirectly acquired a stake of 12.2% via the Kite Pharma deal. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gilead-sciences-m-a/gilead-to-buy-cell-design-labs-for-up-to-567-million-idUSKBN1E134T&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sovaldi and Harvoni====
The drug [[sofosbuvir]] had been part of the 2011 acquisition of Pharmasset. In 2013, the FDA approved this drug, under the trade name Sovaldi, as a treatment for the [[hepatitis C virus]]. ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked Gilead its number 4 drug company, citing a market capitalization of US$113 billion and stock appreciation of 100%, and describing their 2011 purchase of [[Pharmasset]] for $11 billion as “one of the best pharma acquisitions ever”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/12/31/grading-pharma-in-2013-16-drug-companies-ranked/ |title= Grading Pharma in 2013|publisher=Forbes |date=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deutsche Bank]] estimated Sovaldi sales in the year's final quarter would be $53 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Gilead+(GILD)+Q4+Sovaldi+Sales+Tracking+at+$53M+-+Deutsche+Bank/9020948.html |title= Q4 Sovaldi Sales Tracking at $53 Million |publisher=Street Insider |date=January 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]]'' noted the FDA approval and subsequent strong sales of the “potentially revolutionary” drug as a positive indicator for the stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2014/01/02/gilead-sciences-sovaldi-to-boost-shares-in-2014-maxim-group-says/|title= Stocks to Watch |publisher=Barrons |date=January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2014, the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance]] investigated Sovaldi's high price ($1,000 per pill; $84,000 for the full 12-week regimen). Senators questioned the extent to which the market was operating “efficiently and rationally”, and committee chairman [[Ron Wyden]] ([[U.S. Democratic Party|D]]-[[Oregon]]) and ranking minority member [[Chuck Grassley]] ([[U.S. Republican Party|R]]-[[Iowa]]) wrote to CEO John C. Martin asking Gilead to justify the price for this drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Critics Raise Concerns About Sovaldi|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/upshot/is-a-1000-pill-really-too-much.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2014-08-02|access-date = 2015-10-04|issn = 0362-4331|first = Margot|last = Sanger-katz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee hearings did not result in new law, but in 2014 and 2015, due to negotiated and mandated discounts, Sovaldi was sold well below the list price.&lt;ref name="Martin_2014"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2880996-gilead-sciences-gild-ceo-john-martin-on-q4-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=4|title=Gilead Q4 2014 Earnings Call}}&lt;/ref&gt; For poorer countries, Gilead licensed multiple companies to produce generic versions of Sovaldi; in India, a pill's price was as low as $4.29.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-29/the-price-keeps-falling-for-a-superstar-gilead-drug-in-india|title=The same pill that cost $1,000 in the U.S. sold for $4 in India|author=Ketaki Gokhale|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilead later combined Sovaldi with other antivirals in single-pill combinations. First, Sovaldi was combined with [[ledipasvir]] and marketed as [[ledipasvir/sofosbuvir|Harvoni]]. This treatment for hepatitis C cures the patient in 94% to 99% of cases (HCV genotype 1).&lt;ref name=Ke2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keating GM |title=Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir: a review of its use in chronic hepatitis C |journal=Drugs |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=675–85 |year=2015 |pmid=25837989 |doi=10.1007/s40265-015-0381-2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, Gilead was reporting drastic drops in Sovaldi revenue from year to year, not only because of pricing pressure but because the number of suitable patients decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/03/09/i-was-wrong-about-gilead-sciences.aspx|title=I Was Wrong About Gilead Sciences|author=Michael Douglass|publisher=The Motley Fool|date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later single-pill combinations were [[Epclusa]] (with [[velpatasvir]]) and [[Vosevi]] (with [[velpatasvir]] and [[voxilaprevir]]).

====Finances====
For the fiscal year 2017, Gilead Sciences Insurance reported earnings of US$4.628 billion, with an annual revenue of US$26.107 billion, a decline of 14.1% over the previous fiscal cycle. Gilead Sciences's shares traded at over $70 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US$93.4 billion in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GILD/gilead-sciences/revenue|title=Gilead Sciences Revenue 2006-2018 {{!}} GILD|website=www.macrotrends.net|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prospects for the future====
As of 2017, Gilead's challenge is to develop or acquire new blockbuster drugs before its current revenue-producers wane or their patent protection expires. Like other pharmaceutical companies, it stands to gain from efforts by U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] to repeal taxes imposed by the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA). However, Gilead also benefitted from the expansion of [[Medicaid]] in the ACA; Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that Gilead's HIV drugs could face funding pressure under reform proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investors.com/news/technology/will-gileads-hiv-franchise-plan-be-dashed-on-trumpcare/|title=Will Gilead's HIV Franchise Plan Be Dashed On TrumpCare?|author=Allison Gatlin|publisher=Investors Business Daily|date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilead has $32 billion in cash, but $27.4 billion is outside the U.S. and is unavailable for acquisitions unless Gilead pays U.S. tax on it, though it could borrow against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2017/03/13/gilead-sciences-is-an-incyte-deal-reasonable/|title=Gilead Sciences: Is an Incyte Deal ‘Reasonable’?|author=Ben Levisohn|publisher=Barron's|date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilead would benefit from proposals to let companies repatriate offshore capital with minimal further taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/4045199-pharma-m-2017-likely-deal-hunters|title=Pharma M&amp;A In 2017: The Most Likely Deal Hunters|author=Ioannis Stamatopoulos|publisher=Seeking Alpha|date=2017-02-12|accessdate=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hotze "Harry" Koch''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|x}}; 22 October 1867 – 21 June 1942) was a Dutch-born American businessman who founded the ''Quanah Tribune-Chief'' newspaper. He was the father of [[Fred C. Koch]] (1900–1967), founder of [[Koch Industries]].

==Early life and education==
Koch was born in the [[Friesland|Dutch Frisian]] town of [[Workum]], Netherlands. He was the second child of the physician Johan Anthon Koch (1836–1910) and Gatske Hotzes Jorritsma (1837–1876).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gw.geneanet.org/rikvandorst?lang=en&amp;n=koch&amp;oc=0&amp;p=hotze|title=Family tree of Hotze Koch Harry|website=Geneanet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koch’s paternal grandfather had been a shipowner from [[Sande, Lower Saxony|Sande]] in German [[East Frisia]] who had shipwrecked off the coast of Workum, where he eventually married the mayor’s daughter. Koch’s mother died during the birth of her eighth child, and his father remarried Petronella de Swart, the daughter of a banker. Harry Koch had five surviving siblings and another five half-siblings who all remained in the Netherlands.  After working as a printer’s apprentice in [[The Hague]] and [[Germany]], Koch emigrated to the United States in 1888. He first lived in Dutch enclaves in [[Chicago]] and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], where he worked for Dutch-language newspapers.

==Career and politics==
Around 1890 he moved to Eastern Texas, where the humid climate drove him soon West to settle in the railroad town Quanah.&lt;ref name=vuijst&gt;Freke Vuijst, ''[http://www.vn.nl/Archief/Buitenland/Artikel-Buitenland/Aartsvijanden-van-Obama.htm Aartsvijanden van Obama]'', [[Vrij Nederland]], 2 March 2012 (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Quanah had three newspapers, the ''Quanah Eagle'', the ''Quanah Chief'' and the ''Quanah Tribune''.&lt;ref name=NewNetherlandInstitute&gt;[http://www.nnp.org/nni/Publications/Dutch-American/dabook/Chapter%2010.pdf The New Netherland Institute: "DUTCH AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS CHAPTER 10: "SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS—THE KOCH BROTHERS"] retrieved January 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He had saved enough to purchase the ''Quanah Tribune'' and then merged it with the ''Quanah Chief'' in 1897 forming the ''Quanah Tribune-Chief''.&lt;ref name=TexPress&gt;[http://texaspress.com/index.php/about-us/presidents/51-presidents-1900-1919/577-1918-19-harry-koch Texas Press: "1918-19 Harry Koch Quanah Tribune Chief"] December 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a founding shareholder of the [[Quanah, Acme and Pacific Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = Yasha | last= Levine | title = Empire Building | work = The Texas Observer | accessdate = 2014-09-26 | date = 2011-11-07 | url = http://www.texasobserver.org/empire-building/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koch used his newspaper to promote this railroad as well as his libertarian political ideas. During the depression, he fiercely opposed [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and wrote opinion pieces against trade unions, retirement pensions, and the regulation of banks.&lt;ref name=vuijst/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1898, Koch married Margaret (Mattie) Mixson (born in 1874 in Quanah, TX; died 1941).&lt;ref name=Mixsonian&gt;[http://www.mixsonian.com/genealogy/mixon-mixson/pg-392.html Mixson Family Genealogy] retrieved January 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of Hester (née Blessingame) and John Baptist Mixson (1851-1927) of Quanah, Texas (he was the son of Simeon Mixson and Margaret Campbell).&lt;ref name=Mixsonian /&gt; They had two sons:&lt;ref&gt;[http://exiledonline.com/the-birth-of-the-koch-clan-it-all-started-in-a-little-texas-town-called-quanah/ The Exiled (reprinted from the Texas Observer): "The Birth of the Koch Clan: It All Started In a Little Texas Town Called Quanah" By Yasha Levine] November 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hivernants''' was used during the [[North American fur trade]] to describe [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] who spent the winter months hunting and trapping on the [[Canadian prairies]] where they built small temporary villages. The word is French for "winterer". "Hiverner" the verb means to overwinter.&lt;ref name="McDermott1941"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Francis McDermott|title=A glossary of Mississippi Valley French, 1673-1850|url=https://archive.org/details/glossaryofmissis00mcde|year=1941|publisher=Washington University|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hivernants were active in hunting buffalo (bison) during the cold-weather season (mid-November to mid-March) when the bison's hair was thick enough for the production of [[buffalo robe]]s.  This was as opposed to the summer hunt, which was primarily aimed at harvesting meat.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
Hivernant was also applied to a fur trade employee who  wintered in the wilderness (usually at a trading post). 

Hivernant may also refer to a vacationer who spends the winter months at a resort or vacation center in a warmer climate.  During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries many of the seasonal visitors to the [[French Riviera]] were referred to as hivernants.  With the ability to vacation abroad (or domestically if they were French) for months on end (usually October until May), these hivernants were typically wealth elites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2934">{{Corporate law|doctrines}}

The '''internal affairs doctrine''' is a [[choice of law]] rule in [[corporations law]].  Simply stated, it provides that the "internal affairs" of a [[corporation]] (e.g. conflicts between [[shareholder]]s and [[management]] figures such as the [[board of directors]] and [[corporate officer]]s) will be governed by the corporate [[statute]]s and [[case law]] of the state in which the corporation is [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]], sometimes referred to as the '''''lex incorporationis'''''.&lt;ref&gt;''Edgar v. MITE Corp.'', 457 U.S. 624, 645 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''McDermott Inc. v. Lewis'', 531 A.2d 206 (Del. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical effects of the doctrine==
The internal affairs doctrine ensures that such issues as voting rights of shareholders, distributions of [[dividend]]s and corporate [[property]], and the [[fiduciary]] obligations of management are all determined in accordance with the law of the state in which the company is incorporated.  On the other hand, the "external affairs" of a corporation, such as [[labor law|labor and employment]] issues and [[Tax law|tax liability]], are typically governed by the law of the state in which the corporation is doing business. Some issues and activities, such as [[contract]]s, [[mergers and acquisitions]], and sales of [[Security (finance)|securities]] to third parties, may be governed both by the laws of the state of incorporation and by the laws of the state in which the transaction takes place, and in some cases, by [[federal law]] as well (for example, [[United States securities law]] and [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]]).

==Relation to federalism==
{{see also|Federalism in the United States}}

In the [[United States]], each [[U.S. state|state]] has the power to set its own corporate law.  Because of this, and the fact that the internal affairs doctrine has been used by courts to allow application of the ''lex incorporationis'', this has created a competitive market for incorporations among the states.  Several states have taken advantage of this situation by becoming [[corporate haven]]s, particularly [[Delaware]] and [[Nevada]].  Likewise, many jurisdictions apply the internal affairs doctrine internationally, which has permitted [[offshore financial centre]]s to flourish.

'''Jean-Claude Falmagne''' (born February 4, 1934, in Brussels, Belgium) is a [[mathematical psychology|mathematical psychologist]] whose scientific contributions deal with problems in [[reaction time]] theory, psychophysics, [[philosophy of science]], measurement theory, [[decision theory]], and educational technology.  Together with Jean-Paul Doignon, he developed [[knowledge space|knowledge space theory]], which is the mathematical foundation for the [[Aleks|ALEKS]] software for the assessment of knowledge in various academic subjects, including K-12 mathematics, chemistry, and accounting.

== Early life and career ==
After finishing high school, Falmagne spent two years in the Belgian army, where he became an officer.  Military service was mandatory in Belgium at the time.  In 1954, he enrolled at the [[University of Brussels]] (Université Libre de Bruxelles) as a student in the psychology department.  He received his undergraduate degree in 1959 and was hired as an assistant at the University of Brussels, which is a faculty position in the Belgian system.  He obtained his Ph.D. degree in 1965 from the same institution.

While working on his doctoral dissertation, which dealt with reaction times, Falmagne became interested in the applications of mathematics to the cognitive sciences.  In 1964, he was invited by [[Patrick Suppes]] to spend the summer at [[Stanford University]].  He presented the results of his dissertation at a conference there and met several prominent mathematical psychologists, including [[William K. Estes|Bill Estes]], [[Richard C. Atkinson|Dick Atkinson]], and [[Duncan Luce]], and the mathematician [[János Aczél (mathematician)|János Aczél]].  Suppes, Luce, and Aczél had a strong influence on Falmagne’s choice of scientific career and on his approach to solving scientific problems.  His visit to Stanford convinced him that he needed to continue his education in the United States.

With the support of [[Fulbright scholar|Fulbright]] and [[Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique|FNRS]] fellowships, Falmagne held post-doctoral positions at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the [[University of Michigan]] between 1966 and 1969.  His interests grew to include psychophysics, measurement theory, and probabilistic models of ordering and algebraic measurement.  After short teaching stints back in Europe at the University of Brussels and the University of Paris, he returned to the United States in 1971 as a Professor of Psychology at New York University.

In 1989, he joined the faculty of University of California, Irvine, accepting an appointment at the Department of Cognitive Sciences and the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences.  He remained there until his retirement in 2004.

Until 2013, Falmagne was Chairman of [http://www.aleks.com ALEKS Corporation], a web-based educational software company that he founded with some of his graduate students.  He is currently a Research Professor  at the [[University of California, Irvine]].

== Research ==
In 1978, Falmagne solved a well-known problem, posed in 1960 by the economists H.D. Block and [[Jacob Marschak]] in their article "Random Orderings and Stochastic Theories of Responses", concerning the representation of choice probabilities by random variables&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Block|first=H.D.|title=Contributions to Probability and Statistics|year=1960|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=97–132|contribution=Random Orderings and Stochastic Theories of Responses|first2=Jacob|last2=Marschak|editors=Olkin, Ghurye, Hoeffding, Madow and Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published his findings in the ''Journal of Mathematical Psychology''.{{ran|F78}}

=== Knowledge spaces, media theory, learning spaces and the ALEKS software ===
In 1985, Falmagne, along with Jean-Paul Doignon, wrote “Spaces for the Assessment of Knowledge”.{{ran|DF85}}  In this article, they presented a formal framework for the assessment of knowledge in various academic subjects, such as arithmetic, algebra, and chemistry.  This early framework was combinatoric in character, and as such insufficient for a practical assessment, which is unavoidably plagued by careless errors on the part of the test takers.  In time, they created a stochastic framework for the description of the evolution of an assessment, question by question.{{ran|FD88}}  With extensive financial support from the [[National Science Foundation]], their work on the [[stochastic]] framework led to the creation of the web-based system ALEKS for the assessment and learning of mathematics and science.  Falmagne and Doignon's 2011 book, ''Learning Spaces'',{{ran|FD11}} contains the most current presentation and development of the stochastic framework for the assessment of knowledge.  Learning spaces are specific kinds of knowledge spaces, whose best applications are to situations where assessments guide efficient learning.  Learning spaces are a part of the concept of Media Theory,{{ran|EFO07}} which explores the modeling of knowledge structures and knowledge states.  More generally, these lines of research are collectively called Knowledge Space Theory and are being pursued by many investigators, mostly in Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands.

=== The meaningfulness of scientific laws ===
A common practice in the statement of scientific laws ensures that the mathematical expression of the law is invariant with respect to changes of units of its variables—except for the values of dimensional constants. In dimensional analysis, this invariance is implicit and captured by the concept of "quantities". In "Scales and Meaningfulness of Quantitative Laws", Falmagne and [[Louis Narens]] argue that the requirement of invariance, which they call "meaningfulness" should be part of the axioms or theory establishing the law, rather than result from them.{{ran|FN83}} They proposed a more powerful framework making this invariance explicit in the notation.  This approach was generalized by Falmagne in "Meaningfulness and Order Invariance: Two Fundamental Principles for Scientific Laws",{{ran|F04}} and applied to several exemplary laws of physics.

=== Other work ===
The monograph ''Elements of Psychophysical Theory''{{ran|F85}} presents the mathematical foundation of psychophysics and includes an introduction to measurement theory and functional equations.  Falmagne's work in philosophy of science concerns foundational issues in algebraic measurement{{ran|DF69}}{{ran|F75}} and in probabilistic measurement.{{ran|F76}}  A distinctive feature of his research lies in the use of functional equations in order to achieve generality.{{ran|F80}}{{ran|AF99}}{{ran|AF00}}{{ran|FD10}}

== Awards and honors ==
Falmagne is the recipient of Fulbright and [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1973|Guggenheim]] Fellowships and of a von Humboldt Award. In 1994, he was recognized as a "Friend of NSERC" by the [http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada] and [[János Aczél (mathematician)|János D. Aczél]] .  That same year, he was elected as a member of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]]. He is also a fellow of the [[Society of Experimental Psychologists]]. He received an Innovation Award from the University of California, Irvine in 2004 and a doctoris honoris causa degree in science from the University of Graz in 2005.

In celebration of Falmagne's 70th birthday in 2004, a "[http://users.ugent.be/~yrosseel/empg/index.php?path=falmagne.html Falmagne Symposium]" was held at the annual meeting of the [[European Mathematical Psychology Group]] in Ghent, Belgium, and a "Falmagne Festschrift Meeting" was held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.  Two special issues of the ''Journal of Mathematical Psychology'' were published in 2005 with the papers presented at two meetings organized to honor his 70th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Special Issue Honoring Jean-Claude Falmagne|journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|date=December 2005|volume=49|issue=6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00222496/49/6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a conference on meaningfulness and learning spaces was held in Irvine in honor of his 80th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imbs.uci.edu/node/25451 Conference on Meaningfulness and Learning Spaces: A Tribute to the Work of Jean-Claude Falmagne], UC Irvine Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, February 27–28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the UC Irvine Alumni Association gave him their highest honor, the Extraordinarius award.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.uci.edu/features/lauds-laurels-to-salute-18-campus-luminaries/|title=Lauds &amp; Laurels to salute 18 campus luminaries: Cognitive scientist-turned-mathematician and educational software entrepreneur Jean-Claude Falmagne will receive prestigious Extraordinarius award|journal=UCI News|publisher=University of California, Irvine|date=April 3, 2015|first=Laura|last=Rico}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katell Gélébart''' is a French ecodesigner, artist, activist, educator and entrepreneur.  She is best known for her fashion designs made from re-purposing unwanted materials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.treehugger.com/style/katell-gelebart-turns-food-packaging-into-haute-couture.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oshonews.com/2017/12/08/the-freedom-of-having-nothing/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Gélébart was born in Brest, France. She graduated from [[Paris-Sorbonne University|La Sorbonne University]] in 1996 with a Master of Scandinavian Studies. She also attended the [[École du Louvre]]. In her 20s she was an environmental campaigner, in the fields of nuclear issues, tropical wood, trade of endangered species etc. working for diverse grass roots organisations in Europe.  In 1998, in Amsterdam, she founded ART D’ECO &amp; DESIGN, her company specializing in fashion and other products  made from refashioning and reusing wastes.

Gélébart currently teaches the module Men/Environment at NABA  (the New Academy of Fine Arts) in Milan, Italy. 

==Creations==
Since 2004, Gélébart has been developing entire collections of garments and fashion accessories out of unwanted materials. Her media of work have expanded to include stationery collection and interior design.

She lectures in design academies around the world. She empowers people and craft people (specially in India) to create with their own waste.

She has had shows in many galleries around the world. Her major show was a retrospective : WAS DAT IS  at the Museum für Kunst &amp; Gewerbe,in Germany.

==Awards and presentations==
In 2013, her biography in German " Die Mülldesignerin: wie Katell Gélébart die Welt verändert" has been published by SCORPIO and written by Christine Eichel.

In 2018, she published in English her autobiography  '''The Freedom of Having Nothing, Ecodesigner and Global Nomad''' by Amazon. 

In 2012, she was the recipient of the [[KAIROS Prize|Kairos Prize]], the European Cultural award by the A. Toepfer foundation (Hamburg).&lt;ref&gt;[http://toepfer-fvs.de/2318.html?&amp;L=1 Announcement of 2012 Kairos Prize Winner]&lt;/ref&gt; When receiving the award, she said of her work; "My work philosophy and ethic is to develop the potential of recycling/re-using of waste &amp; unwanted materials in the field of design. My creations show that it is possible to combine design and re-use without creating raw material and generating more waste as a result of this process. My work is the embodiment of "ecodesign" : the art of re-using  and utilizing low tech’ means only.  Via my company ART D’ECO &amp; DESIGN, I implement my vision and inspire people to do alike"

'''Lingfield Point''' is a {{convert|107|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[business park]] in [[Darlington]], [[County Durham]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lingfieldpoint.co.uk Lingfield Point website]&lt;/ref&gt; created on a historic industrial site previously home to Europe's largest [[wool]] manufacturing plant developed by [[Patons and Baldwins]].

==History==
[[Patons and Baldwins]] built their new wool factory at Lingfield Point immediately after the [[Second World War]]. Construction started on the new factory in August 1945. The aim was to create a flagship manufacturing base for the knitting yarn company. The {{convert|107|acre|km2|adj=on}} site {{convert|2|mi|km}} to the east of the town centre was located next to the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] line, providing the factory with its own railway sidings. 

By 1951 this wool factory was completed at a cost of £7.5m. At over {{convert|2000000|sqft|m2}} this was one of the largest wool factories in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2001/9/24/159098.html Great yarn of knitting giant's rise and fall]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
{{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Darlington]], Lingfield Point is located off the new Eastern Transport Corridor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darlington.gov.uk/Living/Planning+and+Building+Control/Planning+Services/Projects+and+Schemes/EasternTransportCorridor.htm Darlington Borough Council - Eastern Transport Corridor]&lt;/ref&gt; giving immediate access to the [[A66 road (England)|A66]] (East/West) which in turn links to J57, [[A1(M)]] South, a couple of miles from the [[A167 road (Great Britain)|A167]] which links to J59, A1(M) North.

Lingfield Point is now only minutes away from the region's extensive road network; 5 minutes from [[Darlington railway station]] – operating on the [[East Coast Main Line]] with over 30 trains per day to [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]] and {{convert|4|mi|km}} from [[Durham Tees Valley Airport]].

==Modern Transformation==
60 years later property developers [[Marchday]] transformed this manufacturing base into a large [[business park]] – one of the largest employment bases in the [[Tees Valley]] employing over 2500 people.  Now owned by Clearbell, it is home to over 50 businesses and offers space from {{convert|270|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} to 150,000+ sqft. Lingfield Point has been recognised by winning a number of national and specialist awards including the British Council of Offices Recycled/Refurbished workspace award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/4670331.Award_for_revamped_wool_works/ The Northern Echo - Student Loans Company in the Memphis building, Lingfield Point, named best refurbished/recycled workplace in UK]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 and previous winners of the [[Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors]] (RICS) national property management award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/archive/2004/07/13/The+North+East+Archive/6984804.Marchday_group_wins_property_management_award/ The Northern Echo - Marchday group wins property management award]&lt;/ref&gt;

Creativity is set to continue around the 90-acre site thanks to ongoing investment.  Lingfield Point hopes to become a flagship for successful regeneration in the North East – continuing to position Darlington as a great base for business.

A new £100m masterplan will see the creation of a flagship, sustainable mixed community built around the existing business community providing up to 1300 homes, sports facilities, a school, healthcare facilities and public, green open space.

Over {{convert|250000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of office space has been let at Lingfield Point in the last five years and more than 2500 people currently work at the business park.

Al-Khelaïfi is chairman and chief executive officer of [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain Football Club]] in France. He is also a member of the organizing committee for the FIFA Club World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/bodies/standingcommittees/committee=1882024.html|title=FIFA.com - Organising Committee for the FIFA Club World Cup|work=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he was crowned 'favourite Ligue 1 president' and in 2016, ''[[L'Equipe]]'' named him 'the most powerful man in French football'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Al-Khelaïfi : "J'ai beaucoup appris au contact des autres présidents de L1"|url = http://www.francefootball.fr/news/al-khelaa-fi-a-j-ai-beaucoup-appris-au-contact-des-autres-pra-sidents-de-l1a/617754|website = France Football|access-date = 23 February 2016|language = fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==beIN Media Group==
On 31 December 2013, Al Jazeera Sport global operations were spun off from [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] and rebranded as [[beIN Sports]]. In parallel, [[BeIN Media Group]] was incorporated and became the official owner of beIN Sports. Nasser Al-Khelaïfi was then appointed chairman and chief executive officer of beIN Media Group.&lt;ref name="beinsportsfrance"/&gt; beIN Sports has 22 channels including 17 HD channels and broadcasts across the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, North America, Australia and Asia. The strategy, aside from building the beIN premium sports network, is to develop the group's ambitions in sports and entertainment in production, distribution and digital media sectors.

==Qatar Sports Investments==
Nasser Al-Khelaïfi has been chairman of Qatar Sports Investments (QSi) since June 2011. QSi is a fund dedicated to investments in the sport and leisure industry on a national and international level.&lt;ref name="qsi.com.qa"/&gt;

Following the QSi acquisition of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) Football Club in June 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qatari group takes control of Paris Saint-Germain|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/924844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser Al-Khelaifi became the chairman of the board of PSG and also CEO of the club,&lt;ref name="psg.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psg.fr/en/Club/609001/Presidents|title=Presidents - club_presidents - PSG.fr|work=psg.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; reinforcing Qatari interest in French football.

QSi has several other high profile partnerships. They also used to sponsor Spanish football club [[FC Barcelona]]. QSi also owns the [[Burrda (brand)|Burrda]] sportswear brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qsi.com.qa/portfolio/investments/|title=Portfolio|work=qsi.com.qa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Saint-Germain===

Nasser Al-Khelaïfi became the new chairman and chief executive officer of Paris Saint-Germain in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jean-Claude Blanc Directeur Général Délégué|url=http://www.psg.fr/fr/Article/003001/Article/55345/Jean-Claude-Blanc-Directeur-General-Delegue|date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after being named chairman he presented a five-year plan to take Paris Saint-German to the top of the tree in France and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PSG: 'We want the new Messi'|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/psg-we-want-the-new-messi.htm|work =[[Ligue 1]]|date=1 July 2011|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the long term plan for the club, Al-Khelaïfi brought in legendary footballer [[Leonardo Araújo|Leonardo]] as the new director of football.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.psg.fr/fr/Club/609001/Presidents PSG.FR : Liste des présidents] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Al-Khelaïfi had initially demanded a major trophy haul for the 2011-2012 season, PSG were soon eliminated from the [[Europa League]] and both domestic cups, leaving the team only able to compete $130&amp;nbsp;million on players, PSG failed to dominate, and lost out to eventual winners [[Montpellier HSC]], though they did qualify for the UEFA Champions League by finishing second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PS aiming to bounce back after French Club failure|url=http://www.supersport.com/football/france/news/140414/PSG_aim_to_bounce_back}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2012-13 Paris Saint-Germain F.C. Season|2012-13 season]], PSG won the [[2012-13 Ligue 1|Ligue 1 title]] and also made it to the [[2012-13 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League]], thanks partly to the goalscoring of newly signed striker, [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]]. They eventually lost in a two-legged tie to [[FC Barcelona]] on away goals.

In the [[2013–14 Paris Saint-Germain F.C. season|2013–14 season]] PSG again finished top of [[2013-14 Ligue 1|Ligue 1]] with a record total of 89 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/psg-foot-paris-saint-germain/les-records-du-psg-cette-saison-19-05-2014-3854175.php#xtref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2F|title=Les records du PSG cette saison|date=19 May 2014|work=leparisien.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reached the [[2013-14 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League]] where they lost to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 3-3 on aggregate, again going out only on the away goals rule.

In June 2012, QSi acquired the Paris Handball Club and merged it with the PSG sport franchise to create a wider and more competitive sport offer to the city of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutes.fr/sport/946487-20120604-apres-psg-qatar-sport-investments-devient-proprietaire-paris-handball|title=Après le PSG, Qatar Sport Investments devient propriétaire du Paris Handball|work=20minutes.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tennis==
As a tennis professional, Al-Khelaïfi was the second most successful member of the [[Qatar Davis Cup team]] after [[Sultan Khalfan]], playing 43 ties between 1992 and 2002 and compiling a 12&amp;ndash;31 record in singles, 12&amp;ndash;16 in doubles. Al-Khelaïfi appeared twice on the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) main tour, losing each time in his first round matches in [[Hypo Group Tennis International|St. Pölten]] in 1996 (where he lost to former French Open Champion [[Thomas Muster]]) and in [[Qatar Open (tennis)|Doha]] in 2001. He reached a career-high singles ranking of No. 995 in late 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=atpworldtour.com|publisher=ATP Tour, Inc.|title=atpworldtour.com Profile|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Al/N/Nasser-Ghanim-Al-Khulaifi.aspx|accessdate=1 December 2011}} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=itftennis.com|publisher=ITF Licensing (UK) Ltd.|title=itftennis.com Men's Circuit record|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=10006160|accessdate=1 December 2011}} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser Al-Khelaïfi has been president of the Qatar Tennis Federation since November 2008. In 2011, he was elected vice-president of the [[Asian Tennis Federation]] for West Asia. Nasser Al-Khelaïfi is a former Davis Cup player and member of the Qatar National Tennis Team with which he won the GCC Team Tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qatartennis.org/sections/index/14/board-of-directors.html|title=Qatar Tennis Federation - QTF - Qatar Tennis Tournaments and Championships|work=qatartennis.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government of Qatar==
In November 2013, Nasser Al-Khelaïfi was made Minister without Portfolio in the Qatari government by the emir of Qatar, [[Sheikh Tamim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football365.fr/etranger/autres-championnats/nasser-al-khelaifi-nomme-ministre-au-qatar-1082524.shtml|title=Nasser Al-Khelaïfi nommé ministre au Qatar|publisher=www.football365.fr|language=French|date=2 December 2013|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Al-Khelaïfi was born in [[Doha]], and graduated from [[Qatar University]]. He is close to the Emir, Sheikh Tamim, head of sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority.

It has long seemed to me that there is an unfortunate gulf between the commercial lawyer and the property and equity lawyer.

But in the world of business, problems do not divide themselves into neat packages. ...

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to commercial law:

'''[[Commercial law]]''' &amp;ndash; body of [[law]] that governs [[business]] and [[commerce|commercial]] transactions. It is often considered to be a branch of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and deals with issues of both [[private law]] and [[public law]]. It is also called '''business law'''.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is commercial law? ==

Commercial law can be described as all of the following:

* Branch of [[law]] &amp;ndash; law is a [[system]] of rules and guidelines which are enforced through [[social]] [[institution]]s to govern behavior, wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes against humanity'', 90; see "[[analytical jurisprudence]]" for extensive debate on what law is; in ''[[The Concept of Law]]'' Hart argued law is a "system of rules" (Campbell, ''The Contribution of Legal Studies'', 184); Austin said law was "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction" (Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]); Dworkin describes law as an "interpretive concept" to achieve [[justice]] (Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410); and Raz argues law is an "authority" to mediate people's interests (Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 3–36).&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the chief financial backers of President [[Thomas Boni Yayi]], financing his campaigns for the [[Beninese presidential election, 2006|2006]] and [[Beninese presidential election, 2011|2011 elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20160308-benin-second-round-presidential-election-zinsou-talon "Benin heading for presidential run-off vote"], France 24, 8 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; His company, Benin Control acquired two nationally owned enterprises, Sodeco in 2009 and PVI in 2011.

He was subsequently pardoned in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rfi.fr/africa/20140515-benin-president-pardons-poison-plot-businessman-who-fled-france "Benin president pardons 'poison-plot' businessman who fled to France"], Radio France Internationale, 15 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, US magazine ''Forbes'' listed him as the 15th richest person in sub-Saharan Africa with wealth valued at approximately US$400 million.

==President==
Talon ran as an independent candidate in the [[Beninese presidential election, 2016|March 2016 presidential election]]. Although he finished second to Prime Minister [[Lionel Zinsou]] of the [[Cowry Forces for an Emerging Benin]] in the first round of voting, he won the second round with 65% of the vote. His opponent, outgoing Prime Minister Lionel Zinsou recognized his defeat the night of the election. Speaking on 25 March 2016, Talon said that he would "first and foremost tackle constitutional reform", discussing his plan to limit presidents to a single term of five years in order to combat "complacency". He also said that he planned to slash the size of the government from 28 to 16 members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-benin-election-idUSKCN0WS08X "Newly-elected Benin president aims to reduce presidential terms"], Reuters, 26 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no [[List of heads of government of Benin|prime minister]], and two defeated presidential candidates who had backed Talon in the second round, [[Pascal Koupaki]] and [[Abdoulaye Bio-Tchane]], were appointed to key posts; Koupaki as Secretary-General of the Presidency and Bio-Tchane as Minister of State for Planning and Development.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Duhem, [http://www.jeuneafrique.com/316256/politique/benin-patrice-talon-nomme-gouvernement-premier-ministre/ "Bénin : Patrice Talon nomme un gouvernement sans Premier ministre"], ''Jeune Afrique'', 6 April 2016 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Talon pledged to increase the fortunes of Benin in five years and improve its relationship with France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patrice Talon pledges to 'miraculously' change Benin in 5 years|url=http://www.africanews.com/2016/04/26/patrice-talon-pledges-to-turn-benin-around-in-5-years/|accessdate=September 29, 2016|publisher=Africanews|date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his policy goals are reducing the power of the executive and reducing presidents to single terms of five years, an unheard of suggestion in Africa.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;

On 4 April 2017, the [[National Assembly (Benin)|National Assembly]] failed to pass a bill that would have led to a referendum on Talon's proposal to limit presidents to a single six-year term. 63 votes in the 83-member National Assembly were required for passage, and the bill fell just short, with 60 votes.&lt;ref&gt;Allegresse Sasse, [https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1770OV-OZATP "Benin parliament rejects bill aiming to reduce presidential terms"], Reuters, 5 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Talon said a few days later that he would not pursue the matter any further.&lt;ref&gt;[https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN17B0GX-OZATP "Benin president abandons plan to reduce number of presidential terms"], Reuters, 9 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JA&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/424817/politique/benin-patrice-talon-renonce-a-reforme-de-constitution/ "Bénin : Patrice Talon renonce à la réforme de la Constitution"], ''Jeune Afrique'', 10 April 2017 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he was saddened by the outcome of the vote but that he respected it because of his commitment to democracy. He declined to say whether, in light of the failure of his single-term proposal, he would stand for re-election in 2021.&lt;ref name=JA/&gt;

{{Property law}}
'''Practicing without a license''' is the act of working without the [[licensure]] offered for that occupation, in a particular [[jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name="Springhouse"&gt;Springhouse Corporation. (2004) ''Nurse's legal handbook.'' Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, {{ISBN|9781582552804}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most activities that require licensure also have penalties for practicing without a valid, current license.&lt;ref name="Galaty"&gt;Galaty, Fillmore W. et al. (2001) ''Modern Real Estate Practice in Illinois.'' Dearborn Trade Publishing, {{ISBN|9780793142576}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, a license is offered but not required for some professions.&lt;ref name="unlicensed-practitioner.com"&gt;[http://unlicensed-practitioner.com/69/ "Practicing Your Profession In Oregon Without a License, Legally and Ethically"] Oregon Unlicensed Practitioners, December 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

Fields where practicing without a license may carry civil or criminal penalties include [[lawyer]], [[physician]], [[physician assistant]], [[optometrist]], [[podiatry|podiatrist]], [[surgeon]], [[coroner]], [[medical examiner]], [[paramedic]], [[funeral director]], [[osteopath]], [[chiropractor]], [[dentist]], [[pharmacist]], [[engineer]], [[Aviator|pilot]], [[broadcasting]], [[nurse]], [[veterinarian]], [[midwife]], [[teacher]], [[psychologist]], [[surveying|surveyor]], [[detective]], [[social worker]], [[architect]], [[barber]], [[hairdresser]], [[electrologist]], [[tattooist]], [[cosmetologist]], [[real estate agent]], [[plumber]], [[florist]], [[accountant]], and [[masseuse]]. If a person offering their services is licensed in one of these professions, any member of the public has a right to know if that person is validly licensed or not by the licensing authority. Anyone who claims to have a license and refuses to identify themselves properly by first and last name can possibly lose any one or all of their licenses. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal for service providers to hide their identities for purposes of making it difficult to verify licensure and past disciplinary actions or license violations.

License requirements vary widely with jurisdiction, sometimes even within a single country. Practicing a professional discipline without a license may be legal in some jurisdictions. For example, nine U.S. states have passed  [[health freedom movement|health freedom laws]] that protect alternative practitioners such as herbalists from prosecution for "practicing medicine without a license."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalhealthfreedom.org/InfoCenter/laws_passed.html "Health Freedom Laws Passed"] National Health Freedom Coalition, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of mental health, Oregon offers broad licensing exemptions for [[licensed professional counselor|professional counselors]] and [[Relationship counseling|marriage and family therapists]], allowing people to practice these professions either with or without a license.&lt;ref name="unlicensed-practitioner.com"/&gt; Colorado requires registration but not licensing for [[psychotherapy|psychotherapists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradopsychotherapists.com/page-1435658? "An Historical Overview of CAPS Legislative Activities"] Colorado Association of Psychotherapists, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Other states also have exemptions or registration requirements instead of, or in addition to licensing for some professions.

===Other unlicensed activity===

Other occupations, such as operating a business or working as a [[professional driver]] or [[mariner]], may require specialized licensure as well. Operating a business without proper licenses can result in financial and sometimes criminal penalties. These licenses can include a general [[business license]], a [[liquor license]], a specialized [[drivers license]], and other types regulated by local, regional, state, or federal requirements. Certain occupations may require obtaining appropriate [[intellectual property]] licenses, such as [[music licensing]], [[brand licensing]], [[patent licensing]], [[software licensing]], and other permissions for use.

Non-professional activities may also require licenses for participation. These include [[driver's license]], [[amateur radio license]], [[dog license]], [[firearms license]], [[hunting license]], [[marriage license]], [[pilot license]]. Using certain products or services may also require obtaining a license, such as a [[software license]]. Operating without these licenses can lead to civil and criminal penalties.

Penalties vary depending on the severity of the infraction, but practicing without a valid, current license may be punishable by one or more methods, including [[community service]], [[fine (penalty)|fine]], [[restitution]], [[probation]] and temporary or permanent loss of the license. Criminal charges can lead to [[incarceration]], as they can range from a [[misdemeanor]] to a [[felony]], depending on the severity of the infraction.&lt;ref name="Circo"&gt;Circo, Carl J. [ed.] (2009) ''A State-by-state Guide to Construction &amp; Design Law: Current Statutes and Practices.'' [[American Bar Association]], {{ISBN|9781604425543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noted incidents==
On July 6, 1885, [[Louis Pasteur]], a [[chemist]] who was a pioneer in [[microbiology]], treated [[Joseph Meister]] after the boy was mauled by a dog infected with [[rabies]] with a vaccination treatment that had thus far only been tested on animals. This was technically illegal considering Pasteur was not a licensed [[physician]], but he and his colleagues agreed that it was necessary considering his treatment seemed the only way to save the boy from a likely death. the treatment was successful, Pasteur was feted as a hero, and charges were never filed.&lt;ref name="murphy2004"&gt;Murphy, Timothy F. (2004) ''Case Studies Biomedical Research Ethics.'' MIT Press, {{ISBN|9780262632867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another more modern example is the case of [[Frank Abagnale]], who was accused of impersonating an airline pilot, lawyer, and [[teaching assistant]].

The "yogurt defense" was made famous by the trial of Carol Downer, one of the developers of [[menstrual extraction]]. She was arrested at her self-help group and charged with practicing medicine without a license, as she inserted yogurt into the vagina of another woman to treat a yeast condition.  Carol Downer was acquitted; the jury did not equate inserting yogurt with practicing medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Ruzek, Sheryl Burt. (1978) "The Women's Health Movement Feminist Alternatives to Medical Control," New York: Praeger Publishers. p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

[[Black Jack (manga)|Black Jack]] is a Japanese comic book series created by [[Tezuka Osamu]] that is about the world's greatest surgeon, who chooses to remain unlicensed. This allows Black Jack to charge extortionate amounts of money instead of the standard fees agreed upon by the [[Japanese Medical Association]]. It also lets him perform extremely dangerous, often medically implausible or impossible operations, that are not legally allowed. Black Jack is often viewed as the Japanese equivalent to [[Batman]], in his willingness to routinely break laws to save lives for which he is frequently imprisoned by the police. It is notable that Black Jack actually completed his college medical education and carries a driver's license, though he encourages other unlicensed doctors who have no such formal training. Like many of Osamu's works, Black Jack is extraordinarily critical of the medical establishment, and is notable for raising Japanese public awareness of medical corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osamu Tezuka: Father of manga and scourge of the medical establishment|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/jul/21/medical-manga-osamu-tezuka|author=Cian O'Luanaigh|year=2010|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of [[superhero]]es in comic books investigate crimes without detectives' licenses. In [[Detective Comics]], [[Question (comics)|The Question]], [[Dick Grayson]], [[Detective Chimp]] [[John Constantine]] and John Jones/[[Martian Manhunter]] are all licensed detectives or police officers, while [[Wally West]], the third [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] is a professional crime scene investigator. [[Jonah Hex]] is a bounty hunter operating under the loose legal framework of the wild west. The [[Green Lantern]] Corps patrol the D.C. universe and enforce the ancient intergalactic laws of the guardians of Oa. In [[Marvel Comics]], [[Frank Castle]] used to be a policeman, but after his wife and child were shot to death, he left the force forever and became the mass murdering vigilante [[The Punisher]].

Batman is one of only three members of the Justice League with any medical training but is the only one who lacks an official doctorate and license to practice medicine. Nevertheless, he occasionally performs surgery on his teammates despite being the son of the doctor [[Thomas Wayne]]. In Marvel Comics, the former neurosurgeon Stephen Strange, in desperate search of a cure for his crippled hands, wasted all of his money on alternative medicine, which did not heal him. Homeless, [[Doctor Strange]] performed back alley surgeries for cash, barely able to hold the instruments.

[[Victor Frankenstein]], though often incorrectly referred to as a doctor, is only a medical student, and as such operated on his monster without a license. Prior to the monster's vivification, Frankenstein and his assistant Igor were also acting as unlicensed morticians.

The movie [[Patch Adams (film)|Patch Adams]], among other historical inaccuracies, showed the title character practicing medicine without a license, and getting his equipment by stealing from a hospital.

The [[USA Network]] drama ''[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]]''' protagonist, Michael "Mike" Ross, gets a high-flying job at the fictitious Pearson Hardman law firm without having the necessary license to practice law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2081">'''Sectoral output''' for an industry or combination of industries ("sector") is the value of the sector's [[gross output]] minus the value of shipments within the sector from one establishment to another. 
Value here is measured for a specified time period and usually in units of nominal money.  It may be converted to constant units by multiplying by a [[price index]] to adjust for changes in prices over time and changes in quality of the goods and services produced.
A sectoral output measure is conceptually different from measures of [[gross output]] or [[value added|value-added output]].  Gross output for the sector consists of sales, or receipts, and other operating income, plus commodity taxes and changes in inventories.  Value-added measures exclude the value of intermediate inputs such as material, energy, and services, whether from the same industry or others. Thus gross output is larger than sectoral output which is larger than value-added output.
Sectoral output is the measure of output used in "KLEMS" [[multifactor productivity|multifactor measures of productivity]], which attempt to account for all direct inputs to production: capital services (K), labor services (L), energy (E), materials purchased (M), and services purchased (S)
When calculating [[labor productivity]], a value-added measure of output should be used to avoid counting other inputs (like purchased materials) as if they were created by the labor and capital applied within the sector.
The definition of the sectoral output has been attributed to Frank M. Gollop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.bls.gov/mfp/mprgul95.pdf Gullickson, William. Measurement of productivity growth in U.S. manufacturing]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shahram Jazayeri''' ({{lang-fa|شهرام جزایری}}) is Iranian [[entrepreneur]] and [[businessman]] who was involved in a high-profile [[corruption]] case.

Jazayeri was taken into custody in 2001, at the age of 24, for a long-list of criminal activities involving bribery, illegal exports, forgery and massive embezzlement of state money and assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2789/html/national.htm Iran Daily - National - 02/24/07&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911090033/http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2789/html/national.htm |date=2007-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, as a student in Tehran, his personal wealth was approximately $264,000. The cases of Jazayeri raised questions about the Iranian government's commitment to deal seriously with corruption. Jazayeri was convicted in 2002 in a major corruption case involving 50 defendants, many of them sons of prominent clerics. In September 2004, his 27-year prison sentence was partially overturned, and he was occasionally released from prison on leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2005/15-110405.htm|title=RFE/RL Iran Report|author=John Pike|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jazayeri paid huge amounts of money to the Iranian members of parliament. He confessed to paying about $15,600,000 to [[Hadi Khamenei]], the Iran [[Supreme leader of Iran|Supreme leader]]’s [[Iranian reformists|reformist]] brother, and about $5,800,000 to [[Mehdi Karroubi]], former [[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]] speaker without requesting anything in return.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraneconomist.com/|title=اخبار اقتصادی - ایران اکونومیست|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reportedly arrested after he sent a check worth $35,000,000 to the office of [[Supreme Leader of Iran]].

On 21 February 2007, Iran's Special Judicial Complex for economic affairs declared that Shahram Jazayeri has escaped, while being transferred to a court-assigned financial expert committee. There was suspicion of governmental involvement in his escape as it was assumed unlikely to escape from such prisons without assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-234/0702219579165308.htm Special Judicial Complex declares Jazayeri's escape - Irna&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001002559/http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-234/0702219579165308.htm |date=2007-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hossein Shariatmadari]] of ''[[Kayhan]]'' newspaper wrote an article supporting the theory that those clerics were trying to cover-up the case.&lt;ref name="ref"/&gt; Following the escape controversy, the head of [[Judicial system of Iran|Judiciary]], [[Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi]], fired a number of those responsible in the case, including the head of [[Evin prison]] and a few judges, and ordered an opening of a case in the military court for the judges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baztab.info/news/62011.php بركناری‌های گسترده در دستگاه قضايي به‌خاطر فرار شهرام&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928092436/http://baztab.info/news/62011.php |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 19, 2007 Iran's head of intelligence agency confirmed that Jazayeri was arrested in an unnamed location in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. His hiding location is said to be a remote village in [[Oman]] and handed over to Iranian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mehrnews.com/fa/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=462281|title=دستگیری شهرام جزایری در یک روستای کشور عمان / جزایری تحویل مقامات ایرانی شده است|date=18 March 2007|work=خبرگزاری مهر - اخبار ایران و جهان - Mehr News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, an Iranian newspaper reported that, unlike ordinary prisoners in Iran, Jazayeri had access to a [[laptop]] and two [[mobile phone]]s and is living in luxury in prison and continued his business works overseas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noandish.com/com.php?id=7461 ::Noandish::ستون "جهت اطلاع" روزنامه جمهوري اسلامي 5شنبه&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304071905/http://www.noandish.com/com.php?id=7461 |date=2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Jazayeri was sentenced to US$61,861,200 and 14 years of prison. In 2008 he was seen several times in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hayat.ir/?lang=fa&amp;page=showbody_news&amp;row_id=34317|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308144715/http://www.hayat.ir/?lang=fa&amp;page=showbody_news&amp;row_id=34317|title=::  خبرگزاری حیات  - 14 سال حبس برای شهرام جزایری عرب ::|archivedate=8 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 11 years, on October 11, 2014, Jazayeri was released from prison at the age of 42.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fa:شهرام جزایری]] Farsi Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/2014/10/141003_l03_jazayeri_release]

{{Japanese name|Murata}}
{{nihongo|'''Shōzō Murata'''|村田 省蔵|Murata Shōzō|extra=6 September 1878 – 15 March 1957}} was a Japanese entrepreneur, cabinet minister and diplomat before, during and after [[World War II]].

==Biography==
Murata was a native of [[Tokyo]] and a graduate of the Tokyo Higher Commerce School (now [[Hitotsubashi University]]). After graduation, he went to work with the ''Osaka Shosen Kaisha'' (currently [[Mitsui O.S.K. Lines]]), and transformed the relatively small company into a major [[shipping company]]. He was sent to the company’s branch in Shanghai in 1901 at the age of 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Duus | first = Peter | year = 2013 | title = The Japanese Informal Empire in China, 1895-1937| publisher = Princeton University Press | isbn = 1400847931 }} page 43&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually rose to the position of company president from 1934-1940.  In 1937, in response to increasing demands from the Japanese military for resources from the Japanese merchant fleet, Murata organized an {{nihongo|Autonomous Shipping Control Group|海運自治連盟|Kaiun Jichi Renmei}}, of which he served as chairman, to reduce competition and coordinate efforts between the seven largest shipping companies and the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chida | first = Tomohei | year = 2013 | title = The Japanese Shipping and Shipbuilding Industries: A History of their Modern Growth| publisher = Bloomsbury | isbn = 9781780939186}} page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Murata was appointed to the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]] in the [[Diet of Japan]]. Murata was representative of successful private entrepreneurs who were invited to join the ''[[Taisei Yokusankai]]'' political organization created by [[Fumimaro Konoe]] and his followers, and took active participation in debate on the [[state socialist]] [[controlled economy]] created under the [[National Mobilization Law]].

Murata was invited to become both [[Ministry of Communications (Japan)|Minister of Communications]] and [[Japanese Government Railway|Minister of Railways]] under the 3rd and 4th [[Fumimaro Konoe|Konoe administration]]s from 1940. In 1943, Murata became Japanese ambassador to the [[Second Philippine Republic]], and special advisor to the [[Japanese Fourteenth Area Army]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. As ambassador he brought a team of scholars from Japan to make a research report with recommendations  for the collaborationist government, told Present [[José P. Laurel|José Laurel]] that the Philippines had the right to make more demands upon the Japanese government; however, his report and efforts were ignored by the Japanese military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Friend | first = Theodore | year = 2014 | title = The Blue-Eyed Enemy: Japan Against the West in Java and Luzon, 1942-1945|publisher = Princeton University Press | isbn = 1400859468}} page 60, 67&lt;/ref&gt; He was recalled to Japan in 1945.

In 1946, along with all members of the wartime Japanese government, Murata [[Purge (During Occupation of Japan)|purged from public office]] and was taken into custody by the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|American occupation authorities]] and held at [[Sugamo Prison]], where he was to be charged for [[war crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27925201&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was released without ever being formally charged.

In 1951, Murata became a special advisor to the Foreign Ministry. He also appointed special ambassador to the Philippines in 1954, and worked towards normalization of relations and settlement of war-time compensation claims.  In the post-war period, Murata was president of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade (JAPIT),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bauchamp | first = Edward | year = 2013 | title = Japan's Role in International Politics Since World War II| publisher = Routledge | isbn = 9781780939186}} page 158&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other charity associations. He also worked towards the restoration of [[diplomatic relations]] between China and Japan, visiting Beijing in 1952, and meeting with [[Zhou Enlai]] in 1955 in China and signing a trade agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scalapino | first = Robert | year = 1977 | title = The Foreign Policy of Modern Japan| publisher = University of California Press | isbn = 0520034996 }} page 179&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Janez Andrej Herrlein - Žiga Zois.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Sigmund Zois by [[Janez Andrej Herrlein]]]]
'''Sigmund Zois Freiherr von Edelstein''', usually referred as '''Sigmund Zois''' ({{lang-sl|Žiga Zois}}, archaic ''Cojs'' or ''Cojz''; {{Audio|Sl-Žiga Zois.oga|pronunciation}}) (23 November 1747 – 10 November 1819) was a [[Carniola]]n [[nobleman]], [[natural scientist]] and [[patronage|patron of the arts]]. He is considered one of the most influential figures of the [[Enlightenment Era]] in the [[Slovene Lands]] of [[Habsburg]] [[Austria]].

==Family==
Sigmund's father Michelangelo Zois (1694–1777) was a merchant from [[Lombardy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zois plemeniti Edelstein, Michelangelo (1694–1777)|url=http://www.slovenska-biografija.si/oseba/sbi872267/|website=Slovenski biografski leksikon|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that moved to [[Ljubljana]], where he made a considerable fortune in dealing with iron and holding mines. His second marriage was to a [[Carniola]]n (Slovenian) noblewoman from the family Kappus (also Kapus) von Pichelstein; he was ennobled in 1739 and acquired the right to the title of [[baron]] in 1760. He owned large estates both in Carniola and on the [[Karst Plateau]], and Sigmund was born in [[Trieste]], in one of his father's mansions. 

The  Carniolan noble family Kappus von Pichelstein on Zois's  mother's side was a prosperous family that had lived at Kamna Gorica in Upper Carniola for centuries, where the family had owned an iron foundry and an iron mine since the late Middle Ages, perhaps since the 12th century. Marcus Antonius Kappus von Pichelstein (1657–1717) worked as a Jesuit missionary in Sonora (the border region between today’s United States and Mexico). From there he wrote letters to his friends in Vienna and to his relatives in Carniola. In these letters he described discoveries by research expeditions in Arizona and California and described the living conditions, the climate, and other details. Carolus Josephus Kappus von Pichelstein, a nephew of Marcus Antonius, was member of the Academia Operosorum, which was founded in Ljubljana in 1693 after the example of similar academies in Italy. Vladimir Kappus von Pichelstein (1885–1943), a Slovene writer and publisher, was also from the Kappus family.

==Education==
After attending several private schools, Sigmund Zois moved to Reggio in the duchy of [[Modena]] where he continued his education. He enjoyed traveling and making new acquaintances. However, his way of life was soon truncated by [[gout]], a disease with which he would be stricken the rest of his life. After returning to [[Ljubljana]] to assist in business, he studied natural sciences with [[Gabriel Gruber]] and [[Giuseppe Maffei]] and inherited his father's wealth in 1777. Leaving the management of his economic entities to his cousin, he developed a strong interest in sciences and started to meet with [[Belsazar Hacquet|Baltazar Hacquet]], who taught anatomy in Ljubljana from 1773 to 1787, and several [[Slovenes|Slovene]] intellectuals of the time.

==The Zois circle==
[[File:ZoisovaPalaca-LJubljana.JPG|250px|thumb|right|[[Zois Mansion]] in Ljubljana]]
In the early 1780s, [[Zois Mansion|his mansion]] in Ljubljana became a fostering center for [[Liberal arts|liberal]] intellectuals at the center of the Slovene [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]]. [[Jurij Japelj]] and [[Blaž Kumerdej]] (the two published the Bible in Slovene language), [[Anton Tomaž Linhart]], [[Valentin Vodnik]] (from 1793) and [[Jernej Kopitar]] (from 1803) were the most prominent members of what became known as the “Zois circle”. Zois was their patron, mentoring them and granting them necessary financial support for their cultural and scientific efforts, thus becoming the central figure of the Slovenian enlightenment. He was a [[deist]] and his views were rational and empirical. Nevertheless, he strongly opposed the [[French revolution]] and supported the moderate enlightened constitutionalism of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]].

In Ljubljana, Zois initiated and sponsored the construction of roads, the foundation of the botanical garden and a (German) theatre (whose main shareholder he became) and the enlargement of the lyceal library. His great commitment in sciences contrasted in neglecting the needs of the farmers on his estates, who waged surrection in 1783 and were oppressed by Zois' managers. Only after the French Revolution he ordered obligation towards his subjects, fearing for his properties.

In 1784, Zois was visited by the French geologist and mineralogist [[Déodat Gratet de Dolomieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-XYWN659P/?&amp;language=eng |title=Žiga Zois in Déodat de Dolomieu |language=Slovenian, English|first=Janez |last=Šumrada |issn=0023-4923 |journal=Kronika: časopis za slovensko krajevno zgodovino [The Chronicle: the Newspaper for the Slovenian History of Places] |publisher=Association of Slovenian Historical Societies, Section for the History of Places |volume=49 |issue=1/2 |year=2001 |pages=65–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1797 onwards, Sigmund Zois used a wheelchair and didn't leave his mansion in Ljubljana anymore.

The literary opus of Sigmund Zois, of modest quality and little influence, includes many literary forms and genres, ranging from arias for the opera to lyrics for folk music, although probably only a minor part of his work has been preserved. His translation of the poem ''[[Lenore (ballad)|Lenore]]'' by [[Gottfried August Burger]] was regarded as a complete failure, and Zois himself later came to the conclusion that the Slovene language was "too mediocre and rough" to allow for such a literary achievement. He would be disproven only some decades later by [[France Prešeren]] who managed to compose a complex and exceptional translation of the same poem. Zois is also regarded as a father of Slovene [[literary criticism]], and most of his literary reviews can be found in his correspondence with [[Valentin Vodnik]].

Zois, who was considered to have been the wealthiest Carniolan of his time, died in Ljubljana. His funeral was attended by a huge crowd; to these days, it has been considered one of the biggest funeral ceremonies ever held in the city, together with [[Anton Aškerc]]'s funeral in 1912, and [[Janez Evangelist Krek]]'s funeral in 1917.

==Scientific and collecting work==
Zois was particularly known as a [[mineralogy|mineralogist]] and [[geology|geologist]]. In 1795, he mounted two expeditions to explore the land around the [[Triglav]] mountain. In 1805, [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] described the mineral [[zoisite]] and named it after Zois, who sent him its specimens from [[Saualpe]] in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.si/books?id=J8wJAQAAIAAJ |first=Austin |last=Flint-Rogers |title=Introduction to the Study of Minerals |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |year=1937 |page=478}}&lt;/ref&gt; His collection of minerals (around 5,000 items) is kept at the [[Natural History Museum of Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.pms-lj.si/staff/mineralogy/zois.html |title=Zois Mineral Collection |publisher=National History Museum of Slovenia |accessdate=2 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418130906/http://www2.pms-lj.si/staff/mineralogy/zois.html |archivedate=18 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also involved in [[botany]] and [[zoology]].&lt;ref name="SBL"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://nl.ijs.si/fedora/get/sbl:4790/VIEW/ |title=Zois Žiga pl. Edelstein |encyclopedia=Slovenski biografski leksikon [Slovene Biographical Lexicon] |editors=Vide Ogrin, Petra (electronic ed.). Cankar, Izidor et al. (printed ed.) |year=1925–1991 (printed ed.). 2009 (electronic ed.) |language=Slovenian|last=Gspan-Prašelj |first=Nada |isbn=978-961-268-001-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[ornithology|ornithological]] writings, particularly ''[[Nomenclatura carniolica]]'', contain the first records of Slovene names of the majority of the birds living in Carniola and were the foundation for the Slovene ornithological nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-4M3UJW31/? |title=Nomenclatura carniolica barona Žige Zoisa - ob 200. obletnici rokopisa |journal=Acrocephalus |language=Slovenian, English|trans-title=Nomenclatura carniolica of baron Sigmund Zois – On 200th Anniversary of the Manuscript |year=1999 |first=Jančar |last=Tomaž |volume=20 |issue=94/96 |publisher=Slovenian Society for the Protection and Study of Birds |pages=71–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the work of his brother, the botanist [[Karl von Zois|Karl Zois]], who, among other things, discovered the ''[[Campanula zoysii]]'', a previously unknown Carniolan flower. 

The highest national scientific award in Slovenia, as well as a state-founded [[scholarship]] for talented students, are named after him.

'''Stephen Birch''' (1872–1940) was the President of the [[Kennecott Copper Company]] and one of the most revered business men of his time. “Stephen Birch was one of the thousands who came north in 1898 seeking their fortunes. He found his high in the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska. Most sought wealth in gold; Birch found it in copper. Birch succeeded while others failed because he had assets that many prospectors lacked- a technical education, wealthy friends and remarkable tenacity.”&lt;ref name="Tower"&gt;Elizabeth A. Tower, ''Ghosts of Kennecott: The Story of Stephen Birch'' (Anchorage: Roundtree, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Under his direction, the Kennecott Corporation became the largest copper producer in America and the second largest fabricator of copper.&lt;ref name="Tower"/&gt;{{rp|75}}
[[File:Stephen Birch mansion.jpg|thumb|The Birch Mansion now serves as an administration building at [[Ramapo College of New Jersey]]]]

== Early life ==
Birch was born in 1872 in [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was the second son out of six children. His father was a [[Union Army]] sergeant who died when Stephen was only ten years old. Three years after her husband’s death, Stephen’s mother moved her six children from [[Brooklyn]] to [[Mahwah, New Jersey]] to be near relatives.&lt;ref name="Tower"/&gt;{{rp|1}} The young Birches quickly became friends with the children of their neighbors, [[Theodore Havemeyer]], the vice-president of [[American Sugar Refining Company]], and his wife Lillie. “Mrs. Havemeyer took a special interest in young Stephen providing financial assistance for his education at Trinity School, [[New York University]], and [[Columbia School of Mines]].”&lt;ref name="Tower"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

== Career ==
“At the peak of the Klondike gold rush in 1898, Stephen announced that he wanted to go to [[Alaska]] rather than continue working with an engineering team that was surveying for the New York City [[subway system]].”&lt;ref name="Tower"/&gt;{{rp|3}} While many of his friends and relatives did not take him seriously, Mrs. Havemeyer offered to pay for his trip to Valdez, a newly established city named “the port for an All American route to Alaska’s interior.”&lt;ref name="Tower"/&gt; Because of Mrs. Havemeyer’s kind gesture, Birch was able to travel to Valdez in the summer of 1898. He quickly made a name for himself in the mining industry and found his wealth in copper up in the [[Wrangell Mountains]], the future site of [[Kennecott, Alaska]]. In Alaska, he examined a vastly rich copper deposit in the [[Copper River (Alaska)|Copper River]] region. “He bought 21 claims and consolidated them in 1903 as the Alaska Copper and Coal Company. Equipment and supplies had to be hauled in by boat and horse team to the remote site at the base of the [[Kennicott Glacier]].”&lt;ref name="HOF"&gt;National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum, "Mining Hall of Fame Inductees Database: Stephen Birch," [http://www.mininghalloffame.org/inductee.asp?i=89&amp;b=inductees.asp&amp;t=n&amp;p=B&amp;s=] (accessed November 5, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In need of proper resources, Birch formed an organization and sought out the help of [[Daniel Guggenheim]] and J.P Morgan. It became known as Kennecott Mining Company with offices in New York City and Birch as Managing Director.&lt;ref name="HOF"/&gt; In 1915 Birch had full power and became President of the reorganized Kennecott Copper Company. “As resources were depleted at the Alaska Mines, which closed in 1938, Birch led the diversification into related products and alternate sources of copper in [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Chile]].”&lt;ref name="HOF"/&gt; “Under his direction, Kennecott Copper experienced impressive growth. In 1915, the firm had 450 employees and $11 million in sales.” &lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School, "20th Century American Leaders Database," [http://www.hbs.edu/leadership/database/leaders/stephen_birch.html] (accessed November 5, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawley&gt;{{Cite book |author=Charles Caldwell Hawley |title=A Kennecott Story |publisher=The University of Utah Press |year=2014 |page=33-35,55-57,75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Birch resigned as President of the Kennecott Copper Company in 1933 and was replaced by E.T Stannard. “Birch continued as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee. In addition to his positions with Kennecott, Birch was president and director of the Alaska Steamship Company, chairman of the board of directors of the Braden Copper Company, and a director of the Alaska Development and Mineral Company, the Banker’s Trust company of New York, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company, the Colorado and Southern Railway Company and the Northern Pacific Railway Company.”&lt;ref name="Tower"/&gt;{{rp|75}}
  
“At his death, Kennecott held nearly 15 percent of the world’s known copper resources and was the largest copper producer in the United States.”&lt;ref name="HOF"/&gt; Also, in the year of his death, “the company employed 28,872 employees and had sales of $177,250,036.”&lt;ref name="Tower"/&gt;{{rp|75}}

Unfortunately Kennecott Copper Company’s original location in Alaska is now frequently referred to as a “ghost town” and is a tourist attraction. The buildings and mills are still standing but remain untouched, as the companies Alaska location closed down many years ago.

Birch is positively renowned for his successful business ventures and has received various honors such as being inducted into the Mining Hall of Fame and being named among the 20th Century American Leaders by [[Harvard Business School]].

== Personal life ==

Birch married Mary C. Rand in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] on June 24, 1916. His best man was longtime friend, [[Henry O. Havemeyer]].&lt;ref&gt;"Marriage Announcements," ''The New York Times'', June 24, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife had two children whom they named Stephen and Mary. The Havemeyers sold their mansion and 730 acres of their estate to Birch and the York Room was added to the mansion for his daughter Mary and her husband in the 1920s. He lived in the mansion with his family until he died at age 68 in 1940. “Birch is buried at Ferncliff Mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York. A stained glass window depicting Alaskan mountain scenery adorns this mausoleum.”&lt;ref name="Tower"/&gt;{{rp|75}}
  
After his death, his estate went to his son, Stephen. Stephen died in 1970 at the same time that the founders of [[Ramapo College]] were searching for land to build the school on. After visiting the land, it was decided that the Birch estate would be the new home to [[Ramapo College]]. “The final settlement on all of the Birch property was not concluded until 1972 for $3,133,000 or a little over $10,000 an acre.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Bischoff, ''A History of [[Ramapo College]] of New Jersey: The First Quarter Century- 1971-1996'' (Mahwah: Ramapo College of New Jersey,1997),22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Birch mansion is now used as an administration building at [[Ramapo College of New Jersey]]. 

Birch was said to be a very private man. During his lifetime, he avoided publicity and seldom gave interviews or had his picture taken, though he did have his portrait painted in 1911 by the Swiss-born American artist [[Adolfo Müller-Ury]]. But while he may have been mysterious, it is undeniable that he was admired. Katherine Wilson wrote for Copper Tints magazine that “Stephen Birch is personally little known. Today one of the financial powers in New York City, he shuns publicity and evades acclaim as a captain of industry. But to those who know him he is a man of deep and broad humanity, inspired in all that he does by a keen sense of his responsibility to the national welfare. With his intimates, he is a finely perceptive and generous friend, of an unshakable loyalty. Stephen Birch is an outstanding American.”&lt;ref name="Tower"/&gt;{{rp|77–78}}

== Philanthropy ==
“In 1938 he founded the Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation, Inc. to support health service, hospitals and civic organizations.  It provided major funding for the Stephen [[Birch Aquarium|Birch Aquarium-Museum]] at the [[University of California]], San Diego.”&lt;ref name="HOF"/&gt; Even though 2010 marks the 70th anniversary of his death, his legacy still lives on through this foundation, which recently “made a $10 million contribution to Sharp HealthCare Foundation for Transforming Health Care in San Diego: the Campaign for Sharp Healthcare, the capital campaign launched in 2003 to raise funds for a new health care facility at [[Sharp Memorial Hospital]]. In recognition of this generous gift, Sharp will name the new facility the Stephen Birch Healthcare Center at Sharp Memorial Hospital. The Birch contribution is the largest in Sharp’s history and brings the total that the Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation has donated to Sharp to more than $16 million.”&lt;ref&gt;"Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation Donates $10 Million to Sharp Healthcare Foundation," [http://www.sharp.com/news/press-releases/mary-birch-foundation-donation.cfm] (accessed November 5th, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Such suits frequently appear where the [[defendant]] is a considerably larger entity than the [[plaintiff]], such as a corporation or an estate.

==Strike suits in Securities Law==
Company shareholders sometimes use strike suits as a means of addressing perceived failures by or discontentment with the company while avoiding becoming embroiled in litigation themselves.

*A minor shareholder sues a company for falling short on projected earnings.  The lawsuit makes multiple technical claims of incompetence by the company.
*A minor shareholder sues a company for failure to follow bylaws set by the company.  The lawsuit makes multiple technical claims of bylaw infractions by the company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6884">The '''Systemic Risk Council''' was formed in 2012 by [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] and [[CFA Institute]] to help ensure the effective implementation of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] and related measures related to mitigating [[systemic risk]].

==Charter==
''“This new council is composed of experts with a thorough understanding of the issues, and we are pleased to support their efforts to find nonpartisan and independent recommendations. The reforms to our nation’s financial system enacted by Congress and signed by the president in 2010 were an important first step. The task now is to implement these reforms, especially those related to systemic risk.”'' '''Rebecca W. Rimel, president and CEO of The Pew Charitable Trusts'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rimel|first=Rebecca|title=Press Release|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=85899396370|work=Press Release|accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''“Despite the magnitude of the financial crisis, prospects for major reform of regulatory systems are inadequate and vague ”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=John|title=Web Site Article|url=http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/marketintegrity/2012/06/06/cfa-institute-co-sponsors-systemic-risk-council-led-by-former-bank-regulator-sheila-bair/|work=CFA Institute|accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''John D. Rogers, president of the CFA Institute''' 
*''“The great challenge is to devise a system to identify risks that threaten market stability before they become a danger to the general public. As evidenced by the 2008 crisis and even recent headlines, we need a more effective and efficient early-warning system to detect issues that jeopardize the functioning of U.S. financial markets before they disrupt credit flows to the real economy. And two of the most critical tasks are how to impose greater market discipline on excess risk taking and effectively end the doctrine [[too-big-to-fail]].”'' '''[[Sheila Bair]], chair of the Systemic Risk Council.''' 
* *''“nothing has been finalized. [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] is M.I.A. [[Office of Financial Research]] is barely functional. The [[Volcker Rule]] is mired in controversy. [[Securitization]] reform is stalled. They haven’t even proposed new bank capital rules. The public is becoming cynical about whether the regulators can do anything right, which is undermining support for reforms.”'' '''[[Sheila Bair]], chair of the Systemic Risk Council.''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Group Forms to Urge Strict Oversight of Wall Street|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/business/new-systemic-risk-council-to-press-for-stricter-financial-regulations.html?_r=2|newspaper=NYT|date=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plans==
The council issued a call to action on June 18, 2012 at The Pew Charitable Trusts in Washington, D.C., detailing the objectives and future plans for the Systemic Risk Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Systemic Risk Council is a 'Strong, Independent Voice' to Help Implement Financial Reforms |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/analysis/2012/06/18/systemic-risk-council-is-a-strong-independent-voice-to-help-implement-financial-reforms |work=The Pew Charitable Trusts |accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Our overriding concern stems from the lack of progress made by the members of the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] (FSOC) and the [[Office of Financial Research]] (OFR) to address several critical issues as mandated by the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] (Dodd-Frank), enacted in 2010. That concern increases each day that the implementation of systemic risk reform languishes. A sense of complacency has made reforms for effective oversight seem less urgent despite escalating problems elsewhere in the global financial system. In many ways, the financial system faces larger potential challenges today than it did in the run-up to the 2008 crisis, given the troubled state of the [[European Union]] and uncertainties at home related to fiscal and monetary policy.  It is essential that the FSOC show leadership in coordinating the rule-writing process to promote the development of cohesive, consistent regulations and provide clear and transparent explanations of the reforms in a way that is understandable to the general public. We have created this Council to assist in that effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Systemic Risk Council: A Call to Action |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2012/06/18/src_call_to_action_061812.pdf |work=Systemic Risk Council |format=PDF |accessdate= 11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cityscape ===
[[File:Sjregions.GIF|right|350px]]
The municipality comprises three districts: São José dos Campos&amp;nbsp;— the city itself, (also the seat), [[Eugênio de Melo]] and [[São Francisco Xavier]]. The last one is known for its natural sites and [[ecotourism]].

The district of São José dos Campos is also subdivided into 2 subdistricts (São José dos Campos and Santana do Paraíba).

However, for administrative purposes, the city is composed of 7 urban regions: Center, North, South, West, East, Southeast and São Francisco Xavier.

=== Topography ===
[[Highland (geography)|Highlands]] predominate in the northern region of the municipality with altitudes ranging from {{convert|660|to|975|m|abbr=on}}. The northern border of the municipality lies over the Serra da Mantiqueira Mountains (''Mantiqueira Range''), with some peaks reaching over 2000 meters (6500&amp;nbsp;ft.). The highest point in the municipality is known as 'Pico do Selado' at an altitude of 2082 meters.

In the [[urban area]], there are rolling [[plateaus]] and [[hills]].
The lowest elevation in the city (and also in the municipality) is found in the ''Paraíba do Sul'' river, at an elevation of 550 m.

The municipality is bounded at the south by the 'Serra do Jambeiro' mountains, with an elevation of about 900m.

* Municipality: Elevations {{convert|550|to|2082|m|abbr=on}}

The climate of the city can be, perhaps, best described as a mix between the subtropical climate of southern parts of the [[Climate of Brazil|country]], the tropical climate of most of the country and the [[subtropical highland]] climate (in Portuguese: clima tropical de altitude) of neighbouring mountainous regions.

Technically, the city has a [[humid subtropical climate]] with significant less precipitation during winters (transitioning between ''Cfa'' and ''Cwa'' climatic types in the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/brag/v66n4/22.pdf |title=Climatic classification in São Paulo State |publisher=Instituto Agronômico de Campinas |accessdate=September 11, 2016|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Winters are very mild, with average temperature in the coldest month of 17&amp;nbsp;°C. Summers are not excessively hot, with average temperature of the hotttest month of 24&amp;nbsp;°C. With [[global warming]] it is very likely that the city's climate will transition to a true tropical climate (type 'Aw' in the Köppen climate classification) in the near future.

Frosts are very rare, happening on average once per decade. There's no record of snow precipitation in the city.

The peaks at the northern border of the municipality (some over 2000 m high) due to altitude have a colder Cwb/Cfb climates, with very occasional snowfalls (about once per decade).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monteverdemg.com.br/vm-clima.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
The origins of São José dos Campos lie at the end of the 16th Century when Jesuits founded a cattle farm, ''Aldeia do Rio Comprido''. The farm was created through a concession of settlements around 1590 to the [[Society of Jesus]]. The farm was located on the banks of the Rio Comprido, natural division between São José and the city of [[Jacareí]] today.

The farm status was an artifice to hide a religious outpost, one of the several [[Jesuit Reductions]] in Brazil, known for their resistance to enslavement, from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] expedition leaders and indigenous people hunters, known as the [[Bandeirantes]].

On September 10, 1611, the local was officially recognized and the farmers precluded from utilizing the Natives as [[slaves]]. However, a [[turmeric]] conflict between farmers and the religious led to the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1640 from the region and the consequent dispersion of the mission.

Nevertheless, the Jesuits returned and reestablished a new settlement, where the current city center is spotted. It was about {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} northeast of the previous mission, on a higher plain with a privileged view above a geological depression, which guaranteed security against invasions and floods. Again, despite being a new mission, it was officially treated as a cattle farm.

The initial urbanization plan is attributed to the Jesuit priest [[Manoel de Leão]], whose main occupation was really to be an administrator of the community.

In 1692, documents named the village as ''Residência do Paraíba do Sul''; in 1696 as ''Residência de São José''.

At the beginning of the gold mining economic cycle in Brazil, the settlement goes through serious difficulties due to the exit of labor to the mines.

After the definitive [[Suppression of the Jesuits#Portugal|expulsion of Jesuits from the Portuguese Empire]] in 1759, all the religious order's assets, such as farms, colleges and villages were taken under the Portuguese Crown's custody. The governor, D. [[Luis Antonio Botelho Mourão]], had as a priority to turn these new assets into productive units and increase tax collection. For that, Boutelho Mourão successfully requested authorization from the [[Viceroy]] to create [[civil parishes]], known as ''[[freguesias]]'', and to change the fiscal status of villages to the category of Vila (town).

Then, on July 27, 1767, São José reached the official status of town, with a [[town hall|hall]] and a [[pillory]], passing over the status of civil parish; and the name '''Vila de São José do Paraíba''' was formalized. But for many years it maintained the same rural characteristics. The main difficulty was the fact that the ''Estrada Real'' (Royal Road) passed by its limits, far from the village.

=== Cotton and coffee ===
In the middle of the 19th century, the village of São José do Paraíba had demonstrated some signs of economic growth through the development of agriculture. Cotton production evolved rapidly in the region, exported to the English textile industry. The production reached a peak in 1864.

In the same year, on April 22, the town became the seat of a municipality, acquiring finally, in 1871, the current name of '''São José dos Campos''', followed by the creation of a [[judiciary district]]  in 1872. Almost simultaneously, there was development of coffee crops in [[Vale do Paraiba|Paraíba Valley]], which started to take off in 1870.

In 1886, after the opening of the [[Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil]] railway (1877), the coffee production peaked. Then started to decay, running steady until the 1930s.

=== Hydro-mineral retreat and industrialization ===
[[File:Inauguração_da_Fábrica_da_General_Motors_em_São_José_dos_Campos_(SP)_pelo_Presidente_Juscelino_Kubitschek.tif|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inaugura%C3%A7%C3%A3o_da_F%C3%A1brica_da_General_Motors_em_S%C3%A3o_Jos%C3%A9_dos_Campos_(SP)_pelo_Presidente_Juscelino_Kubitschek.tif|thumb|Inauguration of the General Motors Factory in São José dos Campos by President Juscelino Kubitschek, 1959.]]The call for the municipality of São José dos Campos for the treatment of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by [[sanatorium]]s became noticed at the

beginning of last century, due to its supposedly favorable climate conditions. The city became to be known as ''the Sanatorium City''. The country's then-largest hospital, the Vicentina Aranha Sanitarium, was opened in town in 1924, and in 1935 the municipality was officially recognized as a health retreat.

With the advent of [[antibiotics]] in the 1940s, tuberculosis begins to be treated anywhere, thus ending the healthcare advantage carried out by São José, whereas the establishment of industries was about just to start.

The industrialization process of the municipality takes hold from the installation of the ''[[Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica|Technological Institute of Aeronautics]] '' in 1950 and also with the opening of the Dutra Highway (BR-116), thus making possible a faster connection between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo and cutting into the urban area of São José dos Campos. Altogether, these factors allowed the municipality to make strides towards fulfilling its scientific and technological potential.

== Government ==
São José dos Campos has a "strong mayoral" system in which the mayor is vested with extensive executive powers, as it is in all municipalities in Brazil. The mayor is elected to a four-year term by universal voting. The City Council is elected every four years with the mayor. The current mayor is [[Felicio Ramuth]], from the political party [[Brazil's Social Democratic Party|PSDB]] and was elected in 2016.

=== The state administrative region of São José dos Campos ===
[[File:sjcvale.gif|right|250px]]
The [[State of São Paulo]] is divided politically and administratively into 15 regions. São José dos Campos is the seat and the name of the 3rd Administrative Region, which includes the North Coast of São Paulo state and the Paraíba Valley.

The region comprises 39 municipalities with sharp contrasts. São José dos Campos is a densely populated city, with approximately 2,100 inhabitants/square kilometers in urban area, whereas the quiet municipality of São José do Barreiro has only seven inhabitants/square kilometer. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} There are both highly industrialized cities and the others in the region are focused on agriculture and tourism. São José dos Campos is well known as the ''Capital do Vale'' which means that São José dos Campos is the most important city of the Paraíba Valley.

It is one of the state's most dynamic areas, the fourth one in terms of population density, and covers 11.3% of the state's territory.

{{wide image|São josé dos campos.jpg|1000px|São José dos Campos.}}

The city has two bus stations, having lines to cities in all regions of the country and international routes to [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Chile]].

São José dos Campos boasts an extensive bus system. Operated by three companies (Expresso Maringa, Julio Simões and Viação Capital do Vale), these lines serve nearly all areas in the city with 319 buses. São José dos Campos also has an alternative system with minivans to supplement the regular buses.

The city uses a [[ring road]] system, that interconnects it to important national and state highways:

*[[Brazilian Highway System|BR-116]] (federal highway), which crosses the urban area of São José. It runs in a north-south direction in the country, near but not on Brazil's coastline. The section that connects Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo is known as Presidente Dutra. It is widely used inside the urban area of São José dos Campos for commuting purposes;
*[[Rodovia Carvalho Pinto|SP-070]] (state highway) also known as Rodovia Carvalho Pinto which connects [[São Paulo]] to [[Taubaté]];
*[[Rodovia Dom Pedro I|SP-065]] Connects São Jose dos Campos to [[Campinas]]
*[[Rodovia dos Tamoios|SP-099]] (state highway) also known as Rodovia dos Tamoios which connects São José to the coastal lowlands of the city of [[Caraguatatuba]];
[[File:Tamoios.JPG|thumb|right|[[SP-099|Tamoios Highway]]]]
*[[SP-050]] (state highway) - the old road which connects São José dos Campos to [[Campos do Jordão]] and the southern region of [[Minas Gerais]].

The city is also served by a railway (the former [[Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil|Central do Brasil]]), administered by [[MRS Logística]], which today only carries freight.

The ports of [[São Sebastião, São Paulo|São Sebastião]] and [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]] can be reached by the highways SP-099, SP-155, and BR-101. The transportation of cargo to the domestic and foreign markets is made through both ports.
[[File:Aeroporto de são josé dos campos.jpg|thumb|right|[[São José dos Campos Airport]]]]
The [[São José dos Campos Airport]] ([[IATA]]: SJK, [[ICAO]]: SBSJ) has a heavy passenger flow, mainly business trips during weekdays, and it is an important connection between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. With a {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}} runway, the airport also serves people who come to visit the tourist city of Campos de Jordão. The airlines [[Azul Brazilian Airlines]] and [[TRIP Linhas Aéreas]] fly from São José dos Campos to several destinations and presently are the only commercial airlines operating on São José dos Campos.

It is also used for the transportation of cargo from the several industries located in the so-called Cone Leste Paulista ("São Paulo's East Cone"). [[Infraero]] and the Federal Revenue Agency are also introducing a new concept called airport-industry, that will offer fiscal incentives and fast importation and exportation procedures. The municipality has also a Customs Station for the Hinterland (dry port), controlled by the Federal Revenue Agency.

São José dos Campos receives [[natural gas]] from two gas [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], and large companies such as General Motors, Kodak, Monsanto and Embraer are among the main users. The city is the third largest in the country referring to the distribution net of natural gas for residential use. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

It has also a large network of [[fiber optics]], with [[broadband]] services covering 75% of the city. There is 1 telephone for each 3 inhabitants and a vast service network of cellular telephones. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In contrast to the rural town in 1950s, today São José is an important manufacturing center and holds a large array of industries. Over 1,251 industries are in the municipality and nearby 47,000 inhabitants work for industries. The three main industries are [[automotive]], [[Petroleum|oil]]/[[petrochemical]] and [[aerospace]]. There are significant [[pharmaceutical]], [[consumer durables]], [[chemical]], and [[telecommunication]] companies in the city.{{Specify|date=November 2014}}

It is also known as the "Brazilian aeronautics capital" because it is home of [[Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology|CTA]] and one of the biggest aircraft manufacturers in the world, [[Embraer]].

=== Service industry ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Since the 1990s, the local economy has been evolving in a different direction. The manufacturing economy has been downsized or replaced by [[tertiary sector of industry|tertiary]] and [[quaternary sector of industry|quaternary]] sectors of industries.

For instance, the Entrepreneurial District of Chacaras Reunidas concentrates companies of micro, small and medium size, which are mainly the result of downsizing from old large local industries. Yet even though most of these are industries, these companies provide service as well.

Two technological parks and five (one in project) [[business incubators]] have been created within universities or industrial facilities.

There are incubators with technological start-up companies installed at Univap and at Henrique Lage [[Oil refinery|Refinery]] of [[Petrobrás]]. The CTA houses other incubator, Incubaero, specialized in the aeronautical field.

Univap features a technological park with capacity for around 40 small to medium-sized innovating companies in the areas of [[Chemical substance|materials]], [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]], [[information technology]], [[aerospace]], [[energy]], [[Natural environment|environment]] control, [[biotechnology]], [[bioinformatics]], [[chemical engineering]], and [[software]] among others. A new technological park, managed by the municipality and the state government of São Paulo, will house two new [[think tanks]]: the Institute for Technological Research (IPT) and the ItecBio (Instituto de Tecnologias Biomédicas).

As a result of its geographical location, the city became an important distribution center, having several [[logistics]] providers. Activities like purchasing, transport, planning and warehousing have employed many people recently.

Commerce and real estate ventures have developed in the last years, reflecting the changes in the economy. For instance, the largest shopping mall in the region was an old manufacturing facility. Serving the region's population of approximately one million, the city is the regional hub for shopping and services for the [[Vale do Paraíba]], the northern coast of São Paulo and southern [[Minas Gerais]].

'''''The Choice''''' (2008) is a philosophy book, where the author [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] explains his way of thinking about reality and the consequences of thinking clearly.

The book is structured as a dialogue between the author and his daughter Efrat, where he attempts to explain clearly the way he thinks, and the obstacles that prevent people from thinking in the same fashion. Interspersed between the dialogues are short cases that demonstrate or further explore the points raised in the discussion.

The content of this book might be seen as explaining the basic principles upon which are based the [[Theory of Constraints|TOC]] [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]].

In the Revised Edition (2010) Efrat's own notes are included as she made during the conversation with her father, helping the reader determine the true essence of the book.
