The '''2009 Malagasy political crisis''' began on 26 January 2009 with the political opposition movement led by [[Antananarivo]] mayor [[Andry Rajoelina]], which sought to oust [[President of Madagascar|President]] [[Marc Ravalomanana]] from the presidency. The crisis reached its climax on 21 March 2009 when Andry Rajoelina was declared the president of the [[High Transitional Authority]] of Madagascar, five days after Ravalomanana transferred his power to a military council and fled to South Africa.

The international community immediately condemned the leader and his ascension as unconstitutional.  Financial support and foreign investments stopped, and the country fell into one of the worst economic crises in its history. The [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] and the [[African Union]] have been designated to supervise Madagascar's political reinstatement.

Though the objective of the transitional government was to run presidential elections as soon as possible to relieve the tensions (despite regular delays), its major challenge has been to establish an agreement among Madagascar's four key political factions (Rajoelina, Ravalomanana, [[Albert Zafy|Zafy]] and [[Didier Ratsiraka|Ratsiraka]]), some of which were and still are unfriendly to the transitional government. On 11 December 2010 a new constitution was formally approved, launching the Fourth Republic. On 28 October 2011 a consensus Prime Minister, [[Omer Beriziky]], was appointed. [[Malagasy general election, 2013|Presidential and parliamentary elections]] were scheduled for 8 May and 3 July 2013.

== Origins of the conflict ==
[[File:LocationMadagascar.svg|250px|thumb|Map of Madagascar in Africa]]
In December 2007, Andry Rajoelina was elected mayor of [[Antananarivo]]. Tensions quickly grew between president Ravalomanana and the young mayor over the course of 2008 as Rajoelina became a vocal critic of a series of unpopular policies enacted by the president.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; He condemned what he called the "restriction of freedom" on the island, and criticized the president's plans to lease large parts of land to the [[South Korea|Korean]] industrial company [[Daewoo]].&lt;ref name="first" /&gt;&lt;ref name="second" /&gt;

On 13 December 2008, the Ravalomanana administration decided to shutter Viva TV, a television channel belonging to Rajoelina&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; after broadcasting an interview with the former exiled president Didier Ratsiraka. Other television and radio stations that also aired the interview were not sanctioned.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt;

Andry Rajoelina organized a series of rallies in January 2009 that took aim at the Ravalomanana administration and gave voice to growing popular resentment toward the president's increasingly authoritarian policies and a widespread perception that national development had only benefitted an elite minority of which the president was the most visible figurehead.&lt;ref name="france24" /&gt; As anti-government frustration transformed into civil unrest, two state television stations were burned by anti-government protesters.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; At least 130 people were killed in Madagascar during the crisis.&lt;ref name="135killed" /&gt; The protests were seen as the gravest challenge faced by the Ravalomanana government since he came to office in 2002.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; President Ravalomanana vowed to restore order "whatever the cost", according to a government statement.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-2" /&gt;

== Protests ==
{{Politics of Madagascar}}
[[File:Madagascar-carte.png|thumb|left|160px|The protests took place in [[Antananarivo]], the capital and largest city in [[Madagascar]].]]
Rajoelina called a general strike during the weekend of 24–25 January 2009, in the capital city, [[Antananarivo]], against Ravalomanana, whom he has called a dictator.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt; Ravalomanana, who was in South Africa, cut short his trip to a regional summit in [[Pretoria]], and flew back to Madagascar.&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt; In a statement Ravalomanana accused the mayor of attempting a coup saying, "The call for [[revolt]] and [[civil disobedience]]... corresponds to a coup d'état...tramples on the values of the constitution and the republic's institutions."&lt;ref name="afp2" /&gt;

On 26 January 2009, the protests turned increasingly violent.&lt;ref name="france24" /&gt; Demonstrators set fire to the Madagascar state-owned radio building, attacked a private television station owned by Ravalomanana and looted shops and businesses throughout the city.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; That same day, armed government [[security agent]]s reportedly disabled the transmitter of Viva Radio, a private radio station owned by Rajoelina.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;

Protesters ransacked two pro-government television stations in Antananarivo. Thousands of protesters raided and looted the headquarters of the [[Radio Nationale Malgache]] and [[Télévision Nationale Malgache]] building around 1&amp;nbsp;pm local time on 26 January 2009.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; About an hour later demonstrators burned down the [[Malagasy Broadcasting System]], a private station owned by President Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; A policeman and a fourteen-year-old protester were reportedly killed in the clashes at the Malagasy Broadcasting System attacks.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;

Firefighters found the bodies of at least 25 people in the ruins of a burned out, looted [[department store]] in downtown Antananarivo.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="france24two" /&gt; The bodies were thought to be those of looters who became trapped in the burning shop when the roof caved in.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-4" /&gt; In total, 44 people died. Their bodies were taken to a morgue, and all but ten of them were found to be severely burned.

In a show of defiance against the government, Rajoelina called for all Antananarivo residents to stay home on 29 January 2009.&lt;ref name=france24/&gt; This "ghost town" (''ville morte'') protest basically closed all stores and businesses in the capital city.&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt;

The [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Roman Catholic Cardinal]] [[emeritus]] of Antananarivo [[Armand Razafindratandra]] appealed for calm as the protests spread outside of the capital.&lt;ref name="cna" /&gt; All state and private radio stations in the country reportedly ceased broadcasting, with the exception of [[Radio Don Bosco]], which is run by the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] [[religious institute]].&lt;ref name=cna/&gt;

Rajoelina said on 31 January that he was taking control of the country due to the failure of Ravalomanana and the government to fulfil their responsibilities.&lt;ref name="bbcnews2" /&gt; He said that a request for Ravalomanana's "immediate resignation" would be submitted to [[Parliament of Madagascar|Parliament]] "in order to comply with the legal procedure". Furthermore, he asked that the [[central bank]] withhold money from the government, that all government ministries close, and that the security forces join him. Rajoelina said that he wanted the constitution to be respected and that it was Ravalomanana who had violated the constitution. According to Rajoelina, a new [[transitional government]] would soon be appointed under his leadership and a new presidential election would be held within two years. Speaking on the same day, Ravalomanana stated that he was "still the president of this country" and that he would "do what is necessary to develop this nation".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-5" /&gt;

The [[African Union]] (AU) immediately warned Rajoelina that it would not accept an unconstitutional power grab in Madagascar: "It's totally forbidden to take power by non-constitutional means."&lt;ref name="reuters2" /&gt;

Opposition leaders allied to Rajoelina filed a petition with the High Constitutional Court on 2 February, asking it to remove Ravalomanana from office. By that point, attendance at Rajoelina's rallies had reportedly decreased.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-6" /&gt; On 3 February, Rajoelina said at a rally that he would announce his new government on 7 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-7" /&gt; On the same day, the High Constitutional Court ruled that it had no power to remove the President from office, as that power belonged to Parliament.&lt;ref name="Fired" /&gt; Also on 3 February, Rajoelina was dismissed as Mayor and a special delegation, headed by [[Guy Randrianarisoa]], was appointed instead. Rajoelina denounced the decision, saying that there was "no valid reason" for it and that he was prepared to face arrest if necessary; he warned that the city would "not accept this decision".&lt;ref name="Fired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-8" /&gt;

Rajoelina held another rally on 4 February, with about 1,500 people in attendance. On that occasion he described the appointment of Randrianarisoa as "an insult to the people of Madagascar"; he instead designated [[Michele Ratsivalaka]] to succeed him as Mayor and gave her his mayoral scarf.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-9" /&gt;

=== Shooting at opposition rally ===
On 7 February, an opposition rally was held with twenty-thousand in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-10" /&gt; The demonstrators marched towards [[Ambohitsorohitra Palace]] and crossed the "ligne rouge" (red line), the perimeter line around the palace gates that demarcates the zone off-limits to the public. The palace guards responded by firing live ammunition to disperse the crowd. Initial reports counted 83 wounded and 28 people killed, including a local reporter. Some looting was reported afterward.&lt;ref name="Three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-11" /&gt; Ambulances took the wounded to hospitals or private clinics, and bodies were seen piled up on the streets before they were taken to the morgue. The National Police warned that the death toll could rise, as many of the wounded were in critical condition. The following day it was reported that the death toll had increased to at least 50, with doctors estimating that 180 people had arrived at the city's main [[Ravoahangy Andrianavalona Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Madagascar protesters shot dead" /&gt; Antananarivo journalist [[Fanja Saholiarisoa]] said: "The mortuary is full and the hospital is full. On TV there is a special announcement calling on people who have cars to come and pick up the injured people from the hospitals".&lt;ref name="Madagascar protesters shot dead" /&gt; This brought the number of people killed since the start of the [[political violence]] to 130, with 80 people killed before the shooting of the demonstrators, including the people who died in the burned department store.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-12" /&gt;

Also on 7 February, Rajoelina said that [[Roindefo Monja]] would be prime minister under his transitional authority. According to Rajoelina, each of Madagascar's regions would have representation in the transitional authority. Regarding Ambohitsorohitra Palace, Rajoelina alluded to its history as a mayoral residence prior to 2002 and said that it "belongs to the people and to the city", while declaring that he had decided to give the palace to Monja for his use as prime minister. On the same day, Ravalomanana urged "calm and order", accusing Rajoelina of "cross[ing] all limits", while Prime Minister [[Charles Rabemananjara]] announced a one-week extension of the curfew.&lt;ref name=Three/&gt;

While visiting hospitalized victims of the shooting on 8 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue his struggle and argued that Ravalomanana's answer to the popular call for change was gunfire. He called for a national day of mourning on 9 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-13" /&gt;

On 9 February, Defence Minister [[Cécile Manorohanta]] announced her resignation, saying, "After all that has happened, I decide as of now to no longer remain part of this government."&lt;ref name="AutoRI-14" /&gt; Chief of military staff [[Mamy Ranaivoniarivo]] was appointed to replace Manorohanta on the same day.&lt;ref name="Defence" /&gt;

7 February shooting was thought to have reversed the opposition's declining momentum. Newspapers published on 9 February, strongly denounced the shooting.&lt;ref name=Defence/&gt; On 10 February, speaking before a rally of about 5,000 supporters, Rajoelina urged the people to observe a general strike on the next day; he asked that everyone stay indoors and that no one go to work or attend school. Roindefo announced the appointment of four ministers to serve in his transitional government, and he said that the remainder of them would be appointed by the end of the week. Meanwhile, both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina accepted dialogue in principle; Rajoelina said that dialogue would be conditional on the holding of a new presidential election or the formation of a transitional government.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-15" /&gt;

At a 35,000-strong rally in Antananarivo on 14 February, Ravalomanana said that he would serve out his full term as president, that he was listening to the people, and that he regretted the deaths that had occurred during the protests. On the same day, Rajoelina held a rally nearby, with about 10,000 in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-16" /&gt;

At a rally on 17 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue the struggle, and later in the day several thousand of his supporters engaged in [[sit-in]]s near key ministries. Representing the government, Defense Minister Ranaivoniarivo invited Roindefo to participate in talks.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-17" /&gt; Rajoelina's supporters took over several important ministries on 19 February, changing the locks and installing Rajoelina's own ministers to work in them. Meanwhile, Ravalomanana appointed a new Minister of the Interior, [[Rabenja Sehenoarisoa]] (who had previously served as chief of police in the capital). His predecessor as Interior Minister, [[Gervais Rakotonirina]], was said to have departed the government due to poor health.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-18" /&gt; Only hours after the opposition took over the government ministries, they were removed from the ministries by security forces early on 20 February; about 50 of Rajoelina's supporters were arrested.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-19" /&gt;

Ravalomanana and Rajoelina met on 21 February; this meeting, which lasted about 45 minutes, was organized by the [[Council of Christian Churches in Madagascar]]. Both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina agreed to five points intended to calm the situation. This was intended as a prelude to more comprehensive dialogue.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-20" /&gt; On 23 February the two met again for about an hour,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-21" /&gt; and they held a third meeting, also lasting an hour, on 24 February.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-22" /&gt; However, Ravalomanana failed to appear for a planned meeting on 25 February, and Rajoelina then announced that he was withdrawing from the talks. Rajoelina criticized Ravalomanana for his absence and furthermore stated that the meetings he had held with Ravalomanana prior to that were disappointing. [[Odon Razanakolona]], who had been mediating the talks, abandoned his role shortly before Rajoelina withdrew from the talks; according to Razanakolona, the talks were fruitless and deadlocked.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-23" /&gt;

=== Post-talks ===
A protest in Antananarivo was broken up by the security forces on 26 February. Another protest in [[Fianarantsoa]] on 27 February, was also broken up; two deaths and 13 serious injuries were reported in the latter incident.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-24" /&gt; At a 10,000-strong rally in Antananarivo on 28 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue his struggle "until we end this dictatorship". He said that, beginning on 2 March, protests would be held in the 13 May Plaza on a daily basis; he also called for the army to support him.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-25" /&gt;

A protest in [[Ambositra]] was broken up by police on 4 March, and two people were killed. Also on 4 March, President Ravalomanana declared his intention to "restore order" on [[Radio Mada]]. In Antananarivo, police blocked roads on 5 March to prevent protests in the 13 May Plaza.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-26" /&gt;

The security forces unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Rajoelina at his compound late on 5 March; they also raided his Viva media network. Initially they surrounded Viva, and after 30 minutes the staff attempted to evacuate equipment, at which point the security forces stormed the building and confiscated equipment. Rajoelina told [[Agence France-Presse]] on 7 March that he was "now hiding in a safe location where I cannot be attacked";&lt;ref name="AutoRI-27" /&gt; it was later acknowledged that he had gone to the residence of the French ambassador on 6 March.&lt;ref name="Res" /&gt;

=== Mutiny and military leadership change ===
{{main article|2009 Camp Capsat mutiny}}
Soldiers at a military base in Soanierana district, near Antananarivo, mutinied on 8 March; they objected to the use of force against the opposition.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-28" /&gt; United Nations envoy [[Tiebilé Dramé]] said on 9 March that the UN was placing Rajoelina "under its protection in a diplomatic residence".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-29" /&gt; The French Foreign Ministry said on 10 March that Rajoelina had left the French ambassador's residence.&lt;ref name="Res" /&gt;

On 10 March, the chief of staff of the Malagasy army, General [[Edmond Rasolomahandry]], gave political leaders 72 hours to solve the country's problems and return peace, threatening to take over if this did not occur.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-30" /&gt; The same day, Defence Minister Ranaivoniarivo announced his resignation shortly after a number of army officers visited his office to threaten a switch of allegiances to Rajoelina.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-31" /&gt; On 11 March, pro-opposition soldiers from the CAPSAT (Army Corps of Personnel and Administrative and Technical Services) stormed the army headquarters and forced Edmond Rasolomahandry to resign. Analysts stated that civil war seemed a distinct possibility.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-32" /&gt; Andre Andriarijaona replaced Rasolomahandry, apparently as a result of internal army deliberations and not a presidential appointment, and Andriarijaona said that the military would remain neutral and not seize power, thus revoking the 72-hour ultimatum.&lt;ref name="Lifts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-33" /&gt; A spokesman for Rajoelina said on 11 March that Rajoelina would not participate in talks planned to begin the next day;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-34" /&gt; subsequently the Christian Council of Churches announced that the talks would be delayed.&lt;ref name=Lifts/&gt;

On 12 March, the opposition took over the Ministry of Finance and Budget with the support of the armed forces&lt;ref name="AutoRI-35" /&gt; while the president's prime minister held a ten-minute meeting with the opposition-designated prime minister, who later stated that Rabemananjara had agreed to give up his job to him.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-36" /&gt; The next day, the chief of the military police stated he was taking orders from Andre Andriarijaona and not from the general appointed by Ravalomanana;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-37" /&gt; this was followed by the sending of army tanks against the [[Iavoloha Palace]] of the president, while some 3,000–5,000 civilian supporters of Ravalomanana surrounded the palace to counter opposition protests further away from the area. The Ravalomanana supporters, however, were told to clear the road in case the army neared the area.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-38" /&gt;

On 14 March, Monja occupied the prime minister's office while the opposition forces controlled the building.&lt;ref name="yn-2009-03-15" /&gt; Monja announced that the opposition forces, called the High Authority of Transition, "is presiding over the destiny of Madagascar".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-39" /&gt; Rajoelina gave the president four hours, until 6&amp;nbsp;pm (1500 GMT), to voluntarily resign, after which a mass civilian march would take place on the presidential palace to put Ravalomanana out of office;&lt;ref name=yn-2009-03-15/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-40" /&gt; he explicitly ruled out a violent overthrow through military means. However, Ravalomanana later emerged from the guarded palace after the deadline had passed, asserting that he was still the legal president and calling for a national conference.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-41" /&gt;

On 15 March, Ravalomanana offered to hold a referendum on whether he should stay in power or not, which was seen as a sign of the intense pressure placed on his presidency.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-42" /&gt; The following day, Rajoelina rejected this proposal and called on the security forces to arrest Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-43" /&gt;

== Capture of palace and Ravalomanana's resignation ==
{{wikinews|Coup in Madagascar; opposition leader backs army}}
On 16 March 2009, one of the palaces of President Ravalomanana, the [[Ambohitsorohitra Palace]], was stormed and taken by soldiers of the Malagasy Army. Reports also indicate the capture of the country's [[central bank]]. The president was not in the stormed palace at the time. The [[African Union]] condemned the action, calling it an "attempted coup d'état". The actions followed an earlier call from opposition leader Andry Rajoelina for the President's arrest;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-44" /&gt; Rajoelina insisted that the palace seizure was not a coup,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; although he immediately installed himself in the presidential offices of the captured palace.

Hours later, the BBC stated that Ravalomanana was to resign and hand over the powers of both the president and prime minister to a military board headed by Vice Admiral [[Hyppolite Ramaroson]].&lt;ref name="AutoRI-45" /&gt; Ravalomanana later said, "I never resigned. I was forced to hand power over, at gun point, on March the 17th."&lt;ref name="so-2009-16-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-46" /&gt; At the time, Ravalomanana had already moved out of the Iavoloha Palace to an undisclosed location; as of 24 March, he was reportedly in [[Swaziland]].&lt;ref name="AutoRI-47" /&gt; The military junta, consisting of senior military personnel, would have been charged with organizing elections within 24 months and re-writing the constitution for the "Fourth Republic".&lt;ref name="lough1" /&gt; However, Vice Admiral Ramaroson announced on 18 March that it would transfer power directly to Rajoelina, making him president of the opposition-dominated [[High Transitional Authority (Madagascar)|High Transitional Authority]] that he had appointed weeks earlier.&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-03-18" /&gt; With the military's backing, the authority was charged with taking up the task previously accorded to Ravalomanana's proposed military directorate.&lt;ref name=bbc-2009-03-18/&gt; Madagascar's constitutional court deemed the transfer of power, from Ravalomanana to the military board and then to Rajoelina, to be legal.&lt;ref name="aj-2009-03-19" /&gt; The court's statement did not include any justifications for its decision.&lt;ref name="cbc-2009-03-21" /&gt;

Rajoelina said that Ravalomanana should be prosecuted for allegedly using lethal force against unarmed opposition demonstrators earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt; Rajoelina is prohibiting Ravalomanana's ministers from leaving the country.&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt;

On 19 March, Rajoelina suspended both chambers of [[Parliament of Madagascar|Parliament]].&lt;ref name=aj-2009-03-19/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-48" /&gt; Roindefo responded to international criticism on 20 March, saying that the government will "explain the real situation. Maybe the way Madagascar acts is not very clear. Things can be a bit specific which may be difficult to follow in every detail."&lt;ref name="AutoRI-49" /&gt; According to Roindefo, the transfer of power was not a coup d'état but instead "the direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions".&lt;ref name="gn-2009-03-21" /&gt; Rajoelina was sworn in as President on 21 March before a crowd of 40,000 supporters.&lt;ref name=gn-2009-03-21/&gt; No foreign diplomats were in attendance;&lt;ref name=cbc-2009-03-21/&gt; Rajoelina's foreign minister said none were invited.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-50" /&gt;

On the same day, Malagasy navy troops called for Rajoelina's resignation by 25 March, threatening to use force otherwise to protect the constitution of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="pdo-2009-30-25" /&gt; According to their statement, the navy troops "condemn all violence against civilians" committed by the army corps in March and denounce Rajoelina for the "civil war occurring in Madagascar".&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt; The navy troops claimed that there was "irrefutable" evidence that Rajoelina had paid the army corps hundreds of millions of [[Malagasy ariary|ariaries]] and that they should face trials in accordance with military law.&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt; The navy troops called for other nations not to get involved in what they considered a purely domestic affair.&lt;ref name=pdo-2009-30-25/&gt;

In a recorded message from Ravalomanana played to around 10,000 of supporters on 25 March, Ravalomanana encouraged people to "save the nation, defend the union and our national unity" because Rajoelina's government was "destroying our country with their coup."&lt;ref name="bbc-25-03-2009" /&gt;

Also on 25 March, Rajoelina invited Ravalomanana's political party to join other political parties, unions, and business leaders to discuss reconciliation on 2 and 3 April.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-51" /&gt; Rajoelina said the meeting would also include planning for the next elections.&lt;ref name="r-26-03-2009" /&gt; Rajoelina said he would appoint the members of the group who would organize the meeting.&lt;ref name="ap-26-03-2009" /&gt; Ravalomanana's political party, [[Tiako I Madagasikara]] (TIM), did not immediately comment on whether it would participate in those meetings.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-52" /&gt;

On 26 March, Rajoelina's justice minister said that Rajoelina had given a presidential [[pardon]] to 28 "[[political prisoner]]s" and that more would be pardoned in the future.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt; Members of TIM spoke to the crowd.&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; The names of the pardoned individuals were not made public.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;

About 6,000 people who supported Ravalomanana assembled in a park in downtown Antananarivo on 26 March,&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; the fourth consecutive of such protests.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt; Members of TIM spoke to the crowd.&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; Referring to the reconciliation meeting proposed by Rajoelina, the speakers said that Ravalomanana would be involved only if he were recognized at the meeting as Madagascar's elected president and only if the United Nations, Southern African Development Community, or another neutral, international body organized the meeting.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt; The speakers urged Ravalomanana to leave Swaziland, return to Madagascar, and call the bicameral parliament back in session.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-53" /&gt; One speaker said that elections should only be held after Ravalomanana was reinstated as president.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-54" /&gt; Following the speeches, security forces fired tear gas and shot bullets into the air to disperse the crowd.&lt;ref name=r-26-03-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap-26-03-2009/&gt;

The following day, about 6,000 people who supported Ravalomanana assembled again, the fifth such demonstration in five consecutive days.&lt;ref name="r-27-03-2009" /&gt; Police used tear gas on the assembled individuals at the end of the event, as they did at the end of the previous day's demonstration.&lt;ref name=r-27-03-2009/&gt;

On 28 March, between 15,000&lt;ref name="bbc-28-03-2009" /&gt; and 20,000&lt;ref name="AutoRI-55" /&gt; protesters assembled for the sixth consecutive day.&lt;ref name="aj-28-03-2009" /&gt; In a recorded message played to the assembled crowd, Ravalomanana encouraged his supporters to continue protesting and gave assurance that he would return to Madagascar soon.&lt;ref name=aj-28-03-2009/&gt; While marching towards the 13 May Plaza, the same location that Rajoelina's supporters had assembled earlier in the year, police fired their weapons into the air&lt;ref name="AutoRI-56" /&gt; and used tear gas&lt;ref name=bbc-28-03-2009/&gt; to disperse the crowds, resulting in a stampede that injured 34 people.&lt;ref name="ap-28-03-2009" /&gt; A young protester named "Razily", who was seen in a video of 28 March protests carrying the Malagasy flag at the head of the protests before being publicly beaten and carted off by police, became a [[cause célèbre]] when the video was distributed online; he has not been seen since his arrest. Police said they were trying to keep Ravalomanana's supporters from confronting Rajoelina's supporters.&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt; In response to the police actions, Ravalomanana's supporters encouraged a general strike on 30 March, saying, "Students should not go to school, office workers should stop their work and the private sector should stop paying taxes so as not to support an illegal regime."&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt; Protests continued nearly every day thereafter.&lt;ref name="bbc-20-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21" /&gt;

On 31 March, Rajoelina announced the individuals who would constitute the cabinet of his transitional administration for 24 months until elections are held.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina compared himself to Ravalomanana, saying that Ravalomanana was not immediately accepted by world leaders when he came to power in 2002.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina reiterated his previous statements that other countries should not "interfere" with his rise to the presidency of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="bbc 2009-03-31" /&gt; Rajoelina also announced a freeze of all mining contracts with foreign companies, saying that the foreign companies are not paying the fees and royalties that are legally due to Madagascar.&lt;ref name="afp-30-03-2009" /&gt;

Still asserting that he was the legitimate president, Ravalomanana announced from exile that he was appointing [[Manandafy Rakotonirina]] as Prime Minister on 16 April. Ravalomanana made this announcement by telephone at a rally of his supporters in Antananarivo, with Rakotonirina in attendance.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-57" /&gt;

On 20 April, people gathered in Antananarivo to listen to Ravalomanana speak by telephone and protest the closure of two radio stations, Radio Fahazavana and Radio Mada,&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; the latter of which is owned by Ravalomanana.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; When the protesters began marching to a courthouse in the center of the city, police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and then fired their guns.&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; A [[BBC]] reporter witnessed a protester killed after being shot in the back at close range.&lt;ref name=bbc-20-04-2009/&gt; Another protester was also killed and twenty people went to the hospital for injuries sustained during the protests.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; The following day, thousands of people assembled to mourn the two deaths.&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; [[List of heads of government of Madagascar|Prime Minister]] [[Roindefo Monja]] announced that "all demonstrations are banned, including those in support of Andry Rajoelina, in order to restore law and order."&lt;ref name="r 2009-04-21"/&gt; Despite the ban, a demonstration was held the following day.&lt;ref name="afp-22-04-2009" /&gt; Over a thousand people assembled to protest, fewer in number and shorter in duration as compared in previous days.&lt;ref name=afp-22-04-2009/&gt;

Cars and trucks were set on fire and people were looting in Antananarivo on 23 April.&lt;ref name="ap-23-04-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-23-04-2009" /&gt; Police used tear gas, detonators, and gun fire to break up protests.&lt;ref name=bbc-23-04-2009/&gt; Six protesters were arrested.&lt;ref name="afp-23-04-2009" /&gt;

After Ravalomanana appointed him as Prime Minister, Rakotonirina began working out of the Carlton hotel in Antananarivo, and he appointed ministers to occupy the key government portfolios on 28 April. Soldiers with a warrant for Rakotonirina's arrest stormed the Carlton and arrested him on 29 April; they found him hiding in a bathroom after searching for about an hour. A spokesperson for Rajoelina described Rakotonirina as "the mastermind of last week's violence".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-58" /&gt; Also in late April, Rajoelina's government informed the AU that it was prepared to hold an election by the end of 2009, earlier than it had previously stated.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-59" /&gt;

=== Reconciliation meeting ===
At a reconciliation meeting that included four former presidents of Madagascar and United Nations negotiators, it was announced on 3 April that a [[Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2009|constitutional referendum]] would be held in September 2009, [[Malagasy parliamentary election, 2010|parliamentary elections]] in March 2010 and [[Malagasy presidential election, 2010|presidential elections]] in October 2010.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-61" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-62" /&gt;

On 11 April, Ravalomanana's supporters ended their participation in meetings with Rajoelina's supporters.&lt;ref name="bbc-11-04-2009" /&gt; Ravalomanana's supporters saying that the meetings were not worthwhile because their condition of the Ravalomanana's return to power was not met, nor was the United Nations' special envoy to Madagascar, [[Tiébilé Dramé]], acting as an impartial mediator.&lt;ref name="afp-11-04-2009" /&gt; In response, Dramé said he was "seeking a consensus" rather than an "imposed solution".&lt;ref name=afp-11-04-2009/&gt; On the same day, more than 10,000 people assembled in Antananarivo to protest Rajoelina's government.&lt;ref name=bbc-11-04-2009/&gt;

At a meeting on 23 May 2009 a breakthrough was reached; a transitional government and a [[truth and reconciliation commission]] was agreed to be formed, and all former presidents would be allowed to stand in the presidential elections; this last point was seen as controversial, as it might increase instability.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-63" /&gt; However, on 25 May 2009 the party of [[Didier Ratsiraka]] withdrew from the talks.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-64" /&gt;

=== Mediation crisis talks ===
Former exiled president of Madagascar [[Marc Ravalomanana]], [[President of Madagascar|President of the High Authority of Transition of Madagascar]] [[Andry Rajoelina]], former exiled Madagascar president [[Didier Ratsiraka]] and former president of the Malagasy Republic [[Albert Zafy]] met on Tuesday 4 August 2009 in Maputo, Mozambican capital, for four-day-long mediation crisis talks with the former Mozambican President [[Joaquim Chissano]] acting as mediator. Representatives came from the [[African Union]] (AU), United Nations (UN), the [[Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC). The mediation talks hoped to arrive at a way for Ravalomanana to return to Madagascar from his exile in South Africa. The talks were also a trade meeting to begin negotiations on the transition charter to seek new elections in Madagascar. Ratsiraka, who had been exiled in France, saw his amnesty issue resolved at the talks. The four leaders sought to again become a customs union (SADC), and representatives of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-65" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-66" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-68" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRI-70" /&gt;

== Unity government deal ==
On 7 November 2009, the leaders agreed to a power-sharing deal in which Rajoelina stays as president, creation of two co-presidents, [[Fetison Rakoto Andrianirina]], aide to former President Ravalomanana and [[Emmanuel Rakotovahiny]], aide to former President Zafy. Prime Minister [[Eugene Mangalaza]] who was appointed on 10 October will be retained heading the 31-member cabinet. The deal also creates a 65-member council of transitional advisers and a transitional parliament composed of 258 members.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-71" /&gt;

During the transition in the government, people have been illegally hunting and logging in [[Marojejy National Park]] and other conservation areas in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="ng" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; While the new Malagasy government is otherwise preoccupied and some park rangers have left their posts, armed groups are cutting down valuable [[rosewood]] trees.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Laws prohibiting the export of rosewood were repealed in January 2009, so the illegally acquired logs can be sold and exported for profit.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Thousands of local people were involved in cutting a documented 123,000 rosewood logs representing an estimated 45,000 rosewood trees from Marojejy, Masoala and Makira National Parks between January–October 2009, with at least 871 containers already exported to China between March–April 2009 alone from the [[Vohemar]] and [[Toamasina]] ports.&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Floating the rosewood logs down rivers also requires cutting of 4–5 lighter trees, and several [[rosewood]] species are endangered or occur at low densities below 1–5 trees per hectare.&lt;ref name="Wilmé" /&gt; Numerous new access paths are created and some individuals built a 6-kilometer-long road into a remote northern park to transport the logs.&lt;ref name="gm-18-04-2009" /&gt; Some ships land directly on the coast to pick up the logs, rather than at government-controlled ports.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Bribery of customs officials has been reported.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Radio commercials have been aired seeking workers to help in the process.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Extracting resources from these conservation areas is likely to threaten already [[critically endangered]] species such as the [[silky sifaka]] [[lemur]],&lt;ref name=ng/&gt; one of the top 25 most endangered [[primate]]s in the world.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-72" /&gt; A statement jointly released by several [[non-governmental organizations]] criticized the logging and hunting occurring in national parks, illegal mining, and [[slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn farming]] occurring in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="fn-30-03-2009" /&gt; The joint statement said that "These deplorable acts will only further impoverish the country and deprive future generations of the Malagasy people from their unique natural heritage."&lt;ref name=fn-30-03-2009/&gt; The groups who issued the statement were [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Conservation International]], [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]], Institute for the Conservation of Tropical Environment, [[The Peregrine Fund]], ONG Fanamby, [[Madagascar Fauna Group]], L'Homme et l'Environnement, and Plant Resources for Tropical Africa.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-73" /&gt;

=== Contracts ===
In 2009, Rajoelina canceled a contract with South Korean company [[Daewoo]].&lt;ref name="ft-2009-03-19" /&gt; Under the contract, Daewoo would have leased {{convert|1300000|ha|km2}} of land, almost half of Madagascar's arable land,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-74" /&gt; for 99 years to grow corn and palm oil for export to South Korea, a project that might have created as many as 45,000 jobs.&lt;ref name=ft-2009-03-19/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-03-19" /&gt; On 10 April 2009, Madagascar's Minister of Land Reform confirmed that the contract with Daewoo had been canceled because its "approach was wrong", even though "the project by itself wasn't bad and such a project is welcome".&lt;ref name="bb-10-04-2009" /&gt; As of 10 April, Daewoo said it had not been informed of the contract's cancellation&lt;ref name=bb-10-04-2009/&gt; and would proceed with the project regardless.&lt;ref name=ft-2009-03-19/&gt;

On 17 March 2009, Canadian energy company [[Sherritt International]] said its 27-year $4.5-billion nickel-mining project would still begin in 2010 and reach full production in 2013, as scheduled.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-75" /&gt; On 19 March 2009, it said it was likely the project's start date would be delayed.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-76" /&gt;

=== Economic ===
Finance Minister Benja Razafimahaleo reported a decrease in government revenue of 15 to 20 percent.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Ravalomanana owns Tiko, the largest dairy farm in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-77" /&gt; After Rajoelina became president, Rajoelina's supporters looted Tiko dairy farms, resulting in a milk shortage in Madagascar.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Revenue from foreign tourists has decreased by 70 percent, in part because some foreign countries are cautioning their citizens against visiting the country&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; About 70 percent of hotels have closed due to the sharp drop in business.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; One large hotel that has remained open temporarily laid off 150 of its 400 employees and cut the hours and wages of its other 250 employees.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt; Strikes, wage shortages, and cuts in foreign aid are also causing economic problems for the country.&lt;ref name=gm-18-04-2009/&gt;

=== Sports ===
On 28 January 2009, the [[Confederation of African Football]] canceled a match between Madagascar's [[Academie Ny Antsika]] and [[Réunion]]'s [[US Stade Tamponnaise|Union Sportive Stade Tamponnaise]], which was set to be played in Antananarivo.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-78" /&gt;

The African Union suspended Madagascar's membership in the organization. The [[Peace and Security Council]] of the African Union announced that it would impose sanctions on the Madagascar government if an "unconstitutional" transfer of power were to take place, including total expulsion from the African Union.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-95" /&gt; The African Union can enact sanctions if Madagascar does not restore constitutional order within six months.&lt;ref name="tg 2009-03-20" /&gt;

The African Union's stance was corroborated by Czech Foreign Minister [[Karel Schwarzenberg]], who stated that the European Union may impose sanctions on Madagascar and not recognize the transfer of power,&lt;ref name="AutoRI-96" /&gt; and the United States Department of State, which indicated a similar response to any "extra-constitutional" regime change.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-97" /&gt; The Southern African Development Community will meet in late March to consider sanctions.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-98" /&gt;

On 31 March, the [[European Union]] said it had not suspended its aid to Madagascar, which will continue for the next three years as previously agreed, but it also had no plans for new aid.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-99" /&gt;

US President Barack Obama decided to remove Madagascar from the beneficiary of the AGOA [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]]. On 23 December of the year 2009, President Obama also terminated the program for Guinea, Niger and Madagascar because of their undemocratic changes of power.&lt;ref name="AutoRI-100" /&gt; The AGOA program has helped created ten of thousands of jobs for middle class Malagasy especially in apparel manufacturing factories, it is feared that most of these jobs will be lost in the near future. Considering the important number of business affected by this decision, the economy of the capital city Antananarivo and [[Antsirabe]] will be deeply affected fearing further social tension.

=== Government response ===
Most of the government response has been channeled through opposition prime minister [[Monja Roindefo]], who denied that the events leading to Rajoelina's gaining of the presidency was a coup, but rather a "direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions",&lt;ref name="tg 2009-03-20" /&gt; and called on the European Union to reconsider its reaction to the events. Rajoelina dismissed the condemnations, stating that "if they haven't understood the process, they may well react. But if they stick to their line after we have spoken, it will be annoying".&lt;ref name="AutoRI-101" /&gt;

Rajoelina has promised that the high [[cost of living]] would decrease because merchants had agreed to decrease the price of bread and cooking oil as of 30 March, and the cost of rice soon thereafter.&lt;ref name=ap-28-03-2009/&gt;

In response to the [[Southern African Development Community]]'s view that Rajoelina's rise to power was unconstitutional and its urging for elections within six months, Rajoelina said that membership in the SADC is "not in the interests of Madagascar".&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt; He said he would confer with others to decide whether Madagascar would continue to be a member of the SADC.&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt; "The prospect of an SADC intervention is unacceptable. Other states cannot interfere with the decision of (Madagascar's) High Constitutional Court" that the transfer of power to Rajoelina was constitutional.&lt;ref name=r-30-03-2009/&gt;

[[File:Marc, Franz - Pferde in Landschaft.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Franz Marc]]'s ''Pferde in Landschaft'', one of the artworks discovered in the Gurlitt collection (probably 1911, [[gouache]] on coloured paper).]]

In February 2012, the [[Prosecutor|District Prosecutor]] of Augsburg confiscated 121 framed and 1,285 unframed artworks found in an apartment in [[Schwabing]], [[Munich]] in the course of an investigation into possible tax evasion.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; The apartment was rented to  Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of celebrated art historian, dealer, and war profiteer, [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], and grandson of the art historian [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]].  Some of the paintings were immediately suspected of having been [[Nazi plunder|looted]] by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The collection is largely undamaged and of remarkable quality. It contains [[Old Masters]] as well as [[Impressionist]], [[Cubist]], and [[Expressionist]] paintings by artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Max Liebermann]], among many others. Although German authorities seized the entire collection, Gurlitt was not detained. Not until 3 November 2013 did the magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' report the find.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; News of the discovery was reported worldwide.&lt;ref name="Smale"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |title= Report of Nazi-Looted Trove Puts Art World in an Uproar |last=Smale |first=Alison |date=4 November 2013 |website= |publisher=''The New York Times'' |access-date= 18 March 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurlitt initially refused to cooperate with investigators. He retained several dozen additional suspect paintings, kept not in Munich but in his home in Salzburg, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26133532 |title=Nazi loot probe: More art found at Gurlitt Austria home, BBC News, 11 February 2014 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2014, an agreement was reached whereby the collection confiscated in Munich was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with a government-led task force charged with returning stolen pieces to the rightful owners.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dw.de/p/1BdMb |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2014 |last=R |first=D |title=Gurlitt reaches deal with German authorities over vast trove of art}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10811916/Cornelius-Gurlitt-obituary.html |title=Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary |publisher=Telegraph |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate= 28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His will bequeathed all his property to the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]], Switzerland, after all legitimate claims of ownership against it had been evaluated.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014"&gt;{{cite news|title='Nazi art' hoarder Gurlitt makes Swiss museum sole heir|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27306269|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artnet.com/in-brief/will-germany-keep-gurlitts-trove-from-the-swiss-14647#.U2ujUaPvmMk.facebook |title=Artnet news, Alexander Forbes, '&amp;#39;Will Germany Keep Gurlitt’s Trove from the Swiss?'&amp;#39; |publisher=News.artnet.com |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 1930 art collector Hildebrand Gurlitt was removed as director of the museum in [[Zwickau]] because he exhibited contemporary artists. After the Nazis came to power, he was stripped of his new job as director of [[Kunstverein Hamburg]], because his grandmother was a Jew.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/nazi_policies_toward_jews_and_minorities/ |title='&amp;#39;Nazi Policies Toward Jews and Minorities'&amp;#39;, NY Times, 18 November 2013 |publisher=Topics.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved the family to [[Dresden]] and built a prosperous business as an art dealer, specializing in modern art.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"/&gt;

Hildebrand was appointed as a dealer for the [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]], Austria.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Appointed when?  by whom?}}  On instructions from [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Hermann Göring]] personally appointed a Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Created when?}}  The Commission in turn appointed a series of dealers approved by the official Nazi confiscation service, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|ERR]], to handle the marketing of these art assets. Four men who had been dealing in modern art for years were chosen: Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Möller, Bernhard A. Böhmer and Hildebrand Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title= The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War| publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. |date = 1995 |accessdate=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were instructed to sell these artworks abroad for foreign currency.  Hildebrand's extensive network of European and North American art contacts were invaluable in this.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Göring used the funds raised to grow his personal art collection, though the four men did not always report to the Commission all proceeds of their sales.&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;{{cite web|last=Feliciano |first=Hector |url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/ |title=The Lost Museum |publisher=Bonjour Paris |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works of so-called "degenerate art" that the Commission sold off were many paintings stolen from noted French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]].

[[File:Sworn Statement Dr. H. Gurlitt 1945.pdf|thumb|1945 statement by [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]] to Allied authorities, describing his dealings before and during the war and listing art in his possession]]

In May 1940 the Reich Propaganda Ministry sold to Gurlitt 200 paintings, including Chagall's ''The Walk'', Picasso's ''Farming Family'', and Nolde's ''Hamburg Harbour,'' for the small sum of 4,000 Swiss francs.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt;  Hildebrand similarly acquired 115 additional works of "degenerate art" in 1941.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt; It is estimated that, at his height, he had a personal trading collection of more than 1500 art objects.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"/&gt;

Gurlitt used his position to sell art to domestic collectors, most notably to [[Bernhard Sprengel]], whose collection forms the core of the [[Sprengel Museum]] in Hannover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://derstandard.at/1216918696497/Entartete--Kunstgeschaefte | title=Entartete Kunstgeschäfte | work=Der Standard | date=6 August 2008 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captured with his wife and twenty boxes of art in Aschbach ([[Schlüsselfeld]]) in June 1945, Gurlitt claimed that the art was part of his personal collection, and that most of his collection and all of his records had been destroyed during the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945.&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/depot-mit-nazi-raubkunst-in-muenchen-der-verwerter-und-sein-sohn-1.1809631 | title=Depot mit Nazi-Raubkunst in München | work=Süddeutsche.de | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | author=Mazzoni, Ira |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He painted himself as a victim of Nazi persecution due to his Jewish heritage, and on those grounds he was released.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;
 
[[File:Liebermann, Max - Zwei Reiter am Strand - Gurlitt.jpg|thumb|[[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' in the Gurlitt collection and subject to a claim by the descendants of the original Jewish owner]]

Although suspicious of his story, in December 1950 US investigators returned 206 items to Gurlitt, including [[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'', [[Otto Dix]]'s self-portrait, an allegorical painting by [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2493980/Nazi-art-loot-German-dealer-quizzed-U-S-military-just-war.html#ixzz2k9BmfvdM|title=How U.S. military quizzed German dealer of £1bn Nazi art loot just after the war|last=Enoch |first=Nick|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurlitt continued trading artworks until his death in 1956.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War | publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. | date=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelius Gurlitt (28 December 1932 – 6 May 2014) was a German [[Private collection|art collector]], son  of [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. He grew up in the [[Dammtor]] district of Hamburg with his sister Renate, who was born there in 1935. His great-grandmother was Jewish, which caused his father to be labelled as a "quarter-Jew" under the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nazi race laws]] in the ''Volkszählung vom 17. Mai 1939'', or so-called "German Minority Census" of 1939.&lt;ref&gt;This "German Minority Census" is available in digital form at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Resource Center in Washington D.C. and at the German Federal Archives in Berlin-Lichterfelde. An unsourced copy of the database was published online by the [http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx Holocaust Era Assets and Restitution Taskforce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109175142/http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx |date=2013-11-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery by German customs authorities==
In 2010 German customs officers detained Cornelius Gurlitt entering Germany from Switzerland carrying €9,000 (£7,500; $13,000) in cash,&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; which he explained as the proceeds of a transaction with the Galerie Kornfeld in Bern. Gurlitt was allowed to go on his way, but he had aroused suspicions. Further investigation by the prosecutor's office, the federal police and the tax authorities uncovered a number of anomalies.&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Investigators discovered that Gurlitt had never been employed, had no obvious source of income, was not registered with the {{ill|Einwohnermeldeamt|de}} or with the tax authorities or social services, had never married, and had no pension or health insurance.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In late February 2012, the authorities searched his apartment, finding more than a thousand paintings valued at as much as €1 billion.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/kunst/1500-werke-von-picasso-bis-chagall-zollfahnder-entdecken-sensationellen-kunstschatz-in-muenchen_aid_1147066.html|title=Fahnder entdecken 1500 Werke von Picasso, Chagall und weiteren Künstlern|work=Focus|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24794970|title=Nazi looted art 'found in Munich'|publisher=BBC News|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAZ_Nov22&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-ein-dementi-weitere-meldungen-nuechterne-schaetzungen-12674903.html|title=Schwabinger Kunstfund: Ein Dementi, weitere Meldungen, nüchterne Schätzungen|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=22 November 2013|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' stated that at least 200 pieces were believed to have been lost during the Nazi era.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;
The paintings recovered included works by &lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; [[Ernst Barlach]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Canaletto]], Marc Chagall, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Christoph|de}}, [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], Otto Dix, [[Albrecht Dürer]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Erich Fraaß|de}}, [[Conrad Felixmüller]], [[Bonaventura Genelli]], [[Ludwig Godenschweg]], [[Otto Griebel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Paul Klee]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernhard Kretzschmar|de}}, [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Wilhelm Lachnit]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Maskos|de}}, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Théodore Rousseau]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Carl Spitzweg]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Christoph Voll]].

==Initial legal handling of the Gurlitt case==
On 5 November 2013, Reinhard Nemetz, the head of the prosecutors' office in [[Augsburg]], said that 121 framed and 1,258 unframed works had been seized from the apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt in early March 2012,&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; including unregistered works by Chagall, Dix, Liebermann, and Matisse.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24818541|title=Nazi trove in Munich contains unknown works by masters|publisher=BBC News|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian who first examined the collection, [[Meike Hoffmann]], claimed in print in 2010 that "not a single one" of these works was ever acquired by Hildebrand Gurlitt. Dr. Meike Hoffmann wishes to remark that this controversy derives from a misreading of her book on Bernhard A. Böhmer. In her book, the art historical term ‘Bildwerke’ is used. The term refers only to sculptures, which indeed Hildebrand Gurlitt did not take from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation. Of course, Meike Hoffmann has never questioned the fact that Hildebrandt Gurlitt dealt with other kinds of artworks from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman's book (in German) ''Ein Händler "entarteter" Kunst: Bernhard A.

Gurlitt then told two reporters from the ''[[Paris Match]]'', who confronted him in a Munich supermarket, that "Applause from the wrong side is the worst thing there is." ''Der Spiegel'' found this comment "puzzling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/cornelius-gurlitt-reporter-spueren-den-kunstsammler-in-muenchen-auf-a-932755.html ''Der Spiegel''], 11 November 2013 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portrait of a woman'' by [[Henri Matisse]] was directly traceable to the collection of [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], a Jewish art dealer from Paris who had represented [[Matisse]] and [[Picasso]] and who had been forced to leave his collection behind when he fled France.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|title=German police recover 1,500 modernist masterpieces 'looted by Nazis'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When approached by ''Focus'', Rosenberg's granddaughter, French television presenter [[Anne Sinclair]], who had been fighting for decades for the return of the art dealer's paintings, stated that she knew nothing of the existence of the painting.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2486251/Discovered-Billion-pound-art-collection-seized-Nazis-ordered-destroyed-discovered-rotting-food-dishevelled-Munich-apartment.html#ixzz2jbOnohDE|title=£1billion art collection seized by Nazis found in shabby Munich apartment|author=Hall, Alan|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery efforts for ''Portrait of a woman'' were immediately undertaken on behalf of the Rosenberg heirs by [[Art Recovery Group|Christopher A.

It is believed the work was sold to a collector in Florida in 2002.

One of the last pieces that Cornelius Gurlitt sold was ''The Lion Tamer'' by Max Beckmann. After a settlement, initiated by the Lempertz auction house in Cologne, was reached between Gurlitt and the heirs of [[Alfred Flechtheim]], it was auctioned off for nearly £750,000.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Another work was reportedly sold in 1990 through the [[Bern]]-based gallery of [[Eberhard Kornfeld]].&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"/&gt;

In March 2014, a BBC reporter was granted access to one of the locations where 238 of the seized works were stored. He viewed works such as [[Monet]]'s ''[[Waterloo Bridge (painting)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' (1903) and others by [[Picasso]], [[Cezanne]], [[Liebermann]], [[Renoir]], [[Courbet]], and [[Manet]].&lt;ref name="BBC 20140326"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26746697 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: One lonely man and his hoard of stolen Nazi art |last=Evans |first=Stephen |publisher=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2014, a month before Gurlitt's death, an agreement was reached whereby the seized artwork was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with the government-led task force charged with determining which of the pieces was stolen and returning them to the rightful heirs.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"/&gt;

===Schwabinger (Gurlitt) Art Trove Task Force===
An entity called the Schwabinger Kunstfund or Gurlitt Task Force was created to research the provenance of the paintings in the Gurlitt trove. However, after several years of operations under the direction of Ingeborg Berggreen-Merkel it was widely criticized for having few results and little visibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/task-force-investigating-art-trove-inherited-from-nazi-collector-achieved-embarrassing-results/a-18876659&lt;/ref&gt;

Berggreen-Merkel was accused of visiting the severely ill Gurlitt at his hospital bed and persuading him to sign over the ownership of his collection, allegedly as the only way to prevent Gurlitt from getting sued from various interest groups, Jewish or other. In early 2014 Gurlitt designated the Kunstmuseum as his sole heir. A few weeks earlier, Berggreen-Merkel had met with the President of the Museum's Foundation Council, Christoph Schäublin. One year later, her taskforce was dissolved. "We are disappointed," said Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taskforce-kunstfund.de/en/chronology.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/gurlitt-und-die-folgen-des-schwabinger-kunstfunds-kunstmuseum-bern-tritt-gurlitt-erbe-an/11021442.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/Laesst-sich-Bern-die-grosse-GurlittAusstellung-wegschnappen-/story/31357598&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Gurlitt, and after==
Cornelius Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Nazi art' hoarder Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27298832|work=BBC|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, written on his deathbed, Gurlitt named the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]] in Switzerland as his sole heir.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014" /&gt;  People close to Gurlitt told an American newspaper that he decided to give the collection to a foreign institution because he felt that Germany had treated him and his father badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-museum-close-to-accepting-nazi-era-art-bequest-1416443643 |title= Swiss Museum Close to Accepting Trove of Nazi Art|last1= Lane|first1= Mary M.|date= November 20, 2014|publisher= ''The Wall Street Journal'' |access-date= 13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy included the paintings Gurlitt had kept in Salzburg, paintings which German authorities had not confiscated because their remit did not extend to property held in Austria. Gurlitt's decision created further controversy over the appropriateness of the museum accepting this bequest. The will stipulated that the museum would be required to research the provenance of the paintings and make restitution as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. A12.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum decided to accept those works which are not legally the property of previous Nazi-era owners, or their heirs, and has entered into a joint-agreement with German and Swiss authorities about the handling of this bequest.

Gurlitt's family (cousins) also entered the discussion, raising questions about the legality of the will, based on his state of mind at the time. Gurlitt's cousin, Uta Werner, filed a claim of inheritance on the artwork. Werner's lawyer, Wolfgang Seybold, argued that Gurlitt's relatives were the rightful heirs. Seybold supported his argument with the opinion of psychiatrist and lawyer Helmut Hausner, who stated that Gurlitt suffered from [[schizoid personality disorder]], delusions, and dementia when he wrote the will bequeathing his collection to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die 'Causa Gurlitt': Leichtgradig Kompliziert|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/die-causa-gurlitt-leichtgradig-kompliziert-13273066.html|work=Franffurter Algemeine|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that a number of artworks will be returned to Gurlitt's estate, as he would have been considered the rightful owner unless the heirs of previous owners could prove that he obtained them through unlawful means.&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kunst-und-architektur/article121499967/Wie-Picassos-in-einer-vermuellten-Wohnung-landeten.html | title=Wie Picassos in einer vermüllten Wohnung landeten | work=Die Welt | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Dittmar, Peter | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; German authorities estimate that around 590 pieces need further investigation to determine whether they were confiscated under the Nazi regime, and a further 380 have been definitively identified as confiscated by the Nazis as "degenerate art".&lt;ref name="Schwabing art trove"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.lostart.de/Content/02_Aktuelles/2013/13-11-15%20PM%20Taskforce_EN.html?nn=9848 | title=Schwabing art trove: Provenance of treasures to be researched alongside criminal proceedings – suspicious works being publicised at lostart.de | publisher=the Bavarian State Ministry of Justice, the Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art objects continued to surface after Gurlitt's death. In July 2014, a new discovery was made in his Munich apartment: two sculptures, possibly the work of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].&lt;ref name=sculptures&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28464629 |title=Possible Rodin and Degas works found at Gurlitt home |publisher=BBC |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a landscape by Claude Monet was discovered in a suitcase Gurlitt had left in a hospital where he stayed.&lt;ref name=suitcase&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29085509 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: Monet found in art hoarder's suitcase |publisher=BBC |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
German newspapers questioned the prosecutor's right to seize the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Voss |first=Julia |date=17 November 2013 |title=Münchner Kunstfund: Wo bleibt der Rechtsstaat? |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunstmarkt/muenchner-kunstfund-wo-bleibt-der-rechtsstaat-12668607.html |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-politische-strafjustiz-12678004.html ''Politische Strafjustiz''] (in German) in the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 25 November 2013, by Volker Rieble.&lt;/ref&gt; Property rights in cases of works of art acquired during the Nazi period are highly complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dittmar |first=Peter |date=7 November 2013 |title=Verbrechen lohnt sich |newspaper=Jüdische Allgemeine |url=http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/17492 |language=de}}. This article refers in particular to works of ''[[degenerate art]]'', whose confiscation had been formalized by a Nazi law. ''Gesetz über Einziehung von Erzeugnissen entarteter Kunst'' (Act on the Confiscation of Works of Degenerate Art) of 31 May 1938&lt;/ref&gt; After the war the Nazi law legalizing possession of stolen works of ''[[degenerate art]]'' was deliberately upheld by the [[Allied Control Council]] in order that the trade in artworks could continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 Heuer, Carl-Heinz (undated). "Die eigentumsrechtliche Problematik der ''entarteten'' Kunst" – "The problems surrounding ownership rights to ''degenerate'' art"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235653/http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 |date=2 December 2013 }} (bilingual), on the website of the [[Free University of Berlin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in Austria,&lt;ref&gt;''Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998'' (''Art Return Law 1998'') See the [[:de:Restitution (Österreich)#Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998|German Wikipedia entry]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no law in effect in Germany requiring the return of Nazi-looted art, as long as the items in question can be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the [[Wiedergutmachung|1998 Washington Agreement]], Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries&lt;ref&gt;The [http://raubgut.zlb.de/index.php/About/Index_en Central and Regional Library of Berlin] is the only library in Germany to have full-time staff devoted to the search for Nazi-looted cultural goods.&lt;/ref&gt; have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. A failure on the part of the German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt might have been a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2013/48/gurlitt-kunstwerke-raubkunst/seite-1 ''Fluch des Schatzes''] (''Curse of the Treasure'') in ''Der Zeit'', 21 November 2013 (in German). ''“German museums are accordingly, albeit rather hesitantly, searching for looted art in their collections, and from time to time works are returned. This is cumbersome, mostly unspectacular and takes far too long, but it is still the right way. But Cornelius Gurlitt is a private person, and therefore the principles of the Washington Agreement do not apply to his artworks. He cannot be forced, and it appears the government wants to seize the works, which is hardly possible in the face of the constitution.”''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2013, prominent German art historian [[Sibylle Ehringhaus]], who was one of the first experts to view the artworks in the spring of 2012, gave an interview in the newspaper ''[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]'', demanding the immediate return of the complete collection to Gurlitt. However, she had looked at the works very briefly and had not researched their [[provenance]] because, as she stated in the interview, "Cornelius Gurlitt commissioned neither myself nor anyone else" to perform such research. Chief Prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz vehemently denied her appeal, yet apparently failed to cite any concrete legal grounds for the seizure.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Interview-Kunstexpertin-fordert-Rueckgabe-aller-Bilder-an-Gurlitt-id27983722.html Interview: Kunstexpertin fordert Rückgabe aller Bilder an Gurlitt], ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 4 December 2012 (in German) or a [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001010/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} of the article in English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Augsburger-Staatsanwaltschaft-weist-Vorwuerfe-der-Kunstexpertin-zurueck-id27992202.html Augsburger Staatsanwaltschaft weist Vorwürfe der Kunstexpertin zurück] ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 5 December 2012 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2014, the German jurist [[Jutta Limbach]], the head of the Limbach Commission on Nazi-looted art, confirmed the opinion of the German ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' newspaper that the Bavarian "State Prosecutor used an incorrect application of the tax liability law to seize" the artworks of Cornelius Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', ''Ein Bild lässt sich abhangen, Schuld nicht'' (in German; English: "A picture may be taken down, but not the guilt"), interview by Heribert Prantl and Kia Vahland, 20 November 2014, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the artworks have been returned to the heirs of the legitimate owners, notably a portrait by Matisse restored to the heirs of French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. Another major painting from the collection, ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' (1901), by [[Max Liebermann]], was returned to the heirs of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann,&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, Melissa (May&amp;nbsp;15, 2015).

==Swiss museum's acceptance of Gurlitt's estate==
On 24 November 2014, the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Bern]] agreed to accept the Gurlitt estate.  Museum officials stated that no art looted by the Nazis would be permitted to enter the museum's collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious&gt;{{cite web| url = https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gurlitt-collection-arrives-kunstmuseum-bern-1018277| title = The Notorious Gurlitt Trove of Nazi-Tainted Art Makes Its First Appearance at Kunstmuseum Bern| author = Neuendorf, Henri| date = July 10, 2017| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = artmet.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 500 works were to remain in Germany until their rightful owners could be identified. Three pieces were singled out for immediate return: [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Femme Assise'' to the descendants of the Jewish art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], Max Liebermann's ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' to the great-nephew of the industrialist and art collector [[David Friedmann]], and [[Carl Spitzweg]]'s ''Playing the Piano'' to the heirs of music publisher [[Henri Hinrichsen]], who was murdered at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30176190 |title=Swiss museum to accept Gurlitt 'Nazi art' |publisher=BBC News |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], the [[abstraction]] of '''actual [[infinity]]''' involves the acceptance (if the [[axiom of infinity]] is included) of infinite entities, such as the set of all [[natural numbers]] or an infinite sequence of [[rational numbers]], as given, actual, completed objects. This is contrasted with '''potential infinity''', in which a non-terminating process (such as "add 1 to the previous number") produces a sequence with no last element, and each individual result is finite and is achieved in a finite number of steps.

== Anaximander ==

{{seemain|Apeiron (cosmology)}}

The ancient Greek term for the potential or improper infinite was ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]'' (unlimited or indefinite), in contrast to the actual or proper infinite ''aphorismenon''.{{fact|date=March 2018}} ''Apeiron'' stands opposed to that which has a ''peras'' (limit). These notions are today denoted by ''potentially infinite'' and ''actually infinite'', respectively.

[[Anaximander]] (610–546&amp;nbsp;BC) held that the '' apeiron'' was the principle or main element composing all things.  Clearly, the 'apeiron' was some sort of basic substance. [[Plato]]'s notion of the ''apeiron'' is more abstract, having to do with indefinite variability. The main dialogues where Plato discusses the 'apeiron' are the late dialogues ''Parmenides'' and the ''Philebus''.

==Aristotle==
[[Aristotle]] sums up the views of his predecessors on infinity thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Only the [[Pythagoreans]] place the infinite among the objects of sense (they do not regard number as separable from these), and assert that what is outside the heaven is infinite. Plato, on the other hand, holds that there is no body outside (the Forms are not outside because they are nowhere), yet that the infinite is present not only in the objects of sense but in the Forms also. (Aristotle)"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theme was brought forward by Aristotle's consideration of the apeiron in the context of mathematics and physics (the study of nature).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Infinity turns out to be the opposite of what people say it is. It is not 'that which has nothing beyond itself' that is infinite, but 'that which always has something beyond itself'. (Aristotle)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Belief in the existence of the infinite comes mainly from five considerations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CD0IRPg4roC&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;ots=Y1cIbHE3MX&amp;dq=Belief%20in%20the%20existence%20of%20the%20infinite%20comes%20mainly%20from%20five%20considerations:&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q=Belief%20in%20the%20existence%20of%20the%20infinite%20comes%20mainly%20from%20five%20considerations:&amp;f=false|title=Commentary on Aristotle's Physics|last=Thomas|first=Kenneth W.|last2=Thomas|first2=Thomas, Aquinas|date=2003-06-01|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781843715450|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# From the nature of time – for it is infinite.
# From the division of magnitudes – for the mathematicians also use the notion of the infinite.
# If coming to be and passing away do not give out, it is only because that from which things come to be is infinite.
# Because the limited always finds its limit in something, so that there must be no limit, if everything is always limited by something different from itself.
# Most of all, a reason which is peculiarly appropriate and presents the difficulty that is felt by everybody – not only number but also mathematical magnitudes and what is outside the heaven are supposed to be infinite because they never give out in our thought. (Aristotle)
Aristotle postulated that an actual infinity was impossible, because if it were possible, then something would have attained infinite magnitude, and would be "bigger than the heavens." However, he said, mathematics relating to infinity was not deprived of its applicability by this impossibility, because mathematicians did not need the infinite for their theorems, just an arbitrarily large finite magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.logoslibrary.org/aristotle/physics/37.html|title=Logos Virtual Library: Aristotle: Physics, III, 7|website=www.logoslibrary.org|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle's potential–actual distinction===
[[Aristotle]] handled the topic of infinity in ''Physics'' and in ''Metaphysics''. He distinguished between ''actual'' and ''potential'' infinity. ''Actual infinity'' is completed and definite, and consists of infinitely many elements. ''Potential infinity'' is never complete: elements can be always added, but never infinitely many. 

{{quote
|"For generally the infinite has this mode of existence: one thing is always being taken after another, and each thing that is taken is always finite, but always different."
|Aristotle, Physics, book 3, chapter 6.}}

Aristotle distinguished between infinity with respect to addition and division.

{{quote |But Plato has two infinities, the Great and the Small.
|Physics, book 3, chapter 4.}}

"As an example of a potentially infinite series in respect to increase, one number can always be added after another in the series that starts 1,2,3,... but the process of adding more and more numbers cannot be exhausted or completed."

With respect to division, a potentially infinite sequence of divisions starts e.g. as 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, but the process division cannot be exhausted or completed.

{{quote |"For the fact that the process of dividing never comes to an end ensures that this activity exists potentially, but not that the infinite exists separately."
| Metaphysics, book 9, chapter 6.}}

In mathematics, the infinite series 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + · · · is an elementary example of a geometric series that converges.

==Scholastic philosophers==
The overwhelming majority of [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]] adhered to the motto ''Infinitum actu non datur''. This means there is only a (developing, improper, "syncategorematic") ''potential infinity'' but not a (fixed, proper, "categorematic") ''actual infinity''. There were exceptions, however, for example in England. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is well known that in the Middle Ages all scholastic philosophers advocate Aristotle's "infinitum actu non datur" as an irrefutable principle. ([[Georg Cantor|G. Cantor]] [3, p.&amp;nbsp;174])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The number of points in a segment one ell long is its true measure. ([[Robert Grosseteste|R. Grosseteste]] [9, p.&amp;nbsp;96])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Actual infinity exists in number, time and quantity. (J. Baconthorpe [9, p.&amp;nbsp;96])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the Renaissance and by early modern times the voices in favor of actual infinity were rather rare.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The continuum actually consists of infinitely many indivisibles ([[Galileo Galilei|G. Galilei]] [9, p.&amp;nbsp;97])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am so in favour of actual infinity. ([[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|G.W. Leibniz]] [9, p.&amp;nbsp;97])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The majority{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} agreed with the well-known quote of Gauss:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I protest against the use of infinite magnitude as something completed, which is never permissible in mathematics. Infinity is merely a way of speaking, the true meaning being a limit which certain ratios approach indefinitely close, while others are permitted to increase without restriction.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Kleene 1952 (1971 edition):48 attributes the first sentence of this quote to (Werke VIII p. 216).&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Carl Friedrich Gauss|C.F. Gauss]] [in a letter to Schumacher, 12 July 1831])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The drastic change was initialized by Bolzano and Cantor in the 19th century.

[[Bernard Bolzano]] who introduced the notion of ''set'' (in German: ''Menge'') and Georg Cantor who introduced [[set theory]] opposed the general attitude. Cantor distinguished three realms of infinity: (1) the infinity of God (which he called the "absolutum"), (2) the infinity of reality (which he called "nature") and (3) the transfinite numbers and sets of mathematics.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A multitude which is larger than any finite multitude, i.e., a multitude with the property that every finite set [of members of the kind in question] is only a part of it, I will call an infinite multitude. (B. Bolzano [2, p.&amp;nbsp;6])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are twice as many focuses as centres of ellipses. (B. Bolzano [2a, § 93])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Accordingly I distinguish an eternal uncreated infinity or absolutum which is due to God and his attributes, and a created infinity or transfinitum, which has to be used wherever in the created nature an actual infinity has to be noticed, for example, with respect to, according to my firm conviction, the actually infinite number of created individuals, in the universe as well as on our earth and, most probably, even in every arbitrarily small extended piece of space. (G. Cantor [3, p.&amp;nbsp;399; 8, p.&amp;nbsp;252])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One proof is based on the notion of God. First, from the highest perfection of God, we infer the possibility of the creation of the transfinite, then, from his all-grace and splendor, we infer the necessity that the creation of the transfinite in fact has happened. (G. Cantor [3, p.&amp;nbsp;400])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The numbers are a free creation of human mind. ([[Richard Dedekind|R. Dedekind]] [3a, p.&amp;nbsp;III])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Opposition from the Intuitionist school==
The mathematical meaning of the term "actual" in '''actual infinity''' is synonymous with '''definite''', '''completed''', '''extended''' or '''existential''',&lt;ref name="Kleene 1952/1971:48."&gt;Kleene 1952/1971:48.&lt;/ref&gt; but not to be mistaken for ''physically existing''. The question of whether [[Natural number|natural]] or [[real numbers]] form definite sets is therefore independent of the question of whether infinite things exist physically in [[nature]].

Proponents of [[intuitionism]], from [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] onwards, reject the claim that there are actually infinite mathematical objects or sets. Consequently, they reconstruct the foundations of mathematics in a way that does not assume the existence of actual infinities.  On the other hand, [[constructive analysis]] does accept the existence of the completed infinity of the integers.

For intuitionists, infinity is described as ''potential''; terms synonymous with this notion are ''becoming'' or ''constructive''.&lt;ref name="Kleene 1952/1971:48."/&gt; For example, [[Stephen Kleene]] describes the notion of a [[Turing machine]] tape as "a linear 'tape', (potentially) infinite in both directions."&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952/1971:48 p. 357; also "the machine ... is supplied with a tape having a (potentially) infinite printing ..." (p. 363).&lt;/ref&gt; To access memory on the tape, a Turing machine moves a ''read head'' along it in finitely many steps: the tape is therefore only "potentially" infinite, since while there is always the ability to take another step, infinity itself is never actually reached.&lt;ref&gt;Or, the "tape" may be fixed and the reading "head" may move. Roger Penrose suggests this because: "For my own part, I feel a little uncomfortable about having our finite device moving a potentially infinite tape backwards and forwards. No matter how lightweight its material, an ''infinite'' tape might be hard to shift!" Penrose's drawing shows a fixed tape head labelled "TM" reading limp tape from boxes extending to the visual vanishing point. (Cf page 36 in Roger Penrose, 1989, ''The Emperor's New Mind'', Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, {{ISBN|0-19-851973-7}}). Other authors solve this problem by tacking on more tape when the machine is about to run out.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematicians generally accept actual infinities.&lt;ref&gt;Actual infinity follows from, for example, the acceptance of the notion of the integers as a set, see J J O'Connor and E F Robertson, [ [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Infinity.html "Infinity"].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Cantor]] is the most significant mathematician who defended actual infinities, equating the [[Absolute Infinite]] with God. He decided that it is possible for natural and real numbers to be definite sets, and that if one rejects the axiom of Euclidean finiteness (that states that actualities, singly and in aggregates, are necessarily finite), then one is not involved in any [[contradiction]].

The philosophical problem of actual infinity concerns whether the notion is coherent and epistemically sound.

==Classical set theory==
Classical set theory accepts the notion of actual, completed infinities.  However, some [[finitism|finitist]] philosophers of mathematics and constructivists object to the notion.&lt;blockquote&gt;If the positive number ''n'' becomes infinitely great, the expression 1/''n'' goes to naught (or gets infinitely small). In this sense one speaks of the improper or potential infinite. In sharp and clear contrast the set just considered is a readily finished, locked infinite set, fixed in itself, containing infinitely many exactly defined elements (the natural numbers) none more and none less. ([[Adolf Abraham Halevi Fraenkel|A. Fraenkel]] [4, p.&amp;nbsp;6])&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus the conquest of actual infinity may be considered an expansion of our scientific horizon no less revolutionary than the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] or than the theory of relativity, or even of quantum and nuclear physics. (A. Fraenkel [4, p.&amp;nbsp;245])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To look at the universe of all sets not as a fixed entity but as an entity capable of "growing", i.e., we are able to "produce" bigger and bigger sets. (A. Fraenkel et al. [5, p.&amp;nbsp;118])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;([[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]]) maintains that a veritable continuum which is not denumerable can be obtained as a medium of free development; that is to say, besides the points which exist (are ready) on account of their definition by laws, such as e, pi, etc. other points of the continuum are not ready but develop as so-called [[choice sequence]]s. (A. Fraenkel et al. [5, p.&amp;nbsp;255])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intuitionists reject the very notion of an arbitrary sequence of integers, as denoting something finished and definite as illegitimate. Such a sequence is considered to be a growing object only and not a finished one. (A. Fraenkel et al. [5, p.&amp;nbsp;236])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Until then, no one envisioned the possibility that infinities come in different sizes, and moreover, mathematicians had no use for “actual infinity.” The arguments using infinity, including the Differential [[Calculus]] of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], do not require the use of infinite sets. (T. Jech [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/#1])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Owing to the gigantic simultaneous efforts of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] and Cantor, the infinite was set on a throne and revelled in its total triumph. In its daring flight the infinite reached dizzying heights of success. ([[David Hilbert|D. Hilbert]] [6, p.&amp;nbsp;169])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the most vigorous and fruitful branches of mathematics [...] a paradise created by Cantor from which nobody shall ever expel us [...] the most admirable blossom of the mathematical mind and altogether one of the outstanding achievements of man's purely intellectual activity. (D. Hilbert on set theory [6])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Finally, let us return to our original topic, and let us draw the conclusion from all our reflections on the infinite. The overall result is then: The infinite is nowhere realized. Neither is it present in nature nor is it admissible as a foundation of our rational thinking – a remarkable harmony between being and thinking. (D. Hilbert [6, 190])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Infinite totalities do not exist in any sense of the word (i.e., either really or ideally). More precisely, any mention, or purported mention, of infinite totalities is, literally, meaningless. ([[Abraham Robinson|A. Robinson]] [10, p.&amp;nbsp;507])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Indeed, I think that there is a real need, in formalism and elsewhere, to link our understanding of mathematics with our understanding of the physical world.  (A. Robinson)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Georg Cantor's grand meta-narrative, Set Theory, created by him almost singlehandedly in the span of about fifteen years, resembles a piece of high art more than a scientific theory. ([[Yuri Manin|Y. Manin]] [https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0209244])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, exquisite minimalism of expressive means is used by Cantor to achieve a sublime goal: understanding infinity, or rather infinity of infinities. (Y. Manin [https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0209244])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no actual infinity, that the Cantorians have forgotten and have been trapped by contradictions. ([[Henri Poincaré|H. Poincaré]] [Les mathématiques et la logique III, Rev. métaphys. morale '''14''' (1906) p.&amp;nbsp;316])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the objects of discussion are linguistic entities [...] then that collection of entities may vary as a result of discussion about them. A consequence of this is that the "natural numbers" of today are not the same as the "natural numbers" of yesterday. (D. Isles [http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.ndjfl/1093634481&amp;abstract=])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are at least two different ways of looking at the numbers: as a completed infinity and as an incomplete infinity... regarding the numbers as an incomplete infinity offers a viable and interesting alternative to regarding the numbers as a completed infinity, one that leads to great simplifications in some areas of mathematics and that has strong connections with problems of computational complexity. (E. Nelson [http://www.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/papers/e.pdf])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the renaissance, particularly with [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]], actual infinity transfers from God to the world. The finite world models of contemporary science clearly show how this power of the idea of actual infinity has ceased with classical (modern) physics. Under this aspect, the inclusion of actual infinity into mathematics, which explicitly started with G. Cantor only towards the end of the last century, seems displeasing. Within the intellectual overall picture of our century ... actual infinity brings about an impression of anachronism. ([[Paul Lorenzen|P. Lorenzen]][http://www.sgipt.org/wisms/geswis/mathe/lor01.gif])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An '''alphanumeric grid''' (also known as '''atlas grid'''&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/atlas+grid Retrieved 2010-03-22.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a simple [[coordinate system]] on a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] in which each cell is identified by a combination of a letter and a number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa%3Dknowledgebase.gisDictionary.search%26search%3Dtrue%26searchTerm%3Dalphanumeric+grid |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010070525/http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.gisDictionary.search |archivedate=2007-10-10 |df= }} Retrieved 2010-03-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage over numeric coordinates, which use two numbers instead of a number and a letter to refer to a grid cell, is that there can be no confusion over which coordinate refers to which direction. As an easy example, one could think about battleship; simply match the number at the top to the number on the bottom, then follow the two lines until they meet in a spot.


[[Algebraic chess notation]] uses an alphanumeric grid to refer to the squares of a [[chessboard]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook?id=125&amp;view=article ''Appendices'' in [[FIDE|World Chess Federation]] Handbook: see part ''C.7'' of section ''C.

In the field of [[computer security]], Anderson's rule refers to a principle formulated by [[Ross J. Anderson]]: by their nature large [[database]]s will never be free of abuse by breaches of security. If a large system is designed for ease of access it becomes insecure; if made watertight it becomes impossible to use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/henryporter/2009/aug/10/id-card-database-breach Guardian newspaper article on a security breach, in which Anderson's Rule is formulated]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6768">'''Asquith Camile Xavier''' was a West Indian-born Briton who ended a [[colour bar]] at [[British Railways]] in [[London]] by fighting to become the first non-white [[train guard]] at [[Euston railway station]] in [[1966]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/15/newsid_3043000/3043439.stm|title=Euston staff 'colour bar' ended|accessdate=2018-07-17|date=1966-07-15|work=On This Day|publisher=BBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307123432/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/15/newsid_3043000/3043439.stm|archivedate=2008-03-07|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Oona King]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07zzr8r "Asquith's Fight for Equality"], [[BBC Radio 4]], 2016-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= RAILWAY COLOR BAR IS BROKEN IN LONDON |date= July 16, 1966| url=https://nyti.ms/2LsIzEX|publisher=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trevor Phillips]], the chairman of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]], said in 2006: "Asquith's stand against discrimination brought to light the inadequacy of early race discrimination laws and persistent widespread discrimination faced by ethnic minorities." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/first-class-hero-633709|title= FIRST-CLASS HERO: Forty years ago, this man changed the face of race relations in Britain after beating a colour bar on the railways |accessdate=2018-07-26|date=2006-07-15|work=The Mirror|publisher=MGN | }}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque at the station commemorates his achievement. 

Xavier was born on 18 July 1920 in [[Dominica]], which was then a British colony. He was a member of the [[Windrush generation]] of British African-Caribbean people who migrated to the United Kingdom after the second world war to fill vacancies in service industries. 

==Discrimination==

Xavier joined [[British Railways]]. In 1966 he was working as a guard at [[Marylebone station]] in central London. He applied for a promotion and transfer to work at Euston, but was rejected. A letter from a staff committee at Euston—which was dominated by members of the [[National Union of Railwaymen]]—explained it was because of his colour. Unions and management had informally agreed in the 1950s to ban non-white people from jobs at Euston that involved contact with the public; they could be cleaners and labourers, but not guards or ticket collectors.

The [[Race_Relations_Act_1965|Race Relations Act]] of 1965 had made discrimination on "grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origins" unlawful in public places in [[Great Britain]] (but not [[Northern Ireland]]). Xavier could not use this legislation to further his case as it did not cover workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/8/newsid_4457000/4457112.stm|title=1965: New UK race law 'not tough enough' |accessdate=2018-07-26|date=1965-12-08|work=On This Day|publisher=BBC News| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xavier persisted. A union official publicised the rejection by writing a letter of protest to the head of the National Union of Railwaymen on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Colour bar protest over railman.|last=|first=|date=11 July 1966|work=The Times (London, England)|access-date=|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[member of parliament|members of parliament]] wrote to the [[secretary of state for transport]], [[Barbara Castle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1966-07-15/debates/b65aca94-436b-4d17-90a6-3a40aaa9716c/ColouredWorkers|title=Coloured Workers - Hansard|website=hansard.parliament.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ask her to direct British Railways to end racial discrimination. 
On 15 July 1966 British Railways announced that colour bars at stations in London had been abandoned. Xavier was offered the job with his pay backdated to May, which was when he had been originally rejected.
Xavier could not take up the job immediately as he was recovering from hospital treatment for an ulcer. He received hate mail and death threats, and asked for police protection. He started work on 15 August 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Mirror Reporter |title=CLOCKING ON .. A RAIL PIONEER |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000560/19660816/024/0004 |accessdate=19 August 2018 |publisher=Daily Mirror |date=16 August 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Xavier died in 1980 in [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]], [[Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;"England and Wales Death Registration Index 1837-2007," database, ''FamilySearch''(&lt;nowiki&gt;https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVZ9-G3T1&lt;/nowiki&gt; : 4 September 2014), Asquith Camile Xavier, 1980; from "England &amp; Wales Deaths, 1837-2006," database, ''findmypast''(&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.findmypast.com&lt;/nowiki&gt; : 2012); citing Death Registration, Chatham, Kent, England, General Register Office, Southport, England.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
[[Oona King]] presented a [[BBC Radio 4]] documentary, "Asquith's Fight for Equality", about his story in 2016—the fiftieth anniversary of his victory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oona King]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07zzr8r "Asquith's Fight for Equality"], [[BBC Radio 4]], 2016-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, [[The One Show]] on [[BBC One]] television interviewed Xavier's family and covered the unveiling of the plaque at Euston station that marked his fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04b5rtp|title=Busting the colour bar, 06/10/2016, The One Show - BBC One|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denunciation ("call-outs") can happen in person or [[Online shaming|online]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friedersdorf|first1=Conor|title=The Destructiveness of Call-Out Culture on Campus: Reflections from undergraduates of the social media era|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/call-out-culture-is-stressing-out-college-students/524679/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=October 21, 2017|date=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Danuta Walters|first1=Suzanna|title=Academe's Poisonous Call-Out Culture|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Academe-s-Poisonous-Call-Out/240016|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=October 21, 2017|date=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Shaun |title=In Defense of Call-out Culture |url=https://www.cityartsmagazine.com/defense-call-culture/ |publisher=City Arts Magazine |accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="av"&gt;Vansintjan, Aaron.

Some commentators contend that callout culture is a pernicious influence in both the academic and business worlds, citing the [[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber|controversy at Google]] over a memorandum concerning the respective vocational interests of men and women, authored by former Google engineer [[James Damore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paresky|first1=Pamela|title=When 'Speak Out' Culture Becomes 'Callout' Culture: Welcome to the world of post-rational discourse|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-and-the-pursuit-leadership/201709/when-speak-out-culture-becomes-callout-culture|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=October 21, 2017|date=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators have argued that callout culture can harm [[Progressivism|progressive]] politics by attacking people perceived to have exhibited prejudiced behaviour, rather than using dialogue with such people to change such behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Asam. (March 2, 2015) [https://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/a-note-on-call-out-culture "A Note on Call-Out Culture"]. ''[[Briarpatch]]'' Magazine. Retrieved August 3rd, 2018.  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamad, Ruby, and Liddle, Celeste. (11 October 2017) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/11/intersectionality-not-while-feminists-participate-in-pile-ons "Intersectionality? Not while feminists participate in pile-ons"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved August 3rd, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 essay, "Exiting the Vampire Castle", by [[Mark Fisher (theorist)|Mark Fisher]], is often cited as an early critique of call-out culture. Fisher argued that "call-out culture" created a space where "where solidarity is impossible, but guilt and fear are omnipresent". Fisher also argues that call-out
culture reduces every political issue to criticizing the behaviour of individuals, instead of dealing with such political issues through collective action. &lt;ref name="av" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izaakson, Jen. (August 12, 2017 )[https://www.feministcurrent.com/2017/08/12/kill-normies-skewers-online-identity-politics/ ‘Kill All Normies’ skewers online identity politics]  Feminist Current. Retrieved 23 November 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

Call-out culture found a vehicle in social media. Both as consumers and as political activists, individuals found a means to communicate to a larger crowd in an expedient and pervasive manner. While call-out culture often publicly denounces perceived acts of bigotry, as stated above, it also refers to the act of publicly calling out a larger entity (such as an organization, business or vendor) usually by means of social media. In an effort to hold these businesses or organizations accountable, individuals will take to the online forums to "call them out". Whether the individual is addressed by a representative from within the organization or not, some of these posts or tweets (depending on the medium) can go viral and cause a PR headache for the business. 

The effects of call-out culture are also noted as more prevalent today on college-campuses, where most students are aware of the social justice culture that exists and is expressed online. There are some that are careful to avoid missteps (ex: cultural appropriation by way of a Halloween costume) in order to avoid public online call-outs and others that are exploring ways to deal with past aggressors by way of call-out online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/call-out-culture-is-stressing-out-college-students/524679/|title=The Destructiveness of Call-Out Culture on Campus|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|date=2017-05-08|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people argue in defense of call-out culture and contend that it is a form of social activism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cityartsmagazine.com/defense-call-culture/|title=In Defense of Call-out Culture|last=Scott|first=Shaun|date=February 1, 2018|work=City Arts Magazine|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual calling someone out is ultimately trying to either stop behavior they deem to be negative or prevent it from happening again. Others argue that the call-out culture today tends to be too aggressive and can often have life-altering affects on the individual being called out. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-call-in-mean-when-call-out-culture-feels-toxic-this-method-can-be-used-instead-9056343|title=This Is What It Means To Call Someone In, Instead Of Calling Them Out|last=Rodriguez-Cayro|first=Kyli|work=Bustle|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearson, Ph.D. {{!}} Author {{!}} The Hero Within|website=www.carolspearson.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''Carol S. Pearson''' is an author and educator. She develops new theories and models with an applied practical bent, building on the work of psychiatrist [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]], psychoanalyst [[James Hillman]], mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], and other [[Depth psychology|depth psychologists]].

Pearson is best known as the author of ''The Hero Within: Six Archetypes We Live By'' (1986, 1989, 1998), which was a [[HarperCollins|HarperSanFrancisco]] best-seller, followed by the more expansive ''Awakening the Heroes Within: Twelve Archetypes to Help Us Find Ourselves and Transform Our World'' (1991)''.'' With the assistance of Hugh Marr, she co-created the Pearson-Marr Archetype Indicator (PMAI), published by the Center for Applications of Psychological Type (CAPT), to help people better understand their motivations, their unconscious assumptions, and the narratives they think, tell, and live.

Her most recent book,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carolspearson.com/publications/persephone-rising-awakening-the-heroine-within/|title=Persephone Rising: Awakening the Heroine Within {{!}} Carol S. Pearson, Ph.D. {{!}} Author {{!}} The Hero Within|website=www.carolspearson.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;''Persephone Rising: Awakening The Heroine Within'', published in October 2015, bridges the genres of [[depth psychology]], myth scholarship, and [[memoir]]. It draws on archetypal stories from an ancient [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greek mystery religion]] as a guide to thriving today in a world in flux. It concludes with an analysis of narrative intelligence as an important aspect of emotional intelligence that also builds cognitive complexity. In April 2016, ''Persephone Rising'' received a gold medal from the [[Nautilus Book Awards]] in the category of books for women.

In addition to such books written for the general public, Pearson has made major contributions to the fields of education, marketing and branding, organizational development, and leadership through publications such as ''Educating the Majority: Women Challenge Tradition in Higher Education'', co-editors, Donna L. Shavlik and Judith G.

==Early life and education==

Pearson was born in [[Chicago]] in 1944, the eldest child of Thelma (Widman) and John A. Pearson. At the age of two, she moved with her family to [[Houston|Houston, TX]], where she attended Houston public schools and later [http://www.rice.edu Rice University], from which she received a BA (1966), MA, (1968), and PhD (1970). She has one younger sibling, John Douglas Pearson. She is married to David R. Merkowitz, a political and public affairs consultant, and has two step-children,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdfifund.gov/about/Pages/Staff-and-Board.aspx|title=Staff &amp; Board|website=www.cdfifund.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Merkowitz, who works at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of the Treasury]], and &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/stephen.m.merkowitz|title=Bio - Dr. Stephen M Merkowitz|website=science.gsfc.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Merkowitz, a gravitational physicist at [[Goddard Space Flight Center|NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center]], and a daughter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://web.uri.edu/politicalscience/meet/shanna-pearson-merkowitz/|title=Shanna Pearson-Merkowitz - department of political science|work=department of political science|access-date=2017-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shanna Pearson-Merkowitz, a political science professor at the [[University of Rhode Island]], as well as six grandchildren.

Pearson began her study of archetypal theory and narrative intelligence in the [http://english.rice.edu/home/ English Department at Rice University], which emphasized the myth/symbol school of [[Literary criticism|literary studies]]. Later in her career, she earned a [[Doctor of Ministry]] degree from [http://www.wisdomuniversity.org Wisdom University (2012)], a graduate school originally called the University of Creation Spirituality, and now a part of Ubiquity University, that explores the progressive mystic traditions in religions throughout the world. She also holds an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] degree from [http://www.norwich.edu Norwich University.]

== Academic career ==
Pearson’s academic career began with a series of faculty positions in the 1970s. First hired as an assistant professor in the [http://www.colorado.edu/academics/programs/english English Department at the University of Colorado], she was selected as the founding director of the CU Women Studies Program and was instrumental in developing ''[https://frontiers.osu.edu Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies]'', one of the earliest academic journals in the field. She subsequently was recruited to be the first director of the [http://wmst.umd.edu Women’s Studies Program at the University of Maryland, College Park], where she negotiated to bring the offices of the [http://www.nwsa.org National Women's Studies Association] and the journal ''[[Feminist Studies]]'' to the campus.

During her tenure at UMD, Pearson was selected to be a fellow in the American Council on Education Fellows Program, the nation’s premier higher education leadership development program. She spent her fellowship year at the [http://www.uncc.edu University of North Carolina at Charlotte], working with the chancellor of the university and other senior administrators. Upon returning to UMD, she accepted an invitation to spend part of her time as a visiting scholar at the [http://www.acenet.edu/leadership/programs/Pages/ACE-Fellows-Program.aspx American Council on Education’s] Center for Leadership Development. She also worked with ACE’s Office of Women in Higher Education to develop “The New Agenda of Women for Higher Education.”

As Pearson moved into leadership positions, she began to explore leadership studies scholarship. She worked at two women’s colleges, serving first as Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of [http://www.goucher.edu Goucher College] in Towson, MD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/06/science/education-women-s-college-faces-the-inevitable-men.html|title=WOMEN'S COLLEGE FACES THE INEVITABLE: MEN|date=6 May 1986|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later as Dean of the Mount Vernon Institute at [http://www.mvnu.edu Mount Vernon College] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]. From 1998 to 2005, Pearson was Senior Editor of ''The Inner Edge: A Resource for Enlightened Business Practice'', published bi-monthly by InnoVision Communications''',''' and then the Director of the Transformational Leadership Certificate Program at the Center for Professional Development at Georgetown University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scs.georgetown.edu/programs_nc/CE0127/transformational-leadership?gclid=CPeFj4mD3NICFcSKswodnNYHEQ|title=Executive Certificate in Transformational Leadership|publisher=Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies|website=scs.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, she also was President of [https://greatnonprofits.org/org/meristem Meristem], a nonprofit education and training organization.

From 2005 to 2009, Pearson served as Director of the [[James MacGregor Burns|James MacGregor Burns Academy of Leadership]] in the School of Public Policy at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. The academy incubated the International Leadership Association, of which she was a member of the board of directors. She also co-led a Leadership for Transformation project, out of which grew her edited volume ''The Transforming Leader'', which was honored by the International Leadership Association at its 2014 global conference for making a significant contribution to the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ila-net.org/conferences/2014/2014-ILA-program.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Pearson left UMD to take a position as Executive Vice President and Provost at [http://www.pacifica.edu Pacifica Graduate Institute] in [[Carpinteria, California]], later becoming the school’s President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/10/prweb8859261.htm|title=Pacifica Graduate Institute Welcomes New President, Establishes Chancellor Position|work=prweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacifica offers graduate degrees in Jungian and archetypal studies, psychology, mythology, and several other fields. Since leaving Pacifica in 2013, Pearson has continued to write, teach, consult, and lead workshops, but has retired from academic leadership.

Pearson’s current interests have expanded from exploring archetypes in organizations and individuals to their role in social systems. In 2009, she wrote a monograph for the [[Fetzer Institute]], called &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fetzer.org/sites/default/files/images/resources/attachment/2012-07-12/dad_pearson_essay.pdf|title=Maturing the American Dream|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maturing the American Dream, which identified archetypes in U.S. culture and their likely implications for the future. Most recently, [http://www.carolspearson.com/blog/ Pearson’s blogs] and other social media communications have explored the interface between archetypal patterns in individuals and larger social groups as well as more general philosophical and psycho-spiritual issues.

{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
The '''carrying capacity''' of a biological [[species]] in an [[natural environment|environment]] is the maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain indefinitely, given the food, [[habitat]], [[drinking water|water]], and other [[Resource|necessities available]] in the environment. 
In [[population biology]], carrying capacity is defined as the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]'s maximal load,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hui | first1 = C | year = 2006 | title = Carrying capacity, population equilibrium, and environment's maximal load | url = | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 192 | issue = | pages = 317–320 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2005.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is different from the [[concept]] of population equilibrium. Its effect on [[population dynamics]] may be approximated in a [[logistic function|logistic model]], although this simplification ignores the possibility of [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot]] which real systems may exhibit.

Carrying capacity was originally used to determine the number of animals that could graze on a segment of land without destroying it.  Later, the idea was expanded to more complex populations, like humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carrying Capacity|url=http://www.sustainablescale.org/ConceptualFramework/UnderstandingScale/MeasuringScale/CarryingCapacity.aspx|website=The Sustainable Scale Project|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[human population]], more complex variables such as [[sanitation]] and [[Health care|medical care]] are sometimes considered as part of the necessary establishment. As population density increases, [[birth rate]] often increases and [[death rate]] typically decreases. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is the "natural increase". The carrying capacity could support a positive natural increase or could require a negative natural increase. Thus, the carrying capacity is the number of individuals an environment can support without significant negative impacts to the given organism and its environment. Below carrying capacity, populations typically increase, while above, they typically decrease. A factor that keeps population size at equilibrium is known as a [[regulating factor]]. [[Population decline|Population size decreases]] above carrying capacity due to a range of factors depending on the [[species]] concerned, but can include insufficient [[space]], [[Food security|food supply]], or [[sunlight]]. The carrying capacity of an [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] may vary for different species and may change over time due to a variety of factors including: [[Food security|food availability]], [[water supply]], environmental conditions and living space.
The origins of the term "carrying capacity" are uncertain, with researchers variously stating that it was used "in the context of international [[shipping]]"&lt;ref name="informaworld.com"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sayre |first1=N. F. |year=2008 |title=The Genesis, History, and Limits of Carrying Capacity |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=98 |issue= |pages=120–134 |publisher= |doi= 10.1080/00045600701734356|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a791001773&amp;db=all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that it was first used during 19th-century laboratory experiments with micro-organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerer, K.S., [http://dusk.geo.orst.edu/prosem/PDFs/human_geog.pdf "Human Geography and the "New Ecology": The Prospect of Promise and Integration"], ''Annals of the Assoc. of American Geo.'', '''84'''(1), 108–125, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review finds the first use of the term in an 1845 report by the [[US Secretary of State]] to the [[US Senate]].&lt;ref name="informaworld.com"/&gt;

Several estimates of the carrying capacity have been made with a wide range of population numbers. A 2001 UN report said that two-thirds of the estimates fall in the range of 4 billion to 16 billion with unspecified standard errors, with a median of about 10 billion.&lt;ref name="UN World Population Report 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpm/wpm2001.pdf|format=PDF|title=UN World Population Report 2001|page=31|accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent estimates are much lower, particularly if [[resource depletion|non-renewable resource depletion]] and [[Overconsumption|increased consumption]] are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in habitat quality or human behavior at any time might increase or reduce carrying capacity. In the view of [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul and Anne Ehrlich]], "for earth as a whole (including those parts of it we call Australia and the United States), human beings are far above carrying capacity today."&lt;ref name=Nineveh-Book/&gt;

The application of the concept of carrying capacity for the [[human population]] has been criticized for not successfully capturing the multi-layered processes between humans and the environment, which have a nature of fluidity and [[non-equilibrium]], and for sometimes being employed in a [[Victim blaming|blame-the-victim]] framework.&lt;ref name=Cliggett&gt;Cliggett, L., "Carrying Capacity's New Guise: Folk Models for Public Debate and Longitudinal Study of Environmental Change", ''[[Africa Today]]'', '''48'''(1), 2-19, (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Although the quote may be good the author doesn't reference anything when making it [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-80493292/carrying-capacity-new-guise.html 1]--&gt;  

Supporters of the concept argue that the idea of a limited carrying capacity is just as valid applied to humans as when applied to any other species. Animal population size, living standards, and resource depletion vary, but the concept of carrying capacity still applies. The number of people is not the only factor in the carrying capacity of Earth. [[Waste]] and [[over-consumption]], especially by wealthy and near-wealthy people and nations, are also putting significant strain on the environment together with [[human overpopulation]]. Population and consumption together appear to be at the core of many human problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/consumption_dwarfs_population_as_main_environmental_threat/2140/|title=Consumption Dwarfs Population as Main Environmental Threat|date=2009-04-13|publisher=Yale University|author=Fred Pearce|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nineveh-Book&gt;{{citation

===Factors that govern carrying capacity===
Some aspects of a system's carrying capacity may involve matters such as available supplies of [[food supply|food]], [[water supply|water]], raw materials, and/or other similar resources. In addition, there are other factors that govern carrying capacity which may be less instinctive or less intuitive in nature, such as ever-increasing and/or ever-accumulating levels of [[waste]]s, [[environmental damage|damage]], and/or eradication of essential components of any complex functioning system.  Eradication of, for example, large or critical portions of any [[complex system]] (envision a space vehicle, for instance, or an airplane, or an automobile, or computer code, or the body components of a living vertebrate) can interrupt essential processes and dynamics in ways that induce systems failures or unexpected collapse. (As an example of these latter factors, the "carrying capacity" of a complex system such an airplane is more than a matter of available food, or water, or available seating, but also reflects total weight carried and presumes that its passengers do not damage, destroy, or eradicate parts, [[Door|doors]], windows, wings, engine parts, fuel, and oil, and so forth.) Thus, on a global scale, food and similar resources may affect planetary carrying capacity to some extent so long as Earth's human passengers do not dismantle, eradicate, or otherwise destroy critical [[biosphere|biospheric]] life-support capacities for essential processes of self-maintenance, [[self-perpetuation]], and [[self-repair mechanisms|self-repair]].

Thus, carrying capacity interpretations that focus solely on resource limitations alone (such as food) may neglect wider functional factors.  If the humans neither gain nor lose weight in the long-term, the calculation is fairly accurate. If the quantity of food is invariably equal to the "Y" amount, carrying capacity has been reached. Humans, with the need to enhance their reproductive success (see Richard Dawkins' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''{{Verify source|date=May 2009}}&lt;!-- the gene-centric model of evolution is disputed, in particular in sentient species. Contrast with the Expanded Phenotype, also by Dawkins --&gt;), understand that food supply can vary and also that other factors in the environment can alter humans' need for food. A house, for example, might mean that one does not need to eat as much to stay warm as one otherwise would. Over time, monetary transactions have replaced barter and local production, and consequently modified local human carrying capacity. However, purchases also impact regions thousands of miles away. For example, [[carbon dioxide]] from an [[automobile]] travels to the upper atmosphere. This led [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] to develop the [[I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PAT]] equation.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, P.R., Holdren, J.P., "Impact of Population Growth", [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], '''171'''(3977), 1212–1217, (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{math|1=''I'' = ''P'' ∙ ''A'' ∙ ''T''}}
where:
: ''I'' is the impact on the environment resulting from consumption
: ''P'' is the population number
: ''A'' is the consumption per capita (affluence)
: ''T'' is the technology factor
[[File:Logistic curve examples.png|thumb|This is a graph of the population due to the logistic curve model.  When the population is above the carrying capacity it decreases, and when it is below the carrying capacity it increases.]]
An important model related to carrying capacity (K), is the logistic, growth curve. The logistic growth curve depicts a more realistic version of how population growth rate, available resources, and the carrying capacity are inter-connected. As illustrated in the logistic growth curve model, when the population size is small and there are many resources available, population over-time increases and so does the growth rate. However, as population size nears the carrying capacity and resources become limited, the growth rate decreases and population starts to level out at K. This model is based on the assumption that carrying capacity does not change. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that carrying capacity of a population can increase or decrease and there are various factors that affect it. For instance, an increase in the population growth can lead to over-exploitation of necessary natural resources and therefore decrease the overall carrying capacity of that environment.&lt;ref&gt;Swafford, Angela Lynn.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology can play a role in the dynamics of carrying capacity and while this can sometimes be positive,&lt;ref&gt;Martire, S., Castellani, V., &amp; Sala, S. (2015). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.11.002 Carrying capacity assessment of forest resources: Enhancing environmental sustainability in energy production at local scale] Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 94, 11-20. doi: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.11.002]&lt;/ref&gt; in other cases its influence can be problematic. For example, it has been suggested that in the past that the [[Neolithic]] revolution increased the carrying capacity of the world relative to humans through the invention of agriculture.  In a similar way, viewed from the perspective of foods, the use of [[fossil fuel]]s has been alleged to artificially increase the carrying capacity of the world by the use of stored sunlight, even though that food production does not guarantee the capacity of the Earth's climatic and [[Biosphere|biospheric]] life-support systems to withstand the damage and wastes arising from such fossil fuels.  However, such interpretations presume the continued and uninterrupted functioning of all other critical components of the global system.  It has also been suggested that other technological advances that have increased the carrying capacity of the world relative to humans are: [[polder]]s, [[fertilizer]], [[composting]], [[greenhouse]]s, [[land reclamation]], and [[fish farming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} In an adverse way, however, many technologies enable economic entities and individual humans to inflict far more damage and eradication, far more quickly and efficiently on a wider-scale than ever. Examples include machine guns, chainsaws, earth-movers, and the capacity of industrialized fishing fleets to capture and harvest targeted fish species faster than the fish themselves can reproduce are examples of such problematic outcomes of technology.

[[Agricultural capability]] on Earth expanded in the last quarter of the 20th century. But now there are many projections of a continuation of the decline in world agricultural capability (and hence carrying capacity) which began in the 1990s. Most conspicuously, China's food production is forecast to decline by 37% by the last half of the 21st century, placing a strain on the entire carrying capacity of the world, as China's population could expand to about 1.5 billion people by the year 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Economy, E., ''China vs. Earth'', The Nation, May 7, 2007 issue&lt;/ref&gt; This reduction in China's agricultural capability (as in other world regions) is largely due to the world [[water crisis]] and especially due to mining [[groundwater]] beyond sustainable yield, which has been happening in China since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, R., ''The Little Green Handbook'', [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]], (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-312-42581-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lester Brown]] of the [[Earth Policy Institute]], has said: "It would take 1.5 Earths to sustain our present level of consumption. Environmentally, the world is in an [[overshoot (population)|overshoot]] mode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Ecological footprint===
One way to estimate human [[demand]] compared to ecosystem's carrying capacity is "[[ecological footprint]]" accounting. Rather than speculating about future possibilities and limitations imposed by carrying capacity constraints, Ecological Footprint accounting provides empirical, non-speculative assessments of the past. It compares historic regeneration rates, [[biocapacity]], against historical human [[demand]], [[ecological footprint]], in the same year.&lt;ref name="WS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wackernagel | first1 = M. | last2 = Schulz | first2 = N.B. | display-authors = etal |year=2002 |title="Tracking the ecological overshoot of the human economy |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/14/9266.short |journal=[[PNAS|Proc.

There is also concern of the ability of countries around to globe to decrease and maintain their ecological footprints.

{{Italic title}}
The [[Latin]] term '''''characteristica universalis''''', commonly interpreted as ''universal characteristic'', or ''universal character'' in English, is a universal and formal language imagined by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] able to express mathematical, scientific, and metaphysical concepts. Leibniz thus hoped to create a language usable within the framework of a universal logical calculation or ''[[calculus ratiocinator]]''.

The ''characteristica universalis'' is a recurring concept in the writings of Leibniz. When writing in French, he sometimes employed the phrase ''spécieuse générale'' to the same effect. The concept is sometimes paired with his notion of a ''calculus ratiocinator'' and with his plans for an encyclopaedia as a compendium of all human knowledge.

==A universal pictographic language: the key to all the sciences==

===International communication===
Many Leibniz scholars writing in English seem to agree that he intended his ''characteristica universalis'' or "universal character" to be a form of [[pasigraphy]], or [[ideographic language]]. This was to be based on a rationalised version of the 'principles' of [[Chinese character]]s, as Europeans understood these characters in the seventeenth century. From this perspective it is common to find the ''characteristica universalis'' associated with contemporary [[universal language]] projects like [[Esperanto]], [[auxiliary languages]] like [[Interlingua]], and formal logic projects like [[Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''. The global expansion of European commerce in Leibniz's time provided mercantilist motivations for a universal language of trade so that traders could communicate with any natural language.

Others, such as Jaenecke, for example, have observed that Leibniz also had other intentions for the ''characteristica universalis'', and these aspects appear to be a source of the aforementioned vagueness and inconsistency in modern interpretations. According to Jaenecke,

{{quote|text=the Leibniz project is not a matter of logic but rather one of knowledge representation, a field largely unexploited in today's logic-oriented epistemology and philosophy of science. It is precisely this one-sided orientation of these disciplines, which is responsible for the distorted picture of Leibniz's work found in the literature.|source=Jaenecke 1996}}

As Couturat wrote, Leibniz criticized the linguistic systems of [[George Dalgarno]] and [[John Wilkins]] for this reason since they focused on

{{quote|text=...practical uses rather than scientific utility, that is, for being chiefly artificial languages intended for international communication and not philosophical languages that would express the logical relations of concepts. He favors, and opposes to them, the true "real characteristic," which would express the composition of concepts by the combination of signs representing their simple elements, such that the correspondence between composite ideas and their symbols would be natural and no longer conventional.|source=Couturat, 1901, chpt. 3}}

===A universal language of science===
Leibniz said that his goal was an [[alphabet of human thought]], a universal symbolic language (characteristic) for [[science]], [[mathematics]] and [[metaphysics]]. According to Couturat, "In May 1676, he once again identified the universal language with the characteristic and dreamed of a language that would also be a calculus—a sort of algebra of thought" (1901, chp 3.). This characteristic was a universalisation of the various "real characteristics". Couturat wrote that Leibniz gave Egyptian and Chinese hieroglyphics and chemical signs as examples of ''real characteristics'' writing:

{{quote|text=This shows that the real characteristic was for him an ideography, that is, a system of signs that directly represent things (or, rather, ideas) and not words, in such a way that each nation could read them and translate them into its own language.|source=Couturat, 1901, chpt. 3}}

In a footnote Couturat added:

{{quote|text=Elsewhere Leibniz even includes among the types of signs musical notes and astronomical signs (the signs of the zodiac and those of the planets, including the sun and the moon).  It should be noted that Leibniz sometimes employs planetary signs in place of letters in his algebraic calculations|source=Couturat, 1901, chpt. 3}}

===Metaphysics===
[[Hartley Rogers]] emphasised the metaphysical aspect of the ''characteristica universalis'' by relating it to the "elementary theory of the ordering of the reals," defining it as "a precisely definable system for making statements of science" (Rogers 1963: 934). Universal language projects like Esperanto, and formal logic projects like [[Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' are not commonly concerned with the epistemic synthesis of empirical science, mathematics, pictographs and metaphysics in the way Leibniz described. Hence scholars have had difficulty in showing how projects such as the ''Begriffsschrift'' and Esperanto embody the full vision Leibniz had for his ''characteristica''.

The writings of [[Alexander Gode]] suggested that Leibniz' ''characteristica'' had a metaphysical bias which prevented it from reflecting reality faithfully. Gode emphasized that Leibniz established certain goals or ''functions'' first, and then developed the ''characteristica'' to fulfill those functions.

===Science===
In the domain of science, Leibniz aimed for his ''characteristica'' to form diagrams or pictures, depicting any system at any scale, and understood by all regardless of native language. Leibniz wrote:

{{quote|text=And although learned men have long since thought of some kind of language or universal characteristic by which all concepts and things can be put into beautiful order, and with whose help different nations might communicate their thoughts and each read in his own language what another has written in his, yet no one has attempted a language or characteristic which includes at once both the arts of discovery and judgement, that is, one whose signs and characters serve the same purpose that arithmetical signs serve for numbers, and algebraic signs for quantities taken abstractly. Yet it does seem that since God has bestowed these two sciences on mankind, he has sought to notify us that a far greater secret lies hidden in our understanding, of which these are but the shadows.|source=Leibniz, ''Zur allgemeinen Charakteristik.'' Hauptschriften zur Grundlegung der Philosophie. Philosophische Werke Band 1. page 30-31. Translated by Artur Buchenau. Reviewed and with introduction and notes published by [[Ernst Cassirer]]. Hamburg: Felix Meiner. 1966. (Unless stated otherwise, all Leibniz quotations are from his ''On the General Characteristic'' as translated in Loemker 1969: 221&amp;ndash;25. This passage is from p. 222.)}}

P. P. Weiner raised an example of a large scale application of Leibniz's ''characteristica'' to climatic science. A weather-forecaster invented by [[Athanasius Kircher]] "interested Leibniz in connection with his own attempts to invent a universal language" (1940).

Leibniz talked about his dream of a universal scientific language at the very dawn of his career, as follows:

{{quote|text=We have spoken of the art of complication of the sciences, i.e., of inventive logic... But when the tables of categories of our art of complication have been formed, something greater will emerge. For let the first terms, of the combination of which all others consist, be designated by signs; these signs will be a kind of alphabet. It will be convenient for the signs to be as natural as possible&amp;mdash;e.g., for one, a point; for numbers, points; for the relations of one entity with another, lines; for the variation of angles and of extremities in lines, kinds of relations. If these are correctly and ingeniously established, this universal writing will be as easy as it is common,and will be capable of being read without any dictionary; at the same time, a fundamental knowledge of all things will be obtained. The whole of such a writing will be made of geometrical figures, as it were, and of a kind of pictures &amp;mdash; just as the ancient Egyptians did, and the Chinese do today. Their pictures, however, are not reduced to a fixed alphabet... with the result that a tremendous strain on the memory is necessary, which is the contrary of what we propose.|source=''On The Art of Combination'', 1666, translated in Parkinson 1966: 10&amp;ndash;11}}

[[Nicholas Rescher]], reviewing Cohen's 1954 article, wrote that:

{{quote|text=Leibniz's program of a universal science (''scientia universalis'') for coordinating all human knowledge into a systematic whole comprises two parts: (1) a universal notation (''characteristica universalis'') by use of which any item of information whatever can be recorded in a natural and systematic way, and (2) a means of manipulating the knowledge thus recorded in a computational fashion, so as to reveal its logical interrelations and consequences (the ''calculus ratiocinator'').|source=Rescher 1954}}

Near the end of his life, Leibniz wrote that combining metaphysics with mathematics and science through a universal character would require creating what he called:

{{quote|text=... a kind of ''general algebra'' in which all truths of reason would be reduced to a kind of calculus. At the same time, this would be a kind of universal language or writing, though infinitely different from all such languages which have thus far been proposed; for the characters and the words themselves would direct the mind, and the errors &amp;mdash; excepting those of fact &amp;mdash; would only be calculation mistakes. It would be very difficult to form or invent this language or characteristic, but very easy to learn it without any dictionaries.|source=Leibniz, letter to Nicolas Remond, 10 January 1714, in Loemker 1969: 654. Translation revised.}}

The universal "representation" of knowledge would therefore combine lines and points with "a kind of pictures" ([[pictographs]] or [[logogram]]s) to be manipulated by means of his ''calculus ratiocinator''. He hoped his pictorial algebra would advance the scientific treatment of qualitative phenomena, thereby constituting "that science in which are treated the forms or formulas of things in general, that is, quality in general" (''On Universal Synthesis and Analysis'', 1679, in Loemker 1969: 233).

===His diagrammatic reasoning===
[[Image:Characteristica universalis diagram.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Leibniz's diagrammatic reasoning.]]
Since the ''characteristica universalis'' is diagrammatic and employs [[pictograms]] (below left), the diagrams in Leibniz's work warrant close study. On at least two occasions, Leibniz illustrated his philosophical reasoning with diagrams. One diagram, the frontispiece to his 1666 ''[[De Arte Combinatoria]]'' (On the Art of Combinations), represents the Aristotelian theory of how all material things are formed from combinations of the elements earth, water, air, and fire. [[Image:LeibnizCharacters.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Basic elements of Leibniz's pictograms.]]

These four elements make up the four corners of a diamond (see picture to right). Opposing pairs of these are joined by a bar labeled "contraries" (earth-air, fire-water). At the four corners of the superimposed square are the four qualities defining the elements. Each adjacent pair of these is joined by a bar labeled "possible combination"; the diagonals joining them are labeled "impossible combination".  Starting from the top, fire is formed from the combination of dryness and heat; air from wetness and heat; water from coldness and wetness; earth from coldness and dryness. This diagram is reproduced in several texts including ''Saemtliche Schriften und Briefe'' (''Saemtliche Schriften und Briefe'', Reihe VI, Band 1: 166, Loemker 1969: 83, 366, Karl Popp and Erwin Stein 2000: 33).

===Leibniz loses will===
Leibniz rightly saw that creating the ''characteristica'' would be difficult, fixing the time required for devising it as follows: "I think that some selected men could finish the matter in five years" (Loemker 1969: 224), later remarking: "And so I repeat, what I have often said, that a man who is neither a prophet nor a prince can ever undertake any thing of greater good to mankind of more fitting for divine glory" (Loemker 1969: 225). But later in life, a more sober note emerged. In a March 1706 letter to the Electress [[Sophia of Hanover]], the spouse of his patron, he wrote:

{{quote|text=It is true that in the past I planned a new way of calculating suitable for matters which have nothing in common with mathematics, and if this kind of logic were put into practice, every reasoning, even probabilistic ones, would be like that of the mathematician: if need be, the lesser minds which had application and good will could, if not accompany the greatest minds, then at least follow them. For one could always say: let us calculate, and judge correctly through this, as much as the data and reason can provide us with the means for it. But I do not know if I will ever be in a position to carry out such a project, which requires more than one hand; and it even seems that mankind is still not mature enough to lay claim to the advantages which this method could provide.|source=Strickland 2011: 355}}

In another 1714 letter to Nicholas Remond, he wrote:

{{quote|text=I have spoken to the [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital|Marquis de l'Hôpital]] and others about my general algebra, but they have paid no more attention to it than if I had told them about a dream of mine. I should have to support it too by some obvious application, but to achieve this it would be necessary to work out at least a part of my characteristic,  a task which is not easy, especially in my present condition and without the advantage of discussions with men who could stimulate and help me in work of this nature.|source=Loemker 1969: 656}}

==Three criteria==
C. J. Cohen (1954) set out three criteria which any project for a philosophical language would need to meet before it could be considered a version of the ''characteristica universalis''. In setting out these criteria, Cohen made reference to the concept of "logistic". This concept is not the same as that used in statistical analysis. In 1918, [[Clarence Irving Lewis]], the first English-speaking logician to translate and discuss some of Leibniz's logical writings, elaborated on "logistic" as follows:
{{quote|text=Logistic may be defined as the science which deals with types of order as such. It is not so much a subject as a method. Although most logistic is either founded upon or makes large use of the principles of symbolic logic, still as science of order in general does not necessarily presuppose or begin with symbolic logic.|source=Lewis 1960: 3, 7&amp;ndash;9 (Lewis here echoed the thinking of his teacher Josiah Royce; see "Order" in the 1951 ''Collected Logical Writings of Royce''.)}} 
Following from this Cohen stipulated that the universal character would have to serve as: 
*An "[[international auxiliary language]]" enabling persons speaking different languages to communicate with one another;
*Symbolism for the exact and systematic expression of all present knowledge, making possible a "logistic" treatment of science in general. This symbolism could also be expanded to accommodate future knowledge;
*An instrument of discovery and demonstration.
These criteria together with the notion of logistic reveal that Cohen and Lewis both associated the ''characteristica'' with the methods and objectives of [[general systems theory]].

==A common scientific language==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
[[Inconsistency]], [[vagueness]], and a lack of specifics in both English language translations and modern English language interpretations of Leibniz's writings render a clear exposition difficult. As with Leibniz's ''[[calculus ratiocinator]]'' two different schools of philosophical thought have come to emphasise two different aspects that can be found in Leibniz's writing. The first point of view emphasizes [[logic]] and [[language]], and is associated with [[analytic philosophy]] and [[rationalism]]. The second point of view is more in tune with Couturat's views as expressed above, which emphasize [[science]] and [[engineering]]. This point of view is associated with synthetic philosophy and [[empiricism]]. Either or both of these aspects Leibniz hoped would guide human reasoning like [[Ariadne's thread (logic)|Ariadne's thread]] and thereby suggest solutions to many of humanity's urgent problems.

==Gödel alleges conspiracy==
Because Leibniz never described the ''characteristica universalis'' in operational detail, many philosophers have deemed it an absurd fantasy. In this vein, Parkinson wrote:

{{quote|text=Leibniz's views about the systematic character of all knowledge are linked with his plans for a universal symbolism, a ''Characteristica Universalis''. This was to be a calculus which would cover all thought, and replace controversy by calculation. The ideal now seems absurdly optimistic..."|source=Parkinson 1973: ix}}

The logician [[Kurt Gödel]], on the other hand, believed that the ''characteristica universalis'' was feasible, and that its development would revolutionize mathematical practice (Dawson 1997). He noticed, however, that a detailed treatment of the ''characteristica'' was conspicuously absent from Leibniz's publications. It appears that Gödel assembled all of Leibniz's texts mentioning the ''characteristica'', and convinced himself that some sort of systematic and conspiratorial censoring had taken place, a belief that became obsessional. Gödel may have failed to appreciate the magnitude of the task facing the editors of Leibniz's manuscripts, given that Leibniz left about 15,000 letters and 40,000 pages of other manuscripts. Even now, most of this huge [[Nachlass]] remains unpublished.

==Related 17th century projects==
Others in the 17th century, such as [[George Dalgarno]], attempted similar philosophical and linguistic projects, some under the heading of ''[[mathesis universalis]]''. A notable example was [[John Wilkins]], the author of ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language]]'', who wrote a [[thesaurus]] as a first step towards a universal language. He intended to add to his thesaurus an [[alphabet of human thought]] (an organisational scheme, similar to a [[thesaurus]] or the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey decimal system]]), and an "algebra of thought," allowing rule-based manipulation. The philosophers and linguists who undertook such projects often belonged to [[pansophism|pansophical]] (universal knowledge) and scientific knowledge groups in London and Oxford, collectively known as the "[[Invisible College]]" and now seen as forerunners of the [[Royal Society]].

==More recent projects==
A wide variety of [[List of constructed languages|constructed languages]] have emerged over the past 150 years which appear to support many of Leibniz's intuitions.  If indeed they do support Leibniz's vision of unified science, then the remaining question is whether Ariadne's unifying thread can be discerned among these various projects, leading to their integration.

* Raymond F. Piper (1957; 432&amp;ndash;433) claimed that O.L. Reiser's ''Unified Symbolism for World Understanding in Science'' (1955), an expansion of his ''A Philosophy for World Unification'' (1946), was inspired by Leibniz's ''characteristica universalis'', and believed necessary for world understanding and unbiased communications so that "war may eventually be eliminated and that a worldwide organism of peaceful human beings may gradually be established" (Piper Ibid.).
* The study of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s and [[group theory]] in the 19th century proved correct Leibniz's intuition that [[abstract algebra|algebraic methods]] could be used to reason about qualitative and non-numerical phenomena. Specifically, the members of the [[universal set]] of a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] or [[Group (mathematics)|group]] need not be numbers. Moreover, a fair bit of philosophy and theoretical science can be formalized as axiomatic theories embodying [[first-order logic]] and [[set theory]]. Note also how [[model theory]] has been employed to formalize and reason about such emphatically nonnumerical subjects as [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]] of [[natural languages]]. But these approaches have yet to result in any [[pictogram|pictographic]] notations.
* Fearnley-Sander (1986) went one step further, defining Leibniz's ''characteristica'' as a combination of the algebra of logic (which Fearnley-Sander defined as the ''calculus ratiocinator'') and the algebra of geometry (defined as the ''characteristica geometrica''). Fearnley-Sander suggested that this combination had "come to pass" with the rise of [[universal algebra]]. Some people other than Fearnley-Sander working in the area of "universal algebra," the study of the mathematical and logical properties of [[algebraic structures]] generally, do not believe that universal algebra has anything to do with the ''characteristica''.
* Palko, Gy Bulcsu (1986) considered structured analysis for analyzing and designing hierarchic systems by using an iconic language, and suggested that such was an application of the universal characteristics Leibniz's project to the language of structured analysis and the formalization of an iconic control system.
* Kluge (1980) argued that [[Frege]]'s landmark ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' was consciously inspired by the ''characteristica universalis''.
* Even though [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], a founder of [[semiotics]], believed that all reasoning was diagrammatic, the relation, if any, of the ''characteristica'' to his [[existential graph]]s and to [[semiotics]] has yet to be explored in the English literature.&lt;!--Burkhardt's monograph on Leibniz and semiotics has not been translated from German to English.--&gt;
* Several aspects of [[logical positivism]], specifically:
** The first-order theories of [[Rudolf Carnap]]'s ''Aufbau'' (1928, English translation 1967) and of its successor, Goodman (1977), are Leibnizian in their sweep and ambition, although Leibniz would have taken strenuous exception to Carnap's resolute [[Vienna Circle|hostility]] to all [[metaphysics]].
** The [[Unified Science|unification of science]] movement of the 1930s, led by [[Otto Neurath]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], and [[Charles W. Morris]], and later by [[Edward Haskell]] et al., bears comparison with the ''characteristica''.
** [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[Isotype (pictograms)|isotype]] [[pictogram]] system, and "international picture language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Isotype and FUTURE books - Neurath |url=http://www.fulltable.com/iso/is03.htm |date=June 2003 |accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The following attempts to recast parts of theoretical science as axiomatic first-order theories can be viewed as attempts to develop parts of the ''characteristica'':
**''Special relativity'', by [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], and others during the 1920s (Carnap 1958: 197&amp;ndash;212);
** ''Biology'', by Joseph Woodger (1937), also during the 1930s (Carnap 1958: 213&amp;ndash;20):
** ''Mechanics'', by Suppes (1957: 291&amp;ndash;305) and others during the 1950s.
* The objectives of the 'Symbolator' or 'idea-computer' (Goppold 1994) resemble in some respects a less ambitious version of the ''characteristica universalis''.
* Connections with the Jewish [[Kabbalah|Cabbala]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith and auxiliary language|International auxiliary language policy]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] have also been made.
* The characteristic has also been claimed as an ancestor of the pictographic [[Energy Systems Language]] and associated [[Emergy Synthesis]] of [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]]'s ''[[systems ecology|Systems Ecology]]'' (Cevolatti and Maud, 2004). The Energy Systems Language combines lines and points with "a kind of pictures" manipulated by means of digital computers and software packages like EXTEND(tm) (Odum, Odum, and Peterson 1995), and Valyi's Emergy Simulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Emergy Simulator |url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/emsim/ |website=[[SourceForge]].net |date=16 April 2013 |accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to provide a general systems language affording quantitative accounting and mathematical simulation of qualitative energy relationships between ecological entities: "that science in which are treated the forms or formulas of things in general, that is, quality in general". A general algebra known as the [[Emergy|emergy algebra]] emerged from the repeated use of this language in modelling and simulating the [[Energetics|energetic principles]] of ecological relations. In particular it afforded the discovery and demonstration of the [[maximum power principle]], suggested as the fourth law of thermodynamics. If this ancestral claim is granted, then simulation software like EXTEND(tm) and Valyi's Emergy Simulator can be seen as combining the ''characteristica'' and the ''[[calculus ratiocinator]]'', if and only if the digital computer is interpreted as a physical embodiment of the ''calculus ratiocinator''.
* The work of [[Mario Bunge]] on the border of physics and metaphysics seems grounded in metaphysical presuppositions similar to those of Leibniz's ''characteristica'' (Radnitzky 1981: 246).
* [[Jacob Linzbach]]'s [[Transcendent Algebra]], a pasigraphy designed to allow the "calculation of truth" through manipulation of given facts following basic principles much like those used in mathematics, was inspired by Leibniz's ''characteristica''.
* [[Lojban]] (and its older version [[Loglan]]) are both artificial languages derived from [[predicate logic]], and intended for use in human communication.
*[[Charles K. Bliss]]'s [[Blissymbols]] or Blissymbolics, presently used as an 'alternative and augmentative language' for disabled people but originally intended as an International 'Auxlang', is said to be in the mold of the ''characteristica'' (Bliss 1978).
* [[Ithkuil]] is a constructed language created by John Quijada, designed to express deeper levels of human cognition briefly yet overtly and clearly, particularly with regard to human categorization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45844">'''Civil resistance''' is political action that relies on the use of [[nonviolent resistance]] by civil groups to challenge a particular power, force, policy or [[regime]].&lt;ref&gt;Examples of the use of the term "civil resistance" include [[Erica Chenoweth]] and Maria J. Stephan, [http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-15682-0/why-civil-resistance-works ''Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict''], Columbia University Press, New York, 2011; Howard Clark, [https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Civil+Resistance+in+Kosovo ''Civil Resistance in Kosovo''], Pluto Press, London, 2000; Sharon Erickson Nepstad, [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Sociology/SocialMovementSocialChange/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199778218 ''Nonviolent Revolution: Civil Resistance in the Late 20th Century''], Oxford University Press, New York, 2011; [[Michael Randle]], [http://www.civilresistance.info/randle1994 ''Civil Resistance''], Fontana, London, 1994; [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], [http://www.aeinstein.org/english/ ''Civil Resistance in the East European and Soviet Revolutions''], Albert Einstein Institution, Massachusetts, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil resistance operates through appeals to the adversary, pressure and coercion: it can involve systematic attempts to undermine the adversary's sources of power, both domestic and international. Forms of action have included demonstrations, vigils and petitions; strikes, go-slows, boycotts and emigration movements; and sit-ins, occupations, and the creation of parallel institutions of government. Civil resistance movements' motivations for avoiding violence are generally related to context, including a society's values and its experience of war and violence, rather than to any absolute ethical principle. Cases of civil resistance can be found throughout history and in many modern struggles, against both tyrannical rulers and democratically elected governments.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;This is abstracted from the longer definition of "civil resistance" in Adam Roberts, Introduction, in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 2–3. See also the short definition in Gene Sharp, [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Reference/Subjectareareference/SocialSciences/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199829897 ''Sharp's Dictionary of Power and Struggle: Language of Civil Resistance in Conflicts''], Oxford University Press, New York, 2011, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of civil resistance is often associated with the advancement of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the report by Peter Ackerman, Adrian Karatnycky and others, ''How Freedom is Won.

Civil resistance is a long-standing and widespread phenomenon in human history. Several works on civil resistance adopt a historical approach to the analysis of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009. Include chapters by specialists on nineteen movements between 1917 and 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of civil resistance, both successful and unsuccessful, include:
* [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]]'s role in the [[Indian independence movement]] in 1917–47
* [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s role in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in 1955–68
* Aspects of the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement]] in 1967–72
* the [[Carnation Revolution|Revolution of the Carnations]] in [[Portugal]] in 1974–5, supporting the military coup of 25 April 1974
* the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1977–79, before [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini's]] advent to power in February 1979
* the [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] in the 1980s that ousted President [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]]
* the campaigns against [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid in South Africa]], especially before 1961, and during the period of 1983–94.
* the mass mobilization against authoritarian rule in Pinochet's [[Chile]], 1983–88
* the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] in [[China]] 
* the various movements contributing to the [[revolutions of 1989]] in central and eastern Europe, and to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 
* the campaign against Serbian domination in [[Kosovo]], 1990–98, that was followed by war
* the revolutions in [[Bulldozer Revolution|Serbia]] in 2000, [[Rose Revolution|Georgia]] in 2003, and [[Orange Revolution|Ukraine]] in 2004, all of which involved successful resistance against an incumbent government that had refused to acknowledge its defeat in an election and had sought to falsify the election results
* the [[Cedar Revolution]] in [[Lebanon]] in 2005, following the assassination of former prime minister [[Rafic Hariri]] on 14 February 2005, and calling for Syrian military withdrawal from Lebanon
* the demonstrations, mainly led by students and monks, in the [[Saffron Revolution]] in [[Myanmar|Burma]] in 2007
* the [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests]] following evidence of electoral manipulation in the elections of June 2009

* the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa, starting in [[Tunisia]] in December 2010, and resulting, in 2011, in the fall of rulers in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. In some countries the movements were followed by war (e.g. [[Syrian Civil War]] and [[Yemeni Civil War (2015)|War in Yemen]]) or by a return to military rule, as in [[Egypt]] in 2013 following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]] 
* the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M or ''Indignados'' movement]], which included the peaceful occupation of squares all over Spain in May-June 2011, and a mosaic of other forms of civil disobedience by many of the groups that were created, or strengthened, after the squares occupations. In particular the [[Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca|Platform for People Affected by Mortgages, or PAH]]. 
* the [[Gezi Park protests]] in [[Turkey]] in 2013, in opposition to urban development plans, and also to government encroachments on freedom of expression and on Turkey's secularist traditions
* the early phases of the [[Euromaidan]] protests in [[Ukraine]] in 2013–14, demanding closer integration with European Union countries, and the resignation of President [[Viktor Yanukovych]]
* the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]], also known as "Occupy Central" and the "Umbrella movement", opposing the [[2014–15 Hong Kong electoral reform]] in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
* Women's marches in USA from January [[2017 Women's March]] onwards to resist President Donald Trump's allegedly sexist policies. 

Numerous other campaigns, both successful and unsuccessful, could be included in a longer listing. In 1967 [[Gene Sharp]] produced a list of 84 cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Sharp]], "The Technique of Non-violent Action", in Adam Roberts (ed.), ''The Strategy of Civilian Defence: Non-violent Resistance to Aggression'', Faber, London, 1967, at pp. 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this with further surveys.&lt;ref&gt;See for example his discussion of "Illustrations from the Past" in Gene Sharp, ''[[The Politics of Nonviolent Action]]'' (see [[The Politics of Nonviolent Action|article]]), Porter Sargent, Boston, 1973, pp. 75–97; and his short accounts of numerous cases in Gene Sharp and others, ''Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice and 21st Century Potential'', Porter Sargent, Boston, 2005, pp. 69–356.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Maciej Bartkowski authored a long list of cases in the past 200 years, arranged alphabetically by country.&lt;ref&gt;"Appendix: Conflict Summaries", in Maciej J. Bartkowski (ed.), ''Recovering Nonviolent History: Civil Resistance in Liberation Struggles'', Lynne Rienner, Boulder, Colorado, 2013, pp. 355–405.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
It is not easy to devise a method of proving the relative success of different methods of struggle. Often there are problems in identifying a given campaign as successful or otherwise. In 2008 Maria J. Stephan and [[Erica Chenoweth]] produced a widely-noted article on "Why Civil Resistance Works", the most thorough and detailed analysis (to that date) of the rate of success of civil resistance campaigns, as compared to violent resistance campaigns. After looking at over 300 cases of both types of campaign, from 1900 to 2006, they concluded that "nonviolent resistance methods are likely to be more successful than violent methods in achieving strategic objectives". Their article (later developed into a book) noted particularly that "resistance campaigns that compel loyalty shifts among security forces and civilian bureaucrats are likely to succeed".&lt;ref&gt;Maria J. Stephan and Erica Chenoweth, "Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict", ''International Security'', vol. 33, no. 1 (Summer 2008), p. 42. {{ISSN|0162-2889}}[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18407/why_civil_resistance_works.html]. (See also their 2011 book, ''Why Civil Resistance Works'', listed below in the bibliography.)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the evidence of several of the 2011 uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa appears to provide contrasting pathways by which this logic may fail to materialise, with splits in the armed forces contributing towards civil war in Libya and Syria, and a shift in armed forces loyalty in Egypt failing to contribute towards enduring democratic reform.&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Davies, "The failure of strategic nonviolent action in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya and Syria: ‘political ju-jitsu’ in reverse", ''Global Change, Peace and Security'', vol. 26, no. 3 (2014), pp. 299–313. {{ISSN|1478-1158}} {{DOI|10.1080/14781158.2014.924916}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of the central thesis of the book on ''Why Civil Resistance Works'' have included: 
# Forming judgements about whether a campaign is a success or failure is inherently difficult: the answer may depend on the time-frame used, and on necessarily subjective judgments about what constitutes success. Some of the authors' decisions on this are debatable. Similar difficulties arise in deciding whether a campaign is violent or non-violent, when on the ground both strategies may co-exist in several ways.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Masullo Jimenez, review of ''Why Civil Resistance Works'' on ''Global Policy'' website, 29 November 2013. [http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/29/11/2013/book-review-why-civil-resistance-works-strategic-logic-nonviolent-conflict-erica-che].&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Regimes transitioning from autocracy to democracy tend to be highly unstable, so an initial success for a movement may be followed by a more general failure.&lt;ref&gt;David Cortright, review on E-International Relations website, 17 January 2013. [http://www.e-ir.info/2013/01/17/review-why-civil-resistance-works/]&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Perhaps, more generally, sufficient account is not taken of the possibility that violence often takes place in circumstances that were already violent and chaotic, stacking the odds against any successful outcome for violence.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts, "Terrorism Research: Past, Present and Future", ''Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism'', vol. 38, no. 1, January 2015, pp. 62–74. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1057610X.2014.976011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for choosing to use civil resistance==
[[File:Aung San Suu Kyi greeting supporters from Bago State.jpg|thumb|[[Aung San Suu Kyi]], Burmese pro-democracy leader, greeting supporters from Bago State, Burma, 14 August 2011. She has stated that she was attracted to non-violent civil resistance, not on moral grounds, but "on practical political grounds". ''Photo: Htoo Tay Zar'']]Some leaders of civil resistance struggles have urged the use of non-violent methods for primarily ethical reasons, while others have emphasized practical considerations. Some have indicated that both of these types of factor have to be taken into account – and that they necessarily overlap.

In his chapter on "Pilgrimage to Nonviolence" [[Martin Luther King]] gave a notably multi-faceted account of the various considerations, experiences and influences that constituted his "intellectual odyssey to nonviolence". By 1954 this had led to the intellectual conviction that "nonviolent resistance was one of the most potent weapons available to oppressed people in their quest for social justice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Luther King]], ''Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story'', Ballantine Books, New York, 1960, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have opted for civil resistance when they were in opposition to the government, but then have later, when in government, adopted or accepted very different policies and methods of action. For example, in one of her [[BBC]] [[Reith Lectures]], first broadcast in July 2011, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], the pro-democracy campaigner in [[Myanmar]] (formerly Burma), stated: "Gandhi's teachings on non-violent civil resistance and the way in which he had put his theories into practice have become part of the working manual of those who would change authoritarian administrations through peaceful means. I was attracted to the way of non-violence, but not on moral grounds, as some believe. Only on practical political grounds."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aung San Suu Kyi]], second BBC Reith Lecture, "Dissent", first broadcast 5 July 2011, transcript available at  [http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/radio4/transcripts/2011_reith2.pdf BBC website].&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, as State Counsellor of Myanmar from 2016 onwards, she incurred much criticism, especially in connection with the failure to prevent, and to condemn, the killings and expulsions of the [[Rohingya people]] in [[Rakhine State]].

==Relationship to other forms of power==
The experience of civil resistance suggests that it can at least partially replace other forms of power. Some have seen civil resistance as offering, potentially, a complete alternative to power politics. The core vision is of non-violent methods replacing armed force in many or all of its forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Sharp]], ''Social Power and Political Freedom'', Porter Sargent, Boston, 1980, xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several writers, while sharing the vision of civil resistance as progressively overcoming the use of force, have warned against a narrowly instrumental view of non-violent action. For example, [[Joan Bondurant|Joan V. Bondurant]], a specialist on the Gandhian philosophy of conflict, indicated concern about "the symbolic violence of those who engage in conflict with techniques which they, at least, perceive to be nonviolent." She saw Gandhian satyagraha as a form of "creative conflict" and as "contrasted both to violence and to methods not violent or just short of violence".&lt;ref&gt;Joan V. Bondurant, "Creative Conflict and the Limits of Symbolic Violence" in Bondurant (ed.), ''Conflict: Violence and Nonviolence'', Aldine, Chicago, 1971, pp. 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally difficult in practice to separate out entirely the use of civil resistance and power-political considerations of various kinds. One frequently-encountered aspect of this problem is that regimes facing opposition taking the form of civil resistance often launch verbal attacks on the opposition in terms designed to suggest that civil resistance is simply a front for more sinister forces. It has sometimes been attacked as being planned and directed from abroad, and as intimately connected to terrorism, imperialism, communism etc. A classic case was the Soviet accusation that the 1968 Prague Spring, and the civil resistance after the Soviet-led invasion of August 1968, were the result of Western machinations.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 21–23 (chapter by Roberts), 93 (Kramer) and 386n. (Garton Ash).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, President [[Bashar al-Assad]] of Syria, in March 2011, accused "enemies" of using "very sophisticated tools" to undermine Syria's stability; and President [[Vladimir Putin]] of Russia, in speeches in 2014, described events in Ukraine and the Arab countries as foreign-influenced.&lt;ref&gt;These accusations by Presidents Assad and Putin are cited and discussed in Adam Roberts, Michael J. Willis, Rory McCarthy and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oqXTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105 ''Civil Resistance in the Arab Spring: Triumphs and Disasters''], Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2016, pp. 277–80, 314–17 (chapter by Roberts).&lt;/ref&gt; Such accusations of sinister power-political involvement are often presented without convincing evidence.

There can be some more plausible connections between civil resistance and other forms of power. Although civil resistance can sometimes be a substitute for other forms of power, it can also operate in conjunction with them. Such conjunction is never problem-free. Michael Randle has identified a core difficulty regarding strategies that seek to combine the use of violent and non-violent methods in the same campaign: "The obvious problem about employing a mixed strategy ''in the course of an actual struggle'' is that the dynamics of military and civil resistance are at some levels diametrically opposed to each other."&lt;ref&gt;Randle, ''Civil Resistance'', p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the connections between civil resistance and other forms of power are not limited to the idea of a "mixed strategy". They can assume many forms.&lt;ref&gt;A pioneering exploration of certain examples of connections between non-violent resistance and other forms of power is in Kurt Schock, [https://www.amazon.com/Unarmed-Insurrections-Movements-Nondemocracies-Contention/dp/0816641935 ''Unarmed Insurrections: People Power Movements in Nondemocracies''], Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005, especially at pp. 153–62. A more general discussion of this question is in Adam Roberts, "Introduction", in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], especially at pp. 13–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight ways in which civil resistance can in practice relate to other forms of power are identified here, with examples in each case:
#Civil resistance is often a response to changes in constellations of power. Leaders of civil resistance campaigns have often been acutely aware of power-political developments, both domestic and international.&lt;ref&gt;Schock, ''Unarmed Insurrections'', pp. 154–56.&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries there has been a growth of civil opposition after, and perhaps in part because of, an occupying or colonial state's internal political turmoil or setbacks in war: for example, this was a key factor in the Finnish struggle of 1898–1905 against Russian control.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Duncan Huxley, ''Constitutional Insurgency in Finland: Finnish "Passive Resistance" against Russification as a Case of Nonmilitary Struggle in the European Resistance Tradition'', SHS, Helsinki, 1990, p. 225, where Jonas Castrén, a key figure in the constitutional insurgency, is cited as emphasizing the central importance of understanding current events in Russia and their importance for the Finnish struggle. "He exclaimed that now was the time for Finns to rise up in mass struggle."&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries the problems faced by their own armed forces, whether against conventional armies or guerrillas, played some part in the development of civil resistance: for example, in the [[People Power Revolution]] in the Philippines in 1983–86.&lt;ref&gt;Amado Mendoza, "‘People Power'" in the Philippines, 1983–86’ in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 179–96, where he discusses at pp. 186–89 the competitive relationship between the violent and non-violent anti-dictatorship movements.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Civil resistance campaigns frequently lead to a situation of partial stalemate, in which negotiation between civil resisters and those in positions of governmental power is perceived as essential. Hence, "round table talks" were critically important in the Indian independence struggle up to 1947, in [[Polish Round Table Talks|Solidarity's campaign in Poland up to 1989]], and in Ukraine in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;These three cases of round table talks are outlined by Judith Brown, Alexander Smolar and Andrew Wilson respectively in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 47, 55 (India), 136–43 (Poland), and 350–53 (Ukraine).&lt;/ref&gt;
#The relation between civil resistance and the military [[coup d'état]] can be especially multi-faceted. In some cases a civil resistance campaign has been an effective response to a military coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Adam Roberts (scholar) |first=Adam |last=Roberts |title=Civil Resistance to Military Coups |journal=Journal of Peace Research |volume=12 |issue=1 |year=1975 |pages=19–36 |doi= 10.1177/002234337501200102|jstor=422898 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases a campaign could succeed in its final objective—e.g. the removal of a hated regime—only when there was the reality or the threat of a military coup to bring about the desired change. Thus, the 1963 [[Buddhist crisis]] in South Vietnam a long civil resistance campaign against the government resulted in change only when the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|South Vietnamese army coup]] of 1–2 November 1963 toppled President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Shaplen |title=The Lost Revolution: Vietnam 1945–1965 |publisher=Andre Deutsch |location=London |year=1966 |pages=188–212 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt in June–July 2013, a civil resistance movement in effect called for a military coup: peaceful demonstrators and a petition supported by millions of signatures demanded the replacement of the elected Muslim Brotherhood government, and provided a degree of revolutionary legitimacy for the army take-over of 3 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[[M. Cherif Bassiouni]], [http://www.mcherifbassiouni.com/wp-content/uploads/Egypt-Update-27.pdf Egypt Update no. 27], 19 February 2014, paragraphs 8–9, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  At least one non-violent campaign, the [[Carnation Revolution|Revolution of the Carnations]] in Portugal in 1974–75, was in support of a military coup that had already occurred: this campaign helped to steer Portugal in a democratic direction.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Maxwell, ‘Portugal: "The Revolution of the Carnations", 1974–75’, in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 144–61.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Some non-violent campaigns can be seen as reluctant or unwitting harbingers of violence. They may be followed by the emergence of groups using armed force and/or by military intervention from outside the territory concerned. This can happen if, for example, they (a) are perceived as failures, or (b) are repressed with extreme violence, or (c) succeed in removing a regime but then leave a power vacuum in its place. Processes of the first two of these kinds happened, for example, in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1967–72 and in [[Kosovo]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Cases of perceived failure of civil resistance being followed by armed campaigns and military intervention are outlined by Richard English and Howard Clark in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 75–90 (Northern Ireland) and 277–94 (Kosovo).&lt;/ref&gt; Processes of the third kind, involving some forms of power vacuum, included [[Libya]] from 2011 onwards, and [[Yemen]] from 2012 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Cases of armed interventions in areas where there had been an absence of governance in at least parts of a country are outlined by George Joffé and Helen Lackner in Roberts, Willis, McCarthy and Garton Ash, ''Civil Resistance in the Arab Spring: Triumphs and Disasters'', pp. 134–40 (Libya) and 160–68 (Yemen).&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of such developments can be an inducement to a government to bargain with a non-violent movement before things get out of hand. However, in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa in 2011 and after, campaigns by civil resistance movements were followed by violent internal conflict and civil war, often with the involvement of external forces: Syria is the most tragic case.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], ''Strategic Survey 2013'', London, 2013, pp. 179–84.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Vaclav Havel IMF.jpg|thumb|[[Václav Havel]], impresario of civil resistance in the years leading up to the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]]. In April 1991, as President of post-Communist Czechoslovakia, he praised the NATO military alliance; and on 12 March 1999 the Czech Republic (with Havel still as President) joined the alliance. He is seen here on 26 September 2000. ''Photo: IMF'']]
#There have also been some cases of certain uses of force by civil resistance movements, whether against their adversaries, or to maintain internal discipline. For example, on 2 February 2011, in the generally peaceful [[2011 Egyptian Revolution|Egyptian struggle against President Mubarak]], some groups among the crowds in [[Tahrir Square]] in Cairo did use certain forms of force for a defensive purpose when they were attacked by pro-regime thugs, some of whom were riding on horses and camels.&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Khalili, ‘The two sets of protesters were left to fight it out,’ ''The Guardian'', London, 3 February 2011, provides an eye-witness account of the events of 2 February. Also available at [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/02/cairo-clashes].&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent days the crowds in Tahrir Square reverted to using non-violent methods.
#Some civil resistance movements have sought, or welcomed, a measure of armed protection for their activities. Thus in the American civil rights movement of the 1960s, the [[Freedom Rides|Freedom Ride]] of May 1961, having been opposed violently, received armed protection for part of its hazardous journey;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Peck (pacifist)|James Peck]], ''Freedom Ride'', Grove Press, New York, 1962, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Selma to Montgomery March]] of March 1965 only succeeded in reaching Montgomery, Alabama, at the third attempt, when it was protected by troops and federal agents.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Williams, ''Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, 1954–1965'', Viking Press, New York, 1987, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Some campaigns of civil resistance may depend up the existence of militarily defended space. A life-saving example of an effective civil resistance enabling threatened people to reach a defended space occurred with the [[Rescue of the Danish Jews]] in 1943 when thousands of Jews were spirited out of German-occupied Denmark and across a narrow stretch of sea (the Sound) to Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Semelin, ''Unarmed Against Hitler: Civilian Resistance in Europe, 1939–1943'', Praeger, Westport, Connecticut, 1993, pp. 151–54.&lt;/ref&gt;
#When leaders of even the most determinedly non-violent movements have come to power in their countries, they have generally accepted the continued existence of armed forces and other more or less conventional security arrangements. For example, in 1991 [[Václav Havel]] who had been a leading figure in civil resistance in communist Czechoslovakia from the founding of [[Charter 77]] to the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, in his new capacity as President of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic paid tribute to the [[NATO]] alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Václav Havel]], address to NATO Council, 21 March 1991, ''NATO Review'', Brussels, April 1991, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 1999 the Czech Republic, along with Poland and Hungary, became a member of NATO.

==Proposals for defence by civil resistance==
The promise of civil resistance as a means of opposing oppressive rule has led to many proposals that countries might rely, in whole or in part, on civil resistance as a means of defence against external attack (for example, invasion) and internal usurpation (for example, [[coup d'état]]). Preparations for such resistance are sometimes seen as potentially helping to deter such threats in the first place. Various terms have been used to describe either the policy of relying on such non-military action by a society or social group, or the general phenomenon of sustained country-wide campaigns against outside attack or dictatorial rule. These terms - all near-synonyms - include "defence by civil resistance", "non-violent defence", "civilian defence", "civilian-based defence", and "[[social defence]]". For further information and references to some relevant literature, see [[social defence]].

==The term "civil resistance": merits and concerns==
[[File:Gandhi suit.jpg|thumb|[[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]] in South Africa in about 1906–1909. Referring to his years there, he later wrote: "... I found that even civil disobedience failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase civil resistance."]]The term is not new. [[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]] used it in many of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], "The Momentous Issue", ''Young India'', 10 November 1921; in ''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'', electronic edition, vol. 25, pp. 76–78. [http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL025.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 he wrote: "... I found that even civil disobedience failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase civil resistance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], letter to P. Kodanda Rao, 10 September 1935; in ''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'', electronic edition, vol. 67, p. 400.[http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL067.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a near-synonym for [[nonviolent resistance]], [[civil disobedience]], [[People Power Revolution|people power]] and [[satyagraha]]. While each of these terms has its uses and connotations, "civil resistance" is one appropriate term to use in cases where the resistance has a civic quality, relating to a society as a whole; where the action involved is not necessarily disobedience, but instead involves supporting the norms of a society against usurpers; where the decision not to use violent methods is not based on a general philosophy of [[nonviolence]], but on a wide range of prudential, ethical and legal considerations; and where the technical and communications infrastructure of modern civil societies provides a means of organizing resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Fabien Miard, ''Mobile Phones as a Tool for Civil Resistance: Case Studies from Serbia and Belarus'', DigiActive Research Series, June 2009. 
[http://www.digiactive.org/wp-content/uploads/research3_miard.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of such considerations, the term has been used in this century in many analyses in academic journals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, by {{cite journal |first=Maria J. |last=Stephan |first2=Erica |last2=Chenoweth |title=Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict |journal=International Security |volume=33 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=7–44 |issn=0162-2889 |url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18407/why_civil_resistance_works.html |doi=10.1162/isec.2008.33.1.7}} And {{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Ackerman |first2=Berel |last2=Rodal |title=The Strategic Dimensions of Civil Resistance |journal=Survival |volume=50 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=111–25 |url=http://www.david-kilgour.com/2008/pdf/misc/50-3%2010%20Ackerman%20Author%20Proof.pdf |doi=10.1080/00396330802173131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What exactly are the advantages of the term "civil resistance", as distinct from its near-synonyms "non-violent action" and "[[non-violent resistance]]"? All these terms have merits, and refer to largely the same phenomena. Indeed, there is a long history, in many languages, of using a wide variety of terms to describe these phenomena. The term "civil resistance" has been used increasingly for two main reasons:
#It emphasises the positive (civic goals; widespread civil society involvement; and civil as distinct from uncivil conduct) rather than the negative (avoidance of the use of violence).
#It conveys, more effectively perhaps than such terms as "[[nonviolent resistance]]", that a movement's avoidance of violence in pursuit of a particular cause is not necessarily tied to a general belief in "[[nonviolence]]" in all circumstances, nor to a philosophy of "[[Gandhism]]", but rather arises from the particular values and circumstances of the society concerned.

There have been concerns that the term "civil resistance" might on occasion be misused, or at least stretched in a highly controversial way, to encompass acts of violence. Thus, arising from experience within the [[anti-globalization movement]], one participant-observer has seen "new forms of civil resistance" as being associated with a problematic departure from a previously more widely shared commitment to maintaining non-violent discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Janet |last=Conway |title=Civil Resistance and the 'Diversity of Tactics' in the Anti-Globalization Movement: Problems of Violence, Silence, and Solidarity in Activist Politics |journal=Osgoode Hall Law Journal |volume=41 |issue=2 &amp; 3 |year=2003 |pages=505–17 |url=http://www.ohlj.ca/archive/articles/41_23_conway.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these concerns, those who have used the term "civil resistance" have tended to emphasise its non-violent character, and to use it in addition to – and not in substitution of – such terms as "non-violent resistance".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14763">In [[particle physics]], '''composite Higgs models''' (CHM) are speculative extensions of the [[Standard Model]] (SM) where the [[Higgs boson]] is a [[bound state]] of new strong interactions. These scenarios are the leading alternative to [[supersymmetric]] models for physics beyond the SM presently tested at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) in Geneva.

According to CHM the recently discovered [[Higgs boson]] is not an [[elementary particle]] (or point-like)  but has finite size, typically around 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; meters. This dimension is related to the [[electroweak scale|Fermi scale]] (100 GeV) that determines the strength of the [[weak interactions]] such as in [[β-decay]]. Microscopically the composite Higgs will be made of smaller constituents in the same way as nuclei are made [[protons]] and [[neutrons]].

The main prediction of CHM are new particles with mass around a [[TeV]] that are [[excited state|excitations]] of the composite Higgs. This is  analogous to the resonances in [[nuclear physics]]. The new particles could be produced and detected in collider experiments if the energy of the collision exceeds their mass and/or could produce deviations from the SM predictions in "low energy observables" — results of experiments at lower energies. Within the most compelling scenarios each Standard Model particle has a partner with equal quantum numbers but heavier mass. For example, the [[photon]], [[W and Z bosons]] have heavy replicas with mass determined by the compositeness scale, expected around 1 TeV.

CHM are motivated by the so-called naturalness or [[hierarchy problem]] of the SM,&lt;ref&gt;G. F. Giudice, ''Naturalness after LHC8'',   PoS EPS HEP2013, 163 (2013)   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.7879.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; the difficulty to explain the different energy scales that appear in the fundamental interactions of particle physics, in particular, the large difference between the mass of the Higgs boson and the [[Planck scale]]. CHM can solve the naturalness problem because the Higgs boson is not an elementary particle so that a new energy scale exists that can be explained dynamically similarly to the mass of the proton. Naturalness requires that new particles exist with mass around a TeV and these could be discovered at LHC or future experiments. As of 2018, no direct or indirect signs that the Higgs or other SM particles are composite has been detected.

== History ==
CHM were introduced in the early '80s as an extension of [[Technicolor (physics)|technicolor]] theories to allow for the presence of a physical Higgs boson. At the time this was not required by the data but recent discoveries have shown the necessity of a physical Higgs doublet to break the [[electroweak interaction|electro-weak symmetry]]. This differs from ordinary technicolor theories where strong dynamics directly breaks the electro-weak symmetry without the need of a physical Higgs boson. The first CHM proposed by Georgi and Kaplan were based on known [[gauge theory]] dynamics&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Dugan, H. Georgi and D. B.Kaplan, ''Anatomy of a Composite Higgs Model'',   Nucl.  Phys.  B254, 299 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; that produces the Higgs doublet as a [[Goldstone boson]]. These models are very constrained and it is difficult to include [[fermion]] masses. The subject remained dormant for several years until it was realized that this type of models naturally arise in 5 dimensional theories known as [[Randall–Sundrum]] scenarios. Within these constructions enough freedom exists to build realistic models at the price of abandoning a full microscopic description. It was soon understood that these scenarios can also be realized in hypothetical strongly coupled [[conformal field theory|conformal field theories]] (CFT) also providing a dynamical explanation for the generation of hierarchies. The connection between Randall-Sundrum models and CFTs is rooted in the [[AdS-CFT|AdS-CFT correspondence]]. This spurred a great deal of activity in the field. At first the Higgs was a generic scalar bound state. In the highly influential work&lt;ref&gt;K. Agashe, R. Contino and A. Pomarol, ''The Minimal composite Higgs model'',   Nucl. Phys. B719, 165 (2005)   https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0412089.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; the Higgs as a Goldstone boson was realized in Randall-Sundrum models and in CFTs. Detailed phenomenological studies showed that within this framework agreement with experimental data can be obtained with a mild [[fine-tuning|tuning]] of parameters.

== Models ==
CHM can be characterized by the mass (M) of the lightest new particles and their coupling (g). The latter is expected to be larger than the SM couplings for consistency. Various realizations of CHM exist that differ for the mechanism that generates the Higgs doublet. Broadly they can be divided in two categories:
# Higgs is a generic bound state of strong dynamics.
# Higgs is a Goldstone boson of spontaneous symmetry breaking&lt;ref&gt;R. Contino, ''The Higgs as a Composite Nambu-Goldstone Boson'',   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.4269.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Redi, https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxyZWRpNzZ8Z3g6YjZlZDk5NDU4NTBjMmU5&lt;/ref&gt;
In both cases the electro-weak symmetry is broken by the [[Bose-Einstein condensate|condensation]] of a Higgs scalar doublet. In the first type of scenario there is no a priori reason why the Higgs boson is lighter than the other composite states and moreover larger deviations from the SM are expected.

=== Higgs as Goldstone boson ===
In this scenario the existence of the Higgs boson follows from the symmetries of the theory. This allows to explain why this particle is lighter than the rest of the composite particles whose mass is expected from direct and indirect tests to be around a TeV or higher. It is assumed that the composite sector has a global symmetry G [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] to a subgroup H where G and H are compact [[Lie groups]]. Contrary to [[technicolor]] models the unbroken symmetry must contain the SM electro-weak group SU(2)xU(1).  According to [[Goldstone's theorem]] the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry produces massless scalar particles known as [[Goldstone bosons]]. By appropriately choosing the [[global symmetry|global symmetries]] it is possible to have Goldstone bosons that correspond to the Higgs doublet in the SM. This can be done in a variety of ways&lt;ref&gt;J. Mrazek, A. Pomarol, R. Rattazzi, M. Redi, J. Serra and A. Wulzer, ''The Other Natural Two Higgs Doublet Model'',   Nucl. Phys. B853, 1 (2011)   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.5403.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; and is completely determined by the symmetries. In particular [[group theory]] determines the [[quantum numbers]] of the Goldstone bosons. From the decomposition of the adjoint representation one finds,
:&lt;math&gt;\rm{Adj}[G]={\rm Adj}[H]+{\rm R}[\Pi]&lt;/math&gt;
where R[Π] is the representation of the Goldstone bosons under H. The phenomenological request that a Higgs doublet exists selects the possible symmetries. Typical example is the pattern
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {SO(5)}{SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R}\rightarrow GB=(2,2)&lt;/math&gt;
that contains a single Higgs doublet as a Goldstone boson.

The physics of the Higgs as a Goldstone boson is strongly constrained by the symmetries and determined by the symmetry breaking scale f that controls their interactions. An approximate relation exists between mass and coupling of the composite states,
&lt;math&gt;M=g f&lt;/math&gt;
In CHM one finds that deviations from the SM are proportional to,
:&lt;math&gt;\xi=\frac {v^2}{f^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where v=246 GeV is the [[electro-weak]] vacuum expectation value. By construction these models approximate the SM to arbitrary precision if  ξ is sufficiently small.  For example, for the model above with SO(5) global symmetry the coupling of the Higgs to W and Z bosons is modified as,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{h_{VV}}{h_{VV}^{SM}}\approx 1-\frac {\xi} 2 &lt;/math&gt;
Phenomenological studies suggest f &gt; 1 TeV and thus at least a factor of a few larger than v. However the tuning of parameters required to achieve v &lt; f is inversely proportional to ξ so that viable scenarios require some degree of tuning.

Goldstone bosons generated from the spontaneous breaking of an exact global symmetry are ''exactly'' massless. Therefore if the Higgs boson is a Goldstone boson the global symmetry cannot be exact. In CHM the Higgs potential is generated by effects that explicitly break the global symmetry G. Minimally these are the SM Yukawa and gauge couplings that cannot respect the global symmetry but other effects can also exist. The [[top quark|top]] coupling is expected to give a dominant contribution to the Higgs potential as this is the largest coupling in the SM. In the simplest models one finds a correlation between the Higgs mass and the mass M of the top partners,&lt;ref&gt;M. Redi and A. Tesi, ''Implications of a Light Higgs in Composite Models'',   JHEP 1210, 166 (2012)   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0232.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m_h^2\sim \frac {3}{2\pi^2} \frac {M^2}{f^2} v^2&lt;/math&gt;
In models with f~TeV as suggested by naturalness this indicates fermionic resonances with mass around 1 TeV. Spin-1 resonances are expected to be somewhat heavier. This is within the reach of future collider experiments.

=== Partial compositeness ===
One of the key ingredients of modern realizations of CHM is the hypothesis of partial compositeness originally proposed by D. B. Kaplan.&lt;ref&gt;D. B. Kaplan, ''Flavor at SSC energies: A New mechanism for dynamically generated fermion masses'',   Nucl. Phys. B 365, 259 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is automatically realized in Randall-Sundrum scenarios. Every SM particle has a heavy partner that can mix with it. In practice the SM particles are linear combinations of elementary and composite states:
:&lt;math&gt;|SM\rangle=\cos{\alpha} |El&gt;+\sin{\alpha}|Co\rangle &lt;/math&gt;
where α denotes the mixing angle. Partial compositeness is naturally realized in the gauge sector where an analogous phenomenon happens [[quantum chromodynamics]] and is known as [[photon]]–[[rho meson|ρ]] mixing. For fermions it is an assumption that in particular requires the existence of heavy fermions with equal quantum numbers to SM [[quarks]] and [[leptons]]. These interact with the Higgs through the mixing. One schematically finds the formula for the SM fermion masses,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{m_f}v\approx \sin \alpha_L \cdot Y \cdot \sin \alpha_R &lt;/math&gt;
where L and R refer to the left and right mixings, and Y is a composite sector coupling.

The composite particles are multiplets of the unbroken symmetry H. For phenomenological reasons this should contain the custodial symmetry SU(2)xSU(2) extending the electro-weak symmetry SU(2)xU(1). Composite fermions often belong to [[representation of a Lie group|representations]] larger than the SM particles. For example, a strongly motivated representation for left-handed fermions is the (2,2) that contains particles with exotic electric charge 5/3 or –4/3 with special experimental signatures.

Partial compositeness ameliorates the phenomenology of CHM providing a logic why no deviations from the SM have been measured so far. In the so-called anarchic scenarios the hierarchies of SM fermion masses are generated through the hierarchies of mixings and anarchic composite sector couplings. The light fermions are almost elementary while the third generation is strongly or entirely composite. This leads to a structural suppression of all effects that involve first two generations that are the most precisely measured. In particular flavor transitions and corrections to electro-weak observables are suppressed. Other scenarios are also possible&lt;ref&gt;M. Redi and A. Weiler, ''Flavor and CP Invariant Composite Higgs Models'',   JHEP 1111, 108 (2011)   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.6357.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; with different phenomenology.

== Experiments ==
The main experimental signatures of CHM are:
# New heavy partners of Standard Model particles, with SM quantum numbers and masses around a TeV
# Modified SM couplings
# New contributions to [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] observables

Supersymmetric models also predict that every Standard Model particle will have a heavier partner. However, in supersymmetry the partners have a different [[spin (physics)|spin]]: they are bosons if the SM particle is a fermion, and ''vice versa''. In composite Higgs models the partners have the same spin as the SM particles.

All the deviations from the SM are controlled by the tuning parameter ξ. The mixing of the SM particles determines the coupling with the known particles of the SM. The detailed phenomenology depends strongly on the flavor assumptions and is in general model-dependent. The Higgs and the top quark typically have the largest coupling to the new particles. For this reason third [[generation (particle physics)|generation]] partners are the most easy to produce and top physics has the largest deviations from the SM. Top partners have also special importance given their role in the naturalness of the theory.

After the first run of the LHC direct experimental searches exclude third generation fermionic resonances up to 800 GeV.&lt;ref&gt;ATLAS, https://cds.cern.ch/record/1557777/files/ATLAS-CONF-2013-060.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CMS, https://cds.cern.ch/record/1524087/files/B2G-12-012-pas.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Bounds on gluon resonances are in the multi-TeV range&lt;ref&gt;ATLAS, https://cds.cern.ch/record/1547568/files/ATLAS-CONF-2013-052.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CMS, https://cds.cern.ch/record/1545285/files/B2G-12-005-pas.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and somewhat weaker bounds exist for electro-weak resonances.

Deviations from the SM couplings is proportional to the degree of compositeness of the particles. For this reason the largest departures from the SM predictions are expected for the third generation quarks and Higgs couplings.  The first have been measured with per mille precision by the [[LEP]] experiment. After the first run of the LHC the couplings of the Higgs with fermions and gauge bosons agree with the SM with a precision around 20%. These results pose some tension for CHM but are compatible with a compositeness scale f~TeV.

The hypothesis of partial compositeness allows to suppress [[Flavor-changing neutral current|flavor violation]] beyond the SM that is severely constrained experimentally. Nevertheless, within anarchic scenarios sizable deviations from the SM predictions exist in several observables. Particularly constrained is [[CP violation]] in the [[Kaon]] system and lepton flavor violation for example the rare decay μ-&gt;eγ. Overall flavor physics suggests the strongest indirect bounds on anarchic scenarios. This tension can be avoided with different flavor assumptions.

{{Party politics}}

The '''conservation movement''', also known as '''nature conservation''', is a political, environmental, and social movement that seeks to protect [[natural resource]]s including animal and plant species as well as their habitat for the future.

The early conservation movement included [[fisheries]] and wildlife management, water, [[soil]] conservation, and [[sustainable forestry]]. The contemporary conservation movement has broadened from the early movement's emphasis on use of sustainable yield of natural resources and preservation of [[wilderness]] areas to include preservation of [[biodiversity]]. Some say the conservation movement is part of the broader and more far-reaching [[environmental movement]], while others argue that they differ both in ideology and practice. Chiefly in the United States, conservation is seen as differing from [[environmentalism]] in that it aims to preserve natural resources expressly for their continued [[sustainable]] use by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Early history===
[[File:Sylva paper 1662.jpg|right|thumb| ''Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber in His Majesty's Dominions,'' title page of the first edition (1664).]]
The conservation movement can be traced back to [[John Evelyn]]'s work ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber|Sylva]]'', presented as a paper to the [[Royal Society]] in 1662. Published as a book two years later, it was one of the most highly influential texts on [[forestry]] ever published.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Evelyn]], ''Sylva, Or A Discourse of Forest Trees ... with an Essay on the Life and Works of the Author by John Nisbet'', Fourth Edition (1706), reprinted London: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1908, V1, p. lxv; online edn, March 2007 [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20778/20778-h/20778-h.htm], accessed 29 Dec 2012. This source (John Nisbet) states: "There can be no doubt that John Evelyn, both during his own lifetime and throughout the two centuries which have elapsed since his death in 1706, has exerted more individual influence, through his charming ''Sylva'', ... than can be ascribed to any other individual." Nisbet adds that "Evelyn was by no means the first [author] who wrote on [forestry]. That honour belongs to Master [[Anthony Fitzherbert|Fitzherbert]], whose ''Boke of Husbandrie'' was published in 1534" (V1, p. lxvi).&lt;/ref&gt; Timber resources in England were becoming dangerously depleted at the time, and Evelyn advocated the importance of conserving the forests by managing the rate of depletion and ensuring that the cut down trees get replenished.

The field developed during the 18th century, especially in [[Prussia]] and France where scientific forestry methods were developed. These methods were first applied rigorously in [[British India]] from the early-19th century. The government was interested in the use of [[forest produce]] and began managing the forests with measures to reduce the risk of wildfire in order to protect the "household" of nature, as it was then termed. This early ecological idea was in order to preserve the growth of delicate [[teak]] trees, which was an important resource for the [[Royal Navy]]. Concerns over teak depletion were raised as early as 1799 and 1805 when the Navy was undergoing a massive expansion during the [[Napoleonic War]]s; this pressure led to the first formal conservation Act, which prohibited the felling of small teak trees. The first forestry officer was appointed in 1806 to regulate and preserve the trees necessary for shipbuilding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edugreen.teri.res.in/explore/forestry/history.htm|title=History of forests in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; This promising start received a setback in the 1820s and 30s, when [[laissez-faire]] economics and complaints from private landowners brought these early conservation attempts to an end.

===Origins of the modern conservation movement===
Conservation was revived in the mid-19th century, with the first practical application of scientific conservation principles to the forests of India. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in [[British India]] through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Percy Stebbing]] warned of desertification of India. The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barton |first=Greg |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WDYlNljAP5AC|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|isbn=9781139434607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These local attempts gradually received more attention by the British government as the unregulated felling of trees continued unabated. In 1850, the [[British Association]] in Edinburgh formed a committee to study forest destruction at the behest of [[Hugh Francis Cleghorn|Dr. Hugh Cleghorn]] a pioneer in the nascent conservation movement.

He had become interested in [[Sustainable forest management|forest conservation]] in [[Mysore]] in 1847 and gave several lectures at the Association on the failure of agriculture in India. These lectures influenced the government under [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] to introduce the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the [[United States]]. In the same year, Cleghorn organised the [[Tamil Nadu Forest Department|Madras Forest Department]] and in 1860 the Department banned the use [[shifting cultivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=Nov 5, 2007|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleghorn's 1861 manual, ''The forests and gardens of South India'', became the definitive work on the subject and was widely used by forest assistants in the subcontinent.&lt;ref name="Cleghorn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

[[File:Sir William Schlich07.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Schlich, in the middle of the seated row, with students from the forestry school at Oxford, on a visit to the forests of Saxony in the year 1892.]]
Sir [[Dietrich Brandis]], a [[Germany|German]] forester, joined the British service in 1856 as superintendent of the teak forests of Pegu division in eastern [[Myanmar|Burma]]. During that time Burma's [[teak]] forests were controlled by militant [[Karen people|Karen]] tribals. He introduced the "taungya" system,&lt;ref&gt;King KFS (1968). "Agro-silviculture (the taungya system)". University of Ibadan / Dept. of Forestry, Bulletin no. 1, 109&lt;/ref&gt; in which Karen villagers provided labour for clearing, planting and weeding teak plantations. After seven years in Burma, Brandis was appointed Inspector General of Forests in India, a position he served in for 20 years. He formulated new forest legislation and helped establish research and training institutions. The [[Imperial Forest School]] at [[Dehradun]] was founded by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weil|first1=Benjamin|title=Conservation, Exploitation, and Cultural Change in the Indian Forest Service, 1875-1927|journal=Environmental History|date=1 April 2006|volume=11|issue=2|pages=319–343|doi=10.1093/envhis/11.2.319|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233861694_Conservation_Exploitation_and_Cultural_Change_in_the_Indian_Forest_Service_1875-1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madhav Gadgil and Ramachandra Guha, ''This Fissured Land: An Ecological History of India'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Germans were prominent in the forestry administration of British India. As well as Brandis, [[Berthold Ribbentrop]] and [[Sir William P.D. Schlich]] brought new methods to Indian conservation, the latter becoming the Inspector-General in 1883 after Brandis stepped down. Schlich helped to establish the journal ''[[Indian Forester]]'' in 1874, and became the founding director of the first [[forestry]] school in England at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Burley, Jeffery, et al. 2009. "A History of Forestry at Oxford", ''British Scholar'', Vol. 1, No. 2., pp.236-261. Accessed: May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He authored the five-volume ''Manual of Forestry'' (1889–96) on [[silviculture]], [[forest management]], [[forest protection]], and [[forest utilisation]], which became the standard and enduring textbook for forestry students.

{{Main|Conservation in the United States}}
The American movement received its inspiration from 19th century works that exalted the inherent value of nature, quite apart from human usage. Author [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817-1862) made key philosophical contributions that exalted nature. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book ''[[Walden]],'' which argued that people should become intimately close with nature. The ideas of [[Dietrich Brandis|Sir Brandis]], [[Sir William P.D. Schlich]] and [[Carl A. Schenck]] were also very influential - [[Gifford Pinchot]], the first chief of the [[USDA Forest Service]], relied heavily upon Brandis' advice for introducing professional forest management in the U.S. and on how to structure the Forest Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaticsociety.org.bd/journals/Golden_jubilee_vol/articles/H_468%20(Brett%20M%20Benet).htm America has been the context for both the origins of conservation history and its modern form, environmental history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313144333/http://www.asiaticsociety.org.bd/journals/Golden_jubilee_vol/articles/H_468%20%28Brett%20M%20Benet%29.htm |date=2012-03-13 }}.

Both conservationists and preservationists appeared in political debates during the [[Progressive Era]] (the 1890s&amp;mdash;early 1920s). There were three main positions. The laissez-faire position held that owners of private property—including lumber and mining companies, should be allowed to do anything they wished for their property.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Hays, ''Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement, 1890-1920'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservationists, led by future President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his close ally [[George Bird Grinnell]], were motivated by the wanton waste that was taking place at the hand of market forces, including logging and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Redekop, "Embodying the Story: The Conservation Leadership of Theodore Roosevelt" in ''Leadership'' (2015).

[http://cnu.edu/leadershipstudies/faculty/pdf/redekop-embodying_the_story_theodore_roosevelts_conservation_leadership.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114045519/http://cnu.edu/leadershipstudies/faculty/pdf/redekop-embodying_the_story_theodore_roosevelts_conservation_leadership.pdf |date=2016-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice resulted in placing a large number of North American game species on the edge of extinction. Roosevelt recognized that the laissez-faire approach of the U.S. Government was too wasteful and inefficient. In any case, they noted, most of the natural resources in the western states were already owned by the federal government.  The best course of action, they argued, was a long-term plan devised by national experts to maximize the long-term economic benefits of natural resources. To accomplish the mission, Roosevelt and Grinnell formed the [[Boone and Crockett Club]] in 1887. The Club was made up of the best minds and influential men of the day. The [[Boone and Crockett Club]]'s contingency of conservationists, scientists, politicians, and intellectuals became Roosevelt's closest advisers during his march to preserve wildlife and habitat across North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives of the Boone and Crockett Club|url=http://cdm16013.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16013coll13/id/1220/rec/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preservationists, led by [[John Muir]] (1838–1914), argued that the conservation policies were not strong enough to protect the interest of the natural world because they continued to focus on the natural world as a source of economic production.

The debate between conservation and preservation reached its peak in the public debates over the construction of California's [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (California)|Hetch Hetchy dam]] in [[Yosemite National Park]] which supplies the water supply of San Francisco. Muir, leading the [[Sierra Club]], declared that the valley must be preserved for the sake of its beauty: "No holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man."

President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] put conservationist issue high on the national agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas G. Brinkley, ''The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter, [[Gifford Pinchot]] and was deeply committed to conserving natural resources. He encouraged the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres (360,000&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 930,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more federal land for [[national park]]s and [[nature preserve]]s than all of his predecessors combined.&lt;ref&gt;W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservations Legacy'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:TR-Enviro.JPG|Thumb|250px|right|Roosevelt was a leader in conservation, fighting to end the waste of natural resources]]

Roosevelt established the [[United States Forest Service]], signed into law the creation of five [[National parks (United States)|national parks]], and signed the year 1906 [[Antiquities Act]], under which he proclaimed 18 new [[National Monument (United States)|national monuments]]. He also established the first 51 [[bird reserve]]s, four [[game preserve]]s, and 150 [[United States National Forest|national forests]], including [[Shoshone National Forest]], the nation's first. The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately {{convert|230000000|acre|km2}}.

[[Gifford Pinchot]] had been appointed by McKinley as chief of Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture. In 1905, his department gained control of the national forest reserves.  Pinchot promoted private use (for a fee) under federal supervision. In 1907, Roosevelt designated 16 million acres (65,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of new national forests just minutes before a deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Char Miller, ''Seeking the Greatest Good: The Conservation Legacy of Gifford Pinchot'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the [[Conference of Governors]] held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: "Conservation as a National Duty.".

In 1903 Roosevelt toured the Yosemite Valley with [[John Muir]], who had a very different view of conservation, and tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests.  Working through the Sierra Club he founded, Muir succeeded in 1905 in having Congress transfer the [[Mariposa Grove]] and Yosemite Valley to the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 26, Chap. 1263, pp. 650-52.

Theodore Roosevelt's view on conservationism remained dominant for decades; - [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] authorised the building of many large-scale dams and water projects, as well as the expansion of the National Forest System to buy out sub-marginal farms.  In 1937, the [[Pittman–Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act]] was signed into law, providing funding for state agencies to carry out their conservation efforts.

====Since 1970====
Environmental reemerged on the national agenda in 1970, with Republican [[Richard Nixon]] playing a major role, especially with his creation of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. The debates over the public lands and environmental politics played a supporting role in the decline of liberalism and the rise of modern environmentalism. Although Americans consistently rank environmental issues as "important", polling data indicates that in the voting booth voters rank the environmental issues low relative to other political concerns.

The growth of the Republican party's political power in the inland West (apart from the Pacific coast) was facilitated by the rise of popular opposition to public lands reform.  Successful Democrats in the inland West and Alaska typically take more conservative positions on environmental issues than Democrats from the Coastal states.  Conservatives drew on new organizational networks of think tanks, industry groups, and citizen-oriented organizations, and they began to deploy new strategies that affirmed the rights of individuals to their property, protection of extraction rights, to hunt and recreate, and to pursue happiness unencumbered by the federal government at the expense of resource conservation.&lt;ref&gt;* Turner, James Morton, "The Specter of Environmentalism": Wilderness, Environmental Politics, and the Evolution of the New Right.

=== Conservation in Costa Rica ===
[[File:Areas Conservacion CR.svg|thumb|Figure 1. Costa Rica divided into different areas of conservation]]

Although the conservation movement developed in Europe in the 18th century, [[Costa Rica]] as a country has been heralded its champion in the current times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/25/costa-rica-biodiversity|title=Costa Rica recognised for biodiversity protection|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2010-10-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa Rica hosts an astonishing number of species, given its size, having more animal and plant species than the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]] combined&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; while being only 250 miles long and 150 miles wide. A widely accepted theory for the origin of this unusual density of species is the free mixing of species from both North and South America occurring on this "inter-oceanic" and "inter-continental" landscape.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Preserving the natural environment of this fragile landscape, therefore, has drawn the attention of many international scholars.

Costa Rica has made conservation a national priority, and has been at the forefront of preserving its natural environment with over a quarter of its land designated as protected in some form, which is under the administrative control of [[National System of Conservation Areas|SINAC]] (National System of Conservation Areas) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inbio.ac.cr/es/biod/estrategia/estudio.html|title=http://www.inbio.ac.cr/es/biod/estrategia/estudio.html|website=inbio.ac.cr|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a division of [[Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications|MINAE]] (Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications). SINAC has subdivided the country into various zones depending on the ecological diversity of that region - these zones are depicted in figure 1.

The country has used this ecological diversity to its economic advantage in the form of a thriving [[Ecotourism in Costa Rica|ecotourism industry]], putting its commitment to nature, on display to visitors from across the globe. It is estimated that a record 2.6 million foreigners visited the country in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/01/16/costa-rica-welcomes-2-6-million-tourists-2015-hits-new-record|title=Costa Rica tourism sets new record with 2.6 million visitors in 2015|work=The Tico Times Costa Rica|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost half the population of Costa Rica itself. This tourism is facilitated by the fact that Costa Rica has a stable democracy and has a [[human development index]] of 0.776, the highest for any country in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/CRI|title={{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the only country in the world that generates more than 99% of its electricity from renewable sources, relying on hydropower (78%), wind (10%), geothermal energy (10%), biomass and solar (1%). Critics have pointed out however, that in achieving this milestone, the country has built several dams (providing the bulk of its electricity) some of which have negatively impacted indigenous communities as well as the local flora and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/costa-rica-electricity-renewable-energy-300-days-2017-record-wind-hydro-solar-water-a8069111.html|title=Costa Rica runs entirely on renewable energy for 300 days this year|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Historical development ====
[[File:16th century Spanish expansion in the Caribbean.png|thumb|Figure 2. 16th century Spanish expansion in the Caribbean]]
"The Green Republic: A Conservation History of Costa Rica" by Sterling Evans is a renowned book that traces the development of the conservation movement in Costa Rica from the mid 1700s to present day.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=NckTGXhHZgQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=The+Green+Republic:+A+Conservation+History+of+Costa+Rica,&amp;ots=83nGtAQb-k&amp;sig=sg06Dd_009atdW-IjCOB_in1xM4#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Green%20Republic:%20A%20Conservation%20History%20of%20Costa%20Rica,&amp;f=false|title=The Green Republic: A Conservation History of Costa Rica|last=Evans|first=Sterling|date=2010-06-28|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292789289|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans mentions that when the Spaniards first arrived in the Americas, the landscape of Costa Rica did not appear particularly hospitable to them, compared to Guatemala or Mexico which seemed more reminiscent of the Spanish climate. Therefore, up until the 18th century, there was very little agricultural development in the region. It also lacked gold and other minerals that [[Christopher Columbus]] had hoped to find in these areas (hence the name, Rich Coast). As a result, the forest cover of Costa Rica was left more or less intact by the European settlement in the Americas.

By the mid-19th century, it was observed that the Costa Rican soil was particularly conducive to the growth of coffee. The global demand for coffee was growing rapidly, fueled by the demand from the working class in the industrializing west. The agricultural model adopted by coffee growers in Costa Rica was of small family owned farms known as ''cafeteras,'' and they strove to be responsible stewards of the land. This approach was in stark contrast to the coffee [[monoculture]] that would've developed by adopting a purely capitalistic ideology. As a result, even though the coffee production increased substantially from 1850 to 1950, there wasn't large scale deforestation in Costa Rica until the 1950s, contrary to popular belief.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Some of the key points often overlooked in Costa Rica's conservation history between 1850 and 2000 according to Evans, are as follows:

1. President Bernardo Soto's government in 1888 began the process of attracting scholars from all over the world, particularly Switzerland and Germany in an effort to educate the locals about agricultural practices harmonious with the environment such that by 1914, Costa Rica became a leading scientific research center in tropical America

2. The establishment of the [[University of Costa Rica]] (UCR) in the 1940s was a landmark event, since the university acted as a springboard for research into tropical studies in Central America. At the helm of UCR were many influential academics such as [[Rafael Lucas Rodríguez]] and [[Alexander Skutch]] whose forward thinking publications served as a foundation for the future policy decisions. Skutch noted,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

"&lt;small&gt;in the mid-1930s, Costa Rica was still largely unspoiled. Its population of less than a half a million people . . .was concentrated in the narrow Meseta Central. . . . Other advantages . . . to the naturalist were its political stability and the friendliness of its people. . . . Costa Rica has a record of continuous, orderly constitutional government that scarcely any other country in Latin America can match. Thus the naturalist working in some remote spot was not likely to have his studies suddenly interrupted or his thin lines of communication cut by a violent upheaval, as has happened to many in Latin America. .&lt;/small&gt;"

3. By 1950, Costa Rica became heavily reliant on coffee exports to Europe and the US. Around the same time, it was battling the dilemma between increasing agricultural output on one hand and protecting natural resources for future use on the other. In 1958, however, the world coffee prices plummeted, and Costa Rica's main source of income was shown to be very vulnerable to unpredictable forces. The government responded by promoting internal manufacturing and encouraging other industries. One such industry that emerged as a result, was the meat industry.

The Central American valley has been described as "perfect for cattle" by [[Carl Hoffman]]. Until 1970, the cattle raised in Costa Rica were primarily used for domestic consumption. Around 1970, the demand for beef from the US started showing an exponential growth due to the rise of the fast-food industry. This robust demand, coupled with the falling coffee prices gave the cattle industry a boost and forests started getting replaced with pastures. At its worst, Costa Rica was losing 4% of its forested area per year.

An alternative analysis by Julia Flagg within the framework of "[[Process tracing|process-tracing]]" reveals that after gaining independence in 1821 the isolation of Costa Rica from El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua was critical in shaping its future and served as a divergence point in the evolution of the Central American nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flagg|first=Julia A.|date=2018-01-24|title=Carbon Neutral by 2021: The Past and Present of Costa Rica’s Unusual Political Tradition|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/2/296|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=296|doi=10.3390/su10020296}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mahoney &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511750328|title=Colonialism and Postcolonial Development|last=Mahoney|first=James|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511750328|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; “ . . . while all of the other provinces quickly became engulfed in warfare and political chaos, Costa Rica escaped such devastation and made tentative economic strides forward”. She also argues that the lack of a land-owning elite class in Costa Rica was instrumental in the development of good governance and  maintaining a stable democracy in the country. The abolishing of the military in 1948 helped free up valuable resources that the government chose to invest into education and resource protection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The country entered into a positive reinforcement cycle thereafter, where new laws enacted drew international praise which helped solidify Costa Rica's position as global leader in resource protection .

==== Examples of active efforts ====

===== Environmental Services Program =====
To counter reducing forest area coverage in the 1980's, the Costa Rican government pioneered a [[Payment for ecosystem services#Costa Rica|scheme]] in 1997 known as ''PES'', which rewarded private land owners for keeping forests intact on their lands in lieu of the services provided by these forests to the environment and the economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iied.org/payments-for-ecosystem-services-costa-rica-s-recipe|title=Payments for ecosystem services: Costa Rica’s recipe|date=2013-11-29|work=International Institute for Environment and Development|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank, which provided the loan initially from 2000 to 2006 to support the payments incentivizing afforestation, viewed the program as a success overall despite some of its shortcomings.

It is estimated that the percentage of Costa Rican land covered by forests has gone up from around 20% in the 1980's to over 50% of the total area in 2013 - a growth of 250%. The program has also reduced the national carbon emissions by 11 million tons over a period of 6 years from 1999 to 2005. Indigenous communities and women in particular, have benefited due to this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2015/12/16/costa-rica-improves-the-efficiency-of-its-payment-for-environmental-services-program|title=Costa Rica Improves the Efficiency of its Payment for Environmental Services Program|work=World Bank|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buoyed by this success, the World Bank extended its support to the Costa Rican government's initiative by funding a new program titled "Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projects.worldbank.org/P093384/mainstreaming-market-based-instruments-environmental-management-project?lang=en|title=Projects  : Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management Project {{!}} The World Bank|website=projects.worldbank.org|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, many international agencies have pushed the national government to make the process of obtaining the payments easier so as to include more underdeveloped communities and cast a wider net for the program.

===== Green sea turtle conservation =====
[[File:Green sea turtle (1).jpg|thumb|A Green sea turtle]]
The [[green sea turtle]] is a globally endangered species and one of the most important nesting grounds for it is in [[Tortuguero National Park|Tortuguero]], Costa Rica&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-01-01|title=Long-term conservation efforts contribute to positive green turtle Chelonia mydas nesting trend at Tortuguero, Costa Rica|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320704001715|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=121|issue=1|pages=111–116|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.04.014|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the word Totuguero is derived from old Spanish maps meaning "place of turtles". After a steady global decline in its population due to overhunting for its meat and eggs, the Tortuguero National Park was established in 1975 in an effort to protect and save the turtle's breeding zone. A highly cited study&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by Tröeng and Rankin, investigated in 2004, the effects that this protective measure has had on the nesting trend. Although the population of turtles shows a large inter-annual variation thus making the task of determining the exact number very difficult, on an average, the trend has been positive over a long time scale of almost 35 years. The study illustrated that the enactment of three laws by the Costa Rican government was vital in stabilizing and increasing the population of these green sea turtles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

1. A ban on turtle and egg collection in 1963

2. A ban on the export of [[calipee]] (a part of the turtle's head that is considered a delicacy) in 1970 and finally,

3. The creation of the Tortuguero National Park in 1975 by the legislative assembly.

The lasting impact created by such forward thinking political decisions exhibits the necessity of meaningful governmental intervention.

===== Carbon neutral goal =====
[[File:EARTH-La Flor Campus Classroom.jpg|thumb|Classroom of [[EARTH University|Earth University]] in Costa Rica - a carbon neutral university]]
Although they contribute only 0.15% to the world's [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], the governments of New Zealand and Costa Rica&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5439|title=Costa Rica and New Zealand on Path to Carbon Neutrality {{!}} Worldwatch Institute|website=worldwatch.org|language=cust-en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; have independently expressed their intents to become carbon neutral in the next decade, with Costa Rica aiming to achieve an ambitious target of becoming carbon neutral by 2021.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/costa-rica-promotes-carbon-neutral-program-2021/|title=Costa Rica Promotes the Carbon Neutral Program in 2021 {{!}} The Costa Rica News|last=Villegas|first=Charito|date=2017-11-14|work=The Costa Rica News|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, it would become the world's first carbon neutral country, with the expectation of influencing policy decisions in other major countries. The proposal hopes to ignite the interest of private companies to engage in practices that reduce their emissions, for example, using more fuel efficient routes in transportation, relying more on digital documents than printed ones, adopting LED lighting in offices and using more efficient air conditioning systems.

==== Criticisms of active efforts ====
The government's approach to attain zero net emissions has yielded positive results overall, but has been described as insufficient and lacking by experts &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; because it neglects vehicular emissions which account for nearly 20% of the country's total emissions. The 2021 target has also been called "arbitrary" and "overambitious", since the efforts to reduce the country's reliance on imported oil &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/costa-rica-carbon-neutral-2021-reality-or-unrealistic/|title=Costa Rica Carbon Neutral 2021: Reality or Unrealistic?|last=STAFF|first=TCRN|date=2014-07-21|work=The Costa Rica News|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; will take much longer to take effect.

In 2006, a study by Sierra and Russman&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-08-05|title=On the efficiency of environmental service payments: A forest conservation assessment in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800905004982|journal=Ecological Economics|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=131–141|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.10.010|issn=0921-8009}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the additional conservation obtained through PES, over and above the baseline conservation rate. The study concluded that the PES program definitely affected land use decisions because land owners used the payments for other productive activities thus keeping the forest cover intact. However, they also concluded that this was not the most effective use of funds because the majority of these forests would have remained intact even without the payments. The study suggested that it would a better strategy to engage in the protection of more critical habitats instead.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;    
[[File:Represa Hidroeléctrica Reventazón, Costa Rica (1).jpg|thumb|The Reventazón Dam has come under criticism recently for the loss of habitat it has caused for many species]]

Protestors of this project claim that the construction has failed to meet the expectations on the following issues:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

1) The constructors did not completely clear vegetation from the areas that would be flooded due to this project. As a result, the uncleared vegetation in the flooded areas began to stagnate, creating the perfect conditions for the growth of the [[Eichhornia crassipes|Water Hyacinth]] (an invasive species). The Water Hyacinth acted as a source for a large amount of carbon dioxide and methane emitted into the atmosphere.

2) Reforestation around the reservoir lake to assist in the migration of the jaguars has not been completed making their movement more difficult.

3) Due to the removal of a lot of material to facilitate construction, the neighboring Lancaster wetlands (home to more than 250 species of birds and 80 species of mammals, reptiles and amphibians) have been left in a state more susceptible to landslides.

What appears to be common in these criticisms is that the initiatives have moved things in the right direction overall, but the implementation hasn't been as good as promised.

== Areas of concern ==
[[Deforestation]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] are issues affecting all regions of the world.  The consequent destruction of wildlife habitat has prompted the creation of conservation groups in other countries, some founded by local hunters who have witnessed declining wildlife populations first hand.  Also, it was highly important for the conservation movement to solve problems of living conditions in the cities and the overpopulation of such places.

=== Boreal forest and the Arctic ===
The idea of incentive conservation is a modern one but its practice has clearly defended some of the sub Arctic wildernesses and the wildlife in those regions for thousands of years, especially by indigenous peoples such as the Evenk, Yakut, Sami, Inuit and Cree. The fur trade and hunting by these peoples have preserved these regions for thousands of years. Ironically, the pressure now upon them comes from non-renewable resources such as oil, sometimes to make synthetic clothing which is advocated as a humane substitute for fur. (See [[Raccoon dog]] for case study of the conservation of an animal through fur trade.) Similarly, in the case of the beaver, hunting and fur trade were thought to bring about the animal's demise, when in fact they were an integral part of its conservation. For many years children's books stated and still do, that the decline in the beaver population was due to the fur trade. In reality however, the decline in beaver numbers was because of habitat destruction and deforestation, as well as its continued persecution as a pest (it causes flooding). In Cree lands however, where the population valued the animal for meat and fur, it continued to thrive. The Inuit defend their relationship with the seal in response to outside critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icc.gl/UserFiles/File/sealskin/2006-03-07_icc_saelskind_pressemeddelse_eng.pdf|title=Inuit Ask Europeans to Support Its Seal Hunt and Way of Life|date=6 March 2006|accessdate=12 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628204105/http://www.icc.gl/UserFiles/File/sealskin/2006-03-07_icc_saelskind_pressemeddelse_eng.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin America (Bolivia) ===
The [[Izoceño people|Izoceño]]-[[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]], [[Bolivia]] is a tribe of hunters who were influential in establishing the Capitania del Alto y Bajo Isoso (CABI). CABI promotes economic growth and survival of the Izoceno people while discouraging the rapid destruction of habitat within Bolivia's [[Gran Chaco]]. They are responsible for the creation of the 34,000 square kilometre Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Area (KINP).  The KINP protects the most biodiverse portion of the Gran Chaco, an ecoregion shared with Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. In 1996, the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] joined forces with CABI to institute wildlife and hunting monitoring programs in 23 Izoceño communities. The partnership combines traditional beliefs and local knowledge with the political and administrative tools needed to effectively manage habitats. The programs rely solely on voluntary participation by local hunters who perform self-monitoring techniques and keep records of their hunts.  The information obtained by the hunters participating in the program has provided CABI with important data required to make educated decisions about the use of the land. Hunters have been willing participants in this program because of pride in their traditional activities, encouragement by their communities and expectations of benefits to the area.

=== Africa (Botswana) ===
In order to discourage illegal South African hunting parties and ensure future local use and sustainability, indigenous hunters in [[Botswana]] began lobbying for and implementing conservation practices in the 1960s. The Fauna Preservation Society of Ngamiland (FPS) was formed in 1962 by the husband and wife team: Robert Kay and June Kay, environmentalists working in conjunction with the Batawana tribes to preserve wildlife habitat.

The FPS promotes habitat conservation and provides local education for preservation of wildlife. Conservation initiatives were met with strong opposition from the Botswana government because of the monies tied to big-game hunting. In 1963, BaTawanga Chiefs and tribal hunter/adventurers in conjunction with the FPS founded [[Moremi Wildlife Reserve|Moremi National Park and Wildlife Refuge]], the first area to be set aside by tribal people rather than governmental forces. Moremi National Park is home to a variety of wildlife, including lions, giraffes, elephants, buffalo, zebra, cheetahs and antelope, and covers an area of 3,000 square kilometers.  Most of the groups involved with establishing this protected land were involved with hunting and were motivated by their personal observations of declining wildlife and habitat.

{{About|the hypothesis in set theory|the assumption in fluid mechanics|Fluid mechanics}}
In [[mathematics]], the '''continuum hypothesis''' (abbreviated '''CH''') is a hypothesis about the possible sizes of [[infinite set]]s. It states:
{{quote|There is no set whose [[cardinality]] is strictly between that of the [[integer]]s and the [[real number]]s.}}

The continuum hypothesis was advanced by [[Georg Cantor]] in 1878, and
establishing its truth or falsehood is the first of [[Hilbert's problems|Hilbert's 23&amp;nbsp;problems]] presented in 1900. Τhe answer to this problem is [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of [[ZFC set theory]] (that is, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the [[axiom of choice]] included), so that either the continuum hypothesis or its negation can be added as an axiom to ZFC set theory, with the resulting theory being consistent if and only if ZFC is consistent. This independence was proved in 1963 by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]], complementing earlier work by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1940.

The name of the hypothesis comes from the term ''[[continuum (set theory)|the continuum]]'' for the real numbers.
==History==
Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain {{harv|Dauben|1990}}. It became the first on David Hilbert's [[Hilbert's problems|list of important open questions]] that was presented at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in the year 1900 in Paris. [[Axiomatic set theory]] was at that point not yet formulated. 
[[Kurt Gödel]] proved in 1940 that the negation of the continuum hypothesis, i.e., the existence of a set with intermediate cardinality, could not be proved in standard set theory.  The second half of the independence of the continuum hypothesis – i.e., unprovability of the nonexistence of an intermediate-sized set – was proved in 1963 by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]].

==Cardinality of infinite sets==
{{Main|Cardinal number}}

Two sets are said to have the same ''[[cardinality]]'' or ''[[cardinal number]]'' if there exists a [[bijection]] (a one-to-one correspondence) between them. Intuitively, for two sets ''S'' and ''T'' to have the same cardinality means that it is possible to "pair off" elements of ''S'' with elements of ''T'' in such a fashion that every element of ''S'' is paired off with exactly one element of ''T'' and vice versa. Hence, the set {banana, apple, pear} has the same cardinality as {yellow, red, green}.

With infinite sets such as the set of [[integer]]s or [[rational number]]s, the existence of a bijection between two sets becomes more difficult to demonstrate. The rational numbers seemingly form a counterexample to the continuum hypothesis: the integers form a proper subset of the rationals, which themselves form a proper subset of the reals, so intuitively, there are more rational numbers than integers and more real numbers than rational numbers.  However, this intuitive analysis is flawed; it does not take proper account of the fact that all three sets are [[infinite set|infinite]].  It turns out the rational numbers can actually be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the integers, and therefore the set of rational numbers is the same size (''cardinality'') as the set of integers: they are both [[countable set]]s.

Cantor gave two proofs that the cardinality of the set of [[integer]]s is strictly smaller than that of the set of [[real number]]s (see [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]] and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]). His proofs, however, give no indication of the extent to which the cardinality of the integers is less than that of the real numbers. Cantor proposed the continuum hypothesis as a possible solution to this question.

The continuum hypothesis states that the set of real numbers has minimal possible cardinality which is greater than the cardinality of the set of integers. That is, every set, ''S'', of real numbers can either be mapped one-to-one into the integers or the real numbers can be mapped one-to-one into ''S''. Using the fact that the real numbers are [[equinumerous]] with the powerset of the integers, the continuum hypothesis says that there is no set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt; \aleph_0 &lt; |S| &lt; 2^{\aleph_0}. &lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], [[aleph numbers|there is a smallest cardinal number &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; greater than &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;]], and the continuum hypothesis is in turn equivalent to the equality &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1. &lt;/math&gt;

There is also a generalization of the continuum hypothesis called the '''generalized continuum hypothesis''' ('''GCH''') which says that for every [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] &amp;alpha;, &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_\alpha} = \aleph_{\alpha+1}.&lt;/math&gt; That is, GCH asserts that the cardinality of the [[power set]] of each infinite set is the smallest cardinality greater than that of the set.

==Independence from ZFC==

The independence of the continuum hypothesis (CH) from [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF) follows from combined work of [[Kurt Gödel]]  and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]].

{{harvtxt|Gödel|1940}} showed that CH cannot be disproved from ZF, even if the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) is adopted (making ZFC). Gödel's proof shows that CH and AC both hold in the [[constructible universe]] L, an [[inner model]] of ZF set theory, assuming only the axioms of ZF.  The existence of an inner model of ZF  in which additional axioms hold shows that the additional axioms are [[consistent]] with ZF, provided ZF itself is consistent. The latter condition cannot be proved in ZF itself, due to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]], but is widely believed to be true and can be proved in stronger set theories.

Cohen ([[#{{harvid|Cohen|1963}}|1963]], [[#{{harvid|Cohen|1964}}|1964]]) showed that CH cannot be proven from the ZFC axioms, completing the overall independence proof.  To prove his result, Cohen developed the method of [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], which has become a standard tool in set theory.  Essentially, this method begins with a model of ZF in which CH holds, and constructs another model which contains more sets than the original, in a way that CH does not hold in the new model. Cohen was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1966 for his proof.

The independence proof just described shows that CH is independent of ZFC. Further research has shown that CH is independent of all known ''[[large cardinal axiom]]s'' in the context of ZFC. ({{harvtxt|Feferman|1999}})   Moreover, it has been shown that the cardinality of the continuum can be any cardinal consistent with [[König's theorem (set theory)|König's theorem]]. A result of Solovay, proved shortly after Cohen's result on the independence of the continuum hypothesis, shows that in any model of ZFC, if &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is a cardinal of uncountable [[cofinality]], then there is a forcing extension in which &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} = \kappa&lt;/math&gt;. However, per König's theorem, it is not consistent to assume &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\omega&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\omega_1+\omega}&lt;/math&gt; or any cardinal with cofinality &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.

The continuum hypothesis is closely related to many statements in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], point set [[topology]] and [[measure theory]]. As a result of its independence, many substantial [[conjecture]]s in those fields have subsequently been shown to be independent as well.

The independence from ZFC means that proving or disproving the CH within ZFC is impossible.  However, Gödel and Cohen's negative results are not universally accepted as disposing of all interest in the continuum hypothesis. Hilbert's problem remains an active topic of research; see {{harvs|last=Woodin|year=2001a|year2=2001b|txt}} and {{harvtxt|Koellner|2011a}} for an overview of the current research status.

The continuum hypothesis was not the first statement shown to be independent of ZFC. An immediate consequence of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], which was published in 1931, is that there is a formal statement (one for each appropriate [[Gödel numbering]] scheme) expressing the consistency of ZFC that is independent of ZFC, assuming that ZFC is consistent. The continuum hypothesis and the [[axiom of choice]] were among the first mathematical statements shown to be independent of ZF set theory.

==Arguments for and against the continuum hypothesis==
Gödel believed that CH is false, and that his proof that CH is consistent with ZFC only shows that the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel]] axioms do not adequately characterize the universe of sets.  Gödel was a [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|platonist]] and therefore had no problems with asserting the truth and falsehood of statements independent of their provability. Cohen, though a [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] {{harv|Goodman|1979}}, also tended towards rejecting CH.

Historically, mathematicians who favored a "rich" and "large" [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] of sets were against CH, while those favoring a "neat" and "controllable" universe favored CH. Parallel arguments were made for and against the [[axiom of constructibility]], which implies CH. More recently, [[Matthew Foreman]] has pointed out that [[ontological maximalism]] can actually be used to argue in favor of CH, because among models that have the same reals, models with "more" sets of reals have a better chance of satisfying CH (Maddy 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;500).

Another viewpoint is that the conception of set is not specific enough to determine whether CH is true or false. This viewpoint was advanced as early as 1923 by [[Skolem]], even before Gödel's first incompleteness theorem. Skolem argued on the basis of what is now known as [[Skolem's paradox]], and it was later supported by the independence of CH from the axioms of ZFC since these axioms are enough to establish the elementary properties of sets and cardinalities. In order to argue against this viewpoint, it would be sufficient to demonstrate new axioms that are supported by intuition and resolve CH in one direction or another. Although the [[axiom of constructibility]] does resolve CH, it is not generally considered to be intuitively true any more than CH is generally considered to be false (Kunen 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;171).

At least two other axioms have been proposed that have implications for the continuum hypothesis, although these axioms have not currently found wide acceptance in the mathematical community. In 1986, Chris Freiling presented an argument against CH by showing that the negation of CH is equivalent to [[Freiling's axiom of symmetry]], a statement about [[probability|probabilities]]. Freiling believes this axiom is "intuitively true" but others have disagreed. A difficult argument against CH developed by [[W. Hugh Woodin]] has attracted considerable attention since the year 2000 (Woodin 2001a, 2001b). Foreman (2003) does not reject Woodin's argument outright but urges caution.

[[Solomon Feferman]] (2011) has made a complex philosophical argument that CH is not a definite mathematical problem.  He proposes a theory of "definiteness" using a semi-intuitionistic subsystem of ZF that accepts [[classical logic]] for bounded quantifiers but uses [[intuitionistic logic]] for unbounded ones, and suggests that a proposition &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is mathematically "definite" if the semi-intuitionistic theory can prove &lt;math&gt;(\phi \lor \neg\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.  He conjectures that CH is not definite according to this notion, and proposes that CH should, therefore, be considered not to have a truth value. [[Peter Koellner]] (2011b) wrote a critical commentary on Feferman's article.

[[Joel David Hamkins]] proposes a [[Multiverse (set theory)|multiverse]] approach to set theory and argues that "the continuum hypothesis is settled on the multiverse view by our extensive knowledge about how it behaves in the multiverse, and, as a result, it can no longer be settled in the manner formerly hoped for." (Hamkins 2012). In a related vein, [[Saharon Shelah]] wrote that he does "not agree with the pure Platonic view that the interesting problems in set theory can be decided, that we just have to discover the additional axiom. My mental picture is that we have many possible set theories, all conforming to ZFC." (Shelah 2003).

==The generalized continuum hypothesis==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Forcing (mathematics)]] --&gt;
The ''generalized continuum hypothesis'' (GCH) states that if an infinite set's cardinality lies between that of an infinite set ''S'' and that of the [[power set]] of ''S'', then it either has the same cardinality as the set ''S'' or the same cardinality as the power set of ''S''. That is, for any [[infinite set|infinite]] [[cardinal number|cardinal]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; there is no cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;\kappa &lt;2^{\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt; GCH is equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha+1}=2^{\aleph_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; for every [[ordinal number|ordinal]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;  (occasionally called '''Cantor's aleph hypothesis''')
The [[beth number]]s provide an alternate notation for this condition: &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha=\beth_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for every ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a generalization of the continuum hypothesis since the continuum has the same cardinality as the [[power set]] of the integers. It was first suggested by {{harvs|txt|last=Jourdain|authorlink=Philip Jourdain|year=1905}}. (For the early history of GCH, see {{harvs|txt|last=Moore|year=2011}}).

Like CH, GCH is also independent of ZFC, but [[Wacław Sierpiński|Sierpiński]] proved that ZF + GCH implies the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) (and therefore the negation of the [[axiom of determinacy]], AD), so choice and GCH are not independent in ZF; there are no models of ZF in which GCH holds and AC fails. To prove this, Sierpiński showed GCH implies that every cardinality n is smaller than some [[Aleph number]], and thus can be ordered. This is done by showing that n is smaller than &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0+n}&lt;/math&gt; which is  smaller than its own [[Hartogs number]]—this uses the equality &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0+n}\, = \,2\cdot\,2^{\aleph_0+n} &lt;/math&gt;; for the full proof, see Gillman (2002).

[[Kurt Gödel]] showed that GCH is a consequence of ZF + [[Axiom of constructibility|V=L]] (the axiom that every set is constructible relative to the ordinals), and is therefore consistent with ZFC. As GCH implies CH, Cohen's model in which CH fails is a model in which GCH fails, and thus GCH is not provable from ZFC. W.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Easton used the method of forcing developed by Cohen to prove [[Easton's theorem]], which shows it is consistent with ZFC for arbitrarily large cardinals &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to fail to satisfy &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_\alpha} = \aleph_{\alpha + 1}.&lt;/math&gt; Much later, [[Matthew Foreman|Foreman]] and [[W. Hugh Woodin|Woodin]] proved that (assuming the consistency of very large cardinals) it is consistent that &lt;math&gt;2^\kappa&gt;\kappa^+&lt;/math&gt; holds for every infinite cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa.&lt;/math&gt; Later Woodin extended this by showing the consistency of &lt;math&gt;2^\kappa=\kappa^{++}&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. {{harvs|first=Carmi|last=Merimovich|year=2007|txt}} showed that, for each ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, it is consistent with ZFC that for each κ, 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''n''th successor of κ. On the other hand, {{harvs|first=László |last=Patai|year=1930|txt}} proved, that if γ is an ordinal and for each infinite cardinal κ, 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; is the γth successor of κ, then γ is finite.

For any infinite sets A and B, if there is an injection from A to B then there is an injection from subsets of A to subsets of B. Thus for any infinite cardinals A and B, &lt;math&gt;A &lt; B \to 2^A \le 2^B.&lt;/math&gt; . If A and B are finite, the stronger inequality &lt;math&gt;A &lt; B \to 2^A &lt; 2^B &lt;/math&gt; holds. GCH implies that this strict, stronger inequality holds for infinite cardinals as well as finite cardinals.

===Implications of GCH for cardinal exponentiation===
Although the generalized continuum hypothesis refers directly only to cardinal exponentiation with 2 as the base, one can deduce from it the values of cardinal exponentiation &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha}^{\aleph_{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt; in all cases. GCH implies that (see: Hayden &amp; Kennison (1968), page 147, exercise 76):
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha}^{\aleph_{\beta}} = \aleph_{\beta+1}&lt;/math&gt; when ''α'' ≤ ''β''+1;
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha}^{\aleph_{\beta}} = \aleph_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; when ''β''+1 &lt; ''α'' and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\beta} &lt; \operatorname{cf} (\aleph_{\alpha})&lt;/math&gt;, where '''cf''' is the [[cofinality]] operation; and
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha}^{\aleph_{\beta}} = \aleph_{\alpha+1}&lt;/math&gt; when ''β''+1 &lt; ''α'' and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\beta} \ge \operatorname{cf} (\aleph_{\alpha})&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a '''D-space''' if for any family &lt;math&gt;\{U_x:x\in X\}&lt;/math&gt; of [[open set]]s such that &lt;math&gt;x\in U_x&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, there is a closed discrete [[subset]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of the [[space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{x\in D}U_x=X&lt;/math&gt;.

== History ==

The notion of D-spaces was introduced by Eric Karel van Douwen and E.A. Michael. It first appeared in a 1979 paper by van Douwen and Washek Frantisek Pfeffer in the [[Pacific Journal of Mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=van Douwen|first1=E.|last2=Pfeffer|first2=W.|year=1979|title=Some properties of the Sorgenfrey line and related spaces|url=http://msp.org/pjm/1979/81-2/pjm-v81-n2-p07-s.pdf|journal=Pacific Journal of Mathematics|volume=81|pages=371–377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether every [[Lindelöf]] and regular [[topological space]] is a D-space  is known as the '''D-space problem'''. This problem is among twenty of the most important problems of set theoretic topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/162136062|title=Open problems in topology II|last=Elliott.|first=Pearl,|date=2007-01-01|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|isbn=9780444522085|oclc=162136062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dehumanization''' or an act thereof can describe a behavior or process that undermines individuality of and in others. Behaviorally, dehumanization describes a disposition towards others that debases the others' individuality as either an "individual" species or an "individual" object,  e.g. someone who acts inhumanely towards humans.  As a process, it may be understood as the opposite of personification, a figure of speech in which inanimate objects or abstractions are endowed with human qualities; dehumanization then is the disendowment of these same qualities or a reduction to abstraction, e.g. ''[[Automation|Technology revolutions]] cause the dehumanization of labor markets to the point of antiquation.''

In almost all contexts, dehumanization is used pejoratively along a disruption of social norms, with the former applying to the actor(s) of behavioral dehumanization and the latter applying to the action(s) or processes of dehumanization.  As [[social norms]] define what humane behavior is, reflexively these same social norms define what human behavior is not, or what is inhumane.  Dehumanization differs from inhumane behaviors or processes in its breadth to include the emergence of new competing social norms.  This emergence then is the action of dehumanization until the old norms lose out to the competing new norms, which will then redefine the action of dehumanization.  If the new norms lose acceptance then the action remains one of dehumanization and its severity is comparative to past examples throughout history.  However, dehumanization's definition remains in a reflexive state of a [[Type–token distinction|type-token ambiguity]] relative to both scales individual and societal.

Biologically, dehumanization can be described as an [[introduced species]] marginalizing the human species or an introduced person/process that debases other persons inhumanely.

In [[political science]] and [[jurisprudence]], the act of dehumanization is the inferential alienation of [[human rights]] or [[denaturalization]] of [[natural rights]], a definition contingent upon presiding [[international law]] rather than [[social norms]] limited by [[human geography]]. In this context, specialty within species need not apply to constitute [[global citizenship]] or its inalienable rights; these both are inherit by human genome.

It is theorized to take on two forms: ''animalistic dehumanization'', which is employed on a largely intergroup basis, and ''mechanistic dehumanization'', which is employed on a largely interpersonal basis.&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haslam |first1=Nick |title=Dehumanization: An Integrative Review |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |volume=10 |issue=3 |year=2006 |pages=252–264 |pmid=16859440 |doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1003_4 |url=http://general.utpb.edu/FAC/hughes_j/Haslam%20on%20dehumanization.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626110654/http://general.utpb.edu/fac/hughes_j/Haslam%20on%20dehumanization.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dehumanization can occur discursively (e.g., idiomatic language that likens certain human beings to non-human animals, [[verbal abuse]], erasing one's voice from discourse), symbolically (e.g., imagery), or physically (e.g., chattel [[slavery]], [[physical abuse]], refusing eye contact). Dehumanization often ignores the target's [[Individualism|individuality]] (i.e., the creative and interesting aspects of their personality) and can hinder one from feeling [[empathy]] or properly understanding a [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] group of people.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Dehumanization may be carried out by a social [[institution]] (such as a state, school, or family), interpersonally, or even within the self. Dehumanization can be unintentional, especially on the part of individuals, as with some types of ''de facto'' [[racism]]. State-organized dehumanization has historically been directed against perceived political, [[Race (human classification)|racial]], [[Ethnic group|ethnic]], national, or religious [[minority group]]s. Other minoritized and [[Marginalization|marginalized]] individuals and groups (based on [[sexual orientation]], [[gender]], disability, [[Social class|class]], or some other organizing principle) are also susceptible to various forms of dehumanization. The concept of dehumanization has received empirical attention in the [[Psychology|psychological]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Moller, A. C., &amp; Deci, E. L. (2010).

[[David Livingstone Smith]], director and founder of The Human Nature Project at the University of New England, argues that historically, human beings have been dehumanizing one another for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others|last = Livingstone Smith|first = David|publisher = St. Martin’s Press,|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = 336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humanness ==

In [[Herbert Kelman]]'s work on dehumanization, humanness has two features: "identity" (i.e., a perception of the person "as an individual, independent and distinguishable from others, capable of making choices") and "community" (i.e., a perception of the person as "part of an interconnected network of individuals who care for each other"). When a target's agency and community embeddedness are denied, they no longer elicit compassion or other moral responses, and may suffer violence as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Kelman, H. C. (1976). "Violence without restraint: Reflections on the dehumanization of victims and victimizers". pp. 282-314 in G. M. Kren &amp; L. H. Rappoport (Eds.), ''Varieties of Psychohistory''. New York: Springer. {{ISBN|0826119409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animalistic versus mechanistic ==

In Nick Haslam's review of dehumanization, he differentiates between uniquely human (UH) characteristics, which distinguish humans from non-human animals, and human nature (HN), characteristics that are typical of or central to human beings. His model suggests that different types of dehumanization arise from the denial of one sense of humanness or the other. Language, higher order cognition, refined emotions, civility, and morality are uniquely human characteristics (i.e., traits humans have that non-human animals do not). Cognitive flexibility, emotionality, vital agency, and warmth are central to human nature. Characteristics of human nature are perceived to be widely shared among groups (i.e., every human has these traits), while uniquely human characteristics (e.g., civility, morality) are thought to vary between groups.&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006" /&gt;

According to Haslam, the animalistic form of dehumanization occurs when uniquely human characteristics (e.g., refinement, moral sensibility) are denied to an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]. People that suffer animalistic dehumanization are seen as amoral, unintelligent, and lacking self-control, and they are likened to animals. This has happened to Jewish people during [[The Holocaust]], and indigenous people subject to colonization and slavery. While usually employed on an intergroup basis, animalistic dehumanization can occur on an interpersonal basis as well.

The mechanistic form occurs when features of human nature (e.g., cognitive flexibility, warmth, agency) are denied to targets. Targets of mechanistic dehumanization are seen as cold, rigid, interchangeable, lacking agency, and likened to machines or objects. Mechanistic dehumanization is usually employed on an interpersonal basis (e.g., when a person is seen as a means to another's end).&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006" /&gt;

== Related psychological processes ==

Several lines of psychological research relate to the concept of dehumanization. Infrahumanization suggests that individuals think of and treat [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] members as "less human" and more like animals;&lt;ref name="Leyens, JPh, 2000" /&gt; while Irenaus Eibl-Eibesfeld uses the term ''pseudo-speciation'', a term that he borrowed from the psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, to imply that the dehumanized person or persons are being regarded as not members of the human species.&lt;ref name="eibl"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Biology of Peace and War: Men, Animals and Aggression | publisher=New York Viking Press | author=Eibl-Eibisfeldt, Irenäus | year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, individuals associate secondary emotions (which are seen as uniquely human) more with the ingroup than with the outgroup. Primary emotions (those that are experienced by all sentient beings, both humans and other animals) and are found to be more associated with the outgroup.&lt;ref name="Leyens, JPh, 2000" /&gt; Dehumanization is intrinsically connected with violence.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Often, one cannot do serious injury to another without first dehumanizing him or her in one's mind (as a form of [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]].){{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Military training is, among other things, a systematic desensitization and dehumanization of the enemy, and servicemen and women may find it psychologically necessary to refer to the enemy as animal or other non-human beings. Lt. Col. Dave Grossman has shown that without such desensitization it would be difficult, if not impossible for someone to kill another human, even in combat or under threat to their own lives.&lt;ref name="grossman"&gt;{{cite book | title=On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society | publisher=[[Back Bay Books]] | author=Grossman, Dave Lt.

Delegitimization is the "categorization of groups into extreme negative social categories which are excluded from human groups that are considered as acting within the limits of acceptable norms and/or values."&lt;ref name ="Bar-Tal, D, 1989" /&gt;

Moral exclusion occurs when outgroups are subject to a different set of moral values, rules, and fairness than are used in social relations with ingroup members.&lt;ref name="Opotow, S., 1990" /&gt; When individuals dehumanize others, they no longer experience distress when they treat them poorly. Moral exclusion is used to explain extreme behaviors like genocide, harsh [[Immigration policy|immigration policies]], and [[eugenics]], but can also happen on a more regular, everyday discriminatory level. In laboratory studies, people who are portrayed as lacking human qualities have been found to be treated in a particularly harsh and violent manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|title=Selective Moral Disengagement in the Exercise of Moral Agency|journal=Journal of Moral Education|volume=31|issue=2|year=2002|pages=101–119|url=http://historicalunderbelly.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/bandura_moraldisengagement1.pdf|doi=10.1080/0305724022014322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|last2=Barbaranelli|first2=Claudio|last3=Caprara|first3=Gian Vittorio|last4=Pastorelli|first4=Concetta|title=Mechanisms of moral disengagement in the exercise of moral agency.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=71|issue=2|year=1996|pages=364–374|url=http://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1996JPSP.pdf |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|last2=Underwood|first2=Bill|last3=Fromson|first3=Michael E|title=Disinhibition of aggression through diffusion of responsibility and dehumanization of victims|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=9|issue=4|year=1975|pages=253–269|url=http://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1975.pdf |doi=10.1016/0092-6566(75)90001-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martha Nussbaum]] (1999) identified seven components of objectification: "instrumentality", "denial of autonomy", "inertness", "fungibility", "violability", "ownership", and "denial of subjectivity".&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martha C.

In Psychology higher-order cognitive processes like social cognition may occur between a human and human, or human and non-human, human and object. The assigning that occurs in social cognition suggests a non-human target can have projected internal life, or conscious emotional and cognitive experiences. Mental states projected onto objects and non-human forms of life can occur without intention. Studies by Heberlein, Adolphs, Tranel &amp; Damasio, Heberlein AS, Adolphs R, Tranel D, Damasio H. Cortical regions for judgments of emotions and personality traits from [[Biological motion perception|point-light walkers]] explore the constants of biological motion perception within areas of the human brain, where participants would infer intent among objects which do not have any emotion or cognitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cortical regions for judgments of emotions and personality traits from point-light walkers|date = Sep 16, 2004|publisher = Princeton University|last = Heberlein|first = AS|pmid = 15453970|doi=10.1162/0898929041920423|volume=16|issue = 7|journal=J Cogn Neurosci|pages=1143–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible for subjects to anthropomorphize a spectrum of inanimate objects and non-human life forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwan|first=VSY|date=2008|title=Missing links in social cognition: The continuum from nonhuman agents to dehumanized humans|url=|journal=Social Cognition|volume=26|issue=2|pages=125–128|doi=10.1521/soco.2008.26.2.125|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date = Dec 7, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In children there is a common pattern of projecting the imaginary other, both humanlike and not, and a child is able to interact with the imaginary other without much effort as if the projected other exists. With the ease of anthropomorphic projection, children's lack of social cognition unto human counterparts is surprising. Dehumanized perception often means a cognitive bias experienced through lack of consideration for thoughts, feelings, and general mental contents of a social target's cognition. This dehumanized perception can occur when the target has elicited disgust or further negative responses when in contact with the dehumanizing subject. Humans seen as having certain lower social standings such as people suffering from addictions and homeless persons are often perceived as being low in cognitive warmth and low in social competency reliability. This often elicits more frequent disgust compared to certain higher social standings when projected cognitions by the dehumanizing subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A model of (often mixed) stereotype content: competence and warmth respectively follow from perceived status and competition|last = Fiske|first = ST|date = June 2002|journal = NCBI|volume = 82|issue = 6|pages = 878–902|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.82.6.878|pmid = 12051578}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans can  suddenly consider the mental cognitions of those persons who experience emotions of a social variety, linking in-groups of positive social figures to pride, connecting in-groups of wealthy and the upper class feelings of envy, and experiencing pity towards in-groups of the disabled and the elderly. Through a study by Fiske, Cuddy, &amp; Glick in 2007, a [[stereotype content model]] showed that social targets such as the elderly and wealthy were trustworthy, friendly, and of capable ability due to perceived competence and warmth. However, in-groups of the disabled, poor, persons with addictions, and immigrants were recorded as disgust-inducing due to projected low warmth and incompetence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Universal dimensions of social cognition: warmth and competence|last = Fiske|first = ST|date = Feb 11, 2007|journal = Trends Cogn Sci|volume = 11|issue = 2|pages = 77–83|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.005|pmid = 17188552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilitating factors ==

While social distance from the outgroup target is a necessary condition for dehumanization, some research suggests that it is not sufficient.  Psychological research has identified high status, power, and social connection as additional factors that influence whether dehumanization will occur. If being an outgroup member was all that was required to be dehumanized, dehumanization would be far more prevalent. However, only{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} members of high status groups associate humanity more with ingroup than the outgroup. Members of low status groups exhibit no differences in associations with humanity. Having high status makes one more likely to dehumanize others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Capozza|first1=D.|last2=Andrighetto|first2=L.|last3=Di Bernardo|first3=G. A.|last4=Falvo|first4=R.|title=Does status affect intergroup perceptions of humanity?|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|volume=15|issue=3|year=2011|pages=363–377|doi=10.1177/1368430211426733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low status groups are more associated with human nature traits (warmth, emotionality) than uniquely human traits, implying that they are closer to animals than humans because these traits are typical of humans but can be seen in other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loughnan|first1=S.|last2=Haslam|first2=N.|last3=Kashima|first3=Y.|title=Understanding the Relationship between Attribute-Based and Metaphor-Based Dehumanization|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|volume=12|issue=6|year=2009|pages=747–762|doi=10.1177/1368430209347726}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, another line of work found that individuals in a position of power were more likely to objectify their subordinates, treating them as a means to one's own end rather than focusing on their essentially human qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gruenfeld|first1=Deborah H.|last2=Inesi|first2=M.

Neuroimaging studies have discovered that the medial prefrontal cortex—a brain region distinctively involved in attributing mental states to others—shows diminished activation to extremely dehumanized targets (i.e., those rated, according to the [[stereotype content model]], as low-warmth and low-competence, such as drug addicts or homeless people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=L.

== Race and ethnicity ==

Dehumanization often occurs as a result of conflict in an intergroup context. Ethnic and racial others are often represented as animals in popular culture and scholarship. There is evidence that this representation persists in the American context with African Americans implicitly associated with apes. To the extent that an individual has this dehumanizing implicit association, they are more likely to support violence against African Americans (e.g., jury decisions to execute defendants).&lt;ref name="Goff, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goff|first1=Phillip Atiba|last2=Eberhardt|first2=Jennifer L.|last3=Williams|first3=Melissa J.|last4=Jackson|first4=Matthew Christian|title=Not yet human: Implicit knowledge, historical dehumanization, and contemporary consequences.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=94|issue=2|year=2008|pages=292–306|pmid=18211178|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.2.292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, dehumanization is frequently connected to genocidal conflicts in that ideologies before and during the conflict link victims to rodents/vermin.&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006" /&gt; Immigrants are also dehumanized in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Brien|first1=Gerald|title=Indigestible Food, Conquering Hordes, and Waste Materials: Metaphors of Immigrants and the Early Immigration Restriction Debate in the United States|journal=Metaphor and Symbol|volume=18|issue=1|year=2003|pages=33–47|url=http://www.uky.edu/~addesa01/documents/IndigestibleFood.pdf|doi=10.1207/S15327868MS1801_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1900s, the Australian Constitution and British Government partook in an Act to federate the Australian states. Section 51 (xxvi) and 127 were two provisions that dehumanised Aboriginals.
51. The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:
(xxvi) The people of any race, other than the Aboriginal people in any state, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. 
127. In reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth, or of a state or other part of the Commonwealth, Aboriginal natives shall not be counted.
In 1902 the Commonwealth Franchise Act was passed, this categorically denied Aboriginals from the right to vote. Indigenous Australians were not allowed social security benefits e.g. Aged pensions and maternity allowances. However, these benefits were provided to other non-Indigenous Australians by the Commonwealth Government. Aboriginals in rural areas were discriminated and controlled as to where and how they could marry, work, live, and their movements were restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Documents/auscurric/sampleunit/1967referendum/aboutreferendum.pdf|title=About the 1967 Referendum|date=2012|website=Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectification==

Fredrickson and Roberts argued that the [[sexual objectification]] of women extends beyond [[pornography]] (which emphasizes women's bodies over their uniquely human mental and emotional characteristics) to society generally. There is a normative emphasis on female appearance that causes women to take a third-person perspective on their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fredrickson|first1=Barbara L.|last2=Roberts|first2=Tomi-Ann|title=OBJECTIFICATION THEORY.|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=21|issue=2|year=1997|pages=173–206|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258181826_Objectification_Theory_Toward_Understanding_Women%27s_Lived_Experiences_and_Mental_Health_Risks|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00108.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological distance women may feel from their bodies might cause them to dehumanize themselves. Some research has indicated that women and men exhibit a "sexual body part recognition bias", in which women's sexual body parts are better recognized when presented in isolation than in the context of their entire bodies, whereas men's sexual body parts are better recognized in the context of their entire bodies than in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gervais|first1=Sarah J.|last2=Vescio|first2=Theresa K.|last3=Förster|first3=Jens|last4=Maass|first4=Anne|last5=Suitner|first5=Caterina|title=Seeing women as objects: The sexual body part recognition bias|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=42|issue=6|year=2012|pages=743–753|doi=10.1002/ejsp.1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men who dehumanize women as either animals or objects are more liable to rape and sexually harass women and display more negative attitudes toward female rape victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudman|first1=L.

== The role of nations and governments ==

[[Sociologist]]s and [[historian]]s often view dehumanization as essential to [[war]]. Governments sometimes represent "enemy" civilians or soldiers as less than human so that voters will be more likely to support a war they may otherwise consider mass murder.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Dictatorship]]s use the same process to prevent opposition by citizens. Such efforts often depend on preexisting racist, [[sectarianism|sectarian]], or otherwise biased beliefs, which governments play upon through various types of [[mass media|media]], presenting "enemies" as barbaric, as undeserving of rights, and as threats to the nation. Alternatively, states sometimes present an enemy government or way of life as barbaric and its citizens as childlike and incapable of managing their own affairs. Such arguments have been used as a pretext for [[colonialism]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[The Holocaust]] during [[World War II]] and the [[Rwandan Genocide]] have both been cited as atrocities facilitated by a government sanctioned dehumanization of its citizens. In terms of the Holocaust, government proliferated propaganda created a culture of dehumanization of the Jewish population. Crimes like [[lynching]] (especially in the United States) are often thought of as the result of popular bigotry and government apathy.

[[Anthropologist]]s [[Ashley Montagu]] and [[Floyd Matson]] famously wrote that dehumanization might well be considered "the fifth [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|horseman of the apocalypse]]" because of the inestimable damage it has dealt to society.&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, Ashley and Matson, Floyd W. (1983) ''The dehumanization of man'', McGraw-Hill, Preface, p. xi, "For that reason this sickness of the soul might well be called the 'Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse.' Its more conventional name, of course, is dehumanization."&lt;/ref&gt; When people become things, the logic follows, they become dispensable, and any atrocity can be justified.

Dehumanization can be seen outside of overtly violent conflicts, as in political debates where opponents are presented as collectively stupid or inherently [[evil]]. Such "good-versus-evil" claims help end substantive debate (see also [[thought-terminating cliché]]).

== The role of terrorists and rebels ==

Non-state actors—terrorists in particular—have also resorted to dehumanization to further their cause and assuage pangs of guilt. The 1960s terrorist group [[Weather Underground]] had advocated violence against any authority figure, and used the "police are pigs" idea to convince members that they were not harming human beings, but simply killing wild animals. Likewise, rhetoric statements such as "terrorists are just scum", is an act of dehumanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=Stephen|title=Cities and the 'War on Terror'|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|volume=30|issue=2|year=2006|pages=255–276|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2006.00665.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systematic destruction==

A study investigating racialized law enforcement violence is using virtual [[simulator]]s to investigate "shoot or don't shoot" responses. The studies conducted that participants' responses were affected by racial bias. When the simulator presented an armed Black man, participants shot faster and more accurately compared to an armed White man. In response to the "don't shoot", command of an unarmed Black man participant's reaction time was slower and less accurate compared to an unarmed White man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellawala|first=Themal.I|date=2016|title=Pulling the trigger: Dehumanization of African Americans and Police Violence|url=http://commons.clarku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&amp;context=surj|journal=Scholarly Undergraduate Research Journal|publisher=Clark|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center of Disease Control]] statistics on law enforcement killings between 1999 and 2011 showed that American youth of African ancestry between the ages of 15 and 19 are 2.8 times more likely to be killed by law enforcement than the national average of all races and age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjcj.org/news/8113|title=Who are Police killing?|last=Males|first=Mike|date=26 August 2014|website=Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted with predominately White female undergraduates as well as predominately White male law enforcement found that participants overestimated the age of American children of African ancestry by 4.59 years, translating to boys of thirteen and a half years of age would be misperceived as legal adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goff|first=Phillip Atiba|last2=Jackson|first2=Matthew Christian|last3=Di Leone|first3=Brooke Allison Lewis|last4=Culottal|first4=Carmen Marie|last5=Di Tomasso|first5=Natalia Ann|date=2014|title=The essence of innocence: Consequences of dehumanizing Black children|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/106/4/526/|journal=Personality and social psychology|volume=106|issue=4|pages=526–545|doi=10.1037/a0035663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annually, 250,000 children are processed through to adult correctional facilities; this is at the impairment of their physical and mental health. In comparison to children at juvenile facilities, children sentenced as adults are, five times as likely to be sexually assaulted, twice as likely to be assaulted by a correctional officer, and eight times as likely to commit suicide. Implied dehumanization estimated the inclination of excessive force used by law enforcement against American suspect of African ancestry compared to other races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccdglobal.org/sites/default/files/publication_pdf/justice-for-some.pdf|title=And Justice for Some: Differential Treatment of Youth of Color in the Justice System|last=Hartney|first=Christopher|last2=Silva|first2=Fabiana|date=1 January 2007|website=National Council on Crime and Delinquency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Herbert Kelman, "Violence without moral restraint: Reflections on the dehumanization of victims and victimizes", illustrates how the above dehumanization of Americans with African ancestry is occurring. The apprehension towards murdering human beings is so overwhelming that the victim must be removed from their human status if systematic murdering is to occur. The victims are then dehumanized by placing them "outside the boundary in which moral values, rules, and considerations of fairness apply", the principle of mortality is no longer applicable. To establish others as entirely human, signify the sorrow from their death, despite racial background, as well as our individual relationship with the person. When referring to identity, the death is individualized; when referring to community, the death is experienced personally. The involvement of the bureaucratic apparatus is one of dehumanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelman|first=Herbert|date=1973|title=Violence without moral restraint: Reflections on the dehumanization of victims and victimizers|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/hckelman/files/Violence_1973.pdf|journal=Journal of Social Issues|publisher=Harvard University|volume=29|issue=4|pages=25–61|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1973.tb00102.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States of America, Americans of African ancestry were dehumanised via the classification of being deemed as a primate, not a human.  The United States of America Constitution that took place in 1787 stated when collecting census data "all other persons" in reference to enslaved Africans will be counted as three-fifths of a human being. In the 1990s reportedly California State Police classified incidents involving young men of African ancestry as no humans involved. A California police officer who was also involved in the [[Rodney King]] beating described a dispute between an American couple with African ancestry as "something right out of gorillas in the mist". [[Franz Boas]] and [[Charles Darwin]] hypothesized that there may be an evolution process among primates. Monkeys and apes were least evolved, then savage and/ or deformed anthropoids which referred to people of African ancestry, to Caucasians as most evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goof|first=Phillip|last2=Eberhardt|first2=Jennifer|last3=Williams|first3=Melissa|last4=Jackson|first4=Matthew|date=2008|title=Not yet human: implicit knowledge, historical dehumanization, and contemporary consequences|url= http://web.stanford.edu/~eberhard/downloads/2008-NotYetHuman.pdf|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|publisher= American Psychology Association|volume=94|issue=2|pages=292–306|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.2.292|pmid=18211178|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In science, medicine, and technology ==
Relatively recent history has seen the relationship between dehumanization and science result in unethical scientific research. The [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]] and the [[Nazi human experimentation]] on Jewish people are two such examples. In the former, Africans Americans with syphilis were recruited to participate in a study about the course of the disease. Even when treatment and a cure were eventually developed, they were withheld from the Black participants so that researchers could continue their study. Similarly, Nazi scientists conducted horrific experiments on Jewish people during the Holocaust. This was justified in the name of research and progress which is indicative of the far reaching affects that the culture of dehumanization had upon this society. When this research came to light, efforts were made to protect participants of future research, and currently [[institutional review board]]s exist to safeguard individuals from being taken advantage of by scientists.

In a medical context, the passage of time has served to make some dehumanizing practices more acceptable, not less. While dissections of human cadavers was seen as dehumanizing in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] (see [[History of anatomy]]), the value of dissections as a training aid is such that they are now more widely accepted. Dehumanization has been associated with modern medicine generally, and specifically, has been suggested as a coping mechanism for doctors who work with patients at the end of life.&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schulman-Green|first1=Dena|title=Coping mechanisms of physicians who routinely work with dying patients|journal=OMEGA: the Journal of Death and Dying|volume=47|issue=3|year=2003|pages=253–264|doi=10.2190/950H-U076-T5JB-X6HN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have identified six potential causes of dehumanization in medicine: deindivudating practices, impaired patient agency, dissimilarity (causes which do not facilitate the delivery of medical treatment), mechanization, empathy reduction, and moral disengagement (which could be argued, do facilitate the delivery of medical treatment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haque|first1=O. S.|last2=Waytz|first2=A.|title=Dehumanization in Medicine: Causes, Solutions, and Functions|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=7|issue=2|year=2012|pages=176–186|doi=10.1177/1745691611429706|pmid=26168442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the patient point of view, in some states in America, controversial legislation requires that a woman view the ultrasound image of her fetus before being able to have an abortion. Critics of the law argue that simply seeing an image of the fetus humanizes it, and biases women against abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sanger | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Seeing and believing: Mandatory ultrasound and the path to a protected choice | url = | journal = [[UCLA Law Review]] | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 351–408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a recent study showed that subtle humanization of medical patients appears to improve care for these patients. Radiologists evaluating X-rays reported more details to patients and expressed more empathy when a photo of the patient's face accompanied the X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Y., &amp; Hadas-Halpern, I. (2008, December 3). [http://archive.rsna.org/2008/6008880.html "The effects of including a patient's photograph to the radiographic examination"]. Paper presented at [[Radiological Society of North America]], Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that inclusion of the photos counteracts the dehumanization of the medical process.

Dehumanization has applications outside traditional social contexts. [[Anthropomorphism]] (i.e., perceiving in nonhuman entities mental and physical capacities that reflect humans) is the inverse of dehumanization, which occurs when characteristics that apply to humans are denied to other humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waytz|first1=A.|last2=Epley|first2=N.|last3=Cacioppo|first3=J. T.|title=Social Cognition Unbound: Insights Into Anthropomorphism and Dehumanization|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=19|issue=1|year=2010|pages=58–62|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/cd/19_1_inpress/Waytz_final.pdf|doi=10.1177/0963721409359302|pmid=24839358|pmc=4020342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waytz, Epley, and Cacioppo suggest that the inverse of the factors that facilitate dehumanization (e.g., high status, power, and social connection) should facilitate anthropomorphism. That is, a low status, socially disconnected person without power should be more likely to attribute human qualities to pets or electronics than a high-status, high-power, socially connected person.

Researchers have found that engaging in violent video game play diminishes perceptions of both one's own humanity and the humanity of the players who are targets of the violence in the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bastian|first1=Brock|last2=Jetten|first2=Jolanda|last3=Radke|first3=Helena R.M.|title=Cyber-dehumanization: Violent video game play diminishes our humanity|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=48|issue=2|year=2012|pages=486–491|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the players are dehumanized, the video game characters that play them are likely anthropomorphized.

Dehumanization has occurred historically under the pre-tense of "progress in the name of science". During the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World's fair in 1904]] human zoos exhibited several natives from independent tribes around the globe, most notably a young Congolese man, [[Ota Benga]].  Benga's imprisonment was put on display as a public service showcasing “a degraded and degenerate race”. During this period religion was still the driving force behind much political and scientific action, and because of this, eugenics were widely supported among the most notable US scientific communities, political figures, and industrial elites. After allocating to New York in 1906, public outcry led to the permanent ban and closure of human zoos in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The man who was caged in a zoo {{!}} Pamela Newkirk|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/03/the-man-who-was-caged-in-a-zoo|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-12-08|first = Pamela|last = Newkirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and colonialism ==
In Martin Luther King Jr.'s book on civil rights ''[[Why We Can't Wait]]'', he explains "Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race."

[[Mi'kmaq]] elder and human rights activist [[Daniel N. Paul]] has researched written extensively of historic accounts of atrocious acts of violence against First Nations peoples in North America. His work states European colonialism in Canada and America was a subjugation of the indigenous peoples and is an unequivocal violent series of crimes against humanity which has been unparalleled historically. Tens of millions First Nations died at the hands of European invaders in an attempt to appropriate the entirety of the land. Those hundreds of diverse civilizations and communities who thrived across North America millions of years before the exploits of Christopher Columbus were ultimately destroyed. Dehumanization occurred in the form of barbaric genocidal processes of murder, rape, starvation, enslavement, allocation, and germ warfare. Of the myriad of ways the English performed ethnic cleansing, one of the most frequent was the practice of bounty hunting and scalping—where colonial conquerors would raid communities and remove the scalps of children and adults. This war crime of scalping was most prevalent when maritime colonialists repeatedly attempted to eradicate Daniel N. Paul's ancestors, the Mi'kmaq. Scalping was common practice in many United States areas all the way until the 1860s in attempt to completely wipe out the remaining First Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AMERICAN INDIANS DEHUMANIZED BY DEMONIZING PROPAGANDA|url = http://www.danielnpaul.com/NativeAmericansDemonized.html|website = www.danielnpaul.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compton's Cafeteria riot|Compton's cafeteria riot]] predates the [[Stonewall riots|stonewall riots of 1969]] and marks one of the first times in American history that non-hetero-normative peoples denied their oppressors taking agency by demanding human rights. This incident was a result of the rampant discrimination, abuse, and ultimately, dehumanizing acts of violence against the [[LGBT social movements|LGBT]] community in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|tenderloin]] district of San Francisco. Up until the Compton cafeteria riot, the act of dressing in non-gender binary clothing was considered a criminal offence, and police would respond to "cross-dressers" with frequent violence and misconduct. Accounts of frequent sexual assault, police brutality, abuse of power, and constant arrests by local law enforcement towards those seeking refuge in the ghettos of the tenderloin have been told in the documentary ''Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton’s Cafeteria.''&lt;ref&gt;''Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton’s Cafeteria''. Dir. Susan Stryker and Victor Silverman, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Democracy and "dignity of man" ==

German philosopher and anthropologist of law Axel Montenbruck wrote that dehumanization is inextricably linked with both the "[[techniques of neutralization]]" (David Matza/[[Gresham Sykes]]) and to the obedience aspects of the [[Milgram experiment]] and in a wider sense with [[Philip Zimbardo]]'s [[Stanford prison experiment]].

Montenbruck continues that—in light of our common [[Western civilization]]—dehumanization is based on political [[Humanism]], in terms of both [[human rights]] and Western democracy. Each of them are grounded in the "dignity of man" aspect. Therefore, its "negation" might be seen as dehumanization in our common Western sense. Furthermore, in light democracy, criminal law might be reduced to the simple formula: violating a person means an act of dehumanization by taking "freedom, unfairly and inhumanely". The reaction of a civilized Western society ought to be "taking freedom as well, but fair and humane".&lt;ref&gt;Montenbruck, Axel (2010) [http://edocs.fu-berlin.de/docs/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDOCS_derivate_000000001194/Western_Anthropology,_2nd_ed.pdf?hosts= ''Western Anthropology: Democracy and Dehumanization'']. 2nd edition,, Universitätsbibliothek der Freien Universität Berlin, pp. 60-66,74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
Dehumanization and dehumanized perception can occur as a result of language used to describe groups of people. Words such as migrant, immigrant, and expatriate are assigned to foreigners based on their social status and wealth, rather than ability, achievements, and political alignment. Expatriate has been found to be a word to describe the privileged, often [[Light skin|light-skinned]] people newly residing in an area and has connotations which suggest ability, wealth, and trust. Meanwhile, the word immigrant is used to describe people coming to a new area to reside and infers a much less desirable meaning. Further, "immigrant" is a word that can be paired with "illegal", which harbours a deeply negative connotation to those projecting social cognition towards the other. The misuse and perpetual misuse of these words used to describe the other in the English language can alter the perception of a group in a derogatory way. "Most of the time when we hear [illegal immigrant] used, most of the time the shorter version 'illegals' is being used as a noun, which implies that a human being is perpetually illegal. There is no other classification that I’m aware of where the individual is being rendered as illegal as opposed to the actions of that individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why are white people expats when the rest of us are immigrants?|url = https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/mar/13/white-people-expats-immigrants-migration|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-12-08|first = Mawuna Remarque|last = Koutonin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of examinations of language sought to find if there was a direct relation between homophobic epithets and social cognitive distancing towards a group of homosexuals, a form of dehumanization. These epithets (e.g., ''faggot'') were thought to function as dehumanizing labels because of their tendency to act as labels of deviance. In both studies, subjects were shown a homophobic epithet, its labelled category, or unspecific insult. Subjects were later prompted to associate words of animal and human connotations to both heterosexuals and homosexuals. The results found that the malignant language, when compared to the unspecific insult and categorized labels, subjects would not connect the human connotative words with homosexuals. Further, the same assessment was done to measure effects the language may have on the physical distancing between the subject and homosexuals.Similarly to the prior associative language study, it was found that subjects became more physically distant to the homosexual, indicating the malignant language could encourage dehumanization, cognitive and physical distancing in ways that other forms of malignant language does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Not "just words": Exposure to homophobic epithets leads to dehumanizing and physical distancing from gay men|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2148/abstract|journal = European Journal of Social Psychology|volume = 46|issue = 2|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1099-0992|pages = n/a–n/a|doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2148|first = Fabio|last = Fasoli|first2 = Maria Paola|last2 = Paladino|first3 = Andrea|last3 = Carnaghi|first4 = Jolanda|last4 = Jetten|first5 = Brock|last5 = Bastian|first6 = Paul G.|last6 = Bain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art  ==
[[Francisco Goya]], famed Spanish painter and printmaker of the romantic period often depicted subjectivity involving the atrocities of war and brutal violence conveying the process of dehumanization. In the romantic period of painting martyrdom art was most often a means of deifying the oppressed and tormented, and it was common for Goya to depict evil personalities performing these unjust horrible acts. But it was revolutionary the way the painter broke this convention by dehumanizing these martyr figures. "…one would not know whom the painting depicts, so determinedly has Goya reduced his subjects from martyrs to meat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Death and Afterlife of the North American Martyrs|last = Anderson|first = Emma|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2013|isbn = 9780674726161|location = United States|pages = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other topics ==

The [[propaganda model]] of [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] argues that [[corporate media]] are able to carry out large-scale, successful dehumanization campaigns when they promote the goals (profit-making) that the corporations are contractually obliged to maximise.&lt;ref name="Herman, S (1988)"&gt;Herman, Edward S. and Noam Chomsky.

''Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven Politics''&lt;/ref&gt; In both democracies and dictatorships, [[state media]] are also capable of carrying out dehumanization campaigns, to the extent with which the population is unable to counteract the dehumanizing [[meme]]s.&lt;ref name="Herman, S (1988)" /&gt;

In a general sense, the '''design load''' is the maximum amount of something a system is designed to handle or the maximum amount of something that the system can produce, which are very different meanings. For example, a [[crane (machine)|crane]] with a design load of 20 tons is designed to be able to lift loads that weigh 20 tons or less. However, when a failure could be catastrophic, such as a crane dropping its load or collapsing entirely, a [[factor of safety]] is necessary. As a result, the crane should lift about 2 to 5 tons at the most. 

In [[structural design]], a design load is greater than the load which the system is expected to support. This is because engineers incorporate a [[safety factor]] in their design, in order to ensure that the system will be able to support at least the expected loads (called [[specified loads]], despite any problems with construction, materials, etc. that go unnoticed during construction.

A [[heater]] would have a general design load, meaning the maximum amount of heat it can produce. A bridge would have a specified load, with the design load being determined by engineers and applied as a theoretical load intended to ensure the actual real-world capacity of the specified load.

A '''deterministic system''' is a conceptual model of the [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[doctrine]] of [[determinism]] applied to a [[system]] for understanding everything that has and will occur in the system, based on the physical outcomes of [[causality]]. In a deterministic system, every action, or cause, produces a reaction, or effect, and every reaction, in turn, becomes the cause of subsequent reactions. The totality of these cascading events can theoretically show exactly how the system will exist at any moment in time.

To understand this concept, start with a fairly small system.  Visualize a set of three [[domino]]es lined up in a row with each domino less than a domino's length away from its neighbors. Once the first domino has toppled, the third domino will topple because the second will topple upon being contacted by the first domino.

Small deterministic systems are easy to visualize, but are necessarily linked to the rest of reality by an initial cause and/or final effect.  To go back to the dominoes, something outside the system has to cause the first domino to topple.  The last domino falling might cause something else outside the system to happen.  And the system itself must be considered in isolation—if external forces such as hurricanes, earthquakes or the hands of nearby people were taken into consideration, the final domino toppling might not be a predetermined outcome.  Complete isolation of a system is unrealistic, but useful for understanding what would normally happen to a system when the possibility of external influences is negligible.  Complex physical systems are necessarily built using simpler ones, and using isolated systems as a starting model can help bridge the gap and aid in understanding. The domino example is developed in the [[Petri net]] computational model.

This example assumes that dominoes toppling into each other behave deterministically.  Even the above-mentioned external forces which might interrupt the system are causes which the system did not consider, but which could be explained by cause and effect in a larger deterministic system.

== Some deterministic systems ==

* [[Classical physics]] is the deterministic system assumed in the domino example which scientists can use to describe all events which take place on a scale larger than individual atoms.  Classical physics includes [[Newton's laws of motion]], [[Classical electrodynamics]], [[thermodynamics]], the [[Special theory of relativity]], the [[General theory of relativity]], [[chaos theory]] and [[nonlinear dynamics]].  Some of these systems are complex, and events may be difficult to predict in practice, but if the starting conditions were known in enough detail, the outcomes of events in such systems could be predicted.
* Nearly all electronic [[computer]]s in use today are based on theoretical [[Von Neumann architecture|von Neumann computers]] or [[Turing machine]]s, i.e.: they are devices that perform one small, deterministic step at a time. If all inputs are specified, the computer will always produce a particular output which is calculated deterministically. Computer scientists also study other models of computation including [[parallel computers]] (more than one deterministic step at a time), and [[quantum computers]] (which are based on non-deterministic quantum mechanical models). Computer systems or programs are often described as non-deterministic if their behavior depends on factors that cannot be predicted or reliably reproduced, such as the time of day or the speed at which the user enters data at the keyboard. This, however, is a somewhat different usage of the term.
* [[Behaviorism]], an approach to psychology based on the proposition that behavior can be researched scientifically without recourse to inner mental states, is usually considered to be deterministic and opposed to free will.

== Non-deterministic systems ==

Events without natural causes cannot be part of a deterministic system. Whether such events actually occur is a matter of philosophical and scientific debate – however, possible uncaused events include:
*Random Quantum events
:[[Quantum mechanics|Quantum physics]] holds that certain events such as [[radioactive decay]] and [[Uncertainty principle|movement of particles]] are completely random when taken at the level of single atoms or smaller.  [[Schrödinger's cat]] is a famous [[thought experiment]] in which a cat's survival cannot be determined theoretically before the experiment is done.  For almost all everyday non-microscopic occurrences, however, the probability of such random events is extremely close to zero, and can be approximated to almost certainty with statistics using the [[correspondence principle]].  The philosophical consequences of quantum physics were once considered by many (including [[Albert Einstein]]) to be a major problem for the scientific method which traditionally used a strong version of [[scientific determinism]] (see [[Philosophy of science]]).

== Systems with controversial classification ==

Some systems are particularly difficult to classify as deterministic or not, and have generated much philosophical debate.  The major example would be human minds, and possibly animal minds too.  Can people have [[free will]] if their minds are truly deterministic?  Conversely, when deterministic computers are said to exhibit [[artificial intelligence]], how are their minds similar to ours?

== The entire universe ==

The larger the deterministic system, the longer the necessary chain of cause and effect.  The entire [[universe]] may be considered as such a system, which creates its own philosophical questions (see [[Determinism]]).

[[File:Usmcmessnight.jpg|right|thumb|Mess Night at Camp Lejeune]]
[[File:Dining-in.jpg|right|thumb|Dining in at Fort Dix, New Jersey]]
'''Dining in''' is a formal [[military]] ceremony for members of a [[Company (military unit)|company]] or other [[Military organization|unit]], which includes a dinner, drinking, and other events to foster [[camaraderie]] and ''[[Morale|esprit de corps]]''.

The [[United States Army]], the [[United States Navy]], the [[United States Coast Guard]], and the [[United States Air Force]] refer to this event as a '''dining in''' or '''dining-in.''' The [[United States Marine Corps]] refers to it as '''mess night'''. Other names include '''regimental dinner''', '''guest night''', '''formal mess dinner''', and '''band night'''.&lt;ref name=MCO_P5060.20_ch24&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=
|url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Pages/MCO%20P5060.20%20W%20CH%201%20PT%203.aspx 
|chapter=Chapter 24: Mess Night
|title=Marine Corps Drill and Ceremonies Manual |series=MCO P5060.20
|publisher=United States Marine Corps
|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dining in is a formal event for all unit members, male and female; though some specialized mess nights can be officer- or enlisted-only. The unit [[chaplain]] is usually also invited, if an [[invocation]] is needed. A unit's dining-in consists of only the members of the unit, with the possible exception of the guest(s) of honor. An optional formal dinner, known as the '''dining-out''' may include spouses and other guests. The dining-out follows the same basic rules of the dining-in, but is often tailored to minimize some of the military traditions and be more approachable to civilian guests.

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
The practice of dining in is thought to have formally begun in 16th-century [[England]], in [[Monastery|monasteries]] and [[University|universities]]; though some records indicate that militaries have held formal dinners as far back as the [[Roman Legion]]s. The [[Viking]]s held formal ceremonies to honor and celebrate battles and heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Pages/MCO%20P5060.20%20W%20CH%201%20PT%204.aspx 
|series=MCO P5060.20
|title=Marine Corps Drill and Ceremonies Manual
|chapter=Appendix D: History, Customs and Courtesies, and Traditions of the Mess Night
}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century, the [[British Army]] incorporated the practice of formal dining into their [[regiment]]al mess system. Customs and rules of the mess were soon institutionalized rules, known as the "[[Queen's Regulations]]". The mess night or "Dining in" became a tradition in all British regiments. The Americans, taking many of their traditions from the British military, held mess nights in the 18th and 19th century, but the tradition waned after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

Dining in took a temporary halt in the Navy and Marine Corps when [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Josephus Daniels]] imposed prohibition of alcoholic drink, but soon the tradition was restored.  During [[World War II]], the custom was revived in the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]], initially in the  [[US Army Air Forces]] [[8th Air Force]], which was based in Britain.  [[US Army Air Forces|AAF]]Officers were invited to participate in British military hosted Mess Nights and then were obligated to reciprocate.

==British traditions==

===Formal Functions===
A Formal function is one at which all mess members may be required to attend and Service Personnel are on official duty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = JSP 456 Part 2 Volume 1 Chapter 6 Food Service Management|last = |first = |publisher = Ministry of Defence|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entitlements for official functions are as follows:

=== Officers' Mess ===
12 Formal Functions per annum. Generally these are 2 x seasonal balls and 10 x other functions (e.g. Mess Dinners) as agreed by mess committees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Warrant Officers’ &amp; Senior Rates/Sergeants’ Mess ===
6 Formal Functions per annum. Generally these are 2 x seasonal balls and 4 x other functions (e.g. Mess Dinners) as agreed by mess committees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Loyal Toast ===
The [[Port wine|port]]
decanters are to be placed at pre-determined places and in front of the President and Vice President. The President and Vice President will remove the stoppers simultaneously and pass the decanters in a clockwise direction/to the left. Wine stewards are to follow the decanters round the table with a jug of water, filling the glass of any diner who declines port or madeira. The glasses of the President and Vice President will be filled last, after which they are to re-stop the decanters. All stewards may then be required to leave the dining room before the President calls upon the Vice President to propose the [[Loyal toast|Loyal Toast]]. It should be remembered that whilst the Army and RAF stand for the Loyal Toast, the RN remain seated. Also, whilst passing the port, the RN would ensure the decanter does not leave the table whilst in the RAF; it is passed from hand to hand without touching the table. In the Army, it will depend on the traditions of the Regiment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Army===
By the late 18th century, the British Army's "mess night" developed formal rules, as a result of troops being stationed in remote areas. Officers elected mess committees to conduct their meals. Towards the latter part of the 19th century, attending officers were expected to adhere to the rigid etiquette of  [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] society.

In modern times it is sometimes known as a "regimental dinner".

===Royal Navy and Royal Marines===
[[Royal Navy]] officers have the privilege of remaining seated when toasting the Sovereign. Some sources state that this privilege was granted by [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]. A popular story states that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was on board his namesake ship [[HMS Royal Charles (1655)|''Royal Charles'']] and had bumped his head on the low overhead of the [[wardroom]] when he stood up to reply a toast that had been drunk to him. He stated that henceforth, naval officers would never again rise to toast a British sovereign. In 1964, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] extended the privilege to the [[Royal Marines]] in honour of their 300th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connell|first1=Royal W.|last2=Mack|first2=William P.|title=Naval Ceremonies, Customs, and Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wvKiBiWKrzMC&amp;printsec=frontcover|pages=105–6|publisher=[[Naval Institute Press]]|year=2004|location=[[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]|isbn=9781557503305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of "dining in" to welcome new officers and "dining out" to farewell retiring officers originated with the British, although the term came about much later. It has been discontinued in some countries such as the United States but is still practised by the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibowicz|first=Charles J.|title=Mess Night Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Vo62GFJlpoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=22–23|year=2007|publisher=[[AuthorHouse]]|isbn=9781425984465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Toasts at Sea ====
The traditional toasts after dinner for ships at sea are shown below. On certain days, an alternative toast is available but the first one is most usual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sunday ‘Absent friends’ or ‘Absent friends and those at sea’ 

Monday ‘Our ship at sea’ or ‘Our native land’ 

Tuesday ‘Our Sailors’ 

Wednesday ‘Ourselves’ (as no one is likely to concern themselves with our welfare)’ or ‘Ourselves – Our swords’ 

Thursday ‘A bloody war or a sickly season’ 

Friday ‘A willing foe and sea room’ ‘Fox hunting and old port’ 

Saturday ‘Our Families’

==== Trafalgar Night ====
For [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] Night Mess Dinners, the routine varies slightly from a normal dinner night. When the main course is about to be served, the Baron of Beef is first paraded around the table behind a drummer. Similarly, before commencing the service of the sweet, the Ships of the Line are also paraded around the table in a similar fashion to the Beef. The toasts used at dinner on Trafalgar Night are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty the Queen]].
# The immortal memory of Admiral/[[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] and his comrades.
# Our distinguished guests (if appropriate).

===Royal Air Force===
The [[Royal Air Force]] inherited many mess traditions from the [[British Army]] as a former corps. These customs were notably passed on the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]] as British and American crew served alongside one another in close quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wing dining out: History, heritage, tradition, legacy vital to Air Force way of life|url=http://www.warren.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123095990|publisher=[[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base|warren.af.mil]]|date=25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. traditions==
Portions of the event tend to become quite humorous in nature, while others remain somber. [[Etiquette]] requires a diner to know what is appropriate at any given time.

The dining in follows established protocols. After a brief cocktail period of 30 to 45 minutes, the presiding officer, known as the "President of the Mess", announces, "Please be seated." The group will then retire to the dining area to be seated.

After tasting the [[meat]] (usually [[beef]]), the President will declare it "tasty and fit for human consumption", after which the meal will be served to the diners. After the [[dessert]] is finished, the President will invite the chief steward to bring forth [[wine]] and/or [[Punch (drink)|punch]] to be served, and [[Toast (honor)|toasting]] will begin. After the toasts have concluded, the floor will be opened to the levying of fines. The president and the guest of honor will have the opportunity to speak if they so desire. After this, the mess is often then returned to an open cocktail hour, and then the evening concludes with final honors.

==Formal toasts==
[[File:Navy-invite.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Navy Mess Night Invitation, 1986]]
Formal toasts are the heart of the formal dining in. A junior officer, known as  "Mr/Madam Vice",  proposes a toast to the guests, at which the guests remain seated. After this, various parties will offer toasts to the [[Commander in Chief]], to the heads of state of a visiting or host nations, to their branch of service, to the units, and to the fallen members of the military.

|}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Notice that the United States does not have a king, queen, or Prime Minister, and that the commander in chief and President are the same person.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The final and most solemn toast is always to fallen comrades. Often this tribute is marked with a [[Missing man table|table setting dedicated to those military members killed, captured, or missing in action]].&lt;ref name=ALMAR020-07&gt;The Marine Corps mandates a tribute to fallen Marines: {{cite web|accessdate=

Some unusual forms of toasting are common to the U.S. and Canadian traditions. In the [[Toronto Scottish Regiment]], for example, a [[loyal toast]] to the regiment's Colonel-in-Chief (Currently the Prince of Wales) is performed standing with one foot on the chair and one foot on the dining table, facing a portrait of the C-in-C and drinking after the piper has played.&lt;ref name=Russell1980 /&gt; Others, particularly Scottish regiments,&lt;ref name=Lang1996 /&gt; perform toasts in the same way with one foot on a chair and one on the table.&lt;ref name=Gibowicz2007 /&gt; This is a frequent form of toasting in the United States Marine Corps as well.&lt;ref name=Gibowicz2007 /&gt; In the Scottish form, the glass is raised, lowered, brought out, and brought in, as the words of the toast, usually including some form of "Up", "Down", "To you", "To me", are recited, and finally drunk to the cry "Drink it up!" or similar.&lt;ref name=Lang1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibowicz2007 /&gt;

=== Violations of etiquette and other traditions ===
Violations of the formal [[etiquette]] of the dining in are "punished", generally with fines. The following are examples of what could be considered "Violations of the Mess": 
* untimely arrival at proceedings
* smoking at the table before the lighting of the [[smoking lamp]]
* haggling over date of rank
* improper wear of uniform
** inverted [[cummerbund]] (Note that U.S. Army regulation ''requires'' that cummerbunds be worn ''upside down'': i.e. pleats down.)&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dep't of Army, Reg. 670-1, Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia para 24-10b (3 Feb. 2005). “The cummerbund is worn … with pleats facing down.”&lt;/ref&gt;
** wearing a clip-on bow tie at an obvious [[List (watercraft)|list]]
* [[Error#Gaff|gaffes]]
** loud and obtrusive remarks in a foreign language
** [[foul language]]
** discussion on a controversial topic (politics, religion, and women are commonly forbidden topics)
* improper toasting procedure
** toasting with an uncharged (''empty'') glass
** rising to applaud particularly witty, succinct, sarcastic, or relevant toasts, unless following the example of the President
* leaving the dining room without permission from the President of the Mess
* carrying cocktails into the dining area before the conclusion of dinner
* haggling over penalties or fines imposed
* drawing a sword except in ceremony &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

At some mess nights, violators of the mess are obliged to publicly drink from a [[grog]] bowl in front of the mess attendees. The grog is sometimes contained in a [[toilet]] bowl, consisting of various alcoholic beverages mixed together. As a more disgusting effect, the grog may also contain floating solids, such as meatballs, raw [[oysters]], or [[Tootsie Rolls]]. The tradition of drinking grog originated with the British Navy. [[Grog]] consisted of the regulation rum ration diluted with water to discourage binge drinking. In modern times, grog comes in two varieties: alcoholic and non-alcoholic, the latter of which may contain anything that will make it less appealing to the taste, including hot sauce. For additional effect, the drinker may be required to [[drinking from shoes|drink from a boot]].

In addition to visiting the grog bowl and paying fines, violators may be sentenced to sing songs, tell jokes, do pushups, or perform menial tasks to entertain the mess. In most cases, when a violator has been identified, he or she is given the opportunity to provide a rebuttal or defense for the violation, which rarely results in the violator being excused for the offense, and usually only results in more punishment.

Traditionally, all fines collected throughout the night are split amongst the stewards that served the attendees as a token of appreciation for their efforts. The fines can also be used to pay for the drinks consumed, while some units have used the Mess Night as a fund raiser (often to pay for a ball).

Members of the mess may also be singled out for some good-natured ribbing and teasing. In some units, members go out of their way to be picked on, often wearing obvious uniform violations, such as crowns, tiaras, eye-patches, bowties and cummerbunds of the wrong color, and other items that have no place on any military uniform (although it is common for US Artillerymen to wear red socks, suspenders and even bowties, in a nod to tradition at the expense of uniform regulations). Some will attempt to leave sabotaging evidence on or around others they wish to see fined, so care must be taken to not be the butt of a joke.

Navy and Marine traditions also include that no diner may leave the hall to use the restroom without permission until Mr. Vice suggests that the company "shed a tear for [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Admiral Nelson]]", a reference to the fact that his body was preserved in a barrel of [[brandy]] after his death at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].

Most Messes attempt to furnish the night with military music and marches, with live bands if possible, or recorded music. Depending on how formal the ceremony is, the diners may be required to march to their seats.

In recent times, Marines have established a variant of the mess in a "field environment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usmc1.us/usmc_mess_night.html |title=USMC Customs and Traditions: Marine Corps Mess Night |last=Bartlett |first=Lieutenant Colonel Merrill L. |date=November 1996 |publisher=usmc1.us |accessdate=19 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317021713/http://www.usmc1.us/usmc_mess_night.html |archivedate=17 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; substituting in [[mess dress]] for [[Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform|utilities]] and [[List of United States Marine Corps individual equipment|combat equipment]] (to include camouflage [[facepaint]]), canteen cups, and tentage, while still retaining the formal nature of the ceremony.

'''Discernment''' is the ability to obtain sharp [[perception]]s or to judge well (or the activity of so doing).  In the case of [[judgment]], discernment can be [[psychology|psychological]] or [[morality|moral]] in nature.  Within judgment, discernment 
involves going past the mere perception of something and making nuanced judgments about its properties or qualities.  Considered as a [[virtue]], a discerning individual is considered to possess [[wisdom]], and be of good judgement; especially so with regard to subject matter often overlooked by others.

==Christianity==
In [[Christianity]], the word may have several meanings. Discernment can describe the process of determining [[God in Christianity|God]]'s [[Desire (philosophy)|desire]] in a situation or for one's life or identifying the true nature of a thing, such as discerning whether a thing is good or evil. In large part, it describes the interior search for an answer to the question of one's [[vocation]], namely, determining whether or not God is calling one to the [[married]] life, [[Celibacy|single life]], [[consecrated life]], [[ordained ministry]] or any other calling.

[[Discernment of Spirits]] is a term used in both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Charismatic Movement|Charismatic]] (Evangelist) Christian theology to indicate judging various spiritual agents for their moral influence. 

&lt;br /&gt;

== Process of Discernment ==
The process of individual discernment has required tasks in order for good discernment. These tasks include taking time in making the decision, using both the head and heart, and assessing important values. Time is necessary to make a good choice, decisions made in a hurry are often not the best decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discernment: the Art of Choosing Well: Based on Ignition Spirituality|last=Wolff|first=Pierre|publisher=Liguori Publications|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When time is available to assess the situation it improves the discernment process. When time allots the tentative decision can be revisited days later to make sure that the individual is satisfied with their choice after the discernment process. Making decisions with the head means to first reflect on the situation and emphasize the rational aspect of the decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horton|first=Dennis|date=2009|title=Discerning Spiritual Discernment: Assessing Current Approaches for Understanding God’s Will|url=|journal=Journal of Youth Ministry|volume=7|pages=9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make a decision that is ours it also requires the heart in which the individual makes based on feelings as well as rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discernment: the Art of Choosing Well: Based on Ignition Spirituality|last=Wolff|first=Pierre|publisher=Liguori Publications|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Values in the discernment process are weighing options that decide what is most important to the individual. Every individuals value system is different which effects each individual discernment process.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discernment: the Art of Choosing Well: Based on Ignatian Spirituality|last=Wolff|first=Pierre|publisher=Liguori Publications|year=1993|isbn=|location=Liguori, Missouri|pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining values, using both the head and heart and taking sufficient time when making decision are the main steps for a successful discernment process.

Group discernment is a separate branch of discernment. In group discernment each individual must first undergo their own discernment process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waaijman|first=Kees|date=2013|title=DISCERNMENT AND BIBLICAL SPIRITUALITY: AN OVERVIEW AND EVALUATION OF RECENT RESEARCH|url=|journal=Acta Theologica|volume=32|pages=2-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual must keep in mind what is best for the group as a whole as well as the individual when making a decision. The same principles of values, using the head and heart, as well as giving the decision making process ample time all still apply in group discernment. Group discernment is different because it requires multiple people to have a unanimous decision in order to move forward forward. Group discernment requires discussion and persuasion between individuals to arrive at a decision.

== Christian Spiritual Discernment ==
Christian spiritual discernment can be separated from other types of discernment because every decision is to be made in accordance with God's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horton|first=Dennis|date=2009|title=Discerning Spiritual Discernment: Assessing Current Approaches for Understanding God’s Will|url=|journal=Journal of Youth Ministry|volume=7|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental definition for Christian discernment is a decision making process in which an individual makes a discovery that can lead to future action.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kunz|first=Sandra|date=2011|title=Respecting the Boundaries of Knowledge: Teaching Christian Discernment with Humility and Dignity, a Response to Paul O. Ingram|url=|journal=Buddhist- Christian Studies|volume=|pages=177|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of Christian spiritual discernment God guides the individual to help them arrive at the best decision. The way to arrive at the best decision in Christian spiritual discernment is to seek out internal external signs of God's action and then apply them to the decision at hand. Christian Discernment also has an emphasis on Jesus, and making decisions that align with those of Jesus within the New Testament.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The focus on God and Jesus when making decisions is what separates Christian discernment from secular discernment. Ignatius of Loyola is often regarded as the master of the discernment of spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kees|first=Waaijman|date=2013|title=DISCERNMENT AND BIBLICAL SPIRITUALITY: AN OVERVIEW AND EVALUATION OF RECENT RESEARCH|url=|journal=Acta Theologica|volume=32|pages=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignatian discernment comes from Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556) when he created his own unique way of Catholic discernment. Ignatian discernment uses a series of Spiritual Exercises for discerning life choices and focuses on noticing God in all aspects of life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Au|first=Wilkie|date=September 2010|title=The Ignatian Method: A Way of Proceeding|url=|journal=Presence: An International Journal of Spiritual Direction|volume=16|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spiritual Exercises are designed to help people who are facing a major life decision. There are seven steps of discernment to be followed that include identifying the issue, taking time to pray about the choice, making a wholehearted decision, discussing the choice with a mentor and then finally trusting the decision made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Au|first=Wilkie|date=September 2010|title=The Ignatian Method: A Way of Proceeding|url=|journal=Presence: An International Journal of Spiritual Direction|volume=16|pages=7-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ignatius was a religious man his discernment process can be applied to anyone independent of religion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4808">In [[topology]], a branch of [[mathematics]], an '''extension topology''' is a [[topology (structure)|topology]] placed on the [[disjoint union]] of a [[topological space]] and another [[Set (mathematics)|set]].

There are various types of extension topology, described in the sections below.

== Extension topology ==

Let X be a topological space and P a set disjoint from X. Consider in X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the topology whose open sets are of the form: A&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;Q, where A is an open set of X and Q is a subset of P.

Note that the closed sets of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P are of the form: B&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;Q, where B is a closed set of X and Q is a subset of P.

For these reasons this topology is called the '''extension topology''' of X plus P, with which one extends to X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the open and the closed sets of X. Note that the [[subspace topology]] of X as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the original topology of X, while the subspace topology of P as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the [[discrete space|discrete topology]].

Being Y a topological space and R a subset of Y, one might ask whether the extension topology of Y - R plus R is the same as the original topology of Y, and the answer is in general no.

Note the similitude of this extension topology construction and the [[One-point compactification#Alexandroff one-point compactification|Alexandroff one-point compactification]], in which case, having a topological space X which one wishes to compactify by adding a point ∞ in infinity, one considers the closed sets of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{∞} to be the sets of the form: K, where K is a closed compact set of X, or B&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{∞}, where B is a closed set of X.

== Open extension topology ==

Let X be a topological space and P a set disjoint from X. Consider in X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the topology whose open sets are of the form: X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;Q, where Q is a subset of P, or A, where A is an open set of X.

For this reason this topology is called the '''open extension topology''' of X plus P, with which one extends to X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the open sets of X. Note that the [[subspace topology]] of X as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the original topology of X, while the subspace topology of P as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the [[discrete space|discrete topology]].

Note that the closed sets of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P are of the form: Q, where Q is a subset of P, or B&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P, where B is a closed set of X.

Being Y a topological space and R a subset of Y, one might ask whether the extension topology of Y - R plus R is the same as the original topology of Y, and the answer is in general no.

Note that the open extension topology of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is [[comparison of topologies|smaller]] than the extension topology of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P.

Being Z a set and p a point in Z, one obtains the [[excluded point topology]] construction by considering in Z the [[discrete space|discrete topology]] and applying the open extension topology construction to Z - {p} plus p.

== Closed extension topology ==

Let X be a topological space and P a set disjoint from X. Consider in X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the topology whose closed sets are of the form: X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;Q, where Q is a subset of P, or B, where B is a closed set of X.

For this reason this topology is called the '''closed extension topology''' of X plus P, with which one extends to X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P the closed sets of X. Note that the [[subspace topology]] of X as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the original topology of X, while the subspace topology of P as a subset of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is the [[discrete space|discrete topology]].

Note that the open sets of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P are of the form: Q, where Q is a subset of P, or A&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P, where A is an open set of X.

Being Y a topological space and R a subset of Y, one might ask whether the extension topology of Y - R plus R is the same as the original topology of Y, and the answer is in general no.

Note that the closed extension topology of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P is [[comparison of topologies|smaller]] than the extension topology of X&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;P.

Being Z a set and p a point in Z, one obtains the [[particular point topology]] construction by considering in Z the [[discrete space|discrete topology]] and applying the closed extension topology construction to Z - {p} plus p.

For example, the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] gives the relationship between [[differential calculus]] and [[integral calculus]], which are two distinct branches that are not obviously related. Being "fundamental" does not necessarily mean that it is the most basic result. For example, the proof of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] requires [[Euclid's lemma]], which in turn requires [[Bézout's identity]].

The names are mostly traditional, so that for example the ''fundamental theorem of arithmetic'' is basic to what would now be called [[number theory]].

The mathematical literature sometimes refers to the '''fundamental lemma''' of a field. The term [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] is conventionally used to denote a proven proposition which is used as a stepping stone to a larger result rather than as a useful statement in-and-of itself. The fundamental lemma of a field is often, but not always, the same as the fundamental theorem of that field.

The '''Indian Child Welfare Act''' of 1978 ('''ICWA''') (({{USStatute|95|608|92|3069|1978|11|08}}), codified at {{usc|25|1901|1963}}&lt;ref name=ICWA&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, ({{USStatute|95|608|92|3069|1978|11|08}}, {{usc|25|1901|1963}})&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Federal law that governs jurisdiction over the removal of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] (Indian) children from their families.

==Overview of ICWA==

===General===
ICWA gives tribal governments a strong voice concerning [[child custody]] proceedings that involve Indian children, by allocating tribes [[exclusive jurisdiction]] over the case when the child resides on, or is domiciled on, the reservation, or when the child is a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of the tribe; and [[concurrent jurisdiction|concurrent]], but presumptive, jurisdiction over non-reservation Native Americans' foster care placement proceedings.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
ICWA was enacted in 1978 because of the disproportionately high rate of forced removal of Indian children from their traditional homes and essentially from American Indian cultures as a whole. Before enactment, as many as 25 to 35 percent of all Indian children were being forcibly removed, mostly from intact American Indian families, and placed in non-Indian homes, with a deliberate absence of American Indian cultures.&lt;ref name=JohnsonWSR&gt;Johnson, Troy R. (1999), "The State and the American Indian: Who Gets the Indian Child?," 14 ''Wicazo Sa R.'' 197 (University of Minnesota Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesABA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abanet.org/genpractice/magazine/1995/fall/indianchildwelfareact.html |title=The Indian Child Welfare Act: The need for a separate law |author=Jones, B.J. |year=1995 |work=General Practice, Solo &amp; Small Firm Division |publisher=American Bar Association |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) paid the states to remove Indian children and to place them with non-Indian families and religious groups.&lt;ref name=Lowe352&gt;Lowe, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;  Testimony in the [[United States House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs|House Committee for Interior and Insular Affairs]] showed that in some cases, the per capita rate of Indian children in foster care was nearly 16 times higher than the rate for non-Indians.&lt;ref name=HouseRpt&gt;H. Rep. No. 95-608, 95th Cong., 2d. Sess. (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 7530, 1978 CIS H443-53&lt;/ref&gt;  If Indian children had continued to be removed from Indian homes at this rate, tribal survival would be threatened. It also damaged the emotional lives of many children, as adults having been through the process testified. Congress recognized this, and stated that the interests of tribal stability were as important as the best interests of the child.&lt;ref name=Josephy124&gt;Josephy, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; One of the factors in this judgment was that, because of the differences in culture, what was in the best interest of a non-Indian child was not necessarily what was in the best interest of an Indian child, especially as they have traditionally larger extended families and tribal relationships in their culture.&lt;ref name=JonesTilden12&gt;Jones, ''The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook,'' p.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Louis La Rose ([[Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska]]) testified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think the cruelest trick that the white man has ever done to Indian children is to take them into adoption court, erase all of their records and send them off to some nebulous family ... residing in a white community and he goes back to the reservation and he has absolutely no idea who his relatives are, and they effectively make him a non-person and I think ... they destroy him.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson258&gt;Wilkinson, p. 258-260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Congress recognized that four primary factors contributed to the high rates of Indian child removal. These were 1) "a lack of culturally competent State child-welfare standards for assessing the fitness of Indian families; 2) systematic due-process violations against both Indian children and their parents during child-custody procedures; 3) economic incentives favoring removal of Indian children from their families and communities; 4) and social conditions in Indian country." &lt;ref&gt;81 Fed. Reg. 38780 (June 14, 2016)_&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other groups have also had stakes in these decisions. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) had an [[Indian Placement Program]] that removed Indian children from their tribes and into church members homes.  By the 1970s, approximately 5,000 Indian children were living in Mormon homes.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson258 /&gt;  The lack of knowledge about American Indian culture by most social workers also contributed to the high removal rates.  Most social workers are conditioned by the "[[Best interests|best interest of the child]]" as outlined by ''Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (Second Edition),'' which advocates bonding with at least one adult as a parent figure.&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Goldstein, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; This did not take into consideration the tribal culture of the extended tribal family, in which children could have close relationships with extended family.  Common American Indian practices of having a child cared for by an extended relative was viewed as abandonment by allegedly well-intentioned but arguably paternalistic social workers. But tribal members considered this normal behavior and a desirable way to ensure the child was cared for by family.&lt;ref name=JonesTilden3&gt;Jones, ''The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook,'' p.3-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

During congressional consideration, held at the request of Native American advocacy groups, opposition was raised by several states, the LDS Church, and several social welfare groups.  The bill was pushed through by Representative [[Morris Udall]] of [[Arizona]], who lobbied President [[Jimmy Carter]] to sign the bill.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson258 /&gt; It was strongly supported by Senator [[James Abourezk]] of South Dakota, who had authored the bill and previously contributed to founding the American Indian Policy Review Commission and the [[Select Committee on Indian Affairs]], each of which he chaired.&lt;ref name="abourezk"&gt;[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/08/war-words-icwa-faces-multiple-assaults-adoption-industry-160993 Suzette Brewer, "War of Words: ICWA Faces Multiple Assaults From Adoption Industry"], ''Indian Country Today'', 8 July 2015; accessed 9 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress's overriding purpose in passing the ICWA was to protect Indian culture and tribal integrity from the unnecessary removal of Indian children by state and federal agencies.  Awareness of the issues facing American Indian children came about from the advocacy and research by the [[Association on American Indian Affairs]].  Congress reasoned that "there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children."&lt;ref name=ICWA1902&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal challenge====
In October 2018, Federal District Court Judge [[Reed Charles O'Connor|Reed O'Connor]] struck down parts of the law as unconstitutional due to it mandating racial preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/federal_court_declares_indian_child_welfare_act_unconstitutional|title=Federal court in Texas declares Indian Child Welfare Act unconstitutional|first=Lorelei|last=Laird|date=October 10, 2018|work=[[ABA Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jurisdiction===

====Minimum Standards====
ICWA sets the minimal Federal standards for nearly all Indian child custody proceedings, including adoption, voluntary and involuntary termination of parental rights, and removal and foster care placement of Indian children, but excluding divorce and child delinquency proceedings.  ICWA provides that state courts have no jurisdiction over the adoption or custody of Indian children residing within their own tribal reservation.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; An "Indian child" is "any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe."&lt;ref name=ICWA1903&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICWA applies to a "child custody proceeding"&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt; involving an Indian child.  The term "child custody proceeding" involves: (i) "foster care placements", where the child has been placed in a foster home, and the parent cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated; (2) terminations of parental rights; (3) "preadoptive placements", which means placing the child in a foster home after the termination of parental rights, but before or instead of an adoption; and (4) adoptions.&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt;

ICWA does not cover child custody hearings during divorce proceedings. Nor does ICWA cover cases of child delinquency where the child has done something that would be considered a crime if done by an adult.  Because Indian tribes play a major part in the upbringing of Indian children that is significantly different than that of the parents, the ICWA gives important jurisdictional powers to Indian tribes in order to preserve the Indian culture.  Tribal courts hold either [[exclusive jurisdiction]] or [[concurrent jurisdiction]] dependent on several factors.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;

====Exclusive tribal jurisdiction====
Under ICWA, an Indian tribe has exclusive jurisdiction over an Indian child who resides or is domiciled within the tribe's land.  This includes both reservation land, other tribal lands that are held in trust by the Federal government for the benefit of a tribe or individual, or held by a tribe or individual subject to a restriction by the United States against alienation.  The last two describe tribal lands such as those in [[Oklahoma]] that were transferred to individual Indians under various laws.  The Indian tribal courts also have exclusive jurisdiction over Indian children who are wards of the court or tribe, regardless of their location.&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt;

The first [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case dealing with ICWA was the 1989 case  ''[[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=490&amp;page=30 (490 U.S. 30, 109 S.Ct. 1597)].   This Court ruled that the ICWA gives the tribal court [[exclusive jurisdiction]] over a case where the parent was domiciled on the reservation, no matter what their own personal desires are in the custody case.

====Concurrent jurisdiction====
Concurrent jurisdiction is shared jurisdiction between the tribal courts and the state courts. State courts have been severely criticized for ignoring the requirements of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, The Indian Child Welfare Act: In the Best Interests of the Child and Tribe, 27/8 CLEARINGHOUSE REVIEW 864 (December 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases that the tribal court does not have exclusive jurisdiction, they have concurrent jurisdiction.  These cases would be custody proceedings involving Indian children that don't reside or are not domiciled on the tribal lands (such as someone born off the reservation and whose parents don't live on the reservation). In these concurrent decisions, the ICWA expresses a preference for tribal jurisdiction in Indian child custody proceedings.&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt;

==Procedures==
[[File:Native American boy in Men's Northern Traditional outfit.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Maintaining tribal relationships]]

===Notification and rights===
In an involuntary proceeding, the party seeking the placement of the child,&lt;ref name= 25CFR2311&gt;25 CFR §23.11(a) (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; which is often but not always the state, must notify both the parent(s) and/or Indian custodian(s) and the child's tribe at least 10 days prior to the proceeding. Emergency proceedings may follow state law, but proceedings after that are controlled by ICWA.  If the state cannot determine who the parent or the tribe is, then the state is required to notify the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]. Notification must contain all the requisite information identified in 25 CFR § 23.111 and be sent by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested,&lt;ref name= 25CFR2311 /&gt; and the parties notified have the right to an additional 20 days to prepare prior to the proceeding.&lt;ref name=ICWA1912&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Failure to provide such notice can cause a jurisdictional defect that may result in any such proceeding to be overturned.&lt;ref name=JonesTilden84&gt;{{cite book| title= The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook: A Legal Guide to the Custody and Adoption of Native American Children| first1= Billy Joe |last1= Jones| first2= Mark |last2= Tilden| first3= Kelly |last3= Gaines-Stoner| publisher= American Bar Association| year= 2008| edition= 2nd |pages= 84–88| isbn= 9781590318584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF365&gt;{{cite book| title= A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act| publisher= Native American Rights Fund| year= 2007| pages= 36–41| isbn= 9780979409912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Fort&gt;{{cite journal| last= Fort| first= Kathryn E.| year= 2008| title= Beyond Minimum Standards: Federal Requirements and State Interpretations of the Indian Child Welfare Act| volume= 45 |work= Court Review | number= 26 | publisher= American Judges Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICWA case may be dismissed for lack of due process if not for the lack of jurisdiction "because ' "failure to give proper notice of a dependency proceeding to a tribe with which the dependent child may be affiliated forecloses the participation by the tribe, [ICWA] notice requirements are strictly construed." ' ." &lt;ref&gt;In re Robert A., 147 Cal.App.4th 982, 989&lt;/ref&gt;

"The determination of a child's Indian status is up to the tribe; therefore, the juvenile court needs only a suggestion of Indian ancestry to trigger the notice requirement." &lt;ref&gt;In re Nikki R. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 844, 848&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The circumstances under which a juvenile court has reason to believe that a child is an Indian child is an in Indian child include, but are not limited to, the following: '(I) Any party to the case, Indian tribe, Indian organization or public or private agency informs the court that the child is an Indian child. (II) Any public or state-licensed agency involved in child protection services or family support has discovered information which suggests that the child is an Indian child. (III) The child who is the subject of the proceeding gives the court reason to believe he or she is an Indian child. (IV) The residence or domicile of the child, his or her biological parents, or the Indian custodian is known by the court to be or is shown to be a predominantly Indian community. (V) An officer of the court involved in the proceeding has knowledge that the child may be an Indian child.'|Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings (44 Federal Register 67584, 67586 (Nov. 26, 1979) (Guidelines); [former] rule 1439(d)(2).) &lt;ref&gt;In re O.K., 106 Cal.App.4th 152, 156&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians, a tribe that is federally recognized by the U.S. Federal Government but is not recognized for services of the Bureau of Indian Affairs under 25 C.F.R 83 et al. are used for precedent for many cases whereby the following conditions apply:

In cases whereby the mother may not be a member of the tribe, however she is eligible, then before the provisions of ICWA apply, "the trial court must initially determine if a child is an Indian child within the meaning of ICWA." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;In the Interest of C.H. et al., 510 N.W.2d 119, 123 (S.D. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; This is because "a parent's current enrollment is not always dispositive of a child's membership in an Indian tribe".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The finding in the case of the children involved was "In the matter of C.H. et al., 510 N.W.2d (S.D. 1993) that the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians were held to be a Federally Recognized tribe for the purposes of ICWA.

The child may be provided an attorney, and the parents are entitled to one if they are indigent and cannot afford one.  If the state does not have provisions for providing indigent parents an attorney, the Secretary of the Interior is to pay the attorney expenses.

All of the parties have the right to examine all documents and reports related to the proceeding.&lt;ref name=ICWA1912 /&gt;

In a removal case, the party seeking the removal (normally Child Protective Services or similar agency) is required to make active efforts to provide the parent or custodian with remedial and rehabilitative services designed to prevent the removal of the child from the Indian family.  The "active effort" requirement also applies even if the party seeking removal is a private party, as in a private party adoption.&lt;ref name=ICWA1912 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In the Matter of N.B. |vol= 199 |reporter= P.3d |opinion=16 |pinpoint=31 |court=Colo. App. |date=2007 |url= |quote=Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's holding that stepmother's failure to show active efforts as required by 25 U.S.C. § 1912(d) precludes termination of mother's parental rights through this stepparent adoption.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The child may not be temporarily removed unless there is a likelihood of "serious emotional or physical damage" to the child if they remain in the home.&lt;ref name=ICWA1916&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intervention===
The tribe and parents or Indian custodian of the Indian child have an unqualified right to intervene in a case involving foster care placement or the termination of parental rights .  The intervention may be at any time, and not just at the beginning of the proceedings.&lt;ref name=ICWA1912 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesTilden88&gt;Jones, The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook, p.88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF46&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 46-49&lt;/ref&gt;  This right does not apply to pre-adoption or adoption proceedings unless it also includes the termination of parental rights.&lt;ref name=NARF46 /&gt;

===Transfer to Tribal Court===

====Motion to Transfer====
In a foster care or termination of parental rights case where the tribe and the state exercise concurrent jurisdiction, the tribe, either biological parent, or the Indian custodian may move to transfer the case from the state court to the tribal court.
&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF56&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 56-63&lt;/ref&gt;  The ICWA technically allows transfer to the tribal court at any time in the proceeding, but state courts vary on how they view transfer requests after state court proceedings are well into the adjudication process.  In some cases the state will look to the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] to deny such a transfer based on that law's time standards.&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesTilden65&gt;Jones, The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook, p.65-67.&lt;/ref&gt;  After a motion for transfer has been made, there is a presumption that the tribal court will receive the case and the state court is required to make the transfer unless one of three factors is present.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;

====Objection to Transfer====
A biological parent, whether Indian or non-Indian may object to and veto a proposed transfer of a case to tribal court.  A prospective parent, the Indian child, or another party may object, but may not veto a transfer, and those objections would be covered under the "good cause" provision.  In the event that a parent vetoes the transfer, the case will remain in state court.  This is most commonly seen where one of the parents is non-Indian.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesTilden65 /&gt;

====Declination by Tribal Court====
The tribal court may decline to accept the transfer of a case from a state court.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;  An example is where the parents move to transfer the case, but the tribe declines to accept jurisdiction due to a lack of funding for programs that would support the child and the parents at the tribal level that are present at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;Cavanagh, Michael F. (2010), "American Indian Law: State Court Administrative Office – Court Improvement Program: Indian Child Welfare Act Forum: October 6, 2008," 89 Mich.

==== Active Remediation Efforts ====
One aspect of the ICWA that may provide the most hope for Native American families is the requirement of active efforts with the existing family to rehabilitate the root cause prior to removal of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/docview/1812610354?accountid=38569|title=Implementing and defending the indian child welfare act through revised state requirements.

By engaging at risk families, and providing services, the family may be healed and the outcome for both the child and the family is changed dramatically for the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/docview/1635437017?accountid=38569|title=Child welfare in Indian country: A story of painful removals.Health Affairs, 33(12), 2256-2259|last=Cross|first=T.L|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focus on remediation and rehabilitative services to protect the family, unique services that are geared to tribal values are offered, to help parents understand their roles as parents in the culture.

By working with ICWA and the tribes to create preventative services that are culturally sensitive, outcomes can be dramatically changed. Those services need not be limited to tribal members, but also available to foster and adoptive families to help connect with the child's cultural roots.

====Good Cause====
A state court may decline to transfer a case for "good cause," but that term is not defined in the ICWA.  The BIA has issued an advisory set of guidelines for state courts to use in determining "good cause."&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BIAGuide&gt;Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, {{USFR|44|67584}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While these guidelines are not mandatory, many states have adopted them, and they include:
*No tribal court as defined by the ICWA,
*The proceeding was at an advanced stage when the transfer request was made, and the party asking for the transfer did not request the transfer promptly after receiving notice of the proceeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Shageluk IRA Council v. Alaska |vol=2009 |reporter=Alas. LEXIS |opinion=25 |pinpoint= |court=Alas. |date=2009 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Indian child is over the age of 12 and objects to the transfer,
*It would cause undue hardship on the parties and/or witnesses to travel to a tribal court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re Adoption of S.S. &amp; R.S. |vol=657 |reporter=N.E.2d |opinion=935 |pinpoint= |court=Ill. |date=1995 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
*The parents of an Indian child over the age of 5 are not available and the child has had little or no contact with the tribe.
The BIA has also set out factors that state courts may ''not'' consider when determining whether good cause exists. These are binding regulations, effective as of December 12, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|25|23|118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USFR|81|38802}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibited factors are:
*Whether the proceeding is at an advanced stage, if the Indian parent, custodian, or tribe did not receive notice of the proceeding until an advanced stage;
*Whether there have been prior proceedings involving the child in which transfer was not requested;
*Whether transfer could affect the placement of the child;
*The child's cultural connections with the tribe or its reservation; or
*Socioeconomic conditions or negative perceptions of tribal social services or judicial systems.

===Existing Indian Family Exception===

====History of the Exception====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:File-Indian Backword class child.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Indian Backwordclass child]] --&gt;
In 1982, the [[Kansas Supreme Court]] held that the ICWA " was not to dictate that an illegitimate infant who has never been a member of an Indian home or culture, and probably never would be, should be removed from its primary cultural heritage and placed in an Indian environment over the express objections of its non-Indian mother."&lt;ref name=SCOKBabyL&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re Baby Boy L. |vol=643 |reporter=P.2d |opinion=168 |pinpoint= |court=Kan. |date=1982 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the facts of the case, the court stated that the ICWA did not apply unless the child was part of an "existing Indian family unit."  The court denied the [[Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma]] the right to intervene in the case, stating that the ICWA did not apply. The court also held that even if the ICWA did apply,  the trial court committed no [[harmless error|reversible error]] because the non-Indian mother would have objected to the transfer of the case to a tribal court and, thus, defeated the transfer.&lt;ref name=SCOKBabyL /&gt;

From the Kansas Supreme Court case sprang a body of jurisprudence around the "existing Indian family" exception to ICWA.  In the years following the Kansas ''Baby Boy L.'' case, approximately half of the states adopted or expanded upon this "existing Indian family" exception, despite the fact that the language appeared nowhere in the text of the ICWA.&lt;ref name=NARF1&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 1-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewerenz&gt;Lewerenz, Dan; McCoy, Padraic (2010) "The End of "Existing Indian Family" Jurisprudence: Holyfield at 20, In the Matter of A.J.S., and the Last Gasps of a Dying Doctrine," 36 Wm.Mit.L.R. 684 (William Mitchell College of Law)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to the Kansas ''Baby Boy L.'' case, in 1989, the [[United States Supreme Court]] heard ''[[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield]].'' {{ussc|490|30|1989}}&lt;ref name=SCOTUS&gt;Like the ''Baby Boy L.'' case, ''[[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield]]''{{ussc|490|30|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the ''Baby Boy L.'' case, both parents in ''Holyfield'' consented to the voluntary termination of their parental rights and adoption of their infant by a non-Indian family.  Unlike the parents in ''Baby Boy L.'', the mother in this case lived on the reservation both before and after the birth of the child off-reservation.  The Supreme Court found that the child was "domiciled" on the reservation because its biological mother was domiciled on the reservation. Therefore, the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribal court under ICWA should have been invoked.  The case was remanded to the tribal court for a custody determination three years after the child had been placed with non-Indian adoptive parents.   Noting the potential disruption in the child's life, the Supreme Court noted that any potential harm could have been avoided if the parents and state court had not wrongfully denied the tribe its rights under ICWA.&lt;ref name=SCOTUS/&gt;

While the Supreme Court did not consider the "existing Indian family" exception, some sources cite ''Holyfield'' as an implicit  rejection of  the exception.&lt;ref name=NARF1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewerenz /&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesTilden30&gt;Jones, The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sources have noted that the ''Holyfield'' case is relied upon as support for both sides of the debate over the "existing Indian family" exception:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Surprisingly, ''Holyfield'' has been relied upon by courts and parties both to support and reject the existing Indian family exception, which has been invoked in proceedings involving Indian children and families who are living off the reservation and who are, therefore, subject to state court jurisdiction concurrent with that of the tribal court.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Toni Hahn (1993) "The Existing Indian Family Exception to the Indian Child Welfare Act," 69 N. Dak. L. Rev. 465 (University of North Dakota School of Law)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of 2010, [[Alabama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=S.A. v. E.J.P. |vol=571 |reporter=So.2d |opinion=1187 |pinpoint= |court=Ala. Civ.

App. |date=1997 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; still use the "existing Indian family" exception.   Alabama and Indiana have limited its application by further court decisions.&lt;ref name=Lewerenz /&gt;  Nineteen states have rejected the doctrine, either by court decision or statute, including Kansas, where the Kansas Supreme Court expressly overturned the ''Baby L.'' decision in ''In re A.J.S.'', stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Given all of the foregoing, we hereby overrule Baby Boy L., (citation omitted), and abandon its existing Indian family doctrine. Indian heritage and the treatment of it has a unique history in United States law. A.J.S. has both Indian and non-Indian heritage, and courts are right to resist essentializing any ethnic or racial group. However, ICWA's overall design, including its "good cause" threshold in 25 U.S.C. 1915, ensures that all interests—those of both natural parents, the tribe, the child, and the prospective adoptive parents—are appropriately considered and safeguarded. ICWA applies to this state court child custody proceeding involving A.J.S., and the Cherokee Nation must be permitted to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re A.J.S. |vol=204 |reporter=P.3d |opinion=543 |pinpoint= |court=Kan. |date=2009 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 2016, the Department of Interior specifically rejected the existing Indian family exception.&lt;ref&gt;81 Fed. Reg. 38801-2 (June 14, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations reflect not only that courts who rejected the doctrine were correct to do so, but also that "Congress did not intend to limit ICWA's applicability to those Tribal citizens actively involved in Indian culture." &lt;ref&gt;81 Fed. Reg. 38802 (June 14, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms====
Some critics have complained that the existing Indian family exception requires the state court to determine what it means to be an Indian child or an Indian family, by applying tests to determine the "Indian-ness" of the child.  One such test involved evaluating if the child lived "in an 'actual Indian dwelling,' apparently thinking of a teepee, hogan, or pueblo."&lt;ref name=Johnson398&gt;Johnson, Kevin R., p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;  Another work notes that "state courts have taken it upon themselves to determine individuals' relationship with their tribes by examining such contacts as subscription to a tribal newsletter."&lt;ref name=Lemont125&gt;Lemont, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1997 testimony before the Joint Hearing of the [[House Resources Committee]] and the [[Senate Committee on Indian Affairs]], Assistant Secretary of the Interior [[Ada Deer]] ([[Menominee|Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin]]) stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... we want to express our grave concern that the objectives of the ICWA continue to be frustrated by State court created judicial exceptions to the ICWA. We are concerned that State court judges who have created the "existing Indian family exception" are delving into the sensitive and complicated areas of Indian cultural values, customs and practices which under existing law have been left exclusively to the judgment of Indian tribes ... We oppose any legislative recognition of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indian.senate.gov/hearings/618_ada.htm |title=Statement of Ada E.

===Foster Care Placement and Adoption===
"Foster care placement" is defined as "any action removing an Indian child from its parent or Indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian custodian cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated".&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF86&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 86-89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl==

The Supreme Court issued a decision pertaining to the ICWA in the case ''[[Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl]]'', on June 25, 2013.  In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice [[Samuel Alito]], the Supreme Court held that the heightened standard required under § 1912(f) of ICWA does not apply when the parent in question never had physical or legal custody of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What the Court's 'Baby Veronica' Ruling Means for Fathers and Native Americans|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/06/what-the-courts-baby-veronica-ruling-means-for-fathers-and-native-americans/277215/|publisher=The Atlantic|last=Cohen|first=Andrew|date=25 June 2013|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Law in Modern Society: Toward a Criticism of Social Theory''''' is a 1976 book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, Unger uses the rise and decline of the [[rule of law]] as a vehicle to explore certain problems in [[social theory]]. According to Unger, problems that were central concerns of classical social theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]—the problems of explanation, order, and modernity—remain unsolved. Unger contends that the failure of classical social theory to solve these dilemmas can be traced to the way in which it asserted its independence from the ancient political philosophers, namely in its denial of a supra-historical human nature and in its insistence upon the contrast of [[fact-value distinction|fact and value]]. Unger argues that a radical reorientation of social theory is needed to solve the problems it faces. "To carry out its own program," Unger writes, social theory must destroy itself."{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=8}} The rise and decline of the rule of law, and the dilemmas of social theory, converge in the need to be able to compare and criticize different forms of society, in order to be able to more effectively submit the organization of society to the human will.

==Overview==

===Chapter 1: The Predicament of Social Theory===

Unger opens ''Law in Modern Society'' by connecting the study of law to the unsolved problems of social theory. Social theory is the tradition originating in the writings of [[Montesquieu]] and culminating with the work of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]].{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=1-3}} In Unger's view, classic social theory as represented by these thinkers is marked by an insistence on the distinction between fact and value, description and evaluation, and also by a denial of a unitary human nature. Unger contrasts classic social theory with the political philosophy of the ancients, who did not recognize as sharp a distinction between fact and value, and maintained that there is a universal human nature that exists in all times and places.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=3-5}}

The study of law affords a vantage point from which to explore three unsolved problems of social theory, according to Unger. The first, the '''problem of method''', is that the prevailing methodological approaches to social study are inadequate. The rationalist approach (as seen in the works of economists) and the historicist approach (which accepts the function of cause and effect but not logical entailment) both invite deterministic social explanations. Unger contends that we need a third method, one that is generalizing, and yet also open to rich historical particularity while not falling into deterministic explanations.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=8-23}}

The second problem is the '''problem of social order'''. How do we account for the existence of a social order? Classical social theory is represented by a struggle between the doctrines of instrumentalism (or private interest) versus legitimacy (or consensus). The legitimacy approach sees rules as manifestations of the shared values of a group. The instrumentalist approach sees society as made up of many divergent individual wills, and rules serve the instrumental purpose of helping the members of society achieve their privately chosen aims in the long run.  Utilitarianism is an example of an instrumentalist approach. According to Unger, we need to go beyond the partial truths expressed in each doctrine.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=23-37}}

The third unsolved problem of social theory is '''the problem of modernity'''. What marks the experience of modernity? What is its place in world history? What is the relationship between ideology and actuality in modern life? Our social theory must be able to reconcile the subjective experience of society with its objective meaning. As history transpires, new puzzles are added to the experience of studying modernity.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=37-40}} A large part of the problem of modernity is the difficulty of comparing modern forms of social life: modern Western society with its forbears, and different forms of contemporary society (traditional, revolutionary socialist, postliberal) among themselves.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=41-42}}

The program of classic social theory has value, according to Unger—namely in allowing us to study human beings as they are rather than as they ought to be, and in helping us to inquire into how each society shapes conduct and consciousness of its members. These classical social theorists sought to create a body of objective knowledge of society that would not be at the mercy of metaphysical speculation or political controversy, and up to a point, they succeeded.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=266-267}} But Unger concludes that the problems of social theory cannot be resolved unless the truths of classic social theory are reconciled with the insights of older political philosophy.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=43}} We need a general doctrine of human nature.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=40-43}}

===Chapter 2: Law and the Forms of Society===

In this chapter Unger addresses the varieties of law and explores the conditions under which each of them develops. '''Customary/interactional''' law is neither public nor positive, and consists of implicit standards of conduct, not formulated rules. Under a system of customary and interactional law, customs are characteristically inarticulate.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=49-50}} '''Bureaucratic/regulatory''' law is public and positive, and emerges with the division of state and society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=50-52}} A '''legal order''' is a legal system that is committed to being general and autonomous, in addition to being public and positive.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=52-54}}

From this discussion, he draws conclusions about the issue of social order as it relates to the development of law. Unger explains how disintegration of community is accompanied by a trend toward increasing specialization in a society's division of labor, a trend that is responsible for the separation of state and society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=63}} This process erodes the basis for an inclusive set of shared beliefs.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=61-62}} The legal order emerges with interest group pluralism,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=66-76}} as well as reliance on higher divine or universal law as standard for justifying and criticizing a state's positive law.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=76-86}}  The rule of law is a response to the decline of order in society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=127-133}} But when the belief in higher law declines, the legal order is threatened. In contemporary history, the natural rights synthesis that underlies the legal order ideal has been undone, with the result that the coherence of the rule of law ideal is compromised.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=84-86}}

===Chapter 3: Law and Modernity===

In this chapter, Unger traces the rise and decline of the rule of law in society. He begins by setting out a preliminary framework for the comparison of societies, and uses this framework to examine tribal society, liberal society, and aristocratic society. Unger's inquiry into these types of society revolves around three questions: What is the nature of the contrast between insiders and outsiders? How are insiders drawn together in significant groups and what is the quality of their encounters with strangers? And, finally, how individuals conceive of the place of the ideal—do they have a concept of the right or the good that transcends the natural or social world?{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=137-140}}

Unger concludes that tribal society displays the starkest possible contrast between insiders and outsiders; outsiders are not regarded as human beings with whom the insiders share anything significant in common. There is a paucity of significant groups in tribal society. And there is little conception of a good or right that towers over the immanent reality of daily life or the natural world. The important insight, for Unger, is that tribal society is an extremely cohesive social world, where there is deep agreement about fundamental social questions, profound distrust of strangers, and no recognition of overarching ideals against which the quotidian life or nature can be compared.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=140-143}}

At the other extreme, liberal society is one in which the contrast between insiders and outsiders is softened by the fact that each individual belongs to a large number of significant groups. Because members of liberal society become accustomed to other people being both insiders and outsiders in different contexts, the hostility of tribal society for the stranger is replaced, in liberal society, by ideals of impersonal respect and formal equality. People will abide by relatively stable standards of social order because it is to their advantage to do so, not because they observe identical conceptions of the true and the good. In liberal society, a concept of the right and the good transcends the reality of daily life and the natural world.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=143-147}}

Unger views aristocratic society as a synthesis of tribal and liberal societies. Aristocratic society unites universalism and particularism. In aristocratic society, significant social groups are experienced as steps on a hierarchic ladder. Each individual belongs to a specific group, his estate, which confers on him a range of entitlements and obligations and predetermine his outlook on the world. These strata are sharply divided from each other and are decisive in determining the quality of the individual's life. Aristocratic society's view of the relationship between the ideal and the actual occupies an intermediate position between the views of tribal and liberal society. In aristocratic society, there is an intense oscillation between a tendency to sanctify existing social arrangements and the tendency to oppose them to a higher heavenly perfection.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=147-153}}

Having set out a rudimentary grammar for the comparison of societies, Unger traces the emergence and decline of the liberal state and the rule of law{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=134}} (which Unger describes as the soul of liberal society{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=192}}).

Liberal society developed out of aristocratic society, namely the society of estates (Standestaat), which was an intermediary system between feudal society and the modern liberal state.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=155-156}} The law of the Standestaat was a forerunner to the modern legal system, and consisted of an area of royal discretion (matters falling under the prince's prerogative to keep the peace) and a higher law (matters pertaining to the privileges and obligations of estates of the realm).{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=158-160}} The elements that make up a modern legal order—positiveness, publicity, generality and autonomy—were not present,{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=160}} but as the formerly neat line between royal prerogatives and the law of estates faded away, the prince was increasingly held to standards of generality and autonomy, and estate privileges acquired a public and positive character.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=162-163}} The confinement of royal power by the fundamental law of the Standestaat was supported by a belief in a God-given natural order.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=166}}

The liberal state—with its multiplicity of significant groups, the disappearance of a sharp distinction between insiders and outsiders, and a stark division between the ideal and the actual—faced two questions with increasing urgency: how can there be consensus without widespread agreement about the good,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=169-170}} and how can we distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of power in the face of dissolving hierarchy and moral confusion?{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=172-173}} The rule of law, which attempted to guarantee the impersonality of power, was a way of dealing with these urgent questions.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=176-178}}

The rule of law has two major premises—that the most significant forms of power can be concentrated in government, and that power can be effectively constrained by rules. But Unger contends that these premises are largely fictitious.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=178-179}} They are undermined by the awareness that individuals are most vulnerable to hierarchies of the family, the workplace, and the market that are largely beyond the reach of the legal system, and also that rules can never make power truly impersonal and impartial—administrators and judges will always decide among competing sets of beliefs in rendering a decision.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=179-181}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, the very assumptions of the rule of law ideal appear to be falsified by the reality of life in liberal society ... The state, a supposedly neutral overseer of social conflict, is forever caught up in the antagonism of private interests and made the tool of one faction or another. Thus, in seeking to discipline and to justify the exercise of power, men are condemned to pursue an objective they are forbidden to reach. And this repeated disappointment accentuates still further the gap between the vision of the ideal and the experience of actuality.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=181}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The contradictions and paradoxes of liberal society, by undermining the rule of law and the ideals it represents, ultimately give rise to what Unger calls postliberal society. Postliberal society is marked by overt intervention by the government in areas previously regarded as beyond the reach of state action, and a gradual approximation of state and society. The state's pretense of being a neutral guardian of the social order is abandoned.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=192-193}} These trends are reflected in the rise of open-ended clauses in legislation, administration, and adjudication, and a concern with substantive justice over formal justice.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=192-200}} The effacement of the boundary between state and society, called corporatism, leads to the rise of state institutions that rival the state in their power.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=200-203}} Unger argues that these welfare state institutions are an assault on the legal order, while the corporatist tendencies in postliberal society undermine bureaucratic law.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=200}} The danger of these tendencies, Unger contends, is demonstrated by the Weimar Republic, in which the decline of the rule of law in favor of a welfare corporate state set the stage for terror and inhumanity of Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=216-220}}

Unger concludes his examination of law and modernity by looking at two varieties of the modern state—the traditionalist state{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=224-231}} and the revolutionary socialist{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=231-234}}—then considering two possibilities for the development of law in the future. Seeing similar tensions within traditionalist and revolutionary socialist societies,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=234-235}} Unger points out that the liberal state is only a special case of modernity.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=166}} He concludes that there's no more reason to think that societies will converge toward similarity rather than grow in their differences.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=237}}

The future of the rule of law, Unger suggests, could take two forms. The first, pessimistic, possibility he imagines is a scenario in which the progression of custom, bureaucracy, and rule of law revolves in a circle, and the postliberal decline of the rule of law would lead to the return of custom as the exclusive instrument of the social order.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=238-239}} There would be a relapse of a tribalism that sanctifies the existing order of the group as an irrevocable decree of nature. The second possibility Unger imagines is an optimistic scenario, which Unger describes as a spiral in which "individual freedom could be rescued from the demise of the rule of law."{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=239}} On this model, society defeats inequality to such an extent that people place greater confidence in collective choices, not suspecting them as a product of the interests of dominant groups.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=239-240}} The increasing equality of society would make possible a greater consensus about the immanent order of society and help refine further the meaning of equality.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=240}}

===Chapter 4: The Predicament of Social Theory Revisited===

In this final chapter, Unger returns to the questions of the methodology of social theory with which he opened the book.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=243-245}} For each of the unsolved problems of social theory—the problem of method, the problem of social order, and the problem of modernity—Unger concludes that the theoretical problems of social theory require a political solution.

For the problem of method, Unger offers the interpretive method as an alternative to the rationalist and historicist approaches favored by classical social theorists. The interpretive method, which emphasizes the embeddedness of action in belief and the way social phenomena cluster into meaningful totalities, avoids the tendency of rationalist and historicist methods to fall into deterministic accounts of human activity, while also offering the prospect of reconciling the demands of subjectivity and objectivity in social explanation. But the possibility of reconciling subjectivity and objectivity in social theory ultimately is premised on a belief in the unity of the human spirit, and in order to be achieved, we would need a community of experience, understanding and value to come into existence. For this reason, to solve the problem of method completely requires a political solution.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=245-262}}

For the second persistent problem of social theory, the problem of social order, Unger sees the crux of this problem in the divergence between the doctrines of legitimacy/consensus and instrumentalism/private interest. These views offer completely different accounts of the basis for order in society. Unger allows that instrumentalism is more effective in explaining liberal society, while consensus theory comes closer in explaining tribal and hierarchical societies.
Social study of law suggests a response to our puzzlement over the basis of order in society. It puts the controversy between the doctrines of private interest and consensus, and hence between the instrumental and noninstrumental view of rules, in perspective. But once again, a political solution is called for to deal with the divergence between instrumentalism and consensus theories: the crisis of order will only be fully resolved once it reconciles individual freedom with community cohesion, and the sense of immanent order with possibility of community cohesion.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=262-265}}

Addressing the final unsolved problem of social theory, the problem of modernity, Unger concludes that we must reject the approaches offered by both liberalism, which views society as an association of individuals with conflicting ends and whose security and freedom are guaranteed by the rule of law, and Marxism, which sees society as a structure of class domination whose true character is hidden by the prevailing ideology. Unger argues we must focus on the interplay between belief and experience, consciousness and organization, in the study of modernity. This interplay takes new forms as history unfolds. The political problem presented by modernity—a problem confronted by postliberal, traditionalist, and revolutionary socialist societies—is the problem of reconciling freedom and community. Harmonizing the sense of latent order in society with the capacity to let will remake social arrangements is the key to reconciling freedom and community.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=265-266}}

==Reception==

[[Talcott Parsons]] reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' for the ''[[Law &amp; Society Review]]'', and offered qualified praise for Unger's work. "The book is important because it contains one of the sharpest and clearest statements of the problem of what the author calls the place of a legal system in a total and complex society."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=145}} However, Parsons contends that Unger erroneously claims that law as a social phenomenon is restricted to its interpenetration with the state. Parsons also "disagree[s] with [Unger's] characterization of the legal system as ''part of the structure of modern societies''."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=149}} Parsons concludes: "His is both an important and a good book, but it does not give the reader a
competent and comprehensive appraisal of the issues which contemporary legal and 'social' theory need to confront in their mutual pursuit of an understanding of legal systems."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=149}}

Manning J. Dauer reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''[[The Journal of Politics]]'', describing the book as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;an able work arguing for a new synthesis in social sciences and in legal theory. The argument that traditionalistic aspects now need modifying is well presented. The rule of law is an important concept, but it has to be adapted to more individualistic judgments as the social sciences impinge on traditionalistic interpretations. Might he consider John Rawls's attempt to define Social Justice? Unger points out the need and the difficulties; the method whereby this will be achieved is still in process, but the dilemma presented to the social sciences is well stated.{{sfn|Dauer|1977|p=1106}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

German sociologist Klaus Eder considered ''Law in Modern Society'' alongside [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]]'s ''The Behavior of Law''. Eder considered Unger's argument in detail, and concluded that Unger offered a promising research program for a sociological study of law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This model of the evolution of law is an interesting working hypothesis, which may be especially fruitful for the analysis of changes in modern law. [Unger's] book is ... neither more nor less than a research program, probably a fruitful one, for the sociological study of law on two levels: a synchronic structural description of forms of normative order and a diachronic social-historical analysis of the factors that produce structural transformations of law.{{sfn|Eder|1977|p=142-143}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[James B. Stewart|James Stewart]] reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' for the ''[[Journal of Economic Issues]]'', writing that "this book should be read by those seeking to escape the limitations of existing social theory and particularly neoclassical economics. In particular, Unger's emphasis on the need to undertake cross-cultural analyses and his careful delineation of alternative concepts of law provide a useful guide for further developments in institutional economics."{{sfn|Stewart|1976|pp=990-991}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neil T. Duxbury wrote a retrospective assessment of ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''[[The Modern Law Review]]''. Duxbury acknowledges Unger's commitment to "straddle the frontiers of social theory" in both ''[[Knowledge and Politics]]'' and ''Law in Modern Society'', calling this persistence in addressing the most difficult questions of social theory a "defining feature of the book." However, Duxbury finds fault with the book, contending that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger's notion of post-liberalism is awash with over-generalised arguments. Contrary to his own suggestions, there appears to be no reason why the corporatist tendency within post-liberalism should result not only in a move towards the establishment of substantive justice, but also in the maintenance of the liberal tendency towards formal justice.{{sfn|Duxbury|1986|p=673}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duxbury concludes that Unger's work operates at such a vague and abstract level of generality, that his work might be invalidated by empirical evidence left unexplored by Unger:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger has continued to develop his 'modernist' position with a conceptual vagueness which suggests not so much that he should be criticised for theorising at a selected level of abstraction, but rather that, so long as he continues to operate at this level, he will always, if only potentially, be open to the charge of failing to pay sufficient attention to the empirical evidence on offer-evidence which may sometimes invalidate the conceptualisations to which he ascribes.{{sfn|Duxbury|1986|p=679}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alfred P. Rubin offered high praise for ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''Perspective'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is impossible to do justice to this book in a short review. The evolution of society from status to contract and back to status has been noted by many other writers, but Professor Unger's framework for social analysis is in large part original, accessible only to sophisticated scholars, and possibly seminal.{{sfn|Rubin|1976|p=114}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea is that the existence of [[absolute rotation]] (the distinction of local [[inertial frame]]s vs. [[rotating reference frame]]s) is determined by the large-scale distribution of matter, as exemplified by this anecdote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gravitation and Cosmology |last=Steven |first=Weinberg |publisher= Wiley |year=1972 |isbn=978-0-471-92567-5 |location=USA |pages= 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You are standing in a field looking at the stars. Your arms are resting freely at your side, and you see that the distant stars are not moving. Now start spinning. The stars are whirling around you and your arms are pulled away from your body. Why should your arms be pulled away when the stars are whirling? Why should they be dangling freely when the stars don't move?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mach's principle says that this is not a coincidence—that there is a physical law that relates the motion of the distant stars to the local inertial frame. If you see all the stars whirling around you, Mach suggests that there is some physical law which would make it so you would feel a [[centrifugal force]]. There are a number of rival formulations of the principle. It is often stated in vague ways, like "[[mass]] out there influences [[inertia]] here". A very general statement of Mach's principle is "local physical laws are determined by the large-scale structure of the universe".&lt;ref name=Hawking&gt;{{cite book |title=The Large Scale Structure of Space–Time |author1=Stephen W. Hawking  |author2=George Francis Rayner Ellis  |lastauthoramp=yes |isbn=978-0-521-09906-6 |date=1973 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QagG_KI7Ll8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ellis+inauthor:Hawking#PPA1,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept was a guiding factor in Einstein's development of the [[general theory of relativity]]. Einstein realized that the overall distribution of matter would determine the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], which tells you which frame is rotationally stationary. [[Frame-dragging]] and conservation of gravitational [[angular momentum]] makes this into a true statement in the general theory in certain solutions. But because the principle is so vague, many distinct statements can be (and have been) made that would qualify as a '''Mach principle''', and some of these are false. The [[Gödel metric|Gödel rotating universe]] is a solution of the field equations that is designed to disobey Mach's principle in the worst possible way. In this example, the distant stars seem to be revolving faster and faster as one moves further away. This example doesn't completely settle the question, because it has [[closed timelike curve]]s.

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The basic idea also appears before Mach's time, in the writings of [[George Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=G. Berkeley | title=The Principles of Human Knowledge | date=1726}} See paragraphs 111–117, 1710.&lt;/ref&gt; The book  ''Absolute or Relative Motion?'' (1896) by [[Benedict Friedländer]] and his brother Immanuel contained ideas similar to Mach's principle.{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

== Einstein's use of the principle ==
There is a fundamental issue in relativity theory. If all motion is relative, how can we measure the inertia of a body? We must measure the inertia with respect to something else. But what if we imagine a particle completely on its own in the universe? We might hope to still have some notion of its state of motion. Mach's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a particle's state of motion has no meaning in that case.

In Mach's words, the principle is embodied as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Mach, Ernst |title= The Science of Mechanics; a Critical and Historical Account of its Development |location= LaSalle, IL |publisher= Open Court Pub. Co. |date=1960 |lccn= 60010179 }} This is a reprint of the English translation by Thomas H. MCormack (first published in 1906) with a new introduction by [[Karl Menger]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The] investigator must feel the need of... knowledge of the immediate connections, say, of the masses of the universe.There will hover before him as an ideal insight into the principles of the whole matter, from which accelerated and inertial motions will result in the same way.}}

[[Albert Einstein]] seemed to view Mach's principle as something along the lines of:&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;A.

H. Freeman]] |date=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies...}}

In this sense, at least some of Mach's principles are related to philosophical [[holism]]. Mach's suggestion can be taken as the injunction that gravitation theories should be [[relational theory|relational theories]]. Einstein brought the principle into mainstream physics while working on [[general relativity]]. Indeed, it was Einstein who first coined the phrase ''Mach's principle''. There is much debate as to whether Mach really intended to suggest a new physical law since he never states it explicitly.

The writing in which Einstein found inspiration from Mach was "The Science of Mechanics", where the philosopher criticized [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s idea of [[absolute space]], in particular the argument that Newton gave sustaining the existence of an advantaged reference system: what is commonly called "Newton's [[bucket argument]]".

In his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', Newton tried to demonstrate that:

{{quote|one can always decide if one is rotating with respect to the absolute space, measuring the apparent forces that arise only when an absolute rotation is performed. If a bucket is filled with water, and made to rotate, initially the water remains still, but then, gradually, the walls of the vessel communicate their motion to the water, making it curve and climb up the borders of the bucket, because of the centrifugal forces produced by the rotation.This [[thought experiment]] demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space (represented here by the earth's reference frame, or better, the distant stars) instead, when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced, this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space.}}

Mach, in his book, says that:

{{quote|the bucket experiment only demonstrates that when the water is in rotation with respect to the bucket no centrifugal forces are produced, and that we cannot know how the water would behave if in the experiment the bucket's walls were increased in depth and width until they became leagues big. In Mach's idea this concept of absolute motion should be substituted with a total relativism in which every motion, uniform or accelerated, has sense only in reference to other bodies (''i.e.'', one cannot simply say that the water is rotating, but must specify if it's rotating with respect to the vessel or to the earth). In this view, the apparent forces that seem to permit  discrimination between relative and "absolute" motions should only be considered as an effect of the particular asymmetry that there is in our reference system between the bodies which we consider in motion, that are small (like buckets), and the bodies that we believe are still (the earth and distant stars), that are overwhelmingly bigger and heavier than the former.}}

This same thought had been expressed by the philosopher [[George Berkeley]] in his ''[[De Motu (Berkeley's essay)|De Motu]]''. It is then not clear, in the passages from Mach just mentioned, if the philosopher intended to formulate a new kind of physical action between heavy bodies. This physical mechanism should determine the inertia of bodies, in a way that the heavy and distant bodies of our universe should contribute the most to the inertial forces. More likely, Mach only suggested a mere "redescription of motion in space as experiences that do not invoke the term ''space''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) | title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;  What is certain is that Einstein interpreted Mach's passage in the former way, originating a long-lasting debate.

Most physicists believe Mach's principle was never developed into a quantitative physical theory that would explain a mechanism by which the stars can have such an effect. It was never made clear by Mach himself exactly what his principle was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |place=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7|pages=9–57}} (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Einstein was intrigued and inspired by Mach's principle, Einstein's formulation of the principle is not a fundamental assumption of [[general relativity]].

== Mach's principle in general relativity ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
Because intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply, what exactly is meant by "Mach's principle" in general relativity is even less clear than in Newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of Mach's principle are possible, some being considered more strongly Machian than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title=Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location= Boston |publisher=Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=530}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;  A relatively weak formulation is the assertion that the motion of matter in one place should affect which frames are inertial in another.

Einstein, before completing his development of the general theory of relativity, found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of Mach's principle.  We assume a fixed background for conceptual simplicity, construct a large spherical shell of mass, and set it spinning in that background.  The reference frame in the interior of this shell will [[Precession|precess]] with respect to the fixed background.  This effect is known as the [[Lense–Thirring effect]].  Einstein was so satisfied with this manifestation of Mach's principle that he wrote a letter to Mach expressing this:
{{quote|it... turns out that inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies, quite in the sense of your considerations on Newton's pail experiment...  If one rotates [a heavy shell of matter] relative to the fixed stars about an axis going through its center, a [[Coriolis force]] arises in the interior of the shell; that is, the plane of a [[Foucault pendulum]] is dragged around (with a practically unmeasurably small angular velocity).&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt;}}

The Lense–Thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion that "matter there influences inertia here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bondi, Hermann |author2= Samuel, Joseph |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |journal= Physics Letters A |volume=228 |issue=3 |pages=121 |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi= 10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B }}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles" which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  The plane of the pendulum would not be dragged around if the shell of matter were not present, or if it were not spinning.  As for the statement that "inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies", this too could be interpreted as true in the context of the effect.

More fundamental to the problem, however, is the very existence of a fixed background, which Einstein describes as "the fixed stars".  Modern relativists see the imprints of Mach's principle in the initial-value problem.  Essentially, we humans seem to wish to separate [[spacetime]] into slices of constant time.  When we do this, [[Einstein's equations]] can be decomposed into one set of equations, which must be satisfied on each slice, and another set, which describe how to move between slices.  The equations for an individual slice are [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s.  In general, this means that only part of the geometry of the slice can be given by the scientist, while the geometry everywhere else will then be dictated by Einstein's equations on the slice.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}

In the context of an [[asymptotically flat spacetime]], the boundary conditions are given at infinity.  Heuristically, the boundary conditions for an asymptotically flat universe define a frame with respect to which inertia has meaning.  By performing a [[Lorentz transformation]] on the distant universe, of course, this inertia can also be transformed.

A stronger form of Mach's principle applies in [[Wheeler–Mach–Einstein spacetime]]s, which require spacetime to be spatially [[Compact space |compact]] and [[Globally hyperbolic manifold|globally hyperbolic]].  In such universes Mach's principle can be stated as ''the distribution of matter and field energy-momentum (and possibly other information) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial frame at each point in the universe'' (where "a particular moment in the universe" refers to a chosen [[Cauchy surface]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=188–207}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other attempts to formulate a theory that is more fully Machian, such as the [[Brans–Dicke theory]] and the [[Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity]], but most physicists argue that none have been fully successful. At an exit poll of experts, held in Tübingen in 1993, when asked the question "Is general relativity perfectly Machian?", 3 respondents replied "yes", and 22 replied "no".  To the question "Is general relativity with appropriate boundary conditions of closure of some kind very Machian?" the result was 14 "yes" and 7 "no".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn=978-3-7643-3823-7 |page=106}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Einstein was convinced that a valid theory of gravity would necessarily have to include the relativity of inertia:
{{quote|text=So strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in 1918 he stated as being on an equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory theory of gravitation should rest:
# The principle of relativity as expressed by general covariance.
# The principle of equivalence.
# Mach's principle (the first time this term entered the literature): … that the ''g&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;'' are completely determined by the mass of bodies, more generally by ''T&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;''. 
In 1922, Einstein noted that others were satisfied to proceed without this [third] criterion and added, 
"This contentedness will appear incomprehensible to a later generation however."

It must be said that, as far as I can see, to this day, Mach's principle has not brought physics decisively farther. It must also be said that the origin of inertia is and remains the most obscure subject in the theory of particles and fields. Mach's principle may therefore have a future – but not without the quantum theory.

== Variations in the statement of the principle ==
The broad notion that "mass there influences inertia here" has been expressed in several forms.
[[Hermann Bondi]] and Joseph Samuel have listed eleven distinct statements that can be called Mach principles, labelled by ''Mach0'' through ''Mach10''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bondi, Hermann |author2=Samuel, Joseph |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |volume=228 |issue=3 |journal=Physics Letters A |pages=121–126 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B}}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles", which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  Though their list is not necessarily exhaustive, it does give a flavor for the variety possible.

* ''Mach0'': The universe, as represented by the average motion of distant galaxies, does not appear to rotate relative to local inertial frames.
* ''Mach1'': Newton’s [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' is a [[dynamical field]].
* ''Mach2'': An isolated body in otherwise empty space has no inertia.
* ''Mach3'': Local inertial frames are affected by the cosmic motion and distribution of matter.
* ''Mach4'': The universe is spatially closed.
* ''Mach5'': The total energy, angular and linear momentum of the universe are zero.
* ''Mach6'': Inertial mass is affected by the global distribution of matter.
* ''Mach7'': If you take away all matter, there is no more space.
* ''Mach8'': &lt;math&gt;\Omega\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ 4 \pi \rho G T^2&lt;/math&gt; is a definite number, of order unity, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mean density of matter in the universe, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble time]].
* ''Mach9'': The theory contains no absolute elements.
* ''Mach10'': Overall rigid rotations and translations of a system are unobservable.

'''Montage''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɒ|n|ˈ|t|ɑː|ʒ}}) is a technique in [[film editing]] in which a series of short shots are edited into a sequence to condense space, time, and information. The term has been used in various contexts. It was introduced to cinema primarily by [[Sergei Eisenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell|first=David|title=The Cinema of Eisenstein|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0415973651}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early [[USSR|Soviet]] directors used it as a synonym for creative editing. In French the word "montage" applied to cinema simply denotes editing. The term "montage sequence" has been used primarily by British and American studios, and refers to the common technique as outlined in this article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reisz|first=Karel|title=The Technique of Film Editing|year=2010|publisher=Focal Press|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=978-0-240-52185-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The montage sequence is usually used to suggest the passage of time, rather than to create symbolic meaning as it does in [[Soviet montage theory]].

From the 1930s to the 1950s, montage sequences often combined numerous short shots with special optical effects ([[Dissolve (filmmaking)|fades]], [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]], [[split screen (filmmaking)|split screens]], [[multiple exposure|double and triple exposures]]) dance and music. They were usually assembled by someone other than the director or the editor of the movie.
== Development ==
{{quote|The word ''montage'' came to identify…specifically the rapid, shock cutting that Eisenstein employed in his films. Its use survives to this day in the specially created "montage sequences" inserted into Hollywood films to suggest, in a blur of double exposures, the rise to fame of an opera singer or, in brief model shots, the destruction of an airplane, a city or a planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Knight |first=Arthur |year=1957 |title=The Liveliest Art: A Panoramic History of the Movies |location=New York |publisher=Mentor Books |oclc=833176912 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two common montage sequence devices of the period are a newspaper one and a railroad one. In the newspaper one, there are multiple shots of newspapers being printed (multiple layered shots of papers moving between rollers, papers coming off the end of the press, a pressman looking at a paper) and headlines zooming on to the screen telling whatever needs to be told. There are two montages like this in ''[[It Happened One Night]]''. In a typical railroad montage, the shots include engines racing toward the camera, giant engine wheels moving across the screen, and long trains racing past the camera as destination signs zoom into the screen.

"Scroll montage" is a form of multiple-screen montage developed specifically for the moving image in an [[internet browser]]. It plays with Italian theatre director Eugenio Barba's "space river" montage in which the spectators' attention is said to "[sail] on a tide of actions which their gaze [can never] fully encompass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barba |first=Eugenio |year=2009 |title=On Directing and Dramaturgy: Burning the House |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781135225841 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Scroll montage" is usually used in online audio-visual works in which sound and the moving image are separated and can exist autonomously: audio in these works is usually streamed on [[internet radio]] and video is posted on a separate site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mobile Irony Valve|title=Logical Volume Identifier|url=http://www.mobile-irony-valve.net/index.php/lvi/lvi/ |date=May 25, 2014 |publisher=[[KCHUNG Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Noted directors ==
Film critic Ezra Goodman discusses the contributions of [[Slavko Vorkapić]], who worked at [[MGM]] and was the best-known montage specialist of the 1930s:

{{quote|He devised vivid montages for numerous pictures, mainly to get a point across economically or to bridge a time lapse. In a matter of moments, with images cascading across the screen, he was able to show [[Jeanette MacDonald]]'s rise to fame as an opera star in ''[[Maytime (1937 film)|Maytime]]'' (1937), the outbreak of the revolution in ''[[Viva Villa]]'' (1934), the famine and exodus in ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]'' (1937), and the plague in ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1936).&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Ezra. ''Fifty Year Decline and Fall of Hollywood'', Macfadden Books, 1962, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1933 to 1942, [[Don Siegel]], later a noted feature film director, was the head of the montage department at [[Warner Brothers]]. He did montage sequences for hundreds of features, including ''[[Confessions of a Nazi Spy]]''; ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]''; ''[[Blues in the Night]]''; ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]''; ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''; ''[[Action in the North Atlantic]]''; ''[[Gentleman Jim (1942 film)|Gentleman Jim]]''; and ''[[They Drive By Night]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Don Siegel," ''Who the Devil Made It'', [[Peter Bogdanovich]], Alfred A. Knopf, 1997, p. 766. Interview made in 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel told [[Peter Bogdanovich]] how his montages differed from the usual ones:
{{quote|Montages were done then as they're done now, oddly enough—very sloppily. The director casually shoots a few shots that he presumes will be used in the montage and the cutter grabs a few stock shots and walks down with them to the man who's operating the optical printer and tells him to make some sort of mishmash out of it. He does, and that's what's labeled montage.&lt;ref&gt;"Don Siegel," pp. 724–725.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast, Siegel would read the motion picture's script to find out the story and action, then take the script's one line description of the montage and write his own five page script. The directors and the studio bosses left him alone because no one could figure out what he was doing. Left alone with his own crew, he constantly experimented to find out what he could do. He also tried to make the montage match the director's style, dull for a dull director, exciting for an exciting director.

{{quote|Of course, it was a most marvelous way to learn about films, because I made endless mistakes just experimenting with no supervision. The result was that a great many of the montages were enormously effective.&lt;ref&gt;"Don Siegel", pp. 725–726.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Siegel selected the montages he did for ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942), ''[[The Adventures of Mark Twain (1944 film)|The Adventures of Mark Twain]]'' (1944), and ''Confessions of a Nazi Spy'', as especially good ones. "I thought the montages were absolutely extraordinary in 'The Adventures of Mark Twain'—not a particularly good picture, by the way."&lt;ref&gt;"Don Siegel", p. 726.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports training use ==
The sports training montage is a standard explanatory montage. It originated in [[United States|American]] cinema but has since spread to modern martial arts films from [[East Asia]]. Originally depicting a character engaging in physical or sports training, the form has been extended to other activities or themes.

=== Conventions and clichés ===
The standard elements of a sports training montage include a build-up where the potential sports hero confronts his failure to train adequately. The solution is a serious, individual training regimen. The individual is shown engaging in physical training through a series of short, cut sequences. An inspirational song (often fast-paced [[rock music]]) typically provides the only sound. At the end of the montage several weeks have elapsed in the course of just a few minutes and the hero is now prepared for the big competition. One of the best-known examples is the training sequence in the 1976 movie ''[[Rocky]]'', which culminates in Rocky's run up the [[Rocky Steps]] of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_mImQBUMaA| Rocky and the Methods of Montage - Brows Held High]&lt;/ref&gt;

The montage sequence in Rocky IV is clearly the best of all time (according to Louis).

The simplicity of the technique and its over-use in American film [[vocabulary]] has led to its status as a film [[cliché]]. A notable [[parody]] of the sports training montage appears in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode, "[[Asspen]]". When [[Stan Marsh]] must become an expert skier quickly, he begins training in a montage where the inspirational song explicitly spells out the techniques and requirements of a successful sports training montage sequence as they occur on screen. The same song was later used in ''[[Team America: World Police]]'' in a similar sequence.

In "[[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy episode)|Once More, with Feeling]]", an episode of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', [[Buffy Summers]] does an extended workout while [[Rupert Giles]] sings one song; this distortion of time is one of numerous musical conventions made literal by a spell affecting [[Sunnydale]]. Prior to this sequence, Buffy Summers voices her concern that "this whole session is going to turn into some training montage from an '80s movie" to which Rupert Giles replies "Well, if we hear any inspirational [[power chord]]s we'll just lie down until they go away". The original 1992 film of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' includes a very clichéd training montage.

The music in these training montage scenes has garnered a cult following, with such artists as [[Robert Tepper]], [[Stan Bush]] and [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]] appearing on several '80s soundtracks. Songs like [[Frank Stallone]]'s "[[Far from Over (Frank Stallone song)|Far from Over]]," and [[John Farnham]]'s "Break the Ice" are examples of high-energy rock songs that typify the music that appeared during montages in '80s action films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noecho.net/features/80s-action-film-montage-music-never-say-die-its-far-from-over ‘80s Action Film Montage Music: Never Say Die, it’s Far From Over!]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this process appears straightforward to most observers, it has proven to be a difficult problem from a computational perspective, and extraordinarily difficult to explain in terms of [[neural]] processing.

Motion perception is studied by many disciplines, including [[psychology]] (i.e. [[visual perception]]), [[neurology]], [[neurophysiology]], [[engineering]], and [[computer science]].

==Neuropsychology==
The inability to perceive motion is called [[akinetopsia]] and it may be caused by a lesion to [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] area [[Visual cortex#V5/MT|V5]] in the [[extrastriate cortex]]. [[Neuropsychology|Neuropsychological]] studies of a patient who could not see motion, seeing the world in a series of static "frames" instead, suggested that visual area V5 in humans is homologous to motion processing area MT in primates.&lt;ref name=Hess1989&gt;{{cite journal |title=The "motion-blind" patient: low-level spatial and temporal filters |author=Hess, Baker, Zihl |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |year=1989 |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=1628–1640 |pmid=2723744}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker1991&gt;{{cite journal |title=Residual motion perception in a "motion-blind" patient, assessed with limited-lifetime random dot stimuli |author=Baker, Hess, Zihl |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |year=1991 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=454–461 |pmid=1992012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First-order motion perception ==
[[Image:Phi phenomenom no watermark.gif|right|thumb|225px|Example of [[Beta movement]], often confused with [[phi phenomenon]], in which a succession of still images gives the illusion of a moving ball.&lt;ref name="PhiIsNotBeta"&gt;Steinman, Pizlo &amp; Pizlo (2000) [http://www.psych.purdue.edu/Magniphi/PhiIsNotBeta/phi1.html Phi is not Beta] slideshow based on ARVO presentation.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Two or more stimuli that are switched on and off in alternation can produce two different motion percepts. The first, demonstrated in the figure to the right is "[[Beta movement]]", often used in billboard displays, in which an object is perceived as moving when, in fact, a series of stationary images is being presented. This is also termed "[[Illusory motion|apparent motion]]" and is the basis of movies and television. However, at faster alternation rates, and if the distance between the stimuli is just right, an illusory "object" the same colour as the background is seen moving between the two stimuli and alternately occluding them. This is called the [[phi phenomenon]] and is sometimes described as an example of "pure" motion detection uncontaminated, as in Beta movement, by form cues.&lt;ref name="PhiIsNotBeta"/&gt; This description is, however, somewhat paradoxical as it is not possible to create such motion in the absence of figural percepts. 

The phi phenomenon has been referred to as "first-order" motion perception. Werner E. Reichardt and Bernard Hassenstein have modelled it in terms of relatively simple "motion sensors" in the visual system, that have evolved to detect a change in luminance at one point on the retina and correlate it with a change in luminance at a neighbouring point on the retina after a short delay. Sensors that are proposed to work this way have been referred to as either ''Hassenstein-Reichardt detectors'' after the scientists [[Bernhard Hassenstein]] and [[Werner E. Reichardt|Werner Reichardt]], who first modelled them,&lt;ref name="Reichardt1961"&gt;{{cite book |author=Reichardt, W. |year= 1961 |chapter=Autocorrelation, a principle for the evaluation of sensory information by the central nervous system |editor=W.A. Rosenblith |title=Sensory Communication |pages=303–317 |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; motion-energy sensors,&lt;ref name="AdelsonBergen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adelson, E.H. |author2=Bergen, J.R. |year=1985 |title=Spatiotemporal energy models for the perception of motion |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A |pmid=3973762 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=284–299 |doi=10.1364/JOSAA.2.000284|bibcode=1985JOSAA...2..284A |citeseerx=10.1.1.148.4141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Elaborated Reichardt Detectors.&lt;ref name="VanSantenSperling"&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Santen, J.P. |author2=Sperling, G. |year=1985 |title=Elaborated Reichardt detectors |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A  |pmid=3973763 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=300–321 |doi=10.1364/JOSAA.2.000300|bibcode=1985JOSAA...2..300S }}&lt;/ref&gt; These sensors are described as detecting motion by spatio-temporal [[correlation]] and are considered by some to be plausible models for how the visual system may detect motion. (Although, again, the notion of a "pure motion" detector suffers from the problem that there is no "pure motion" stimulus, i.e. a stimulus lacking perceived figure/ground properties). There is still considerable debate regarding the accuracy of the model and exact nature of this proposed process. It is not clear how the model distinguishes between movements of the eyes and movements of objects in the visual field, both of which produce changes in luminance on points on the retina.

==Second-order motion perception==
''[[Second-order stimulus|Second-order]]'' motion has been defined as motion in which the moving contour is defined by [[contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], flicker or some other quality that does not result in an increase in luminance or motion energy in the [[Fourier transform|Fourier spectrum]] of the stimulus.&lt;ref name="CavanaghMather"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cavanagh, P  |author2=Mather, G  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1989 |title=Motion: the long and short of it |journal=Spatial Vision |volume=4 |pages=103–129 |doi=10.1163/156856889X00077 |pmid=2487159 |issue=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChubbSperling"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chubb, C  |author2=Sperling, G  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1988 |title=Drift-balanced random stimuli: A general basis for studying non-Fourier motion perception |journal=J.

(The notion that neural responses are attuned to frequency components of stimulation suffers from the lack of a functional rationale and has been generally criticized by G. Westheimer (2001) in an article called "The Fourier Theory of Vision.") Second-order motion produces a weaker [[motion aftereffect]] unless tested with dynamically flickering stimuli.&lt;ref name="LedgewaySmith"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ledgeway, T.  |author2=Smith, A.T.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1994 |title=The duration of the motion aftereffect following adaptation to first- and second-order motion |journal=Perception |volume=23 |pages=1211–1219 |doi=10.1068/p231211 |pmid=7899037 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The aperture problem==
&lt;!--[[Aperture problem]] redirects here.--&gt;
[[Image:aperture problem animated.gif|thumb|275px|The aperture problem. The [[grating]] appears to be moving down and to the right, [[perpendicular]] to the orientation of the bars. But it could be moving in many other directions, such as only down, or only to the right. It is impossible to determine unless the ends of the bars become visible in the aperture.]]
The motion direction of a contour is ambiguous, because the motion component parallel to the line cannot be inferred based on the visual input. This means that a variety of contours of different orientations moving at different speeds can cause identical responses in a motion sensitive neuron in the visual system.

==Motion integration==
Some have speculated that, having extracted the hypothesized motion signals (first- or second-order) from the retinal image, the visual system must integrate those individual ''local'' motion signals at various parts of the visual field into a 2-dimensional or ''global'' representation of moving objects and surfaces. (It is not clear how this 2D representation is then converted into the perceived 3D percept) Further processing is required to detect coherent motion or "global motion" present in a scene.&lt;ref name="BurrSantoro2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burr|first1=David C|last2=Santoro|first2=Loredana|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698901000724|title=Temporal integration of optic flow, measured by contrast and coherence thresholds|journal=Vision Research|volume=41|issue=15|year=2001|pages=1891–1899|issn=0042-6989|doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(01)00072-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of a subject to detect coherent motion is commonly tested using motion coherence discrimination tasks. For these tasks, dynamic random-dot patterns (also called ''random dot kinematograms'') are used that consist in 'signal' dots moving in one direction and 'noise' dots moving in random directions. The sensitivity to motion coherence is assessed by measuring the ratio of 'signal' to 'noise' dots required to determine the coherent motion direction. The required ratio is called the ''motion coherence threshold''.

==Motion in depth==
{{Main|Monocular depth cues|Structure from motion|Stereoscopic motion}}
As in other aspects of vision, the observer's visual input is generally insufficient to determine the true nature of stimulus sources, in this case their velocity in the real world. In monocular vision for example, the visual input will be a 2D projection of a 3D scene. The motion cues present in the 2D projection will by default be insufficient to reconstruct the motion present in the 3D scene. Put differently, many 3D scenes will be compatible with a single 2D projection. The problem of motion estimation generalizes to [[binocular vision]] when we consider occlusion or motion perception at relatively large distances, where binocular disparity is a poor cue to depth. This fundamental difficulty is referred to as the [[inverse problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maloney|first1=Laurence T.|last2=Lages|first2=Martin|last3=Heron|first3=Suzanne|title=On the Inverse Problem of Binocular 3D Motion Perception|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|volume=6|issue=11|year=2010|pages=e1000999|issn=1553-7358|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000999|pmid=21124957|pmc=2987932|bibcode=2010PLSCB...6E0999L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, some humans do perceive motion in depth. There are indications that the brain uses various cues, in particular temporal changes in disparity as well as monocular velocity ratios, for producing a sensation of motion in depth.&lt;ref name="BlakeWilson2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blake|first1=Randolph|last2=Wilson|first2=Hugh|title=Binocular vision|journal=Vision Research|volume=51|issue=7|year=2011|pages=754–770|issn=0042-6989|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2010.10.009|pmid=20951722|pmc=3050089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Perceptual learning]] of motion==
Detection and discrimination of motion can be improved by training with long-term results. Participants trained to detect the movements of dots on a screen in only one direction become particularly good at detecting small movements in the directions around that in which they have been trained. This improvement was still present 10 weeks later. However [[perceptual learning]] is highly specific. For example, the participants show no improvement when tested around other motion directions, or for other sorts of stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ball | first1 = K. | last2 = Sekuler | first2 = R. | year = 1982 | title = A specific and enduring improvement in visual motion discrimination | url = | journal = Science | volume = 219 | issue = | pages = 697–698 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive map==
A [[cognitive map]] is a type of mental representation which serves an individual to acquire, code, store, recall, and decode information about the relative locations and attributes of phenomena in their spatial environment.

Many species of mammals can keep track of spatial location even in the absence of visual, auditory, olfactory, or tactile cues, by integrating their movements—the ability to do this is referred to in the literature as [[path integration]]. A number of theoretical models have explored mechanisms by which path integration could be performed by [[artificial neural network|neural network]]s. In most models, such as those of Samsonovich and McNaughton (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Neurophysiology==
Motion sensing using vision is crucial for detecting a potential mate, prey, or predator, and thus it is found both in vertebrates and invertebrates vision throughout a wide variety of species, although it is not universally found in all species. In vertebrates, the process takes place in retina and more specifically in [[retinal ganglion cells]], which are neurons that receive input from [[bipolar cells]] and [[amacrine cells]] on visual information and process output to higher regions of the brain including, thalamus, hypothalamus, and mesencephalon.

The study of directionally selective units began with a discovery of such cells in the cerebral cortex of cats by [[David Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]] in 1959. Following the initial report, an attempt to understand the mechanism of directionally selective cells was pursued by [[Horace B. Barlow]] and [[William R. Levick]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=barlev&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barlow, H. B., &amp; Levick, W. R.|year=1965|title=The mechanism of directionally selective units in rabbit's retina|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=178|issue=3|pages=477–504|pmc=1357309|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1965.sp007638|pmid=5827909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their in-depth experiments in rabbit's retina expanded the anatomical and physiological understanding of the vertebrate visual system and ignited the interest in the field. Numerous studies that followed thereafter have unveiled the mechanism of motion sensing in vision for the most part. [[Alexander Borst]] and [[Thomas Euler]]'s 2011 review paper, "Seeing Things in Motion: Models, Circuits and Mechanisms".&lt;ref name=boreul&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Borst, Alexander |author2=Thomas Euler|title=Seeing Things in Motion: Models, Circuits, and Mechanisms|journal=Neuron|volume=71.6|issue=6|year=2011|pages=974–994|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2011.08.031|pmid=21943597}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses certain important findings from the early discoveries to the recent work on the subject, coming to the conclusion of the current status of the knowledge.

===Direction selective (DS) cells===
Direction selective (DS) cells in the retina are defined as neurons that respond differentially to the direction of a visual stimulus. According to Barlow and Levick (1965), the term is used to describe a group of neurons that "gives a vigorous discharge of impulses when a stimulus object is moved through its receptive field in one direction."&lt;ref name=barlev/&gt; This direction in which a set of neurons respond most strongly to is their "preferred direction". In contrast, they do not respond at all to the opposite direction, "null direction". The preferred direction is not dependent on the stimulus—that is, regardless of the stimulus' size, shape, or color, the neurons respond when it is moving in their preferred direction, and do not respond if it is moving in the null direction. There are three known types of DS cells in the vertebrate retina of the mouse, ON/OFF DS ganglion cells, ON DS ganglion cells, and OFF DS ganglion cells. Each has a distinctive physiology and anatomy.

====ON/OFF DS ganglion cells====
ON/OFF DS ganglion cells act as local motion detectors. They fire at the onset and offset of a stimulus (a light source). If a stimulus is moving in the direction of the cell's preference, it will fire at the leading and the trailing edge. Their firing pattern is time-dependent and is supported by the [[Werner E. Reichardt|Reichardt]]-[[Bernhard Hassenstein|Hassenstain]] model, which detects spatiotemporal correlation between the two adjacent points. The detailed explanation of the Reichardt-Hassenstain model will be provided later in the section. 
The anatomy of ON/OFF cells is such that the dendrites extend to two sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer and make synapses with bipolar and amacrine cells. They have four subtypes, each with own preference for direction.

====ON DS ganglion cells====
Unlike ON/OFF DS ganglion cells that respond both to the leading and the trailing edge of a stimulus, ON DS ganglion cells are responsive only to a leading edge. The dendrites of ON DS ganglion cells are monostratified and extend into the inner sublamina of the inner plexiform layer. They have three subtypes with different directional preferences.

====OFF DS ganglion cells====
OFF DS ganglion cells act as a centripetal motion detector, and they respond only to the trailing edge of a stimulus. They are tuned to upward motion of a stimulus. The dendrites are asymmetrical and arbor in to the direction of their preference.&lt;ref name=boreul/&gt;

===DS cells in insects===
The first DS cells in invertebrates were found in [[flies]] in a brain structure called the [[lobula plate]]. The lobula plate is one of the three stacks of the [[neuropils]] in the fly's [[optic lobe (arthropods)|optic lobe]]. The "[[tangential cell]]s" of the [[lobula plate]] composed of roughly about 50 neurons, and they arborize extensively in the neuropile.  The tangential cells are known to be directionally selective with distinctive directional preference. One of which is Horizontally Sensitive (HS) cells, such as the [[H1 neuron]], that depolarize most strongly in response to stimulus moving in a horizontal direction (preferred direction). On the other hand, they hyperpolarize when the direction of motion is opposite (null direction). Vertically Sensitive (VS) cells are another group of cells that are most sensitive to vertical motion. They depolarize when a stimulus is moving downward and hyperpolarize when it is moving upward. Both HS and VS cells respond with a fixed preferred direction and a null direction regardless of the color or contrast of the background or the stimulus.

===The Reichardt-Hassenstein model===
[[File:Reichardt model.jpg|thumb|Reichardt model]]
It is now known that motion detection in vision is based on the Hassenstein-Reichardt detector model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassenstein|first=B.|last2=Reichardt|first2=W.|date=1956-10-01|title=Systemtheoretische Analyse der Zeit-, Reihenfolgen- und Vorzeichenauswertung bei der Bewegungsperzeption des Rüsselkäfers Chlorophanus|journal=Zeitschrift für Naturforschung B|volume=11|issue=9–10|pages=513–524|doi=10.1515/znb-1956-9-1004|issn=1865-7117}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is a model used to detect correlation between the two adjacent points. It consists of two symmetrical subunits. Both subunits have a receptor that can be stimulated by an input (light in the case of visual system). In each subunit, when an input is received, a signal is sent to the other subunit. At the same time, the signal is delayed in time within the subunit, and after the temporal filter, is then multiplied by the signal received from the other subunit. Thus, within each subunit, the two brightness values, one received directly from its receptor with a time delay and the other received from the adjacent receptor, are multiplied. The multiplied values from the two subunits are then subtracted to produce an output.  The direction of selectivity or preferred direction is determined by whether the difference is positive or negative. The direction which produces a positive outcome is the preferred direction.

In order to confirm that the Reichardt-Hassenstain model accurately describes the directional selectivity in the retina, the study was conducted using optical recordings of free cytosolic calcium levels after loading a fluorescent indicator dye into the fly tangential cells. The fly was presented uniformly moving gratings while the calcium concentration in the dendritic tips of the tangential cells was measured. The tangential cells showed modulations that matched the temporal frequency of the gratings, and the velocity of the moving gratings at which the neurons respond most strongly showed a close dependency on the pattern wavelength. This confirmed the accuracy of the model both at the cellular and the behavioral level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haag J | year = 2004 | title = Fly Motion Vision Is Based on Reichardt Detectors Regardless of the Signal-to-noise Ratio | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 101 | issue = 46| pages = 16333–6338 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0407368101| pmid = 15534201 | pmc = 526200| bibcode = 2004PNAS..10116333H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the details of the Hassenstein-Reichardt model have not been confirmed at an anatomical and physiological level, the site of subtraction in the model is now being localized to the tangential cells. When depolarizing current is injected into the tangential cell while presenting a visual stimulus, the response to the preferred direction of motion decreased, and the response to the null direction increased. The opposite was observed with hyperpolarizing current. The T4 and T5 cells, which have been selected as a strong candidate for providing input to the tangential cells, have four subtypes that each project into one of the four strata of the lobula plate that differ in the preferred orientation.&lt;ref name=boreul/&gt;

===DS cells in vertebrates===
One of the early works on DS cells in vertebrates was done on the rabbit retina by H. Barlow and W. Levick in 1965. Their experimental methods include variations to the slit-experiments and recording of the action potentials in the rabbit retina. The basic set-up of the slit experiment was they presented a moving black-white grating through a slit of various widths to a rabbit and recorded the action potentials in the retina. This early study had a large impact on the study of DS cells by laying down the foundation for later studies. The study showed that DS ganglion cells derive their property from the basis of sequence-discriminating activity of subunits, and that this activity may be the result of inhibitory mechanism in response to the motion of image in the null direction. It also showed that the DS property of retinal ganglion cells is distributed over the entire receptive field, and not limited to specific zones. Direction selectivity is contained for two adjacent points in the receptive field separated by as small as 1/4°, but selectivity decreased with larger separations. They used this to support their hypothesis that discrimination of sequences gives rise to direction selectivity because normal movement would activate adjacent points in a succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barlow H., Levick W. R. | year = 1965 | title = The Mechanism of Directionally Selective Units in Rabbit's Retina | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 178 | issue = 3| pages = 477–504 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1965.sp007638 | pmid=5827909 | pmc=1357309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular identity and structure of DS cells in mice===
ON/OFF DS ganglion cells can be divided into 4 subtypes differing in their directional preference, ventral, dorsal, nasal, or temporal. The cells of different subtypes also differ in their dendritic structure and synaptic targets in the brain. The neurons that were identified to prefer ventral motion were also found to have dendritic projections in the ventral direction. Also, the neurons that prefer nasal motion had asymmetric dendritic extensions in the nasal direction. Thus, a strong association between the structural and functional asymmetry in ventral and nasal direction was observed. With a distinct property and preference for each subtype, there was an expectation that they could be selectively labeled by molecular markers. The neurons that were preferentially responsive to vertical motion were indeed shown to be selectively expressed by a specific molecular marker.

===Neural mechanism: starburst amacrine cells===
The direction selective (DS) ganglion cells receive inputs from bipolar cells and starburst amacrine cells. The DS ganglion cells respond to their preferred direction with a large excitatory postsynaptic potential followed by a small inhibitory response. On the other hand, they respond to their null direction with a simultaneous small excitatory postsynaptic potential and a large inhibitory postsynaptic potential. Starburst amacrine cells have been viewed as a strong candidate for direction selectivity in ganglion cells because they can release both GABA and Ach. Their dendrites branch out radiantly from a soma, and there is a significant dendritic overlap. Optical measurements of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration showed that they respond strongly to the centrifugal motion (the outward motion from the soma to the dendrites), while they don't respond well to the centripetal motion (the inward motion from the dendritic tips to the soma).
When the starburst cells were ablated with toxins, direction selectivity was eliminated. Moreover, their release of neurotransmitters itself, specifically calcium ions, reflect direction selectivity, which may be presumably attributed to the synaptic pattern. The branching pattern is organized such that certain presynaptic input will have more influence on a given dendrite than others, creating a polarity in excitation and inhibition. Further evidence suggests that starburst cells release inhibitory neurotransmitters, GABA onto each other in a delayed and prolonged manner. This accounts for the temporal property of inhibition.&lt;ref name=boreul/&gt;

In addition to spatial offset due to GABAergic synapses, the important role of chloride transporters has started to be discussed. The popular hypothesis is that starburst amacrine cells differentially express chloride transporters along the dendrites. Given this assumption, some areas along the dendrite will have a positive chloride-ion equilibrium potential relative to the resting potential while others have a negative equilibrium potential. This means that GABA at one area will be depolarizing and at another area hyperpolarizing, accounting for the spatial offset present between excitation and inhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Demb Jonathan B | year = 2007 | title = Cellular mechanisms for direction selectivity in the retina | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 179–186 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.07.001| pmid = 17640521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research (published March 2011) relying on [[Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy|serial block-face electron microscopy]] (SBEM) has led to identification of the circuitry that influences directional selectivity. This new technique provides detailed images of calcium flow and anatomy of dendrites of both [[starburst amacrine cell|starburst amacrine]] (SAC) and DS ganglion cells. By comparing the preferred directions of ganglion cells with their synapses on SAC's, Briggman et al. provide evidence for a mechanism primarily based on inhibitory signals from SAC's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Briggman Kevin L., Helmstaedter Moritz, Denk Winfried | year = 2011 | title = Wiring specificity in the direction-selectivity circuit of the retina | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 471 | issue = 7337| pages = 183–188 | doi=10.1038/nature09818| pmid = 21390125 | bibcode = 2011Natur.471..183B}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an oversampled serial block-face scanning electron microscopy study of one sampled retina,  that retinal ganglion cells may receive asymmetrical inhibitory inputs directly from starburst amacrine cells, and therefore computation of directional selectivity also occurs postsynaptically.  Such postsynaptic models are unparsimonious, and so if  any given starburst amacrine cells conveys motion information to retinal ganglion cells then any computing of 'local' direction selectivity postsynaptically by retinal ganglion cells  is  redundant and dysfunctional. An [[acetylcholine]] (ACh) transmission model of directionally selective starburst amacrine cells provides a robust topological underpinning of a motion sensing in the retina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poznanski R.R. | year = 2010 | title = Cellular Inhibitory Behavior Underlying the Formation of Retinal Direction Selectivity | url = | journal = J.

{{mythology}}
In [[structuralism]]-influenced studies of [[mythology]], a '''mytheme''' is a fundamental generic unit of narrative structure (typically involving a relationship between a character, an event, and a theme) from which myths are thought to be constructed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mytheme|title=mytheme - Definition of mytheme in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Similarly, in [[memetics]]  a [[meme]] is the smallest memetic unit that has [[semantics|semantic]] [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and in a language or dialect, a [[phoneme]] (from the {{lang-el|φώνημα}}, ''phōnēma'', "a sound uttered") is the smallest [[segment (linguistics)|segmental]] unit of sound employed to form meaningful contrasts between utterances.&lt;/ref&gt;—a minimal unit that is always found shared with other, related mythemes{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} and reassembled in various ways ("bundled")&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss: "the true constituent units of a myth are not the isolated relations but bundles of such relations" (Lévi-Strauss 1963:211).&lt;/ref&gt; or linked in more complicated relationships. For example, the myths of [[Adonis]] and [[Osiris]] share several elements, leading some scholars to conclude that they share a source, i.e. images passed down in cultures or from one to another, being ascribed new interpretations of the action depicted, as well as new names in various readings of [[symbol|icon]]s.

==Overview==
[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] (1908–2009), who gave the term wide circulation,&lt;ref&gt;First described, as a "gross constituent unit", in {{cite journal
 | first = Claude | last = Lévi-Strauss | authorlink = Claude Lévi-Strauss

}} reprinted as "The structural study of myth", ''Structural Anthropology'', 1963:206-31; the term ''mytheme'' first appears in Lévi-Strauss' 1958 French version of the work.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote, "If one wants to establish a parallel between [[structural linguistics]] and the structural analysis of myths, the correspondence is established, not between mytheme and word but between mytheme and [[phoneme]]."&lt;ref&gt;
Lévi-Strauss, ''La poetière jalouse'', Paris, 1985 (''The Jealous Potter'', Chicago, 1988) pp 144-46.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[structuralism|structuralist]] analyzer of [[Folklore|folk tale]]s, [[Vladimir Propp]], treated the individual tale as the unit of analysis. The unitary mytheme, by contrast, is the equivalent in myth of the [[phoneme]]s, [[morpheme]]s, and [[sememe]]s into which [[Linguistics|structural linguistics]] divides language, the smallest possible units of sound, structure, and meaning (respectively) within a language [[system]].

In the 1950s Claude Lévi-Strauss first adapted this technique of language analysis to analytic myth criticism. In his work on the myth systems of primitive tribes, working from the analogy of [[language structure]], he adopted the French term ''mythème'', with the assertion that the system of meaning within mythic utterances parallels closely that of a language system. [[Roman Jakobson]] varies this idea, treating mythemes as [[concept]]s or phonemes which have no significance in themselves but whose significance might be shown by [[sociology|sociological]] analysis.

Philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]] have also used the term "mytheme".

[[Lev Manovich]] uses the terms ''seme'' and ''mytheme'' in his book, ''The Language of New Media'', to describe aspects of culture that computer images enter into dialog with.

'''Nazi plunder''' refers to [[art theft]] and other items stolen as a result of the [[Art theft and looting during World War II|organized looting of European countries]] during the time of the [[Third Reich]] by agents acting on behalf of the ruling [[Nazi Party]] of [[Germany]]. Plundering occurred from 1933 until the end of [[World War II]], particularly by military units known as the [[Kunstschutz]], although most plunder was acquired during the war. In addition to [[gold]], [[silver]] and currency, cultural items of great significance were stolen, including paintings, ceramics, books, and religious treasures. Although most of these items were recovered by agents of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] (MFAA, also known as the Monuments Men), on behalf of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] immediately following the war, many are still missing. There is an international effort underway to identify Nazi plunder that still remains unaccounted for, with the aim of ultimately returning the items to the rightful owners, their families or their respective countries.

[[Adolf Hitler]] was an unsuccessful artist who was denied admission to the [[Vienna Academy of Fine Arts]]. Nonetheless, he thought of himself as a connoisseur of the arts, and in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' he ferociously attacked modern art as degenerate, including [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]], and [[Dadaism]], all of which he considered the product of a decadent twentieth century society. In 1933 when Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]], he enforced his aesthetic ideal on the nation. The types of art that were favored amongst the Nazi party were classical portraits and landscapes by [[Old Masters]], particularly those of Germanic origin. Modern art that did not match this was dubbed [[degenerate art]] by the Third Reich, and all that was found in Germany's state museums was to be sold or destroyed.&lt;ref name="BJParis"/&gt; With the sums raised, the Führer's objective was to establish the European Art Museum in [[Linz]]. Other Nazi dignitaries, like [[Reichsmarschall]] [[Hermann Göring]] and Foreign Affairs minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|von Ribbentrop]], were also intent on taking advantage of German military conquests to increase their private art collections.&lt;ref name="BJParis"/&gt;

==Sale of art confiscated from German museums==
Art dealers [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Moeller and Bernhard Boehmer set up shop in Schloss Niederschonhausen, just outside Berlin, to sell a cache of near-16,000 paintings and sculptures which Hitler and Göring removed from the walls of German museums in 1937-38. They were first put on display in the [[Haus der Kunst]] in Munich on 19 July 1937, with the Nazi leaders inviting public mockery by two million visitors who came to view the condemned modern art in the ''[[Degenerate art]]'' exhibition. Propagandist [[Joseph Goebbels]] in a radio broadcast called Germany's degenerate artists "garbage". Hitler opened the Haus der Kunst exhibition with a speech. In it he described German art as suffering "a great and fatal illness".

==Public burning of art==
[[Hildebrand Gurlitt]] and his colleagues did not have much success with their sales, mainly because art labelled "rubbish" had small appeal. So on 20 March 1939 they set fire to 1,004 paintings and sculptures and 3,825 [[watercolours]], [[drawings]] and [[printmaking|prints]] in the courtyard of the Berlin Fire Department, an act of infamy similar to their earlier well-known [[book burning]]s. The propaganda act raised the attention they hoped. The Basel Museum in Switzerland arrived with 50,000 Swiss francs to spend.  Shocked art lovers came to buy. What is unknown after these sales is how many paintings were kept by Gurlitt, Buchholz, Moeller and Boehmer and sold by them to Switzerland and America - ships crossed the Atlantic from Lisbon - for personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24812078|title=BBC News - The unfinished art business of World War Two|work=BBC News|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Auctions and Private Sales in Switzerland ==
The most infamous auction of Nazi looted art was the "degenerate art' auction organized by [[Theodor Fischer (auctioneer)]] in Lucerne, Switzerland, 30 June 1939 at the Grand Hotel National. The artworks on offer had been "de-accessioned" from German museums by the Nazis, yet many well known art dealers participated as well as proxies for major collectors and museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2011/11/17/momas-problematic-provenances/|title=MoMA's Problematic Provenances|last=Cohan|first=William|date=November 17, 2011|website=Artnews|access-date=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public auctions were only the visible tip of the iceberg, as many sales operated by art dealers were private. The Commission for Art Recovery has characterized Switzerland as "a magnet" for assets from the rise of Hitler until the end of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.commartrecovery.org/cases/switzerland|title=Switzerland, Neutral Haven and a Willing Wartime Art Market|last=Commission for Art Recovery|first=|date=|website=Commission for Art Recovery|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researching and documenting Switzerland's role "as an art-dealing centre and conduit for cultural assets in the Nazi period and in the immediate post-war period" was one of the missions of the Bergier Commission, under the directorship of Professor Georg Kreis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lootedart.com/MFEU4O92059|title=Bergier Commission: Independent Commission of Experts Switzerland, Second World War (ICE)1996 - 2001|last=Commission for Looted Art in Europe|first=|date=|website=LootedArt.com|access-date=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

==Nazi looting organizations==
[[File:Stempel einsatzstab rr.png|thumb|{{largethumb}}|Seal of the "[[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]]", used from 1941 to 1944 to mark seized documents by the German occupation troops]]

While the Nazis were in power, they plundered cultural property from every territory they occupied. This was conducted in a systematic manner with organizations specifically created to determine which public and private collections were most valuable to the Nazi Regime. Some of the objects were earmarked for Hitler's never realized [[Führermuseum]], some objects went to other high-ranking officials such as [[Hermann Göring]], while other objects were traded to fund Nazi activities.

In 1940, an organization known as the ''[[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Institute for the Occupied Territories|Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg für die Besetzten Gebiete]]'' (The [[Reichsleiter]] Rosenberg Institute for the Occupied Territories), or ERR, was formed, headed for [[Alfred Rosenberg]] by [[:de:Gerhard Utikal|Gerhard Utikal]]. The first operating unit, the western branch for France, Belgium and the Netherlands, called the ''Dienststelle Westen'' (Western Agency), was located in Paris. The chief of this Dienststelle was [[:de:Kurt von Behr|Kurt von Behr]]. Its original purpose was to collect [[Jew]]ish and [[Freemasons|Freemasonic]] books and documents, either for destruction, or for removal to Germany for further "study". However, late in 1940, [[Hermann Göring]], who in fact controlled the ERR, issued an order that effectively changed the mission of the ERR, mandating it to seize "Jewish" art collections and other objects. The [[war loot]] had to be collected in a central place in Paris, the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Museum Jeu de Paume]]. At this collection point worked [[art historian]]s and other personnel who inventoried the loot before sending it to Germany. Göring also commanded that the loot would first be divided between Hitler and himself. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] later ordered that all confiscated works of art were to be made directly available to him. From the end of 1940 to the end of 1942 Göring traveled twenty times to Paris. In the Museum Jeu de Paume, art dealer [[Bruno Lohse]] staged 20 expositions of the newly looted art objects, especially for Göring, from which Göring selected at least 594 pieces for his own collection.&lt;ref name="petropoulos"/&gt; Göring made Lohse his liaison-officer and installed him in the ERR in March 1941 as the deputy leader of this unit. Items which Hitler and Göring did not want were made available to other Nazi leaders. Under Rosenberg and Göring's leadership, the ERR seized 21,903 art objects from German-occupied countries.&lt;ref name="essentials"/&gt;

Other Nazi looting organizations included the [[:de:Sonderauftrag Linz|Sonderauftrag Linz]], the organization run by the art historian [[Hans Posse]], which was particularly in charge of assembling the works for the [[Führermuseum]], the Dienststelle Mühlmann, operated by [[Kajetan Mühlmann]], which Göring also controlled{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} and operated primarily in the Netherlands, Belgium, and a Sonderkommando Kuensberg connected to the minister of foreign affairs [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], which operated first in France, then in Russia and North Africa. In Western Europe, with the advancing German troops, were elements of the 'von Ribbentrop Battalion', named after [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]. These men were responsible for entering private and institutional libraries in the occupied countries and removing any materials of interest to the Germans, especially items of scientific, technical or other informational value.&lt;ref name="dtic"/&gt;

Art collections from prominent Jewish families, including the [[Rothschilds]], the Rosenbergs, the Wildensteins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/datenbank/goering/dhm_goering.php?seite=6&amp;is_fulltext=true&amp;fulltext=wildenstein&amp;suchen=Schnellsuche&amp;modus=rechts|title=DHM - Kunstsammlung Hermann Göring|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Schloss Family were the targets of confiscations because of their significant value. Also Jewish art dealers sold art to German organizations - often under duress, e.g. the art dealerships of [[Jacques Goudstikker]], Benjamin and Nathan Katz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/en/summary_rc_190b.html|title=Summary RC 1.90B|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kurt Walter Bachstitz]]. Also non-Jewish art dealers sold art to the Germans, e.g. the art dealers De Boer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/datenbank/ccp/dhm_ccp.php?seite=6&amp;is_fulltext=true&amp;fulltext=de+boer&amp;suchen=Quick+search&amp;modus=folge|title=DHM: Datenbank zum Central Collecting Point München|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hoogendijk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/datenbank/ccp/dhm_ccp.php?seite=6&amp;is_fulltext=true&amp;fulltext=hoogendijk&amp;suchen=Schnellsuche&amp;modus=folge|title=DHM: Datenbank zum Central Collecting Point München|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Netherlands.

By the end of the war, the Third Reich amassed hundreds of thousands of cultural objects.

==Art Looting Investigation Unit==
On November 21, 1944, at the request of [[Owen Roberts]], [[William J. Donovan]] created the Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) within the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] to collect information on the looting, confiscation and transfer of cultural objects by [[Nazi Germany]], its allies and the various individuals and organizations involved; to prosecute war criminals and to restitute property.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DFS|title=The OSS and the Search for Looted Art|url=http://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumer/holocaust/history_art_looting_restitution/allies_oss.htm|website=New York State Department of Financial Services|publisher=New York State DFS|accessdate=10 May 2017|ref=http://www.dfs.ny.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALIU compiled information on individuals believed to have participated in art looting, identifying a group of key suspects for capture and interrogation about their roles in carrying out Nazi policy. Interviews were conducted in Bad Aussee, Austria.

===Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) Reports 1945-1946 and ALIU Red Flag Names List and Index===

Consolidated Interrogations Reports (CIRs), and a "Red Flag list" of people involved in Nazi spoilation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The ALIU Reports form one of the key records in the US Government Archives of Nazi Era Assets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Series Descriptions|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/art/key-series-descriptions|website=www.archives.gov|publisher=US Government Office of Strategic Services|accessdate=20 May 2017|ref=https://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/art/key-series-descriptions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Detailed Intelligence Reports (DIR)'''
The first group of reports detailing the networks and relations between  art dealers and other agents employed by Hitler, Göring and Rosenberg are organized by name: [[Heinrich Hoffmann (photographer)|Heinrich Hoffmann]], [[Ernst Buchner (curator)|Ernst Buchner]], [[Gustav Rochlitz]], Gunter Schiedlausky, [[Bruno Lohse]], Gisela Limberger, [[Walter Hofer|Walter Andreas Hofer]], Karl Kress, Walter Bornheim, Hermann Voss and [[Karl Haberstock]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

'''Consolidated Interrogation Reports (CIR)'''
A second set of reports detail the art looting activities of Göring (The Goering Collection), the art looting activities of the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR), and Hitler's Linz Museum.

'''ALIU List of Red Flag Names'''

The Art Looting Intelligence Unit published a list of "Red Flag Names", organizing them by country: Germany, France, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, and Luxembourg. Each name is followed by a description of the person's activities, their relations with other people in the spoliation network and, in many cases, information concerning their arrest or imprisonment by Allied forces.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Soviet Union==
To investigate and estimate Nazi plunder in the [[USSR]] during 1941 through 1945, the [[Extraordinary State Commission|Soviet State Extraordinary Commission for Ascertaining and Investigating the Crimes Committed by the German-Fascist Invaders and Their Accomplices]] was formed on 2 November 1942. During the [[Great Patriotic War]] and afterwards, until 1991, the Commission collected materials on Nazi crimes in the USSR, including incidents of plunder. Immediately following the war, the Commission outlined damage in detail to sixty-four of the most valuable Soviet museums, out of 427 damaged ones. In the [[Russian SFSR]], 173 museums were found to have been plundered by the Nazis, with looted items numbering in the hundreds of thousands.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the USSR]], the [[Government of the Russian Federation]] formed the State Commission for the Restitution of Cultural Valuables to replace the Soviet Commission. Experts from this Russian institution originally consulted the work of the Soviet Commission, yet continue to catalogue artworks lost during the war museum by museum. {{As of|2008}}, lost artworks of 14 museums and the libraries of [[Voronezh Oblast]], [[Kursk Oblast]], [[Pskov Oblast]], [[Rostov Oblast]], [[Smolensk Oblast]], [[Northern Caucasus]], [[Gatchina]], [[Peterhof Palace]], [[Tsarskoye Selo]] (Pushkin), [[Novgorod]] and [[Novgorod Oblast]], as well as the bodies of the Russian State Archives and [[CPSU]] Archives, were catalogued in 15 volumes, all of which were made available online. They contain detailed information on 1,148,908 items of lost artworks. The total number of lost items is unknown so far, because cataloguing work for other damaged Russian museums is ongoing.&lt;ref name="lostart"/&gt;

Alfred Rosenberg commanded the so-called Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg [ERR] für die Besetzten Gebiete, which was responsible for collecting art, books, and cultural objects from invaded countries, and also transferred their captured library collections back to Berlin during the retreat from Russia. "In their search for 'research materials' ERR teams and the Wehrmacht visited 375 archival institutions, 402 museums, 531 institutes, and 957 libraries in Eastern Europe alone".&lt;ref name="Hadden"/&gt; The ERR also operated in the early days of the blitzkrieg of the Low Countries. This caused some confusion about authority, priority, and the chain of command among the German Army, the von Rippentropp Battalion and the Gestapo, and as a result of personal looting among the Army officers and troops. These ERR teams were, however, very effective. One account estimates that from the Soviet Union alone: "one hundred thousand geographical maps were taken on ideological grounds, for academic research, as means for political, geographical and economic information on Soviet cities and regions, or as collector's items".&lt;ref name=Hadden/&gt;

==Poland==
{{main|Nazi plunder in Poland}}
[[File:Aleksander Gierymski, Żydówka z pomarańczami.jpg|thumb|[[Aleksander Gierymski]]'s ''[[Jewess with Oranges]]'' discovered on 26 November 2010 in an art auction in [[Buxtehude]], Germany]]

After the occupation of Poland by German forces in September 1939, the Nazi regime [[Polish culture during World War II|attempted to exterminate its upper classes as well as its culture]].&lt;ref name="JOG_quote"/&gt; Thousands of art objects were looted, as the Nazis systematically carried out a plan of looting prepared even before the start of hostilities. 25 museums and many other facilities were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The total cost of German Nazi theft and destruction of Polish art is estimated at 20 billion dollars, or an estimated 43% of Polish [[cultural heritage]]; over 516,000 individual art pieces were looted, including 2,800 paintings by European painters; 11,000 paintings by Polish painters; 1,400 sculptures; 75,000 manuscripts; 25,000 maps; 90,000 books, including over 20,000 printed before 1800; and hundreds of thousands of other items of artistic and historical value. Germany still has much Polish material looted during World War II. For decades there have been mostly futile negotiations between Poland and Germany concerning the return of the looted property.&lt;ref name="GW2007"/&gt;

==Führermuseum==
{{main|Führermuseum}}

After Hitler became Chancellor, he made plans to transform his home city of [[Linz, Austria]] into the Third Reich's capital city for the arts. Hitler hired architects to work from his own designs to build several galleries and museums, which would collectively be known as the [[Führermuseum]]. Hitler wanted to fill his museum with the greatest art treasures in the world, and believed that most of the world's finest art belonged to Germany after having been looted during the Napoleonic and First World wars.

==Hermann Göring collection==
The [[Hermann Göring]] collection, a personal collection of [[Reichsmarschall]] Hermann Göring, was another large collection including confiscated property, consisted of approximately 50 percent of works of art confiscated from the enemies of the Reich.&lt;ref name="rothfeldtheus"/&gt; Assembled in large measure by art dealer [[Bruno Lohse]], Göring's adviser and ERR representative in Paris, in 1945 the collection included over 2,000 individual pieces including more than 300 paintings. The [[U.S. National Archives and Records Administration]]'s Consolidated Interrogation Report No. 2 states that Göring never crudely looted, instead he always managed "to find a way of giving at least the appearance of honesty, by a token payment or promise thereof to the confiscation authorities. Although he and his agents never had an official connection with the German confiscation organizations, they nevertheless used them to the fullest extent possible."&lt;ref name=rothfeldtheus/&gt;

==Nazi storage of looted objects==

The Third Reich amassed hundreds of thousands of objects from occupied nations and stored them in several key locations, such as [[Musée Jeu de Paume]] in Paris and the Nazi headquarters in [[Munich]]. As the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] gained advantage in the war and bombed Germany's cities and historic institutions, Germany "began storing the artworks in salt mines and caves for protection from Allied bombing raids. These mines and caves offered the appropriate humidity and temperature conditions for artworks."&lt;ref name="archives.gov"/&gt; Well known repositories of this kind were mines in [[Merkers]], [[Altaussee]] and [[Siegen]]. These mines were not only used for the storage of looted art but also of art that had been in Germany and Austria before the beginning of the Nazi rule.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.durchblick-siegen.de/themes/ds/pdf/01_05/seite12.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Degenerate art]] was legally banned by the Nazis from entering Germany, and so ones designated were held in what was called the Martyr's Room at the Jeu de Paume. Much of Paul Rosenberg's professional dealership and personal collection were so subsequently designated by the Nazis. Following [[Joseph Goebels]] earlier private decree to sell these degenerate works for foreign currency to fund the building of the Führermuseum and the wider war effort, [[Hermann Göring]] personally appointed a series of ERR approved dealers to liquidate these assets and then pass the funds to swell his personal art collection, including [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. With the looted degenerate art sold onwards via [[Switzerland]], Rosenberg's collection was scattered across Europe. Today, some 70 of his paintings are missing, including: the large Picasso watercolor ''Naked Woman on the Beach'', painted in Provence in 1923; seven works by Matisse; and the ''Portrait of Gabrielle Diot'' by [[Degas]].&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/|title=Bonjour Paris - The Lost Museum|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post war recovery effort==

===Immediate aftermath===
The Allies created special commissions, such as the [[Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives]] (MFAA) organization to help protect famous European monuments from destruction, and after the war, to travel to formerly [[Nazi-occupied territories]] to find Nazi art repositories. In 1944 and 1945 one of the greatest challenges for the "Monuments Men" was to keep Allied forces from plundering and "taking artworks and sending them home to friends and family"; When "off-limits" warning signs failed to protect the artworks the "Monuments Men" started to mark the storage places with white tape, which was used by Allied troops as a warning sign for unexploded mines.&lt;ref name="archives.gov"/&gt; They recovered thousands of objects, many of which were pillaged by the Nazis.

The Allies found these artworks in over 1,050 repositories in Germany and Austria at the end of World War II. In summer 1945, Capt. Walter Farmer became the collecting point's first director. The first shipment of artworks arriving at [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program#Restitutions|Wiesbaden Collection Point]] included cases of antiquities, Egyptian art, Islamic artefacts, and paintings from the [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]]. The collecting point also received materials from the [[Reichsbank]] and Nazi-looted, Polish, [[liturgical]] collections. At its height, Wiesbaden stored, identified, and restituted approximately 700,000 individual objects including paintings and sculptures, mainly to keep them away from the Soviet Army and wartime reparations.&lt;ref name="h-net"/&gt;

The Allies collected the artworks and stored them in collecting points, in particular the [[Central Collection Point in Munich]] until they could be returned. The identifiable works of art, that had been acquired by the Germans during the Nazi rule, were returned to the countries from which they were taken. It was up to the governments of each nation if and under which circumstances they would return the objects to the original owners.&lt;ref name="for the Netherlands Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herkomstgezocht.nl/eng/nkcollectie/woordenboek.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211224449/http://www.herkomstgezocht.nl/eng/nkcollectie/woordenboek.html |archivedate=2015-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Munich collection point was closed, the owners of many of the objects had not been found. Nations were also unable to find all of the owners or to verify that they were dead. There are many organizations put in place to help return the stolen items taken from the Jewish people. For example: Project Heart, the World Jewish Restitution Organization, and The Claims Conference. Depending on the circumstances these organizations may receive the art works in lieu of the heirs.

===Later developments===
[[File:Raphael missing.jpg|thumb|[[Raphael]]'s ''[[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|Portrait of a Young Man]]'' was looted by the Germans from the [[Czartoryski Museum]] in 1939. Although Polish officials state that it has been known "for years" that the painting survived the war,&lt;ref name="Rafael"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msz.gov.pl/pl/aktualnosci/msz_w_mediach/msz__nie_mamy_informacji__gdzie_jest__portret_mlodzienca__rafaela__depesza_pap_01_08_2012 |title=MSZ: nie mamy informacji, gdzie jest "Portret młodzieńca" Rafaela, depesza PAP 01.08.2012 |publisher=[[Polish Press Agency]] |work=MSZ in the Media |accessdate=2 February 2014 |author=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland]] |language=Polish |trans-title=Communiqué of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: we have no new information about the painting |quote=[Rafael's "Portrait of a Young Man" was not destroyed, as has been known[…]for years]}}&lt;/ref&gt; its whereabouts remain unknown.&lt;ref name="Rafael" /&gt; ]]

Although most of the stolen artworks and antiques were documented, found or recovered "by the victorious Allied armies ... principally hidden away in salt mines, tunnels, and secluded castles",&lt;ref name="nuremberg"/&gt; many artworks have never been returned to their rightful owners. [[Art dealer]]s, [[art gallery|galleries]] and [[museum]]s worldwide have been compelled to research their collection's [[provenance]] in order to investigate claims that some of the work was acquired after it had been stolen from its original owners.&lt;ref name="looting"/&gt; Already in 1985, years before American museums recognized the issue and before the international conference on Nazi-looted assets of [[Holocaust]] victims, European countries released inventory lists of works of art, coins and medals "that were confiscated from Jews by the Nazis during World War II, and announced the details of a process for returning the works to their owners and rightful heirs."&lt;ref name="december"/&gt; In 1998 an [[Austria]]n advisory panel recommended the return of 6,292 [[objets d'art]] to their legal owners (most of whom are [[Jew]]s), under the terms of a 1998 restitution law.&lt;ref name="austria"/&gt;
[[Nazi concentration camp]] and [[death camp]] victims had to strip completely before their murder, and all their personal belongings were stolen. The very valuable items such as [[gold coin]]s, [[ring (jewellery)|ring]]s, [[spectacles]], [[jewellry]] and other [[precious metal]] items were sent to the [[Reichsbank]] for conversion to [[bullion]]. The value was then credited to [[SS]] accounts.

Pieces of art looted by the Nazis can still be found in Russian/Soviet&lt;ref name="reported"/&gt; and American institutions: the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] revealed a list of 393 paintings that have gaps in their provenance during the Nazi Era, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] has posted a listing of more than 500 works "for which links in the chain of ownership for the years 1933–1945 are still unclear or not yet fully determined." The [[San Diego Museum of Art]]&lt;ref name="sdmart"/&gt; and the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]&lt;ref name="lacma"/&gt; provide lists on the internet to determine if art items within their collection were stolen by the Nazis.

[[Stuart Eizenstat]], the Under Secretary of State and head of the U.S. delegation sponsoring the 1998 international conference on Nazi-looted assets of Holocaust victims in Washington conference stated that "From now on, ... the sale, purchase, exchange and display of art from this period will be addressed with greater sensitivity and a higher international standard of responsibility."&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; The conference was attended by more than forty countries and thirteen different private entities, and the goal was to come to a federal consensus on how to handle Nazi-Era Looted Art. The conference was built on the foundation of the Nazi Gold Conference held in London in 1997. The U.S. Department of State hosted the conference with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum from November 30 to December 3, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/index.HTM|title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets|website=fcit.usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Egon Schiele 069.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Portrait of Wally]]'' by [[Egon Schiele]] (1912)]]
After the conference the [[Association of Art Museum Directors]] developed guidelines which require museums to review the provenance or history of their collections, focusing especially on art looted by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="cnn2"/&gt; The [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington identified more than 400 European paintings with gaps in their provenance during World War II era.&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt; One particular piece of art, "Still Life with Fruit and Game" by the 16th-century Flemish painter [[Frans Snyders]], was sold by [[Karl Haberstock]], whom the [[World Jewish Congress]] describes as "one of the most notorious Nazi art dealers."&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt; In 2000 the New York City's [[Museum of Modern Art]] still told Congress that they were "not aware of a single Nazi-tainted work of art in our collection, of the more than 100,000" they held.&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;

In 1979 two paintings, a Renoir, Tête de jeune fille, and a Pissarro, Rue de village, appeared on Interpol's "12 Most Wanted List," but to date no one knows their whereabouts (ATA Newsletter, Nov. '79, vol. 1, no. 9, p.&amp;nbsp;1. '78, 326.1-2) The New Jersey owner has asked IFAR to republish information about the theft, with the hope that someone will recognize the paintings.  The owner wrote IFAR that when his parents emigrated from Berlin in 1938, two of their paintings "mysteriously disappeared."  All of their other possessions were shipped from Germany to the U.S. via the Netherlands, and everything except the box containing these two paintings arrived intact.  After World War II the owner's father made a considerable effort to locate the paintings, but was unsuccessful.  Over the years numerous efforts have been made to recover them, articles have been published, and an advertisement appeared in the German magazine, Die Weltkunst, May 15, 1959.  A considerable reward has been offered, subject to usual conditions, but there has been no response.  Anyone with information about these two paintings is asked to contact IFAR.

However, restitution efforts initiated by German politicians have not been free of controversy, either. As the German law for restitution ''applies to "cultural assets lost as a result of Nazi persecution, "which includes paintings that Jews who emigrated from Germany sold to support themselves'',&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; pretty much any trade involving Jews in that era is affected, and the benefit of the doubt is given to claimants. German leftist politicians [[Klaus Wowereit]] (SPD, mayor of [[Berlin]]) and [[Thomas Flierl]] ([[Linkspartei]]) were sued in 2006 for being overly willing to give away the 1913 painting ''[[:File:Kirchner Berlin Street Scene 1913.jpg|Berliner Straßenszene]]'' of expressionist [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], which was in Berlin's [[Brücke Museum]]. On display in Cologne in 1937, it had been sold for 3,000 [[Reichsmark]] by a Jewish family residing in Switzerland to a German collector. This sum is considered by experts to have been well over the market price.&lt;ref name="spiegel1"/&gt; The museum, which obtained the painting in 1980 after several ownership changes, could not prove that the family actually received the money. It was restituted&lt;ref name="spiegel2"/&gt; to the heiress of the former owners, and she had it auctioned off for $38.1 Million.&lt;ref name="spiegel3"/&gt;

In 2010, as work began to extend an [[Rapid transit|underground line]] from [[Alexanderplatz]] through the historic city centre to the [[Brandenburg Gate]], a number of sculptures from the degenerate art exhibition were unearthed in the cellar of a private house close to the "Rote Rathaus". These included, for example, the [[bronze]] [[cubist]] style statue of a female dancer by the artist [[Marg Moll]], and are now on display at the [[Neues Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hickley |first=Catherine |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-08/-degenerate-sculptures-unearthed-from-bomb-rubble-put-on-show-in-berlin.html |title='Degenerate' Art Unearthed From Berlin Bomb Rubble |publisher=Bloomberg |date=1946-09-27 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2010/11/09/2010-11-09_rescued_prewwii_degenerate_art_on_display_in_the_neues_museum_in_berlin.html |title=Rescued pre-WWII 'degenerate art' on display in the Neues Museum in Berlin |publisher=Nydailynews.com |date= November 9, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-10 |first=Rosemary |last=Black}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,727971,00.html| title=Nazi Degenerate Art Rediscovered in Berlin| date=2010-11-08| work=Der Spiegel | author=Charles Hawley }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2013 up to 2015 a committee researched the collection of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch Royal family]]. The committee focussed on all objects acquired by the family since 1933 and which were made prior to 1945. In total 1300 artworks were studied. Dutch musea had already researched their collection in order to find objects stolen by the Nazis. It appeared that one painting of the forest near [[Huis ten Bosch]] by the Dutch painter [[Joris van der Haagen]] came from a Jewish collector. He was forced to hand the painting over to the former Jewish bank [[Lippmann, Rosenthal &amp; Co.|Lippmann, Rosenthal &amp; Co]] in Amsterdam,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/4022041/koninklijk-huis-bezit-nazis-geroofd-schilderij.html|title = Koninklijk huis bezit door nazi's geroofd schilderij|date = 31 March 2015|accessdate = 2 April 2015|website = |publisher = nu.nl|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which collected money and other possessions of the Jews in Amsterdam. The painting was bought by [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Queen Juliana]] in 1960. The family plans to return the painting to the heirs of the owner in 1942, a Jewish collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Koninklijke familie bezit roofkunstwerk|url = http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/03/31/koninklijke-familie-bezit-roofkunstwerk/|accessdate = 2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of Nazi looting today==
Approximately 20% of the art in Europe was looted by the Nazis, and there are well over 100,000 items that have not been returned to their rightful owners.&lt;ref name="archives"/&gt; The majority of what is still missing includes everyday objects such as china, crystal or silver.

Some objects of great cultural significance remain missing, though how much has yet to be determined. This is a major issue for the [[art sale|art market]], since legitimate organizations do not want to deal in objects with unclear ownership titles. Since the mid-1990s, after several books, magazines, and newspapers began exposing the subject to the general public, many dealers, auction houses and museums have grown more careful about checking the provenance of objects that are available for purchase in case they are looted. Some museums in the United States and elsewhere have agreed to check the provenance of works in their collections with the implied promise that suspect works would be returned to rightful owners if the evidence so dictates. But the process is time-consuming and slow, and very few disputed works have been found in public collections.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In the 1990s and 2000s, information has become more accessible due to political and economic changes as well as advances in technology. Privacy laws in some countries have expired so records that were once difficult to obtain are now open to the public. Information from former Soviet countries that was previously unobtainable is now available, and many organisations have posted information online, making it widely accessible.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In addition to the role of courts in determining restitution or compensation, some states have created official bodies for the consideration and resolution of claims. In the United Kingdom, the [[Spoliation Advisory Panel]] advises the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] on such claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/cultural_property/3296.aspx/|title=Maintaining world-leading national museums and galleries, and supporting the museum sector|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Foundation for Art Research]] (IFAR), a not-for-profit educational and research organization, has helped provide information leading to restitution.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 2013 the Canadian government created the Holocaust-era Provenance Research and Best-Practice Guidelines Project, through which they are investigating the holdings of six art galleries in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rollason|first=Kevin|title=Art Sleuths on Nazi Trail|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/art-sleuths-on-nazi-trail-244172801.html|accessdate=February 23, 2014|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|date=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992 International Archives for the Women's Movement discovery===
{{main|International Archives for the Women's Movement}}
On 14 January 1992, historian Marc Jansen reported in an article in ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' that archival collections stolen from the Netherlands including the records of the International Archives for the Women's Movement ({{lang-nl|Internationaal Archief voor de Vrouwenbeweging (IAV)}}), which had been looted in 1940, had been found in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Everard|first1=Myriam|last2=Bosch|first2=Mineke|editor-last1=Bosch|editor-first1=Mineke|chapter=Feminisme als oorlogstrofee: De vooroorlogse IAV-archieven in Moskou|title=Feminisme en Verbeelding Jaarboek voor Vrouwengeschiedenis|url=https://www.academia.edu/30315885/Feminisme_als_oorlogstrofee._De_vooroorlogse_IAV-archieven_in_Moskou|date=1994|volume=14|trans-title=Feminism as a war trophy: The pre-war IAV archives in Moscow|publisher=Stichting beheer IISG|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|language=Dutch|isbn=978-90-6861-096-3|pages=193–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confiscated records were initially sent to Berlin and later was moved to [[Sudetenland]] for security reasons. At the end of the war, the [[Red Army]] took the documents from [[Prague Offensive|German-occupied Czechoslovakia]] and in 1945-46, stored them in the [[KGB]]'s {{ill|Osobyi Archive|de|Sonderarchiv Moskau}} ({{lang-ru|Особый архив}}), meaning special archive, which was housed in [[Moscow]]. Though agreements were drafted almost immediately after the discovery, bureaucratic delays kept the archives from being returned for eleven years. In 2003, the partial recovery of the papers of some of the most noted feminists in the pre-war period, including [[Aletta Jacobs]] and [[Rosa Manus]], some 4,650 books and periodicals, records of the [[International Council of Women]] and [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]], among many photographs were returned.

In January 2014, researcher Dominik Radlmaier of the city of Nuremberg announced that eight objects had been identified as lost art with a further eleven being under strong suspicion.

=== 2015 Walbrzych, Poland rumored armored train ===
In Walbrzych, Poland two amateur explorers — Piotr Koper and Andreas Richter — claim to have found a rumored armored train that is believed to be filled with gold, gems and weapons. The train was rumored to be sealed in a tunnel in the closing days of World War II before the collapse of The Third Reich. Only 10% of the tunnel has been explored because much of the tunnel has collapsed. Finding the train will be an expensive and complicated operation involving a lot of funding, digging, and drilling. However, to support their claims the explorers said experts have examined the site with ground-penetrating, thermal and magnetic sensors that picked up signs of a railway tunnel with metal tracks. The legitimacy of these claims has yet to be determined, yet the explorers are requesting 10% of the value of whatever is within the train if their findings are correct. Poland's deputy culture minister, Piotr Zuchowski, said he was "99 percent convinced" that the train had finally been found but scientists claim that the explorers' findings are false.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Hopes Dashed Again in Hunt for Fabled Nazi Gold Train in Poland|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/world/europe/hopes-dashed-again-in-hunt-for-fabled-nazi-gold-train-in-poland.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-12-15|access-date = 2016-02-16|issn = 0362-4331|first = Joanna|last = Berendt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nazi gold train: 'No evidence' of discovery in Poland - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35104117|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-02-16|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]] and [[second scholasticism]], '''objective precision''' (Latin ''praecisio obiectiva'') is the "objective" aspect of [[abstraction]]. Objective precision is the process by which certain features (the [[differentia]]e) of the real object of a [[formal concept]] are excluded from the comprehension of that concept; the object is thus being intentionally transformed into a universal [[objective concept]]. Objective precision is thus a process by which universal objective concepts arise. It is the "objective" aspect of the process of (total) [[abstraction]] or concept-formation.

== Objective precision and formal precision ==
Objective precision is distinguished against [[formal precision]]. Whereas objective precision is a process on the part of objective ''concepts'' (the objective correlates of the mental acts by means of which something is being conceived) formal precision is the corresponding process on the part of formal concepts or the mental ''acts'' themselves. Objective and formal precision are the two aspects (objective and subjective) of abstraction.

== Nominalism and realism ==
The two opposing philosophical views on universals, [[nominalism]] (or rather [[conceptualism]]) and [[philosophical realism|realism]] can be defined by means of their relation to objective precision: anyone who accepts objective precision, is a philosophical realist; anyone who rejects it, is a conceptualist or nominalist (in a broad sense). In other words, the nominalists reject the idea that our universal mental concepts (formal concepts) require universal intentional objects; thus, according to nominalists, in abstraction only formal precision takes place, no objective precision.

== Ontological requirements on the part of the object ==
The schools are divided in their opinion what constitutes the necessary condition on the part of the object in order that objective precision be possible. According to the [[Thomism|Thomists]] a [[virtual distinction]] on the part of the object between the excluded differentia and the arising abstracted objective concept is sufficient to make objective precision possible. According to the [[Scotism|Scotists]], a [[formal distinction]] is generally required, although certain Scotists (like [[Bartolomeo Mastri]]) regard virtual distinction as sufficient in certain special cases. [[Francisco Suárez|Suárez]] defends objective precision but he rejects any distinctions on the part of the object. The nominalists (conceptualists) agree with the Scotists that a formal distinction would be necessary to enable objective precision, but since they regard such a distinction as impossible, they reject objective precision altogether.

'''Open Source Ecology''' ('''OSE''') is a network of farmers, engineers, architects and supporters, whose main goal is the eventual manufacturing of the '''Global Village Construction Set''' ('''GVCS'''). As described by Open Source Ecology "the GVCS is an open technological platform that allows for the easy fabrication of the 50 different Industrial Machines that it takes to build a small civilization with modern comforts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensourceecology.org/gvcs.php "Open Source Ecology"], Accessed: 7-23-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups in [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[California]] are developing blueprints, and building prototypes in order to pass them on to Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rohan Pearce |date=2011-12-14 |title=Can open source save the planet? |publisher=Techworld Australia |url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/in-depth/open-source/3325167/can-open-source-save-planet/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Recently, 3D-Print reports&lt;ref&gt;http://3dprint.com/10110/3d-printers-economy/&lt;/ref&gt; OSE has been experimenting with [[RepRap]] [[3-D printers]] as suggested by academics for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;J. M Pearce, C. Morris Blair, K. J. Laciak, R. Andrews, A. Nosrat and I. Zelenika-Zovko, "[https://www.academia.edu/1507915/3-D_Printing_of_Open_Source_Appropriate_Technologies_for_Self-Directed_Sustainable_Development 3-D Printing of Open Source Appropriate Technologies for Self-Directed Sustainable Development]", ''Journal of Sustainable Development'' '''3'''(4), pp. 17-29 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Marcin Jakubowski Ph.D. founded the group in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensourceecology.org/about.php "About"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717072826/http://opensourceecology.org/about.php |date=2011-07-17 }}, Accessed: 7-19-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final year of his doctoral thesis at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], he had the feeling that his career field was too closed off from the world's problems, and he wanted to go a different way.  After graduation, he devoted himself entirely to OSE.

OSE made it to the world stage in 2011 when Jakubowski presented his Global Village Construction Set [[TED Talk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/marcin_jakubowski.html "Marcin Jakubowski: Open-sourced blueprints for civilization"], April 2011. Accessed: 7-19-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the GVCS won [[Make (magazine)|Make magazine's]]  Green Project Contest. The Internet blogs Gizmodo and Grist produced detailed features on OSE. Jakubowski has since become a [[Shuttleworth Foundation]] Fellow (2012) and TED Senior Fellow (2012).

In December 2013, Marcin married Catarina Mota.  She co-chaired the Open Hardware Summit 2012, served on the board of directors of the Open Source Hardware Association, taught as an adjunct faculty member at ITP-NYU, and was a fellow of the National Science and Technology Foundation of Portugal.

Catarina finished her PhD dissertation on the social impact of open and collaborative practices for the development of physical goods and technologies. She was a visiting scholar at ITP-NYU, Research Chair at the Open Source Hardware Association, TED Fellow, and member of NYC Resistor.

Open Source Ecology is also developing in Europe as OSE Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/OSE_Europe |title=OSE Europe |publisher=Opensourceecology.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, OSE and the [https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/ Open Building Institute] joined forces to make affordable, ecological housing widely accessible. The initiative has prototyped the [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/622508883/open-building-institute-eco-building-toolkit/posts/1750160 Seed Eco-Home] - a 1400 square foot home with the help of 50 people in a 5 day period - demonstrating that OSE's [[EXtreme_Manufacturing|Extreme Manufacturing]] techniques can be apply to rapid swarm builds of large structures. Materials for the Seed Eco-Home cost around US$30,000. Further, OBI has prototyped the Aquaponic Greenhouse - which was also built in 5 days with 50 people: 

Image: not letting me upload my own image at https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/portfolio/aquaponic-greenhouse-workshop-2/ with caption ''Open source vertical growing towers with bok choi, lettuce, and other greens. Tilapia ponds under the towers provide nutrients as water circulates from the ponds to the towers. The ponds are 4 feet deep, making for a vertical biological zone 12 feet high to maximize productivity. The goal for the greenhouse is to experiment with the feasibility of producing a full diet for one person from only 800 square feet of space.''


== Factor e Farm ==
The '''Factor e Farm''' is the main headquarters, where the machines are prototyped and tested.  The farm itself also serves as a prototype. Utilizing the Open Source Ecology principles, Marcin and Catarina have built four prototype modules which comprise their home.  An added greenhouse demonstrates how a family can grow their own fresh vegetables and fish.  Outside there is also a large garden including fruit trees..&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Factor_e_Farm Factor e Farm Information] Accessed 7-31-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current progress==
As of 2014, twelve of the fifty machines have been designed, blueprinted, and prototyped, with four of those reaching the documentation stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Status_Brief Status Brief], Accessed: 2016-02-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/GVCS_Tools_Status GVCS Prototype Status], Accessed: 2016-02-14&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2011 a [[Kickstarter]] fundraising campaign collected 63,573 USD for project expenses and the construction of a training facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/622508883/global-village-construction-set |title=Fundraising |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date=2011-10-10 |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project has been funded by the Shuttleworth Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/marcin-jakubowski/ |title=Marcin Jakubowski |publisher=Shuttleworthfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a semifinalist in the Focus Forward Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/focusforwardfilms/semifinalists/51764445 |title=Build yourself. – Tristan Copley Smith |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2012-10-19 |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum field theory]], '''penguin diagrams''' are a class of [[Feynman diagrams]] which are important for understanding [[CP violation|CP violating]] processes in the [[standard model of particle physics|standard model]]. They refer to [[one-loop Feynman diagram|one-loop process]]es in which a [[quark]] temporarily changes [[Quark flavor|flavor]] (via a W or Z loop), and the flavor-changed quark engages in some tree interaction, typically a [[Strong interaction|strong one]]. For the interactions where some quark flavors (e.g. very heavy ones) have much higher interaction amplitudes than others, such as CP-violating or [[Higgs interaction]]s, these penguin processes may have amplitudes comparable to or even greater than those of the direct [[tree process]]es. A similar diagram can be drawn for leptonic decays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Flip Tanedo |title=Dissecting the Penguin |date=March 19, 2012 |url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2012/03/19/dissecting-the-penguin/ |website=Quantum Diaries }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were first isolated and studied by [[Mikhail Shifman]], [[Arkady Vainshtein]], and Valentin Zakharov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vainshtein |first1=A. I. |last2=Zakharov |first2=V.

== Origin of the name ==

[[John Ellis (physicist)|John Ellis]] was the first to refer to a certain class of Feynman diagrams as "penguin diagrams", due in part to their shape, and in part to a legendary bar-room bet with [[Melissa Franklin]].  According to John Ellis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=hep-ph/9510397 |author1=Mikhail Shifman |title=ITEP Lectures in Particle Physics |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
[[Mary K. Gaillard|Mary K. [Gaillard]]], [[Dimitri Nanopoulos|Dimitri [Nanopoulos]]] and I first got interested in what are now called penguin diagrams while we were studying [[CP violation]] in the [[Standard Model]] in 1976... The penguin name came in 1977, as follows.

In the spring of 1977, [[Mike Chanowitz]], Mary K and I wrote a paper on [[grand unification theory|GUTs]] predicting the [[bottom quark|b quark]] mass before it was found. When it was found a few weeks later, Mary K, Dimitri, [[Serge Rudaz]] and I immediately started working on its phenomenology. That summer, there was a student at [[CERN]], [[Melissa Franklin]] who is now an experimentalist at Harvard. One evening, she, I, and Serge went to a pub, and she and I started a game of darts. We made a bet that if I lost I had to put the word [[penguin]] into my next paper. She actually left the darts game before the end, and was replaced by Serge, who beat me. Nevertheless, I felt obligated to carry out the conditions of the bet.

For some time, it was not clear to me how to get the word into this b quark paper that we were writing at the time. Then, one evening, after working at CERN, I stopped on my way back to my apartment to visit some friends living in [[Meyrin]] where I smoked some illegal substance. Later, when I got back to my apartment and continued working on our paper, I had a sudden flash that the famous diagrams look like penguins. So we put the name into our paper, and the rest, as they say, is history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1081">'''Permission''', in philosophy, is the attribute of a person whose performance of a specific [[philosophy of action|action]], otherwise ethically wrong or dubious, would thereby involve no ethical fault. The term "permission" is more commonly used to refer to [[consent]]. '''Consent''' is the legal embodiment of the concept, in which approval is given to another party.

Permissions depend on [[norm (philosophy)|norm]]s or [[institution]]s.

Many permissions and [[obligation]]s are complementary to each other, and [[deontic logic]] is a tool sometimes used in reasoning about such relationships.

'''Physical abuse''' is any intentional act causing [[injury]] or [[Physical trauma|trauma]] to another person or [[animal abuse|animal]] by way of bodily contact. In most cases, children are the victims of physical abuse, but adults can also be victims, as in cases of [[domestic violence]] or [[workplace aggression]]. Alternative terms sometimes used include [[assault|physical assault]] or [[physical violence]], and may also include [[sexual abuse]]. Physical abuse may involve more than one abuser, and more than one victim.

==Forms==

Physical abuse means any non-accidental act or behavior causing [[injury]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], or other physical [[suffering]] or [[bodily harm]]. Abusive acts toward children can often result from parents' attempts at [[child discipline]] through excessive [[corporal punishment]].&lt;ref name=Humane&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110316155856/http://www.americanhumane.org/children/stop-child-abuse/fact-sheets/child-physical-abuse.html "Child physical abuse".] American Humane Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WebMD&gt;Giardino, A.P.; Giardino, E.R. (12 December 2008). [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/915664-overview "Child Abuse &amp; Neglect: Physical Abuse".] ''WebMD''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

A number of causes of [[Child abuse#Physical abuse|physical abuse against children]] have been identified, the most common of which, according to Mash and Wolfe, being:
*many abusive and neglectful parents have had little exposure to positive parental models and supports.
*there is often a greater degree of stress in the family environment.
*information-processing disturbances may cause maltreating parents to misperceive or mislabel their child's behavior, which leads to inappropriate responses.
*there is often a lack of awareness or understanding of developmentally appropriate expectations.&lt;ref name=Mash /&gt;

==Effects==

Physically abused children are at risk for later interpersonal problems involving aggressive behavior, and adolescents are at a much greater risk for [[substance abuse]]. In addition, symptoms of depression, emotional distress, and [[suicidal ideation]] are also common features of people who have been physically abused. Studies have also shown that children with a history of physical abuse may meet [[DSM-IV-TR]] criteria for [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).&lt;ref name=Mash&gt;{{cite book|last=Mash|first=Eric|title=Abnormal Child Psychology|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont,California|isbn=9780495506270|pages=427–463}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as one-third of children who experience physical abuse are also at risk to become abusive as adults&lt;ref&gt;Oliver JE (1993). Intergenerational transmission of child abuse: rates, research, and clinical implications. Am J Psychiatry, 150(99): 1314-24.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Researchers have pointed to other potential psycho-biological effects of child physical abuse on parenting, when abused children become adults. These recent findings may, at least in part, be carried forward by epigenetic changes that impact the regulation of stress physiology.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Moser DA, Paoloni-Giacobino A, Stenz A, Gex-Fabry M, Aue T, Adouan W, Cordero MI, Suardi F, Manini A, Sancho Rossignol A, Merminod G, Ansermet F, Dayer AG, Rusconi Serpa S (epub May 29, 2015).

J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,53(4):417-24.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.jaac.2013.12.025.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other potentially important consequences of childhood physical abuse on adolescent and adult physical and mental health and development have been documented via the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hillis SD, Anda RF, Dube SR, Felitti VJ, Marchbanks PA, Marks JS (2004). The association between adverse childhood experiences and adolescent pregnancy, long-term psychosocial consequences, and fetal death. Pediatrics. 2004 Feb;113(2):320-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

Seeking treatment is unlikely for a majority of people that are physically abused, and the ones who are seeking treatment are usually under some form of legal constraint. The prevention and treatment options for physically abused children include: enhancing positive experiences early in the development of the parent-child relationship, as well as changing how parents teach, discipline, and attend to their children. 

Evidence-based interventions include [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) as well as video-feedback interventions and child-parent [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]]; all of which specifically target anger patterns and distorted beliefs, and offer training and/or reflection, support, and modelling that focuses on parenting skills and expectations, as well as increasing empathy for the child by supporting the parent's taking the child's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Kolko, D. J. (1996). Individual cognitive-behavioral treatment and family therapy for physically abused children and their offending parents: A comparison of clinical outcomes. Child Maltreatment, 1, 322-342.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Myers MM, Brunelli SA, Coates SW, Zeanah CH, Davies M, Grienenberger JF, Marshall RD, McCaw JE, Trabka KA, Liebowitz MR (2006). Traumatized mothers can change their minds about their toddlers: Understanding how a novel use of videofeedback supports positive change of maternal attributions. Infant Mental Health Journal, 27(5), 429-448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=A.F.|year=2007|title=Ghosts and angels: Intergenerational patterns in the transmission and treatment of the traumatic sequelae of domestic violence|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|volume=28|issue=4|pages=422–439|doi=10.1002/imhj.20145|pmid=28640404}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These forms of treatment may include training in social competence and management of daily demands in an effort to decrease parental stress, which is a known risk factor for physical abuse. Although these treatment and prevention strategies are to help children and parents of children who have been abused, some of these methods can also be applied to adults who have physically abused.&lt;ref name=Mash/&gt;

'''''Portfolio: An Intercontinental Quarterly''''' was a cross-disciplinary [[literary magazine|literary journal]] published between 1945 and 1947. It was edited by [[Caresse Crosby]] and published through her [[Black Sun Press]]. Only six issues were published, each totaling about 1000 copies. Each issue was a series of loose sheets contained in a [[folio (printing)|folio]], lavishly illustrated, and printed in limited numbers. Contributors included many [[avant-garde]] authors, architects, photographers, and illustrators who were prominent in their respective fields, including individuals like [[Albert Camus]] (who contributed "Letter to a German Friend," his first appearance in an English-language publication),&lt;ref name=lopez/&gt; architect [[Luigi Moretti]],&lt;ref name=mclean/&gt; artist [[Picasso|Pablo Picasso]],&lt;ref name=lopez/&gt; and photographer [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], along with emerging writers like [[Charles Bukowski]].&lt;ref name=3dc/&gt; It introduced American readers to many authors who later became famous.&lt;ref name=mccoy/&gt;

==Origins and purpose==

[[Caresse Crosby]], a long-time [[patron of the arts]], originally published with her husband [[Harry Crosby]] through the [[Black Sun Press]] a number of emerging writers during the 1920s and 1930s in Paris. After his suicide in December 1929, she continued their work, though less actively. The press stopped active publishing when World War II intervened and Crosby left Paris for the United States.

Towards the end of World War II, [[Harry T. Moore]] encouraged her to start a new cultural magazine,&lt;ref name=mccoy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mccoy.lib.siu.edu/show/portf.html |title=Portfolio |accessdate=2010-06-11 |publisher=Morris Library, [[Southern Illinois University]] at Carbondale |work=Library Affairs Showcase |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121210132425/http://mccoy.lib.siu.edu/show/portf.html |archivedate=2012-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which she titled ''Portfolio'' with the desire to present to the public "lively and varied examples of work by modern artists." Each issue contained prose, poetry, prints and plans. She hoped to initiate an "exchange of thought between America and Europe" and to carry forth "a new expression of man's aspirations."&lt;ref name=bookrags/&gt; She followed in the tradition of the original literary journal ''[[transition (literary journal)|transition]]'', which her husband Harry Crosby had edited. She hoped that artists of all kinds could "build a bridge of enduring fabric between the ivory tower and the arena" and contribute to rebuilding the culture of Europe.&lt;ref name=bookrags&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/mary-jacob-caresse-crosby-dlb2/ |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography on (Mary) (Jacob) Caresse Crosby |accessdate=2010-06-11 |publisher=BookRags.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529054226/http://www.bookrags.com/biography/mary-jacob-caresse-crosby-dlb2/ |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Portfolios'' included work by a variety of [[avant-garde]] writers, artists, photographers, and architects.&lt;ref name=mclean/&gt;&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.lib.siu.edu/index.php?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=2127&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=50842#id50842 |title=Caresse Crosby papers, 1912-1970 – Manuscripts |accessdate=2010-06-24 |publisher=Morris Library Special Collections |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720045711/http://archives.lib.siu.edu/index.php?p=collections%2Ffindingaid&amp;id=2127&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=50842#id50842 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication featured new work, translated works of foreign writers,&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/crosby/bio.htm |title=Harry Crosby: A Biographical Essay |author=Edward Brunner |work=An Online Journal and Multimedia Companion to Anthology of Modern American Poetry |accessdate=2010-06-24 |publisher=Morris Library Special Collections |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702185436/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/crosby/bio.htm |archivedate=2010-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; re-published works of writers whose work had not been widely known, and both original images and reproductions of various artist's work.

==Publishing format==

During World War II and for some time after, paper was in short supply.&lt;ref name=mccoy/&gt; Caresse printed the magazine on a variety of different sizes, colors and types of paper stock printed by different printers, stuffed into a  {{convert|11.5|x|15|in|mm}} [[Folio (printing)|folio]], though the size varied.&lt;ref name=3dc/&gt; Caresse printed 1,000 copies of each issue, and as she had done with earlier works published by the [[Black Sun Press]], gave special treatment to 100 or so deluxe copies that featured original artwork by [[Henri Matisse]], [[Romare Bearden]], and others.&lt;ref name=3dc&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://washingtonart.com/beltway/3dceditors.html|title=Richard Peabody on 3 DC Editors|last=Peabody|first=Richard|volume=7|number=4|date=Fall 2006|accessdate=31 March 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701005000/http://washingtonart.com/beltway/3dceditors.html|archivedate=1 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby worked from her offices at 1620 20th Street NW  in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=players&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stringandacan.com/Black_Sun/BLACK_SUN_PRESS.html |title=Black Sun Press |publisher=The Black Sun Players |accessdate=31 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154734/http://www.stringandacan.com/Black_Sun/BLACK_SUN_PRESS.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived around the corner at 2008 Q St. NW.&lt;ref name=3dc/&gt; She later moved the offices to 918 F Street, N.W.&lt;ref name=pba&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbagalleries.com/search/item170066.php? |title=Portfolio V, Spring 1947 - PBA Galleries, Auctions and Appraisers |publisher=PBA Galleries, |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715060416/http://www.pbagalleries.com/search/item170066.php |archivedate=15 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Portfolio VI''===

''Portfolio VI'' was published during the summer of 1947. It focused on writers and artists from Greece, where publisher [[Caresse Crosby]] had for some years tried to establish a world peace center. It was the largest ''Portfolio'' with 36 leaves of text and illustration. Writers included [[Yórgos Theotokás]], [[Nicolas Calas]], Cambas, D. Nicolareizis, and others. She published contributions from [[Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghikas]],&lt;ref name="hamalian"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamalian|first=Linda |title=The Cramoisy Queen: A Life of Caresse Crosby |publisher=Southern Illinois University| year=2005| isbn=0-8093-1865-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} a sculptor, engraver, iconographer, writer and academic, and from painter and poet [[Nikos Engonopoulos]].&lt;ref name="hamalian"/&gt; Illustrations were provided by [[Yannis Moralis]], Kanellis, Kapralos, Diamantopoulos, and others.&lt;ref name=simreed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.simsreed.com/artists_illustrated_books/post_war.php?category=post-war&amp;stk=36692 |accessdate=2010-06-11 |title=Post War |publisher=Sims Reed Limited |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716074128/http://books.simsreed.com/artists_illustrated_books/post_war.php?category=post-war&amp;stk=36692 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceases publication==

Crosby had already begun work on an issue focusing on Ireland and a "Negro" issue. When she did not attract more sponsors, she finally decided she could not absorb the risk of publishing further issues.&lt;ref name=hamalian/&gt;{{rp|158}} She stopped publication with Issue VI.&lt;ref name="Conover"&gt;{{cite book |last=Conover |first=Anne |title=Caresse Crosby: From Black Sun to Roccasinibalda |publisher=Capra Press |place=Santa Barbara, California |year=1989 |isbn=0-595-15928-1 |url =https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0595159281/techpros}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had intended to publish four issues per year, and never achieved that goal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16319">'''Realistic conflict theory''' (initialized '''RCT'''), also known as '''realistic group conflict theory''' (initialized '''RGCT'''),&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; is a [[social psychology|social psychological]] model of [[group conflict|intergroup conflict]].&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt; The theory explains how intergroup hostility can arise as a result of conflicting goals and competition over limited resources, and it also offers an explanation for the feelings of [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] toward the [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] that accompany the intergroup hostility.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name=W&amp;K /&gt; Groups may be in competition for a real or perceived [[scarcity]] of resources such as money, political power, military protection, or social status.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt; 

Feelings of resentment can arise in the situation that the groups see the competition over resources as having a [[zero-sum game|zero-sums fate]], in which only one group is the winner (obtained the needed or wanted resources) and the other loses (unable to obtain the limited resource due to the "winning" group achieving the limited resource first).&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;  The length and severity of the conflict is based upon the perceived value and shortage of the given resource.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt; According to RCT, positive relations can only be restored if [[superordinate goals]] are in place.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

== Concept ==

=== History ===
The theory was officially named by [[Donald T. Campbell|Donald Campbell]], but has been articulated by others since the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt;  In the 1960s, this theory developed from Campbell's recognition of social psychologists' tendency to reduce all human behavior to [[hedonism|hedonistic goals]]. He criticized psychologists like [[John Thibaut]], [[Harold Kelley]], and [[George C. Homans|George Homans]], who emphasized theories that place food, sex, and pain avoidance as central to all human processes. According to Campbell, hedonistic assumptions do not adequately explain intergroup relations.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; Campbell believed that these [[social exchange theory|social exchange theorists]] oversimplified human behavior by likening interpersonal interaction to animal behavior.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt; Similar to the ideas of Campbell, other researchers also began recognizing a problem in the psychological understanding of intergroup behavior.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;  These researchers noted that prior to Campbell, social exchange theorists ignored the essence of social psychology and the importance of interchanges between groups.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966"/&gt; To the contrary of prior theories, RCT takes into account the sources of conflict between groups,  which include, incompatible goals and competition over limited resources.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;

===Supportive research===

==== Robbers cave study ====

The 1954 Robbers Cave Experiment by [[Muzafer Sherif]] and [[Carolyn Wood Sherif]] represents one of the most widely known demonstrations of RCT.&lt;ref name="W&amp;K"/&gt; The Sherifs' study was conducted over three weeks in a 200-acre summer camp in [[Robbers Cave State Park]], [[Oklahoma]], focusing on intergroup behavior.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt; In this study, researchers posed as camp personnel, observing 22 eleven- and twelve-year-old boys who had never previously met and had comparable backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;

The experiment was divided into three stages. The first stage being "[[ingroup]] formation", in which upon arrival the boys were split into two approximately equal groups based on similarities. Each group was unaware of the other group's presence. The second stage was the "friction phase", wherein the groups were entered in competition with one another in various camp games.  Valued prizes were awarded to the winners. This caused both groups to develop negative attitudes and behaviors towards the [[outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]]. The third and final stage was the "integration stage". During this stage, tensions between the groups were reduced through teamwork-driven tasks that required intergroup cooperation.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;

The Sherifs made several conclusions based on the three-stage Robbers Cave Experiment.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; From the study, he determined that because the groups were created to be approximately equal, individual differences are not necessary or responsible for intergroup conflict to occur.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; As seen in the study when the boys were competing in camp games for valued prizes, Sherif noted that hostile and aggressive attitudes toward an outgroup arise when groups compete for resources that only one group can attain.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; Sherif also establishes that contact with an outgroup is insufficient, by itself, to reduce negative attitudes.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; Finally, he concludes that friction between groups can be reduced along with positive intergroup relations maintained, only in the presence of superordinate goals that promote united, cooperative action.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;

However a further review of the Robber's Cave Experiments, which were in fact a series of three separate experiments carried out by the Sherifs and colleagues reveals additional deliberations. In two earlier studies the boys ganged up on a common enemy, and in fact on occasion ganged up on the experimenters themselves showing an awareness of being manipulated.&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt; In addition, Michael Billig argues that in addition to the two groups of boys, the experimenters themselves form a third group, and one that is arguably the most powerful of the three and that they in fact become the outgroup themselves in the aforementioned experiment.&lt;ref name="Billig" /&gt; 

[[Lutfy Diab]] repeated the experiment with 18 boys from Beirut. The 'Blue Ghost' and 'Red Genies' groups each contained 5 Christians and 4 Muslims. Fighting soon broke out, not Christian vs Muslim but Blue vs Red. &lt;ref&gt; Us and Them, [[David Berreby]], Hutchinson 2006, p178 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions and applications ==

===Implications for diversity and integration===
RCT offers an explanation for negative attitudes toward [[racial integration]] and efforts to promote diversity.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bobo"/&gt; This is illustrated in the data collected from the [[American National Election Studies|Michigan National Election Studies]] survey. According to the survey, most whites held negative attitudes toward school districts' attempts to integrate schools via [[Desegregation busing in the United States|school busing in the 1970s]].  In these surveys, there was a general perceived threat that whites had of African Americans.&lt;ref name="Bobo"/&gt; It can be concluded that, contempt towards racial integration was due to a perception of blacks as a danger to valued lifestyles, goals, and resources, rather than [[symbolic racism]] or prejudice attitudes formulated during childhood.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bobo /&gt;

RCT can also provide an explanation for why competition over limited resources in communities can present potentially harmful consequences in establishing successful [[Diversity (business)|organizational diversity]].&lt;ref name="Brief"/&gt; In the workplace, this is depicted by the concept that increased racial [[heterogeneity]] among employees is associated with job dissatisfaction among majority members.&lt;ref name="Brief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsui"/&gt; Since organizations are affixed in the communities to which their employees belong, the racial makeup of employees' communities affect attitudes toward diversity in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; As racial heterogeneity increases in a white community, white employees are less accepting of workplace diversity.&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt; RCT provides an explanation of this pattern because in communities of mixed races, members of minority groups are seen as competing for economic security, power, and prestige with the majority group.

RCT can help explain discrimination against different ethnic and racial groups.&lt;ref name="Esses"/&gt; An example of this is shown in [[cross-cultural studies]] that determined that violence between different groups escalates in relationship to shortages in resources.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Esses /&gt;  When a group have a notion that resources are limited and only available for possession by one group, this leads to attempts to remove the source of competition.&lt;ref name=Esses /&gt; Groups can attempt to remove their competition by increasing their groups capabilities (e.g. skill training), decreasing the abilities of the outgroups competition (e.g. expressing negative attitudes or applying punitive [[tariffs]]), or by decreasing proximity to the outgroup (e.g. denying immigrant access).&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Esses /&gt;

===An extension to unequal groups===
Realistic conflict theory originally only described the results of competition between two groups of equal status.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name="Duckitt"/&gt; John Duckitt suggests that the theory be expanded to include competition between groups of unequal status. To demonstrate this, Duckitt created a scheme of types of realistic conflict with groups of unequal status and their resulting correlation with prejudice.&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt;

Duckitt concluded that there are at least two types of conflict based on ingroups competition with an outgroup.&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; The first is 'competition with an equal group' and is explained by realistic conflict theory.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; Thus being, group-based threat that leads ingroup members to feel hostile towards the outgroup which can lead to conflict as the ingroup focuses on acquiring the threatened resource.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; The second type of conflict is 'domination of the outgroup by the ingroup'. This occurs when the ingroup and outgroup do not have equal status. If domination occurs, there are two responses the subordinate group may have. One is stable oppression, in which the subordinate group accepts the dominating group's attitudes on some focal issue and sometimes, the dominant group's deeper values to avoid further conflict. The second response that may occur is unstable oppression. This occurs when the subordinate group rejects the lower status forced upon them, and sees the dominating group as oppressive. The dominant group then may view the subordinates' challenge as either justified or unjustified. If it is seen as unjustified, the dominant group will likely respond to the subordinates' rebellion with hostility. If the subordinates' rebellion is viewed as justified, the subordinates are given the power to demand change.&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; An example of this would be the eventual recognition of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s in the United States.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prejudice"/&gt;

===An extension to nations===
When group conflict extends to nations or tribes, regality theory argues that the collective danger leads citizens to start having strong feelings of national or tribal identity, preferring strong, hierarchical political system, adopting strict discipline and punishment of deviants, and expressing xenophobia and strict religious and sexual morality&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers |isbn=978-1-78374-403-9 |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Income Tax Germany 2010.png|thumb|German [[progressive tax]] rates for different incomes. Progressive tax systems require the rich to pay taxes at higher rates, to make it possible to raise larger total sums to pay for governmental functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Investopedia|title=The Advantages of a Progressive Tax|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue such systems are primarily for wealth redistribution.]]

'''Redistribution of income''' and '''redistribution of wealth''' are respectively the transfer of [[income]] and of [[wealth]] (including physical [[property]]) from some [[individual]]s to others by means of a social mechanism such as [[taxation]], [[charity (practice)|charity]], [[welfare]], [[public services]], [[land reform]], [[monetary policies]], [[confiscation]], [[divorce]] or [[tort]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/redistribution/ |title=Redistribution |date=2 July 2004 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |publisher=Stanford University |quote=The ''social mechanism'', such as a change in tax laws, monetary policies, or tort law, that engenders the redistribution of goods among these subjects|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term typically refers to redistribution on an economy-wide basis rather than between selected individuals.

Interpretations of the phrase vary, depending on personal perspectives, political ideologies and the selective use of statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|title=Fact Checker: Elizabeth Warren’s claim that the bottom 90 percent got ‘zero percent’ of wage growth after Reagan.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/23/elizabeth-warrens-claim-that-the-bottom-90-percent-got-zero-percent-of-wage-growth-after-reagan/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is frequently heard in politics, usually referring to perceived redistributions from those who have more to those who have less.  Occasionally, however, it is used to describe laws or policies that cause opposite redistributions that shift monetary burdens from wealthy to low-income individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Robert|title=Trump’s Stock in Trade is Cruelty. Count the ways.|url=http://www.newsweek.com/robert-reich-trumps-stock-trade-cruelty-count-ways-594472|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase can be emotionally charged and used to exaggerate or misconstrue the motivations of opponents during political debates.  For example, if an individual politician calls for increased taxes on higher income individuals, their sole focus may be to raise funds for specific government programs, tapping the largest available sources while realizing that low-wage workers have little or no excess income to draw tax revenues from. Political opponents might argue that this politician's prime motivation is to redistribute wealth, when redistribution is not their goal.

The phrase is often coupled with the term "[[Class conflict|class warfare]]," with high income earners and the wealthy portrayed as victims of unfairness and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FAIR|title=For Media, ‘Class War’ Has Wealthy Victims, Rich getting richer seldom labeled as belligerents.|url=http://fair.org/extra/for-media-class-war-has-wealthy-victims/|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redistribution tax policy should not be confused with [[predistribution]] policies.  "Predistribution" is the idea that the state should try to prevent inequalities occurring in the first place rather than through the tax and benefits system once they have occurred.  For example, a government predistribution policy might require employers to pay all employees a [[living wage]], not just a [[minimum wage]], as a "bottom-up" response to widespread income inequalities or high poverty rates.

Many alternate taxation proposals have been floated without the political will to alter the status quo. One example is the proposed "[[Buffett Rule]]", which is a hybrid taxation model composed of opposing systems, intended to minimize the favoritism of the special interest tax design.

The effects of a redistribution system are actively debated on ethical and economic grounds. The subject includes analysis of its rationales, objectives, means, and policy effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Cowell ([1987] 2008).

==History==
In ancient times, redistribution operated as a [[palace economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lukas|last=de Blois |author2=R.J. van der Spek |translator=Susan Mellor |title=An Introduction to the Ancient World|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|pages=56–60|isbn=0-415-12773-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These economies were centrally based around the administration, so the dictator or pharaoh had both the ability and the right to say who was taxed and who got special treatment.

Another early form of wealth redistribution occurred in [[Plymouth Colony]] under the leadership of [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]].&lt;ref name=commoncourse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/william-bradford|title=William Bradford – Facts &amp; Summary |publisher=History.com|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradford records in his diary that this "common course"&lt;ref name=commoncourse /&gt; bred confusion, discontent, distrust, and the colonists looked upon it as a form of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tYecOAN1cwwC&amp;pg=PA135 ''History of Plymouth Plantation''], p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term [[Distributism]] (also known as distributionism or distributivism) is an economic ideology that developed in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century based upon the principles of [[Catholic social teaching]], especially the teachings of [[Pope Leo XIII]] in his encyclical ''Rerum novarum'' and [[Pope Pius XI]] in ''Quadragesimo anno''.  More recently, [[Pope Francis]] in his ''Evangelii Gaudium'', echoed the earlier Papal statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunt III|first1=Arthur W.|title=Pope Francis Needs Distributism: Americans and popes alike can embrace a humane alternative to modern capitalism.|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/pope-francis-needs-distributism/|publisher=The American Conservative|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in economic systems ==
Different types of [[economic system]]s feature varying degrees of interventionism aimed at redistributing income, depending on how unequal their initial distributions of income are. Free-market [[capitalist]] economies tend to feature high degrees of income redistribution. However, Japan's government engages in much less redistribution because its initial wage distribution is much more equal than Western economies. Likewise, the [[socialist]] planned economies of the former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc featured very little income redistribution because private [[Property income|capital and land income]] – the major drivers of income inequality in capitalist systems – was virtually nonexistent; and because the wage rates were set by the government in these economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rosser|first= Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title= Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher= MIT Press|date=July 23, 2003|isbn= 978-0262182348|page = 11|quote=Economies vary based on the extent to which and the methods by which governments intervene to redistribute income. This depends partly on how unequal income is to begin with before any redistributive policies are implemented. Thus the Japanese government does much less redistributing than the governments of many other capitalist countries because Japan has a more equal distribution of wages than most other capitalist countries. Command socialist economies also have had less income redistribution because governments initially control the distribution of income by setting wages and forbidding capital or land income.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern forms of redistribution ==
Today, income redistribution occurs in some form in most [[Democracy|democratic]] countries through economic policies. Some redistributive policies attempt to take wealth, income, and other resources from the “haves” and give them to the “have-nots,” but many redistributions go elsewhere.

In his article ''Redistribution'',&lt;ref name="Redistribution"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Dwight R.|title=Redistribution|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwight R. Lee states:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 
“…most government transfers are not from the rich to the poor. Instead, government takes from the relatively unorganized (e.g., consumers and general taxpayers) and gives to the relatively organized (groups politically organized around common interests, such as the elderly, sugar farmers, and steel producers). The most important factor in determining the pattern of redistribution appears to be political influence, not poverty. “

“The direct transfer of cash and services is only one way that government transfers income. Another way is by restricting competition among producers. The inevitable consequence—indeed, the intended consequence—of these restrictions is to enrich organized groups of producers at the expense of consumers. Here, the transfers are more perverse than with Medicare and Social Security. They help relatively wealthy producers at the expense of relatively poor (and, in some cases, absolutely poor) consumers. Many government restrictions on agricultural production, for example, allow farmers to capture billions of consumer dollars through higher food prices (see [[agricultural subsidy]] programs). Most of these dollars go to relatively few large farms, whose owners are far wealthier than the average taxpayer and consumer (or the average farmer). Also, wealthy farmers receive most of the government’s direct agricultural subsidies."

|}

Some consider the U.S. government’s progressive-rate [[income tax]] policy as redistributive, because some of the tax revenue goes to social programs such as welfare and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Christine, and Gerald C. Wright. ''Keeping the Republic: Power and Citizenship in American Politics.'' 7th ed.: CQ, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Progressive tax|progressive income tax]] system, a high income earner will pay a higher tax rate (a larger percentage of their income) than a low income earner; and therefore, will pay more total dollars per person.&lt;ref&gt;Prante, Gerald, and Scott A. Hodge. "The Distribution of Tax and Spending Policies in the United States." Tax Foundation. N.p., 13 Nov. 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other taxation-based methods of redistributing income are the [[negative income tax]] for very low income earners and [[tax loopholes]] (tax avoidance) for the better-off.

Two other common types of governmental redistribution of income are [[subsidies]] and [[vouchers]] (such as [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]). These [[transfer payment]] programs are funded through general taxation, but benefit the poor or influential special interest groups and corporations.&lt;ref name="Redistribution"/&gt; While the persons receiving transfers from such programs may prefer to be directly given cash, these programs may be more palatable to society than cash assistance, as they give society some measure of control over how the funds are spent.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey S. Rosen &amp; Ted Gayer, Public Finance pp. 271–72 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the U.S. [[Social security|Social Security]] program redistributes income from the rich to the poor,  but the majority of those receiving Social Security earned their benefits through tax withholding from their paychecks or quarterly income statements, and most benefits are indexed to the actual earning levels of individual workers.  Only the highest- and lowest-income workers fall outside normal rates.  In addition, Social Security deductions are only taken from the first $200,000 in income, with nothing further taken from higher incomes over that amount. In other words, a person who earns $100 million a year pays the same Social Security tax as another worker who earns $200,000 a year.

Contrary to popular belief, a recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balls|first1=Andrew|title=Social Security Does Not Redistribute Income|url=https://www.nber.org/digest/may00/w7520.html#navDiv=6|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, overall, the Social Security System was slightly regressive against the poor and not redistributive, once important factors were taken into account (for example, the longer life expectancy of the wealthy when compared to the poor gives them more years to collect benefits).

Governmental redistribution of income may include a direct benefit program involving either cash transfers or the purchase of specific services for an individual. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;Rector, Robert. "The Redistributive State: The Allocation of Government Benefits, Services, and Taxes in the United States." The Heritage Foundation. N.p., 15 Sept. 2015. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Medicare is a government-run health insurance program that covers people age 65 or older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with [[end-stage renal disease]] (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant, sometimes called ESRD). This is a direct benefit program because the government is directly providing health insurance for those who qualify.

The difference between the [[Gini index]] for the [[income distribution]] before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Wealth redistribution can be implemented through [[land reform]] that transfers ownership of land from one category of people to another, or through [[inheritance tax]]es or direct [[wealth tax]]es. Before-and-after Gini coefficients for the [[distribution of wealth]] can be compared.

==Objectives==
The objectives of income redistribution are to increase economic stability and opportunity for the less wealthy members of society and thus usually include the funding of [[public services]].

One basis for redistribution is the concept of [[distributive justice]], whose premise is that money and resources ought to be distributed in such a way as to lead to a [[socially just]], and possibly more financially [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]], society. Another argument is that a larger [[middle class]] benefits an economy by enabling more people to be [[consumer]]s, while providing equal opportunities for individuals to reach a better standard of living. Seen for example in the work of [[John Rawls]],{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} another argument is that a truly fair society would be organized in a manner benefiting the least advantaged, and any inequality would be permissible only to the extent that it benefits the least advantaged.

Some proponents of redistribution argue that [[capitalism]] results in an [[externality]] that creates unequal wealth distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. A. ,''Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy''. Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{who|date=December 2011}} argue that wealth and income inequality are a cause of [[economic crises]], and that reducing these inequalities is one way to prevent or ameliorate economic crises, with redistribution thus benefiting the economy overall. This view was associated with the [[underconsumptionism]] school in the 19th century, now considered an aspect of some schools of [[Keynesian economics]]; it has also been advanced, for different reasons, by [[Marxian economics]]. It was particularly advanced in the US in the 1920s by [[Waddill Catchings]] and [[William Trufant Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Dorfman|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgoewer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Allgoewer|first=Elisabeth|date=May 2002|title= Underconsumption theories and Keynesian economics.

There is currently a great debate concerning the extent to which the world's extremely rich have become richer over recent decades. Thomas Piketty's ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'' is at the forefront, critiqued in certain publications such as ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Forget the 1%; Free Exchange", ''The Economist'', 8 November 2014, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral obligation ===
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}
[[Peter Singer]]'s argument contrasts to Thomas Pogge's in that he states we have an individual moral obligation to help the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utilitarianism.net/singer/by/1972----.htm|title=Famine, Affluence, and Morality, by Peter Singer|first=Pablo|last=Stafforini|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201106/fighting-poverty|title=Fighting Poverty|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US, British researchers [[Richard G. Wilkinson]] and [[Kate Pickett]] show a correlation between income inequality and higher rates of health and social problems ([[obesity]], [[mental illness]], [[homicide]]s, [[teenage birth]]s, [[List of countries by incarceration rate|incarceration]], child conflict, drug use), and lower rates of social goods ([[List of countries by life expectancy|life expectancy]], educational performance, [[Trust (social sciences)|trust among strangers]], [[Women's rights#2011 study of status by country|women's status]], [[social mobility]], even numbers of [[patent]]s issued per capita), on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/resources/slides|title=The Spirit Level - The Equality Trust|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argue inequality leads to the social ills through the psychosocial [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], [[Social status|status]] anxiety it creates.&lt;ref name=thinktanks&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/14/the-spirit-level-equality-thinktanks "The Spirit Level: how 'ideas wreckers' turned book into political punchbag"], Robert Booth, ''The Guardian'', 13 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the [[International Monetary Fund]] by Andrew G. Berg and Jonathan D. Ostry found a strong association between lower levels of inequality and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries (such as Brazil, Cameroon, Jordan) with high inequality have "succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years" but "longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2011/sdn1108.pdf "Inequality and Unsustainable Growth: Two Sides of the Same Coin?"] Andrew G.

==Criticism==
[[Public choice]] theory states that redistribution tends to benefit those with political clout to set spending priorities more than those in need, who lack real influence on government.&lt;ref&gt;Plotnick, Robert (1986) "An Interest Group Model of Direct Income Redistribution", ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'', vol. 68, no. 4, pp. 594–602.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialist economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] criticize redistribution via taxation in the context of [[Nordic model|Nordic-style]] [[social democracy]], highlighting its limited success at promoting relative egalitarianism and its lack of sustainability. They point out that social democracy requires a strong labor movement to sustain its heavy redistribution, and that it is unrealistic to expect such redistribution to be feasible in countries with weaker labor movements. They point out that, even in the Scandinavian countries, social democracy has been in decline since the labor movement weakened. Instead, Roemer and Bardhan argue that changing the patterns of enterprise ownership and [[market socialism]], obviating the need for redistribution, would be more sustainable and effective at promoting egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;"Market socialism, a case for rejuvenation", by Pranab Bardhan and Johen E. Roemer. 1992. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', vol. 6, no. 3, p. 104: "Since it (social democracy) permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labor movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxian economics|Marxian economists]] argue that social democratic reforms – including policies to redistribute income – such as unemployment benefits and high taxes on profits and the wealthy create more contradictions in capitalism by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system via reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.&lt;ref name="Market Socialism 1998. P.60-61"&gt;''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', by Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell. 1998. pp. 60–61: "The Marxist answers that...it involves limiting the incentive system of the market through providing minimum wages, high levels of unemployment insurance, reducing the size of the [[reserve army of labour]], taxing profits, and taxing the wealthy. As a result, capitalists will have little incentive to invest and the workers will have little incentive to work. Capitalism works because, as Marx remarked, it is a system of economic force (coercion)."&lt;/ref&gt; In the Marxist view, redistribution cannot resolve the fundamental issues of capitalism – only a transition to a socialist economy can.

[[File:Rodale Institute, Test Garden 01.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Rodale Institute, Test Garden]]
=== Late 1800s through 1960s ===
[[Julius Hensel]] (1844–1903) was an early advocate of restoring trace minerals to soil with dust from primeval stones and reported success with his steinmehl ([[Rock flour|stonemeal]]). He opposed the use of chemicals in agriculture. He claimed that his steinmehl could replace chemical and animal fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;Hensel, Julius. ''Bread From Stones: A New and Rational System of Land Fertilization and Physical Regeneration''. Republished by Acres USA, Austin, Texas, 1991. 102p.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Washington Carver]] (1864–1943) was one of the early proponents of sustainable agriculture. 

While botanist [[Sir Albert Howard]] (1873–1947) was in charge of a colonial research farm at [[Indore]], [[India]], he documented and tested Indian organic farming techniques. He refined the traditional Indian composting system into what became known as the Indore method. He shared this knowledge through the Soil Association in England and the [[Rodale Institute]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Sir Albert. An Agricultural Testament. London: Oxford University Press, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruth Stout]] (1884–1980) by the 1950s had perfected a "no-till" method of gardening that she promoted as "no work" in her books, ''How to Have a Green Thumb Without an Aching Back'' and ''Gardening Without Work for the Aging, the Busy and the Indolent''.&lt;ref&gt;Stout, Ruth. [http://www.motherearthnews.com/shopping/detail.aspx?itemnumber=5785#axzz3BbsMv8yn Gardening without Work].&lt;/ref&gt; Her work led to other innovations in no-till practices, such as ''slash and mulch'' in the tropics.

Agronomist [[William Albrecht]] (1888–1974), promoted the relationship between healthy soil and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifoam.org/en/dr-william-albrecht|title=Dr. William A. Albrecht - IFOAM|website=www.ifoam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jerome Irving Rodale|J.I. Rodale]] (1898–1971) was an early proponent of organic and regenerative farming and founder of the Rodale Institute. He encouraged organic gardening through his writings, research and publishing.

[[Lady Eve Balfour|Lady Evelyn Barbara "Eve" Balfour]] (1899–1990) was a founder in the organic farming movement. She was one of the first women to study agriculture at an English university, graduating from the University of Reading to begin farming in 1920. By 1939, she had launched Haughley, an experimental farm, to test organic farming. Her findings were published in ''Living Soil'' (1948), which became a classic. Haughley was the first long-term comparative research project to contrast organic and chemically-based farming.&lt;ref&gt;Balfour, Lady Eve. ''9,600 Miles Through The U.S.A. in a Station Wagon''. London: The Soil Association, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maynard Murray (1910–1983) pioneered the merger of biology, health and agriculture from the 1930s when he began experimenting with "sea-solids"–mineral salts that remain after total sea water evaporation. Around 1940, he conducted experiments to determine the proportions of trace minerals and other elements present in sea water that were optimal for growth and health of both terrestrial and marine life. His experiments demonstrated that plants fertilized with sea solids and animals fed sea-solid-fertilized feeds grow stronger and more disease resistant. Murray presented his work in ''Sea Energy Agriculture'' (1976). Largely ignored during his lifetime, he helped define the role of trace minerals in healthy growth.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Maynard. ''Sea energy agriculture''. 2nd ed. revised. Austin, TX: Acres, USA,  2003. vii, 109p. Nauta, Phil. Building soils naturally. Austin, TX: Acres, USA, 2012. xvi, 303p.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhaskar Save|Bhaskar H. Save]] (born 1922) created Kalpavruksha ("wish-fulfilling tree") Farm in Umbergaon, India in 1953. After practicing traditional agriculture with poor results, Save switched to organic farming and developed a system of natural farming. He used intensive interplanting in which short life-span vegetables (alpa-jeevi), medium life-span species (madhya-jeevi – such as banana, papaya and custard apple) and long life-span species (deergha-jeevi–such as chikoo, coconut, mango) are combined and phased in over time until the long-lived species matured.

Australian geologist [[P.A. Yeomans]] (1904–1984) developed the [[Keyline design]], an approach to farm planning and water management. Keyline used maps to analyse the [[topography]] to channel rain water into earthen dams for irrigation, build roads on ridges, plant trees in 'Contour Strip Forests', position farm buildings, arrange subdivision fencing and renovate pastures.&lt;ref&gt;Yeomans, P.A. ''The Australian Keyline Plan''. Sydney: P.A. Yeomans, 1954. [Source: The Holistic Agriculture Library and ''The Challenge of Landscape - The Development and Practice of Keyline''.

[[Masanobu Fukuoka]] (1913–2008) was a farmer, activist and author of the practices and theory of [[natural farming]] that he based on four core principles: no cultivation, no (chemical) fertilizers, no weeding and no pesticides. Among his teachings is that a successful farmer must partner with the natural environment and derive an intimate understanding of it together with the plants. His "seed balls" cultivation innovation is widely used in horticulture and retail products, including lawn seed.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuoka, Masanobu et. al.

[[Mechanical engineering|Mechanical engineer]] and ecologist [[John D. Hamaker]] (1914–1994) advocated remineralizing soils.

[[Booker T. Whatley]] (1915–2005), popularized U-Pick farms and their direct marketing approach through fee-based subscriptions. He was among the first practitioners of [[sustainable agriculture]] to focus on the economic concerns of small farmers, encouraging them to identify high value crops that could be profitable on smaller farms, such as [[shiitake]] mushrooms, the husbandry of small [[ruminants]] and specialty cheeses.&lt;ref&gt;Whatley, Booker T. ''How to Make $100,000 Farming 25 Acres''. [[Emmaus, Pennsylvania]], Regenerative Agriculture Association, 1987. 180 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Walters (1926–2009) was an economist, journalist, farmers advocate in the first phase of his career with the National Farmer's Organization; and founder, publisher and editor of ''Acres U.S.A''. Walters penned hundreds of articles and was author or co-author of books, including ''Eco-Farm'', ''Weeds: Control Without Poisons'' and ''Unforgiven''. In 1970 Walters coined the term "eco-agriculture" to unify the concepts of "ecology" and "economy" to reflect his belief that unless agriculture was ecological, it could not be economical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acresusa.com/eco-agriculture/|title=What is Eco-Agriculture? Acres U.S.A. Explains...|website=www.acresusa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Rodale]] (1930–1990) was an advocate of RA, fostered the Regenerative Agriculture Association, published books on the subject, funded research, established demonstration fields, sponsored practitioners in the field and spread RA around the globe. He coined the concept of 'regenerative organic agriculture' to distinguish it from 'sustainable' agriculture. He served as CEO of The Rodale Institute.

Patricia Lanza (b. 1935) authored books about "lasagna" gardening or sheet mulch gardening, as perfected by Ruth Stout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/ruth-stouts-system-for-gardening-zmaz04fmzsel.aspx Mother Earth News.] (article)&lt;/ref&gt; The lasagna method feeds the soil biota from above and encourages the soil food web to do the work of aerating and mixing the nutrients into the soil below.&lt;ref&gt;Lanza, Patricia.

Austrians [[Sepp Holzer|Sepp]] (b. 1942) and Veronica Holzer created hugekultur, a terraced system of mounds on Austrian mountainsides. The mounds are built of organic materials, a traditional way of growing in the region of the Krameterhof in Lungau, but at 1000+ meters above sea level. Holzer's mounds are considered one of the world's few perfectly working permaculture systems. After almost 40 years, their farms support pond culture, terraces, a water power station, thousands of fruit trees, thirty types of potatoes, grains, fruits, vegetables, herbs and wildflowers — growing in the forest, on steep hills, on rocky outcrops, on stone pathways and around ponds, all without the use of pesticides, herbicides or synthetic fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, Sepp. Sepp Holzer's Permaculture: A practical guide to small-scale,  integrative farming and gardening. White River Junction, VT: Chelsea Green Publishing, 2011. xix, 246p.&lt;/ref&gt; They created a video, ''Farming With Nature: A Case Study of Successful Temperate Permaculture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2ZY4gqCzO0&amp;list=PLDlzpZidSKy6lGumiKBLgKSAfKwHZ_Vsk|title=PERMACULTURE - CULTIVER AVEC LA NATURE - Sepp Holzer TRAILER|last=ecofilm|first=|date=15 August 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Takao Furuno]] (b. 1950) is the architect of the Aigamo Method, a modernization of an 800-year-old Chinese technique of using ducks in sustainable rice cultivation. Funuro's system combines commercial rice cultivation with duck husbandry, aquaculture and vegetable production. Aigamo ducks are derived from wild and domestic ducks, whose ducklings provide the labor for cultivation, pest control and manure to fertilize the rice. This eliminates dependency on chemical fertilizers, pesticides, [[Molluscicide|molluscicides]], fossil fuels and heavy duty equipment, providing a safe and productive environment.&lt;ref&gt;Furuno, Takao.

[[Biointensive agriculture#System|John Jeavons]] created Grow Biointensive, a sustainable 8-step food production method, which combines elements of French intensive and biodynamics techniques.

Jacob Mittleider created the Mittleider Method, a contemporary method of soil-less agriculture. Jim Kennard refined this method.&lt;ref&gt;Mittleider, Jacob.

Ecologist and gardener Don Weaver assisted John Hamaker in advocating for policies and practices of soil remineralization, biosphere regeneration and climatic stabilization.&lt;ref name="Hamaker, John D 1982" /&gt;

In the 1980s, [[the Rodale Institute]] began using the term ‘regenerative agriculture’.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/afsic-history-timeline|title=AFSIC History Timeline {{!}} Alternative Farming Systems Information Center{{!}} NAL {{!}} USDA|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodale Publishing formed the Regenerative Agriculture Association, which published books in 1987 and 1988.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/tracing-evolution-organic-sustainable-agriculture-tesa1980|title=Tracing the Evolution of Organic / Sustainable Agriculture (TESA1980)  {{!}} Alternative Farming Systems Information Center{{!}} NAL {{!}} USDA|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=By marching forward under the banner of sustainability we are, in effect, continuing to hamper ourselves by not accepting a challenging enough goal. I am not against the word sustainable, rather I favor regenerative agriculture.|sign=[[Robert Rodale]]|source=}}

However, the Institute stopped using the term in the late 1980s and it appeared sparingly (in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rodaleinstitute.org/a-truly-regenerative-agriculture/|title=A truly regenerative agriculture {{!}} Rodale Institute|website=rodaleinstitute.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2008) until they released a white paper titled "Regenerative Organic Agriculture and Climate Change" in 2014.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rodaleinstitute.org/regenerative-organic-agriculture-and-climate-change/|title=Regenerative Organic Agriculture and Climate Change {{!}} Rodale Institute|website=rodaleinstitute.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its summary states, “we could sequester more than 100% of current annual CO2 emissions with a switch to widely available and inexpensive organic management practices, which we term 'regenerative organic agriculture.'” The agricultural practices described are [[crop rotation]], [[compost]] application and reduced tillage,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; similar to most organic agriculture.

From 1990 to 2010, RA was most explicitly practiced within the permaculture community. Influenced by Carol Sanford and the design and development work of Regenesis,&lt;ref&gt;Regenesis Group, 2016. Regenerative Development and Design: A Framework for Evolving Sustainability: Wiley Publishing, Hoboken, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; the ecological systems approach of permaculture led regenerative agriculture to incorporate whole farm design, multi-story agroforestry and rotational livestock integration.&lt;ref&gt;Mollison, B. 1988.

Author and restorative development consultant [[Storm Cunningham]] (b. 1951) documented the rise of what he then called "restorative agriculture" in his first book, The Restoration Economy. He defined it as a technique that rebuilds the quantity and quality of topsoil while restoring local biodiversity (especially native pollinators) and watershed functionality. Carbon sequestration has more recently been added to that definition, to help achieve climate restoration. Restorative agriculture was one of the eight sectors of restorative development industries / disciplines in The Restoration Economy's taxonomy. The other seven were watershed restoration, ecological restoration, fisheries restoration, brownfields remediation, heritage restoration, infrastructure renewal and catastrophe reconstruction. &lt;ref name="Cunningham, Storm 2002"&gt;Cunningham, Storm.

Vermont farmer and farm consultant Abe Collins created LandStream to monitor ecosystem performance in RA farms.&lt;ref&gt;http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/sites/harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/files/grazing/Collins_Harvard%20Forest%202.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Shepard founded New Forest Farms in Viola, Wisconsin, and Forest Agriculture Enterprises and wrote ''Restoration Agriculture: Real World Permaculture for Farmers''. He demonstrated how to grow more calories per acre than corn and soy without inputs. He does this through a mix of RA practices, balancing nut crops, livestock and keyline.

Ethan Roland Soloviev and Gregory Landua, cofounded Terra Genesis International (a regenerative agriculture and supply company), published ''Levels of Regenerative Agriculture'' (2016). In this paper, they describe a four-fold framework consisting of:

* Functional Regenerative Agriculture: "humans can do good through their agricultural production"
* Integrative Regenerative Agriculture: "grow the health and vitality of the whole ecosystem"
* Systemic Regenerative Agriculture: "farms are woven into an ecosystem of enterprises operating in their bioregion"
* Evolutionary Regenerative Agriculture: "harmonize with the potential of a place," and "develop a diversity of global and local regenerative producer webs"

'''Scottish Landfill Tax''' (SLfT) is a tax which is charged in Scotland under the [[Landfill Tax (Scotland) Act 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/2/contents Landfill Tax (Scotland) Act 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced the [[Landfill tax#Landfill tax by country|UK Landfill Tax]] from 1 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/638/made The Scotland Act 2012, Section 31 (Disapplication of UK Landfill Tax)(Appointed Day) Order 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Revenue Scotland]] administers and collects SLfT with support from the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] (SEPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.revenue.scot/scottish-landfill-tax|title = Scottish Landfill Tax|accessdate = 2015-01-30|publisher = Revenue Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Finance/scottishapproach/landfilltax|title = A Scottish Landfill Tax|accessdate = 2015-01-30|publisher = Scottish Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rates of Scottish Landfill Tax (given in £/tonne) are £84.40 (standard rate) and £2.65 (lower rate) from 1 April 2016,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2016/94/made The Scottish Landfill Tax (Standard Rate and Lower Rate) Order 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; increased from the preceding year's rates of £82.60 and £2.60 respectively&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2015/127/article/2/made The Scottish Landfill Tax (Standard Rate and Lower Rate) Order 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Siteswap''' is a [[juggling notation]] used to describe or represent [[juggling pattern]]s. ''Siteswap'' may also be used to describe '''siteswap patterns''', possible patterns transcribed using siteswap. It encodes the number of '''beats''' of each throw, which is related to their relative height, and the hand to which the throw is to be made: "The idea behind siteswap is to keep track of the order that balls are thrown and caught, and only that."&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.juggling.org/help/siteswap/faq.html|title=Siteswap FAQ|last=Knutson|first=Allen|website=[[Juggling Information Service|Juggling.org]]|access-date=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an invaluable tool in determining which combinations of throws yield valid juggling patterns for a given number of objects, and has led to previously unknown patterns (such as 441). However, it does not describe body movements such as behind-the-back and under-the-leg. Siteswap assumes that, "throws happen on [[beat (music)|beats]] that are equally spaced in time."&lt;ref name="B&amp;L"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Beek|first=Peter J.|last2=Lewbel|first2=Arthur|chapter=The Mathematics of Juggling|title=The Science of Juggling|url=https://www2.bc.edu/~lewbel/jugweb/sciamjug.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104003/https://www2.bc.edu/~lewbel/jugweb/sciamjug.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016|dead-url=yes|journal=[[Scientific American]]|issn=0036-8733|language=en|date=November 1995|volume=273|issue=5|pages=92–97|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1195-92|bibcode=1995SciAm.273e..92B}} Also available at [http://www.juggling.org/papers/science-1/mathematics.html Juggling.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

Throws are represented, "by [[positive integer|{{bracket|positive}} integers]] that specify the number of beats in the future when the object is thrown again."&lt;ref name="Sethares"/&gt;

The numbers are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20728493|title=Juggling by numbers: How notation revealed new tricks|last=Gray|first=Laura|date=December 20, 2012|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=June 30, 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*0 = "missing"/rest [empty hand]
*1 = pass [between hands]
*2 = hold [one hand/no toss]
*3 = (3-ball) [[cascade (juggling)|cascade]] toss [between hands]
*4 = (4-ball) [[fountain (juggling)|fountain]]/[[columns (juggling)|columns]] toss [up and into same hand]
*5 = high toss [between hands]
*...
*a = 10 = high toss [up and into same hand]
*...

For example, a three-ball cascade may be notated "3", while a [[shower (juggling)|shower]] may be notated "5 1".&lt;ref name="B&amp;L"/&gt; The height, and thus difficulty, of throws increases exponentially and siteswaps above 5 are rare except in [[numbers juggling]]
 {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for claim of rarity of siteswaps above 5|date=December 2017}}. The name ''siteswap'' comes from the ability to generate patterns by "swapping" landing times of any 2 throws in a siteswap. For example, swapping the landing times of throws "5" and "1" in the siteswap "51" generates the siteswap "24" {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

==Vanilla==
[[File:Juggling53145305520.png|right|border|Diagram of someone "juggling" with the siteswap notation and the state]]
Its simplest form, sometimes called vanilla siteswap, describes only patterns whose throws alternate hands and in which one ball is thrown at a time. If we were to watch someone from above as they were juggling while walking forward, we might see something like the adjacent diagram, which is sometimes called a '''space-time diagram''' or '''ladder diagram'''.  In this diagram, time progresses from the top to the bottom.

We can describe this pattern by stating how many throws later the ball is thrown again. For instance, on the first throw in the diagram, the purple ball is thrown in the air by the right hand, next the blue ball, the green ball, the green ball again, and the blue ball again and then finally the purple ball is caught and thrown by the left hand on the fifth throw, this gives the first throw a count of ''5''. We end up with a [[sequence]] of numbers which denote the height of each throw to be made. Since hands alternate, [[parity (mathematics)|odd]]-numbered throws send the ball to the other hand, while even-numbered throws send the ball to the same hand. A ''3'' represents a throw to the opposite hand at the height of the basic three-[[cascade (juggling)|cascade]]; a ''4'' represents a throw to the same hand at the height of the four-[[fountain (juggling)|fountain]], and so on.

There are three special throws: a ''0'' is a pause with an empty hand, a ''1'' is a quick pass straight across to the other hand, and a ''2'' is a momentary hold of an object. Throws longer than ''9'' beats are given letters starting with ''a''. The number of beats a ball is in the air usually corresponds to how high it was thrown, so many people refer to the numbers as heights, but this is not technically correct; all that matters is the number of beats in the air, not how high it is thrown. For example, bouncing a ball takes longer than a throw in the air to the same height, and so can be a higher siteswap value while being a lower throw.

Each pattern repeats after a certain number of throws, called the ''[[Frequency|period]]'' of the pattern. The pattern is named after the shortest repeating segment of the sequence, so the pattern diagrammed on the right is 53145305520 and has a period of 11. If the period is an odd number, like this one, then each time you repeat the sequence you're starting with the other hand, and the pattern is '''symmetrical''' because each hand is doing the same thing (although at different times). If the period is an even number then on every repeat of the pattern, each hand does the same thing it did last time and the pattern is '''asymmetrical'''.

The number of balls used for the pattern is the average of the throw numbers in the pattern.&lt;ref name="T&amp;M"/&gt; For example, ''441'' is a three-object pattern because (4+4+1)/3 is 3, and ''86'' is a seven-object pattern. All patterns must therefore have a siteswap sequence that averages to an [[integer]]. Not all such sequences describe patterns; for example ''543'' with integer average 4 but its three throws all land at the same time, colliding.

Some hold to a convention in that a siteswap is written with its highest numbers first. One drawback to doing so is evident in the pattern ''51414'', a 3-ball pattern which cannot be inserted into the middle of a string of 3-throws, unlike its rotation ''45141'' which can.

===State diagrams===
Just after throwing a ball (or club or other juggling object), all balls are in the air and are only under the influence of gravity. Assuming you catch the balls at a consistent level, then the timing of when the balls land is already determined. We can mark each point in time when a ball is going to land with an ''x'', and each point in time when there is not yet a ball scheduled to land with a ''-''. This describes the '''state''' that you're in and determines what you can throw next. For instance, we can look at the state just after our first throw in the diagram, it is xx-&lt;!--two "-"s--&gt;-x. We can use the state to determine what can be thrown next. First we take the ''x'' off the left hand side (that's the ball that's landing next) and shift everything else to the left filling in a ''-'' on the right. This leaves us with x--x-. Since we caught a ball (the x we removed from the left) we can't "throw" a 0 next. We also can't throw a 1 or a 4, because there are already balls scheduled to land there. So assuming that the highest we can accurately throw a ball is to a height of 5, then we can only throw a 2, 3, or a 5. In this diagram, the juggler threw a 3, so an x goes in the third spot, replacing the -, and we have x-xx- as the new state.

[[File:StateDiagram3BallMaxThrow5.png|left|border|400px]]
The diagram on the left shows all possible states for someone juggling three items and a maximum height of 5. From each state you can follow the arrows and the corresponding numbers give you the siteswap. Any path which brings you back to the same state that you started with is a valid siteswap, and all siteswaps can be generated this way. The diagram becomes a lot bigger very fast when more balls or higher throws are introduced as there are more possible states and more possible throws. 

Another method of representing siteswap states is having the next throw on the right and read to the left (instead of the left to right system described above), represent a ball with a 1 instead of an x, and represent a spot where there's no ball scheduled to land with a 0 instead of a -. Then the state can be represented with a binary number, such as binary 10011 for the first state in the space-time diagram above. This method makes it a lot easier to represent more objects or higher throws as it is less complicated to create.

The table on the right contains the same information as the diagram on the left. To generate a siteswap, first find the row of your starting state. Reading across the row will give you the possible numbers you can throw and the column will give you the resulting state. Moving like this from state to state until you end up back in your starting state will give you a valid siteswap.

===Mathematical connections===
Vanilla siteswap patterns may be viewed as certain elements of the [[affine Weyl group]] of type &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_n&lt;/math&gt;. One presentation of this group is as the set of [[bijective]] functions ''f'' on the integers such that, for a fixed ''n'':  ''f''(''i'' + ''n'') = ''f''(''i'') + ''n'' for all integers ''i''.  If the element ''f'' satisfies the further condition that ''f''(''i'') ≥ ''i'' for all ''i'', then ''f'' corresponds to the (infinitely repeated) siteswap pattern whose ''i''th number is ''f''(''i'') &amp;minus; ''i'': that is, the ball thrown at time ''i'' will land at time ''f''(''i'').

A subset of these siteswap patterns naturally label strata in the positroid stratification of the [[Grassmannian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|last1=Knutson|last2=Lam|last3=Speyer|first1=Allen|first2=Thomas|first3=David|eprint=1111.3660|title=Positroid Varieties: Juggling and Geometry|date=November 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Several jugglers who have spent time in working on site swaps describe the same gain in flexibility and conceptual power that mathematicians seem to report from the use of well-chosen abstractions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|editor-last1=Borwein|editor-first1=Jonathan M.|date=1997|publisher=American Mathematical Society|book-title=Organic mathematics|conference=Organic Mathematics Workshop|page=141|isbn=9780821806685|oclc=36259883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions ==

=== Multi-handed ===

Multi-hand notation was developed by Ed Carstens in 1992 for use with his juggling program JugglePro.&lt;ref name="Lewbel"/&gt; Siteswap notation in its simplest form ("Vanilla siteswap") assumes that only one ball is thrown at a time.  It follows that any valid siteswap for two hands will also be valid for any number of hands, on the condition that the hands throw after each other.  Commonly used multi-hand siteswaps are ''1-handed (diabolo) siteswap'', and ''4-handed (passing) siteswap''.

'''1-handed (diabolo) '''

The siteswap is performed by a single hand, or a [[diabolo]] player throwing diabolos at different heights.

'''4-handed '''

Valid siteswaps can be juggled by a 4-handed juggler, or for 2 jugglers coordinating 4 hands, on the condition that hands throw alternately.

In practice, this is most easily obtained if the jugglers throw by turns, one sequence being (Right hand of juggler A, right hand of juggler B, left hand of A, left hand of B).

=== Synchronous ===
[[File:Juggling - 3-ball box (4,2x)(2x,4) ladder diagram.svg|150px|thumb|Ladder diagram for box: (4,2x)(2x,4)]]

Siteswap notation can be extended to denote patterns containing synchronous throws from both hands. The numbers for the two throws are combined in [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]] and separated by a comma. Only even numbers are allowed (each throw involves two hands, and thus only even numbers), so throws that move to the other hand are marked by an ''x''. Thus a synchronous three-prop [[shower (juggling)|shower]] is denoted ''(4x,2x)'', meaning one hand continually throws a low throw or 'zip' to the opposite hand, while the other continually makes a higher throw to the first. Sequences of bracketed pairs are written without delimiting markers.

=== Multiplexing ===
[[File:Multiplex333 33.gif|thumb|100px|3-ball Cascade with triplex: [333]33]]

A further extension allows siteswap to notate patterns involving multiple throws from either or both hands at the same time in a [[multiplex (juggling)|multiplex]] pattern. The numbers for multiple throws from a single hand are written together inside square brackets.  For example, ''[33]33'' is a normal 3-ball cascade, with a pair of balls always thrown together.

=== Passing ===
[[File:Classic 4beats passing 2juggler 6balls side.gif|thumb|100px|Four-count, or "Every others": {{nowrap|&lt;333P&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;333P&gt;}}]]

Simultaneous juggling: ''&lt;xxx|yyy&gt;'' notation means one juggler does 'xxx' while another does 'yyy'.  'p' is used to represent a passing throw.  For example, ''&lt;3p 3|3p 3&gt;'' is a 6 prop '2 count' passing pattern, where all left hand throws are passes and right hand throws are selves. This can also be used with synchronous patterns; a two-person 'shower' is then ''&lt;(4xp,2x)|(4xp,2x)&gt;''

If the pattern contains fractions, e.g. ''&lt;4.5 3 3 | 3 4 3.5&gt;'' the juggler after the bar is supposed to be half a count later, and all fractions are passes. If both juggle the same pattern (although shifted in time), the pattern is called a social siteswap and only half of the pattern needs to be written: ''&lt;4p 3| 3 4p&gt;'' becomes ''4p 3'' and ''&lt;4.5 3 3| 3 4.5 3&gt;'' becomes ''4.5 3 3''.

=== Other extensions ===
Various other enhancements to the siteswap system have been proposed and enjoy some use.
* Synchronous siteswaps that switch sides: patterns that repeat in mirror image can be abbreviated with a *.  For example, Instead of ''(4,2x)(2x,4)'' (3-ball box pattern), you can write ''(4,2x)*''.
* In [[#Programs|software]], files describing patterns may contain additional information. In Joepass, each throw can be given an individual delay (the equivalent of extending the holding time), thus allowing the description of irregular rhythms.
* Siteswaps may be considered either prime or composite. If a siteswap may be split into any valid shorter pattern which uses the same number of props, it is composite, and one which may not is prime.&lt;ref&gt;Beever, Ben (2001). "[http://www.jugglingedge.com/pdf/BenBeeversGuidetoJugglingPatterns.pdf Siteswap Ben's Guide to Juggling Patterns]", p.6, ''JugglingEdge.com''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810153015/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15026487/GJP.pdf |date=August 10, 2015 |title=BenBeever.com }}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 441, which uses three props, is prime, as 1, 4, 41, and 44 are not valid three prop patterns (as 1/3≠3, 4/3≠3, (4+1)/3≠3, and (4+4)/3≠3).

{{Italic title}}
[[Kenneth Arrow]]'s [[monograph]]  '''''Social Choice and Individual Values''''' (1951, 2nd ed., 1963) and a theorem within it created modern [[social choice theory]], a rigorous melding of social [[ethics]] and [[voting theory]] with an [[economics|economic]] flavor.  Somewhat formally, the "social choice" in the title refers to Arrow's representation of how ''social values'' from the ''set of individual orderings'' would be implemented under the ''constitution''.  Less formally, each social choice corresponds to the feasible set of laws passed by a "vote" (the set of orderings) under the constitution even if not every individual voted in favor of all the laws.

The work culminated in what Arrow called the "General Possibility Theorem," better known thereafter as [[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Arrow's (impossibility) theorem]]. The theorem states that, absent restrictions on either individual preferences or neutrality of the constitution to feasible alternatives, there exists no social choice rule that satisfies a set of plausible requirements. The result generalizes the [[voting paradox]], which shows that majority voting may fail to yield a stable outcome.

== Introduction ==
The Introduction contrasts voting and markets with dictatorship and social convention (such as those in a religious code).  Both exemplify social decisions.   Voting and markets facilitate ''social'' choice in a sense, whereas dictatorship and convention limit it.  The former amalgamate possibly differing tastes to make a social choice.  The concern is with formal aspects of generalizing such choices.  In this respect it is comparable to analysis of the [[voting paradox]] from use of [[majority rule]] as a value.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|In the simplest case of the voting paradox, there are 3 candidates, A, B, and C, and 3 voters with preferences listed in decreasing order as follows. 
:Voter 1:   A B C
:Voter 2:   B C A
:Voter 3:   C A B
By majority rule for 2-candidate votes, A beats B, B beats C, but C beats A.  Majority rule works for an individual selecting consistently among the 3 candidates but not necessarily for the "social choice" in any general sense. 
|}
Arrow asks whether other methods of taste aggregation (whether by voting or markets), using other values, remedy the problem or are satisfactory in other ways.  Here logical consistency is one check on acceptability of all the values.  To answer the  questions, Arrow proposes removing the distinction between voting and markets in favor of a more general category of collective social choice.

The analysis uses [[ordinal utility|ordinal rankings]] of individual choice to represent  behavioral patterns.   [[cardinal utility|Cardinal measures]] of individual  [[utility]] and, ''a fortiori'', interpersonal comparisons of utility are avoided on grounds that such measures are unnecessary to represent behavior and depend on mutually incompatible value judgments (p.&amp;nbsp;9).

Following [[Abram Bergson]], whose formulation of a [[social welfare function]] launched ordinalist [[welfare economics]],&lt;ref&gt;Abram Bergson, 1938. "A Reformulation of Certain Aspects of Welfare Economics," 1938. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 52(2), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1881737 p. 310]-334 ([http://google.com/scholar?q=cache:uoJ0KiOk-UwJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=80000000000000 [HTML.]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; Arrow avoids locating a social good as independent of individual values.  Rather, social values inhere in actions from social-decision rules (hypostatized as ''constitutional conditions'') using individual values as input.  Then 'social values' means "nothing more than social choices" (p.&amp;nbsp;106).

Topics implicated along the way include [[game theory]],  the [[compensation principle]] in [[welfare economics]], [[extended sympathy]], Leibniz's principle of the [[identity of indiscernibles]], [[logrolling]], and similarity of social judgments through [[Arrow's impossibility theorem|single-peaked preferences]], Kant’s [[categorical imperative]], or the [[decision making|decision process]].

== Terminology ==
The book defines a few terms and logical symbols used thereafter and their applied empirical interpretation (pp.&amp;nbsp;11–19, 23).   Key among these is the "vote" ('set of orderings') of the society (more generally "collectivity") composed of  individuals (“voters” here) in the following form:  
*'''Voters''', a finite set with at least two members, indexed as ''i'' = ''1'', ''2'', ... ''n''.
*'''Commodities''', the objects of choice (things that voters might want, goods and services), both private and public (municipal services, statecraft, etc.).
*A '''social state''' is a specification (formally, an element of a [[vector space|vector]]) of a distribution among voters of commodities, labor, and resources used in their productions. 
*The '''set of social states''',  the set of all 'social states', indexed as ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', . ., with at least three members.
*A (weak) '''ordering''', a ranking by a voter of all 'social states' from more to less preferred, including possible ties.
*The '''set of 'orderings'''', the set of all ''n'' orderings, one ordering per voter.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|Example: Three voters {''1,2,3''} and three states {''x,y,z''}. Given the three states, there are 13 logically possible orderings (allowing for ties).''*''  Since each of the individuals may hold any of the orderings, there are 13*13*13  = 2197 possible "votes" (sets of orderings).  A well-defined social-decision rule selects the social state (or states, in case of tie) corresponding to each of these "votes."

''*'' Namely, from highest to lowest ranked for each triplet and with 'T's indexing ties:
:x y z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;y T z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  (x z T y is the same ranking as x y T z, so is omitted, etc.)
:y x z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    y T x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;z
:z x y&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;x T y
:x z y&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    x T z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;y
:y z x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    y&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;z T x
:z y x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    z T y&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    z T y T x
|}The ordering of each voter ranks social states, including the ''distribution'' of commodities (possibly based on equity, by whatever metric, or any other consideration), not merely direct consumption by that voter.  So, the ordering is an "individual value," not merely, as in earlier analysis, a purely private "taste."  Arrow notes that the distinction is not sharp.  [[Resource allocation]] is specified in the production of each social state in the ordering.

The comprehensive nature of  ''commodities'', the ''set'' of ''social states'', and the ''set'' of ''orderings'' was noted by early reviewers.

The two properties that define any ordering of the set of ''objects'' in question (all ''social states'' here) are:

* '''connectedness''' ('''completeness'''): ''All'' the objects in the set are included in the ranking (no "undecideds" nor "abstentions") and
* '''transitivity''':  If, for any objects ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in the set, ''x'' is ranked at least as high as ''y'' and ''y'' is ranked at least as high as ''z'', then ''x'' is ranked at least as high as ''z''.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|A standard [[indifference curve|indifference-curve map]] for an individual has these properties and so is an ordering.  Each [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|ray]] from the origin ranks (conceivable) commodity bundles from least preferred on up (no ties in the ranking).  Each indifference curve ranks commodity bundles as equally preferred (all ties in the ranking).  
|}
 
The earlier definition of an '''ordering''' implies that any given ordering entails one of three responses on the "ballot" as between any pair of social states (''x'', ''y''):  ''better than'', ''as good as'',  or ''worse than'' (in preference ranking).  (Here "as good as" is an "equally-ranked," not a "don't know," relation.)  
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|The denotations of these three "ballot" options are respectively:

* '''x P y''' (voter prefers ''x'' to ''y'')
* '''x I y''' (voter indifferent between ''x'' and ''y'')
* '''y P x''' (voter prefers ''y'' to ''x'').

It is convenient for deriving implications to compact the first two of these options on the ballot to one, an "''at least'' as good as" relation, denoted ''R'':

* '''x R y''': voter either prefers ''x'' to ''y'' or is indifferent between ''x'' and ''y'' but not both.

The above two properties of an ordering are then axiomatized as:

'''connectedness''': For all (the objects of choice in the set) ''x'' and ''y'', either ''x R y'' or ''y R x''.

'''transitivity''':  For all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', ''x R y'' and ''y R z'' imply ''x R z''.

Thus, alternation ('or')  and conjunction ('and') of ''R'' relations represent both the properties of an ordering for all the objects of choice.

The ''I'' and ''P'' relations are then defined as:

'''x I y''':  ''x R y'' and ''y R x'' (''x'' as good as ''y'' means  ''x'' at least as good as ''y'' and vice versa).

'''x P y''':  not ''y R x'' (''y R x'' includes one of two options. Negating that option leaves only ''x P y'', the third of the original three options, on the ballot.)

From this, conjunction ('and') and negation ('not') of mere pairwise ''R'' relations can (also) represent all the properties of an ordering for all the objects of choice.  Hence, the following shorthand.   
|}
An [[Total order|ordering]] of a voter is denoted by '''R'''.  That ordering of voter ''i'' is denoted with a subscript as '''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;'''.

If voter ''i'' changes orderings, primes distinguish the first and second, say '''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;''' compared to '''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;' '''.  The same notation can apply  for two different hypothetical orderings of the same voter.

The interest of the book is in amalgamating sets of orderings. This is accomplished through a 'constitution'.  
  
*A '''constitution''' (or '''social welfare function''') is a ''voting rule'' mapping each (of at least one) set of orderings onto a '''social ordering''', a corresponding ordering of the set of social states that applies to each voter.

A social ordering of a constitution is denoted '''R'''. (Context or a subscript distinguishes a voter ordering ''R'' from the same symbol for a social ordering.)

For any two social states ''x'' and ''y'' of a given social ordering ''R'':

'''x P y''' is "social preference" of ''x'' over ''y'' (''x'' is selected over ''y'' by the rule).

'''x I y''' is "social indifference" between ''x'' and ''y'' (both are ranked the same by the rule).

'''x R y''' is either "social preference" of ''x'' over ''y'' or "social indifference" between ''x'' and ''y'' (''x'' is ranked least as good as ''y'' by the rule).

A social ordering applies to each ordering  in the set of orderings (hence the "social" part and the associated amalgamation).  This is so regardless of (dis)similarity between the social ordering and any or all the orderings in the set.  But Arrow places the constitution in the context of ordinalist [[welfare economics]], which attempts to aggregate different tastes in a coherent, plausible way.
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
| The social ordering for a given set of orderings as to the set of social states is analogous to an [[Consumer theory|indifference-curve map]]  for an individual as to the set of commodity bundles.  There is no necessary interpretation from this that "society" is just a big voter. Still, the relation of a set of voter orderings to the outcome of the voting rule, whether a social ordering or not, is a focus of the book.
|}

Arrow (pp.&amp;nbsp;15, 26–28) shows how to go from the social ordering ''R'' for a given set of orderings to a particular 'social choice' by specifying:

* the '''environment''', '''S''':  the ''subset'' of social states that is (hypothetically) ''available'' ([[Production possibilities frontier|feasible]] as to [[Factors of production|resource]] quantity and productivity), not merely conceivable.

The social ordering ''R'' then selects the top-ranked social state(s) from the subset as the ''social choice'' set.  
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
| This is a generalization from [[consumer theory|consumer demand theory]] with [[perfect competition]] on the buyer's side.  ''S'' corresponds to the set of commodity bundles on or inside the budget constraint for an individual. The consumer's top choice is at the highest indifference curve on the budget constraint.  
|} 
Less informally,  the '''social choice function''' is the function mapping each environment ''S'' of available social states (at least two) for any ''given'' set of orderings (and corresponding social ordering ''R'') to the '''social choice''' set, the set of social states each [[Element (mathematics)|element]] of which is top-ranked (by ''R'') for that environment and that set of orderings.

The social choice function is denoted '''C(S)'''.  Consider an environment that has just two social states, ''x'' and ''y'':  ''C(S)'' = ''C([x, y])''.  Suppose ''x'' is the only top-ranked social state.  Then C([''x'', ''y''])   = {''x''}, the ''social choice'' set.  If ''x'' and ''y'' are instead tied, ''C([x, y])'' = {''x'', ''y''}.  Formally (p.&amp;nbsp;15), ''C(S)'' is the set of all ''x'' in ''S'' such that, for all ''y'' in ''S'', ''x R y'' ("''x'' is at least as good as ''y''").

The next section invokes the following.  Let ''R'' and ''R' '' stand for social orderings of the constitution corresponding to any 2 sets of orderings.  If ''R'' and ''R' '' for the same environment ''S'' map to the same social choice(s), the relation of the identical social choices for ''R'' and ''R' ''is represented as: C(''S'') = C'(''S'').

== Conditions and theorem ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]] --&gt;
A constitution might seem to be a promising alternative  to dictatorship and  vote-immune social convention or external control.  Arrow describes the ''connectedness'' of a social ordering as requiring only that ''some'' social choice be made from any environment of available social states.  Since some social state will prevail, this is hard to deny (especially with no place on the ballot for abstention).  The  ''transitivity'' of a social ordering has an advantage over requiring unanimity (or much less) to change between social states if there is a maladapted ''status quo'' (that is, one subject to "[[path dependence|democratic paralysis]]"). Absent deadlock, transitivity crowds out any reference to the ''status quo'' as a privileged default blocking the path to a social choice (p.&amp;nbsp;120).

Arrow proposes the following "apparently reasonable" '''conditions''' to constrain the social ordering(s) of the constitution (pp.&amp;nbsp;25, 96-97).&lt;ref&gt;The [[mnemonic]] labels`for the conditions are those of Amartya K. Sen, 1970, ''Collective Choice and Social Welfare'', p. 41, with the following correspondence.&lt;br&gt;
Arrow  Sen&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''1' '''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''U'''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''P'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''P'''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''3'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;   '''I'''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''5'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''D'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1.  '''Universal (Unrestricted) Domain U''' (subsequently so called):  Every logically possible set of orderings maps to its own social ordering.

Each voter is permitted by the constitution to rank the set of social states in any order, though with only one ordering per voter for a given set of orderings.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|Arrow refers to a constitution satisfying this condition as '''collective rationality'''.  It can be compared to  the '''rationality''' of a voter ordering.  But the ''[[Universal prescriptivism|prescription]]'' of collective rationality, which Arrow proposes, is distinct from the descriptive use of a voter ordering, which he deploys. Hence, his denial at the end of the book that collective rationality is "merely an illegitimate transfer from the individual to society." (p.&amp;nbsp;120)
|}
*  2.  '''[[Independence of irrelevant alternatives#IIA in social choice theory|Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives]] I''': Let ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;'', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;' '', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;' '' be 2 sets of orderings in the constitution. Let ''S'' be a ''subset'' of hypothetically ''available'' (not merely ''conceivable'') social states, say ''x'' and ''y'', from the set of social states. For each voter ''i'', let the ranking of ''x'' and ''y'' be the same for ''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;'' and  for ''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;' ''. (Different voters could still have different rankings of the 2 social states.) Then the social orderings for the 2 respective sets of orderings select the same state(s) from the subset as the social choice.
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|'''Condition I''':  Let ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;'', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt; '' and ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;' '', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;' '' be 2 sets of orderings in the constitution. Let ''S'' be ''any'' subset of hypothetically available social states from the set of social states. For each voter ''i'' and for each pair of ''x'' and ''y'' in ''S'', let ''x &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;  y'' if and only if ''x &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;' y''. Then the social choice functions for the 2 respective sets of orderings map to an identical social choice set:   ''C(S)'' = ''C'(S)''.
|}
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|This identical mapping happens even with differences in rankings of any voter between the two sets of orderings ''outside that subset'' of social states.  Consider a hypothetical “run-off vote” between say only 2 available social states. The social choice is associated with the sets of rankings ''for that subset'',  not with rankings of unavailable social states ''beyond the subset''.  Thus, that social choice for the subset is unaffected by say a change in orderings only ''beyond'' the subset.    
|}Arrow describes this condition as an extension of [[ordinal utility|ordinalism]] with its emphasis on prospectively observable behavior (for the subset in question).  He ascribes practical advantage to the condition from "every known electoral system" satisfying it (p.&amp;nbsp;110).

*  3.  The (weak) '''Pareto Principle P''':   For any ''x'' and ''y''  in the set of social states, if all prefer ''x'' over ''y'',  then ''x'' is socially selected over ''y''.'''#'''
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|'''Condition P''': For any ''x'' and ''y'' in the set of social states, if, for every voter ''i'', ''x &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; y'', then ''x P y''.  
|}
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|As Sen suggests,&lt;ref&gt;Amartya K. Sen, 1970, ''Collective Choice and Social Welfare'', ch. 3.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Pareto unanimity (with universal domain) overrides ''any'' social convention selecting some social state.     
|}
The conditions, particularly the second and third, may seem minimal, but jointly they are harsh, as may be represented in either of two ways.

*  '''[[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Arrow’s Theorem]] [1]''':  The 3 conditions of the constitution imply a '''dictator''' who prevails as to the social choice whatever that individual's preference and those of all else.

An alternate statement of the theorem adds the following condition to the above:

*4.  '''Nondictatorship D''':  No voter in the society is a dictator.  That is, there is no voter ''i'' in the society such that for every set of orderings in the domain of the constitution and every pair of distinct social states ''x'' and ''y'', if voter ''i'' strictly prefers ''x'' over ''y'',  ''x'' is socially selected over ''y''.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "for every set of orderings in the domain of the constitution" is included here, though not Arrow's statement of '''D''', to remove an ambiguity suggesting that absolute indifference of a voter, negating the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]], would constitute dictatorship. On this, see Amartya K. Sen, 1970, ''Collective Choice and Social Welfare'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|'''Condition D''':  There is no voter ''i'' in {''1'', ..., ''n''} such that for every set of orderings in the domain of the constitution and every pair of social states ''x'' and ''y'', ''x &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; y'' implies ''x P y''.
|}
*'''[[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Arrow's Theorem]] [2]''':  The constitution is '''impossible''', that is, the 4 conditions of a constitution imply a contradiction.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|Each voter has an ordering (by attribution). Yet a set of orderings used as an argument of the voting rule does not carry over to a social ordering, with a corresponding loss of social adaptivity and constitutional generality, whether descriptive or prescriptive.
|}   
'''#''' Pareto is stronger than necessary in the proof of the theorem that follows above.  But it is invoked in Arrow (1963, ch. VIII) for a simpler proof than in Arrow (1951). In the latter, Arrow uses 2 other conditions, that with (2) above imply Pareto (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;97; 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;127):  
* 3a. '''[[Monotonicity]] M''' ('''Positive Association of Individual and Social Values'''), as in Arrow (1987, p.&amp;nbsp;125):  For a given set of orderings with social ordering ''R'', such that state ''x'' is socially preferred  to  state ''y'', if the preference for ''x'' rises in some individual ordering(s) and falls in none, ''x'' is also socially preferred to ''y'' in the social ordering for the new set of orderings.
Arrow (1951, p.&amp;nbsp;26) describes social welfare here as at least not negatively related to individual preferences.  
* 3b.  As defined by Arrow (1951, pp.&amp;nbsp;28–29), an '''Imposed Constitution''' is a constitution such that for some alternative social states ''x'' and ''y'' and for any set of orderings  ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;'', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;'' in the domain and corresponding social ordering ''R'', the social ranking is ''x R y''.
:'''Non-imposition N'''  ('''Citizens' Sovereignty'''): A constitution is not to be imposed.

Under imposition, for every set of orderings in the domain, the social ranking for at least one ''x'' and ''y'' is only ''x R y''.  The vote makes no difference to the outcome.  
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|For the special case of all preferring ''y'' over ''x'', the vote  still makes no difference.  If the invariant social ranking applies to only one pair of distinct social states, the constitution would violate '''N'''.  In this respect, as a representation of excluding convention, '''N''' is thorough.   
|}

==Proof==
The proof is in two parts (Arrow, 1963, pp.&amp;nbsp;97–100).  The first part considers the hypothetical case of some one voter's  ordering that ''prevails'' ('is decisive') as to the social choice for ''some'' pair of social states no matter what that voter's preference for the pair, despite all other voters opposing.   It is shown that, for a constitution satisfying '''Unrestricted Domain''', '''Pareto''' and '''Independence''',  that voter's ordering would prevail for ''every'' pair of social states, no matter what the orderings of others.   So, the voter would be a '''Dictator'''. Thus, '''Nondictatorship''' requires postulating that no one would so prevail for even one pair of social states.

The second part considers more generally a set of voters that would prevail for some pair of social states, despite all other voters (if any) preferring otherwise.  '''Pareto'''  and '''Unrestricted Domain''' for a constitution imply that such a set would at least include the entire set of voters.  By '''Nondictatorship''', the set must have at least 2 voters.  Among all such sets, postulate a set such that no other set is smaller.   Such a set can be constructed with '''Unrestricted Domain''' and an adaptation of the [[voting paradox]] to imply a still smaller set. This contradicts the postulate and so proves the theorem.

== Summary, interpretation, and aftereffects ==
The book proposes some apparently reasonable conditions for a "voting" rule, in particular, a 'constitution', to make consistent,  feasible social choices in a [[welfarism|welfarist]] context. But then any constitution that allows dictatorship requires it, and any constitution that requires nondictatorship contradicts one of the other conditions.  Hence, the ''paradox of social choice''.

The set of ''conditions'' across ''different'' possible votes refined [[welfare economics]] and differentiated Arrow's constitution from the ''pre-Arrow [[social welfare function]]''.  In so doing, it also ruled out any one consistent social ordering to which an [[agent (economics)|agent]] or official might appeal in trying to implement social welfare through the votes of other''s'' under the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abram Bergson]], 1954. "On the Concept of Social Welfare," ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 68(2), p. 242 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1884448 &amp;#91;pp. 233&amp;#93;-252] — an interpretation, which Arrow (1963, pp. 106-7) notes as in agreement with his own view of the constitution.&lt;/ref&gt;  The result generalizes and deepens the [[voting paradox]] to any voting rule satisfying the conditions, however complex or comprehensive.

The 1963 edition includes an additional chapter with a simpler proof of [[Arrow's Theorem]] and corrects an earlier point noted by Blau.&lt;ref&gt;Julian H. Blau, 1957. "The Existence of Social Welfare Functions,"  ''Econometrica'', 25(2), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1910256 p. 302]-313.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also elaborates on advantages of the conditions and cites studies of [[William H. Riker|Riker]]&lt;ref&gt;William H. Riker, 1958.  “The Paradox of Voting and Congressional Rules for Voting on Amendments.” ''American Political Science Review'', 52, p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1952321 p. 349]-366.&lt;/ref&gt;   and [[Robert A. Dahl|Dahl]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Dahl, 1956. ''A Preface to Democratic Theory'', pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95Zpl8C0-wYC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%22A+Preface+to+Democratic+Theory%22+39&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDvIKL8_Pv&amp;sig=zgye9PpbHZDDy25kKESWqXLxUPg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pqHhS_qGI8OBlAeOyfyLAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 39-41.]&lt;/ref&gt; that as an empirical matter [[intransitivity]] of the voting mechanism may produce unsatisfactory inaction or majority opposition.  These support Arrow's characterization of a constitution across possible votes (that is, collective rationality) as "an important attribute of a genuinely democratic system capable of full adaptation to varying environments" (p.&amp;nbsp;120).

The theorem might seem to have unravelled a skein of behavior-based social-ethical theory from [[invisible hand|Adam Smith]] and [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] on.  But Arrow himself expresses hope at the end of his Nobel prize lecture that, though the philosophical and distributive implications of the paradox of social choice were "still not clear,"  others would "take this paradox as a challenge rather than as a discouraging barrier."

The large subsequent literature has included reformulation to extend, weaken, or replace the conditions and derive implications.  In this respect Arrow's framework has been an instrument for generalizing [[voting theory]] and critically  evaluating and  broadening [[economic policy]] and [[social choice theory]].

The '''Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC)''' was a student activist group in the southern [[United States]] during the 1960s, which focused on many political and social issues including:   African-American [[civil rights]], opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], worker's rights, and feminism. It was intended, in part, to be [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|SDS]] for Southerners and [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] for white students{{snd}} at a time when it was [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|dangerous]] for SDS to attempt to organize in the Deep South and when SNCC was starting to discuss expelling white volunteers. It was felt that students at the traditionally white and black colleges in the South could be more effectively organized separately than in an integrated student civil rights organization; however, this was controversial and initially opposed by advisors like Anne Braden. Sue Thrasher and Archie Allen of the Christian Action Fellowship were among the founders of the group, with the support of [[Robert Parris Moses|Bob Moses]] and others.&lt;ref name="struggle-better-south"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Michel|first=Gregg|title=Struggle for a Better South: The Southern Student Organizing Committee, 1964-1969.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-60256-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7_0GgAACAAJ&amp;dq=southern+student+organizing+committee&amp;ei=BMNrS4WtJY-INqSFsZQL&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its inception, the group had close ties to controversial Louisville, Kentucky radicals Carl and [[Anne Braden]] and their organization, the [[Southern Conference Education Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6259523/The-not-so-silent-minority.html Ernst, John and Baldwin, Yvonne. "The not so silent minority: Louisville's antiwar movement, 1966-1975"] ''Journal of Southern History'' (February 2007). Retrieved April 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but a deliberate effort was later  made to put some distance between the SSOC and the Bradens to avoid the appearance that the SSOC was a Communist front.

After its founding, SSOC came to be formally tied to the SDS as a fraternal organization with a regional mandate in the South, and joint SDS-SSOC chapters existed at some schools like the [[University of North Carolina]]. A monthly organ,''The New South Student'', was published on a regular basis. In 1967, SSOC organizers led by [[The Great Speckled Bird (newspaper)|Gene Guerrero]] and [[Lynn Wells]], worked with [[TWUA]] on a unionization drive in North Carolina textile mills, involving more than 300 students in the campaign. In 1968, Gene Guerrero and Howard Romaine were among the SSOC activists involved in founding Atlanta's widely circulated [[underground press|underground newspaper]], [[The Great Speckled Bird (newspaper)|The Great Speckled Bird]].

SSOC considered itself a distinctly Southern organization and sometimes embraced traditional [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] symbols and language. In 1968, SSOC staged a series of antiwar protests called "Southern Days of Secession," in which they urged Southerners to "secede" from the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="new-left-revisited-48"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Left Revisited|editor=John Campbell McMillian, Paul Buhle|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2003|pages=48|isbn=978-1-56639-976-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Ohks41z2IC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=southern+student+organizing+committee&amp;ei=BMNrS4WtJY-INqSFsZQL&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=southern%20student%20organizing%20committee&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SSOC button was a Confederate flag with black and white hands shaking in front of it. The hands were modeled on a handshake between SSOC organizer Archie Allen and SNCC chairman John Lewis.  It was designed by an artist on the SNCC staff.

SSOC had an extensive literature program, printing thousands of copies of pamphlets on civil rights, the Vietnam war, poverty and campus reform that were sold on campus literature tables across the south.  The bestseller was entitled "Vietnam: The Myth and Reality of American Policy."  During the school year, it published a monthly magazine called The New South Student, copies now sell for a high premium on the internet. One of the magazine's features was a series called "The Roots of Southern Radicalism", which featured stories on historic predecessors of SSOC back to slave revolts, the American revolution, the abolition movement, the Populists, the union organizing drives of the 1930s, and institutions and organizations like Highlander Center, Koinonia Farms, and the Southern Conference for Human Welfare.  SSOC also organized a conference in Atlanta on Radical Southern History.

SSOC had four chairmen during its five-year history: Gene Guerrero, Howard Romaine, Steve Wise, and Tom Gardner. During its last year, it changed the post to two secretaries, Mike Welch and Lyn Wells, and added a newspaper called The Phoenix, to SSOC's list of publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crmvet.org/docs/64_ssoc_about.pdf|format=PDF|title=THE SOUTHERN STUDENT ORGANIZING COMMITTEE (SSOC) was organized in response to an urgent and growing need for communication and education in the South.|website=Crmvet.org|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SSOC leased the historic camp at Buckeye Cove in Swannanoa, North Carolina from the Fellowship of Southern Churchmen and held many conferences there. SSOC conferences had a variety of topics but were a way for southern activists, who often felt isolated on the conservative and largely segregated campuses of the time to meet like-minded students from other places and draw strength and inspiration from their activities.

Through a traveling teach-in on Vietnam and American foreign policy that toured southern states between 1967 and 1969, SSOC helped to organize the antiwar movement in the south. The appearance of SSOC delegations at national antiwar marches always resulted in enthusiastic applause.

For some Southern schools, even though SSOC had a presence, the numbers were so small in comparison to the size of the student bodies that it could not gain traction as anything but protest theatre. For example, SSOC organizers came to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, connected with a few individuals and left buttons and flyers with them and then departed. Of the 26,000 students on campus, only about ten were recruited.

Early in 1969 these individuals gathered in a highly resonant hallway and staged an "organizational meeting". On audiotape it sounded like hundreds were attending and a motion was made to follow SDS's example at Columbia University and take over the campus Administration building the next day.

The tape was "leaked" to the Administration of U.T. and, to the surprise of the participants, the next morning the campus was flooded with police, the windows of the Administration building were shuttered with wooden boards, and a truck was backed up to the doorway blocking entry while keeping the Administration locked inside. One of the members volunteered to brandish a toy water-pistol machine gun and parade back and forth in front of the building. Everyone else stayed out of sight. The individual was arrested and subsequently released. Nothing more happened.&lt;ref&gt;Personal recollection of Russ Reina&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, radicals in SDS increasingly saw SSOC as too liberal and too timid. SSOC finally dissolved itself in 1969 as the result of an internal struggle with members of [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor]], a Maoist sect, after members of PL had successfully passed a resolution at an SDS convention condemning SSOC's "anachronistic" regionalism and breaking the ties between the organizations.&lt;ref name="sds"&gt;{{Cite book|title=SDS|author=Kirkpatrick Sale|publisher=Random House|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''The Kudzu'': Birth and Death in Underground Mississippi" by David Doggett, in ''Voices from the Underground: Insider Histories of the Vietnam Era Underground Press'' ed. by Ken Wachsberger (Tempe, AZ: Mica's Press, 1993), p. 213-232. Doggett, who was at one point a candidate for president of SSOC, states that the conflict inside SSOC was a power struggle between a clique of SSOC headquarters staffers who were secretly Communist Party members, and insurgents from the Progressive Labor Party who had gotten control of some of the local branches.&lt;/ref&gt;

The breakup of SSOC came in 1969, the same year that its counterpart New Left Organizations, SNCC and SDS, collapsed—in part because of the COINTELPRO efforts, but in larger part because the movement had grown so widespread that the organizational forms of the early 1960s were no longer able to handle it. What SSOC organizer Ed Hamlett called "the radical beer-drinking five" on southern campuses became the long-haired pot-smoking hundreds (or thousands), and instead of getting ideas from mimeographed pamphlets, they could turn on the nightly news and see massive demonstrations and dramatic trials like those of the Chicago 7.

In the bitterness following the breakup of SSOC, the organization's papers were taken and burned, lest they fall into the hands of the FBI. This also threatened the memory of the organization and its efforts with becoming historically extinct. However, in the 1990s, a graduate student at the University of Virginia, Gregg Michel, decided to write his dissertation on SSOC and began contacting and interviewing old activists, and organized a reunion of them in Charlottesville, VA in 1994.  It turned out that many people had saved SSOC material, and were willing to donate them to an archive that was established at the University of Virginia Library.  Michel's dissertation was published as "Struggle for a Better South" in 2004 and the memory of the organization was brought back from the brink of historic oblivion. The book was launched with a panel at the American Studies Association convention in Atlanta in 2004 that brought together many SSOC and SNCC activists (including all four SSOC chairmen).

After the breakup of SSOC, two former members, Howard Romaine and Sue Thrasher, were instrumental in forming the [[Institute for Southern Studies]] with [[Julian Bond]].

[[Raymond Luc Levasseur]], later the leader of the [[United Freedom Front]], worked with the SSOC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EVpIpSuP1TkC&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;ots=_8X4xjiciX&amp;dq=%22Southern%20Student%20Organizing%20Committee%22%20levasseur&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Southern%20Student%20Organizing%20Committee%22%20levasseur&amp;f=false "Raymond Luc Levasseur"] ''Imprisoned Intellectuals''.

==History==
The Kansas City organization became unofficially established with a ''Declaration of Unity'' signed by [[Nation of Islam]] Student Minister Vincent Muhammad, Pastor Tony R. Caldwell of [[Community United KC]], Kenneth "Sasteh Meter" Mosley of [http://emwot.ws EMWOT](East Meets West of Troost), and more than three dozen other community improvement activists on September 17, 2011.

After several meetings and discussions in ensuing weeks, Pastor Caldwell, Captain Muhammad, Sasteh Meter Mosley, and other community leaders met at the [[Bruce R. Watkins Cultural Heritage Center]] on Feb. 11, 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kshb.com/dpp/news/local_news/community-leaders-hold-forum-to-stop-violence-in-kansas-city Community leaders hold forum to stop violence in Kansas City] [[KSHB-TV]], February 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and called for all interested persons to meet the following Saturday, February 18, and create a working organization.  On March 3, 2012, an organizational meeting elected officers, including a President and Vice-President, but in mid-May policy disagreements among officers resulted in that organizational structure being abandoned for a seven-member Advisory Council. Stop The Killing KC was formally incorporated on March 14, 2012, with a dedicatory "open house" April 7, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kshb.com/dpp/news/local_news/organization-opens-safe-house-to-help-tackle-violence Organization opens safe house to help tackle violence] [[KSHB-TV]], April 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In flyers publicizing the event, Stop the Killing KC lists more than seventy "partners" as being supportive in a "Stop The Killing KC [[Coalition]]":

==Incidents==
On May 14, 2012 a Kansas City woman named Andrea Shields was murdered and her body then set on fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.issuu.com/120525164057-30734a12318343e3b3107c8ddcf475d8/jpg/page_1.jpg Police Identify Woman Brutally Murdered And Set On Fire]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} [[The Call (Kansas City)]], May 25–31, 2012 edition&lt;/ref&gt;  Stop the Killing KC and other anti-violence organizations held vigils for and coordinated funeral arrangements for Shields. The funeral was scheduled for 2 p.m. Saturday May 26, 2012. Shortly after 4 a.m. that morning a drive-by shooter fired eight bullets toward Stop the Killing KC's headquarters building, seven rounds lodging in a vehicle parked in  front of the building, one round chipping siding near the building's "Stop the Killing KC" sign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fox4kc.com/2012/05/26/crime-fighting-organization-receives-threats Crime Fighting Organization Receives Threats][[WDAF-TV]], May 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, someone phoned Kansas City's "Tips Hotline" the day before, and demanded that Stop the Killing KC '"back off from the Andrea Shields investigation"'.  Because Stop The Killing KC is a "Crime Prevention" and pro-[[Civil Rights]] organization, Federal Law Enforcement agencies are investigating the incident along with Kansas City police.

'''Swatch Internet Time''' (or .'''beat time''') is a [[decimal time]] concept introduced in 1998 by the [[Swatch]] corporation as part of their marketing campaign for their line of "Beat" watches.

Instead of hours and minutes, the mean solar day is divided into 1000 parts called ".beats". Each .beat is equal to one decimal minute in the [[French Revolutionary calendar|French Revolutionary]] [[decimal time]] system and lasts 1 minute and 26.4 seconds (86.4 seconds) in standard time.  Times are notated as a 3-digit number out of 1000 after midnight.  So, @248 would indicate a time 248 .beats after midnight representing 248/1000 of a day, just over 5 hours and 57 minutes.

There are no time zones in Swatch Internet Time; instead, the new time scale of Biel Meantime (BMT) is used, based on Swatch's headquarters in [[Biel/Bienne|Biel]], Switzerland and equivalent to [[Central European Time]], West Africa Time, and [[UTC+01]].  Unlike civil time in Switzerland and many other countries, Swatch Internet Time does not observe [[daylight saving time]].

==History==
Swatch Internet Time was announced on October 23, 1998, in a ceremony at the Junior Summit '98, attended by [[Nicolas Hayek|Nicolas G. Hayek]], President and CEO of the Swatch Group, G.N. Hayek, President of Swatch Ltd., and [[Nicholas Negroponte]], founder and then-director of the [[MIT Media Lab]]. During the Summit, Swatch Internet Time became the official time system for [[Nation1]], an online country (supposedly) created and run by children.

===Uses===
[[File:SwatchBeat1.jpg|thumb|A Swatch watch showing .beat time in the bottom part of the display]]
During 1999, Swatch produced several models of watch, branded "Swatch .beat",  that displayed Swatch Internet Time as well as standard time, and even convinced a few websites (such as [[CNN.com]]) to use the new format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In March 2001, [[Ericsson]] released the T20e, a [[mobile phone]] which gave the user the option of displaying Internet Time. Outside these areas, it is infrequently used. While Swatch still offers the concept on its website, it no longer markets beat watches.{{Citation needed |date=July 2015}} In July 2016, Swatch released Touch Zero Two, its second wirelessly connected watch, with Swatch Internet Time function.

===Beatnik satellite controversy===

In early 1999, Swatch began a marketing campaign about the launch of their Beatnik satellite, intended to service a set of Internet Time watches. They were criticized for planning to use an [[amateur radio]] frequency for broadcasting a commercial message (an act banned by international treaties). Swatch reallocated the transmitter batteries to a different function on the [[Mir|Mir space station]], thus the satellite never broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Description==
The concept was touted as an alternative, decimal measure of time. One of the supposed goals was to simplify the way people in different [[time zone]]s communicate about time, mostly by eliminating time zones altogether.

===Beats===
Instead of hours and minutes, the [[solar day|mean solar day]] is divided into 1,000 parts called ".beats". Each .beat lasts 1 minute and 26.4 seconds. One .beat is equal to one decimal minute in [[Decimal time#France|French decimal time]].

Although Swatch does not specify units smaller than one .beat, [[Third-party developer|third party]] implementations have extended the standard by adding "centibeats" or "sub-beats", for extended precision: @248.00. Each "centibeat" is a hundredth of a .beat and is therefore equal to one [[Decimal time#France|French decimal second]] (0.864 seconds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Time zones===
There are no time zones; instead, the new time scale of Biel Meantime (BMT) is used, based on the company's headquarters in [[Biel/Bienne|Biel, Switzerland]]. Despite the name, BMT does not refer to mean [[solar time]] at the Biel [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] (7°15′E), but to the standard time there. It is equivalent to the [[Central European Time]] and [[West Africa Time]] or [[UTC]]+1.

Like UTC, Swatch Internet Time is the same throughout the world. For example, when the time is 875 .beats, or @875, in New York, it is also @875 in Tokyo: 0.875 × 24 hours = 21:00 BMT = 20:00 UTC. Unlike civil time in most European countries, Internet Time does not observe [[daylight saving time]] and thus it matches Central European Time during (European) winter and [[Western European Summer Time]], which is observed by the United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal and the [[Canary Islands |Canary Islands (Spain)]], during summer.

===Notation===
The most distinctive aspect of Swatch Internet Time is its notation; as an example, "@248" would indicate a time 248 .beats after midnight, equivalent to a fractional day of 0.248 CET, or 04:57:07.2 UTC. No explicit format was provided for [[calendar date|dates]], although the Swatch website formerly displayed the [[Gregorian calendar]] date in the order day-month-year, separated by periods and prefixed by the letter ''d'' (d31.01.99).

===Time unit conversion===
{| class="wikitable"
! Unit !! Beat Conversion
|-
| 1 day || 1000 .beats
|-
| 1 hour || 41.6 .beats
|-
| 1 min || 0.694 .beats
|-
| 1 s || 0.011574 .beats
|}

Note that units smaller than 1 .beat are not officially recognized by the standard.

===Calculation from UTC+1===
The formula for calculating the current time in .beats from [[UTC]]+1 is:

    (UTC+1seconds + (UTC+1minutes * 60) + (UTC+1hours * 3600)) / 86.4

Round down the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''tetractys''' ({{lang-el|τετρακτύς}}), or '''tetrad''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=24vBaQDNy8UC|title=The Theosophical Glossary|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''tetractys of the decad'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=36|author=[[Eduard Zeller]]|title=Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy|edition=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[triangular number|triangular figure]] consisting of ten points arranged in four rows: one, two, three, and four points in each row, which is the geometrical representation of the fourth [[triangular number]]. As a [[mysticism|mystical]] symbol, it was very important to the secret worship of [[Pythagoreanism]]. There were four seasons, and the number was also associated with planetary motions and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=DQpSA4CEnIwC| title = Pythagoras: pioneering mathematician and musical theorist of Ancient Greece| author = Dimitra Karamanides| publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group|year= 2005 |pages=65–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pythagorean symbol==

# The first four numbers symbolize the ''[[musica universalis]]'' and the [[Cosmos]] as: 
## (1) Unity ([[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]])
## (2) [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|Dyad]] – Power – Limit/Unlimited (peras/[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]])
## (3) Harmony (Triad)
## (4) Kosmos (Tetrad).&lt;ref&gt;''The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library'' by [[Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# The four rows add up to ten, which was unity of a higher order (The Dekad).
# The Tetractys symbolizes the [[classical element|four classical elements]]—[[fire]], [[air]], [[water]], and [[earth]].
# The Tetractys represented the organization of [[space]]:
## the first row represented zero [[dimension]]s (a [[Point (geometry)|point]])
## the second row represented one dimension (a [[Line (geometry)|line]] of two points)
## the third row represented [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in two dimensions|two dimensions]] (a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] defined by a [[triangle]] of three points)
## the fourth row represented [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|three dimensions]] (a [[tetrahedron]] defined by four points)

A [[prayer]] of the Pythagoreans shows the importance of the Tetractys (sometimes called the "Mystic Tetrad"), as the prayer was addressed to it.
{{quote|Bless us, divine number, thou who generated gods and men! O holy, holy Tetractys, thou that containest the root and source of the eternally flowing creation! For the divine number begins with the profound, pure unity until it comes to the holy four; then it begets the mother of all, the all-comprising, all-bounding, the first-born, the never-swerving, the never-tiring holy ten, the keyholder of all.&lt;ref&gt;Dantzig, Tobias ([1930], 2005) Number. The Language of Science. p.&amp;nbsp;42&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As a portion of the secret religion, [[Initiation|initiates]] were required to swear a secret oath by the Tetractys. They then served as novices for a period of silence lasting five years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

The Pythagorean oath also mentioned the Tetractys:
:By that pure, holy, four lettered name on high,
:nature's eternal fountain and supply,
:the parent of all souls that living be,
:by him, with faith find oath, I swear to thee."

It is said&lt;ref&gt;[[Introduction to Arithmetic]] – [[Nicomachus]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q-1o3tUGcXMC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=tetraktys+diatessaron&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R6YTUZrMAYXB0gWy_YCQDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tetraktys%20diatessaron&amp;f=false|title=The Musical Order of the World: Kepler, Hesse, Hindemith-Siglind Bruhn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:entry=musica-cn&amp;highlight=pythagorean%2Cpythagoras|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities(1890) – William Smith, LLD, William Wayte, G. E. Marindin, Ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Pythagorean musical system was based on the Tetractys as the rows can be read as the ratios of [[diatessaron|4:3]] (perfect fourth), 3:2 ([[perfect fifth]]), [[pythagorean interval#diapason|2:1]] (octave), forming the basic intervals of the Pythagorean scales. That is, Pythagorean scales are generated from combining pure fourths (in a 4:3 relation), pure fifths (in a 3:2 relation), and the simple ratios of the unison [[unison|1:1]] and the octave [[octave|2:1]].  Note that the [[diapason (interval)|diapason]], 2:1 (octave), and the diapason plus diapente, 3:1 (compound fifth or perfect twelfth), are consonant intervals according to the tetractys of the decad, but that the diapason plus diatessaron, 8:3 (compound fourth or perfect eleventh), is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0386%3Asection%3D14|title=Plutarch, De animae procreatione in Timaeo – Goodwin, Ed.(lang.:English)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ehDG5mGUYAMC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=tetraktys+diatessaron&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R6YTUZrMAYXB0gWy_YCQDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tetraktys%20diatessaron&amp;f=false|title=Sacred Architecture of London – Nigel Pennick}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Tetractys [also known as the decad] is an [[equilateral triangle]] formed from the sequence of the first ten numbers aligned in four rows. It is both a [[mathematics|mathematical]] idea and a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] symbol that embraces within itself—in seedlike form—the principles of the natural world, the [[harmony]] of the cosmos, the ascent to the divine, and the mysteries of the divine realm. So revered was this ancient symbol that it inspired ancient philosophers to swear by the name of the one who brought this gift to humanity.}}

==Kabbalist symbol==
[[Image:Boehme-heart.jpg|thumb|right|Symbol by early 17th-century Christian mystic [[Jakob Böhme]], including a tetractys of flaming Hebrew letters of the Tetragrammaton.]]
[[Image:Tetragrammaton-Tetractys.png|thumb|A tetractys of the letters of the Tetragrammaton adds up to 72 by [[gematria]].]]
There are some {{who?|date=April 2018}} who believe that the tetractys and its mysteries influenced the early [[Kabbalah]]. A Hebrew tetractys has the letters of the [[Tetragrammaton]] inscribed on the ten positions of the tetractys, from right to left. It has been argued that the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Kabbalistic Tree of Life]], with its ten spheres of emanation, is in some way connected to the tetractys, but its form is not that of a triangle. The occultist [[Dion Fortune]] writes: 
:The [[Point (geometry)|point]] is assigned to [[Keter|Kether]]; 
:the [[Line (geometry)|line]] to [[Chokhmah|Chokmah]];
:the two-dimensional [[plane (geometry)|plane]] to [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]]; 
:consequently the three-dimensional [[Solid geometry|solid]] naturally falls to [[Chesed]].&lt;ref&gt;The Mystical Qabalah, Dion Fortune, Chapter XVIII, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between geometrical shapes  and the first four [[Sephirot]] is analogous to the geometrical correlations in Tetraktys, shown above under &lt;span style="font-size:0.9em; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Pythagorean Symbol&lt;/span&gt;, and unveils the relevance of the Tree of Life with the Tetraktys.

==Tarot card reading arrangement==
In a [[Divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot|Tarot reading]], the various positions of the tetractys provide a representation for forecasting future events by signifying according to various occult disciplines, such as Alchemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/PT/D-tet.html|title=Tetractys Spread|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below is only a single variation for interpretation.

The first row of a single position represents the Premise of the reading, forming a foundation for understanding all the other cards.

The second row of two positions represents the cosmos and the individual and their relationship.
* The Light Card to the right represents the influence of the cosmos leading the individual to an action.
* The Dark Card to the left represents the reaction of the cosmos to the actions of the individual.

The third row of three positions represents three kinds of decisions an individual must make.
* The Creator Card is rightmost, representing new decisions and directions that may be made.
* The Sustainer Card is in the middle, representing decisions to keep balance, and things that should not change.
* The Destroyer Card is leftmost, representing old decisions and directions that should not be continued.

The fourth row of four positions represents the four Greek elements.
* The Fire card is rightmost, representing dynamic creative force, ambitions, and personal [[will (philosophy)|will]].
* The Water card is to the right middle, representing the [[emotion]]s, feelings, and whims.
* The Air card is to the left middle, representing the mind, [[thought]]s, and strategies toward goals.
* The Earth card is leftmost, representing physical [[reality|realities]] of day to day living.

==Occurrence==
[[Image:Template-Metropolitan Archbishop.svg|thumb|100px|right|[[Coat of arms]] of an [[archbishop]] of the [[Catholic Church]]]]
The tetractys occurs (generally coincidentally) in the following:
* the [[Eightfold Way (physics)|baryon decuplet]]
* an [[archbishop]]'s [[coat of arms]]
* the arrangement of pins in [[ten-pin bowling]]
* a [[Chinese checkers]] board
* the [[Formation_(association_football)#4–3–2–1 (the "Christmas Tree" formation)|"Christmas Tree" formation]] in [[association football]]

==In poetry==
In English-language poetry, a tetractys is a syllable-counting form with five lines.  The first line has one syllable, the second has two syllables, the third line has three syllables, the fourth line has four syllables, and the fifth line has ten syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.volecentral.co.uk/vf/englishsyllable.htm#Tetractys|title=English Syllable Counters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sample tetractys would look like this:

:''&lt;span style="font-size:0.9em; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Mantrum&lt;/span&gt;
:''Your /
:''fury /
:''confuses /
:''us all greatly. /
:''Volatile, big-bodied tots are selfish.  //''

The tetractys was created by Ray Stebbing, who said the following about his newly created form:

:''"The tetractys could be Britain's answer to the haiku. Its challenge is to express a complete thought, profound or comic, witty or wise, within the narrow compass of twenty syllables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bensonofjohn.co.uk/poetry/formssearch.php?searchbox=Tetractys Search result for Tetractys]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], also known as ISIS, ISIL, and the Daesh, is a terrorist group located in Northern [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]]. The group sophisticatedly utilizes social media as a tool to spread terror around the world in addition to international recruitment efforts. The Islamic State is widely known for its posting of disturbing contents such as beheading videos on the internet. The Islamic State creates its own online content such as videos, magazines, and flyers. This propaganda is disseminated through websites and many social media platforms such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Telegram (messaging service)|Telegram]], and [[YouTube]]. By utilizing [[social media]], the organization has garnered a strong following and successfully recruited thousands of followers. Additionally, the organization has recruited members from Western countries including the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/06/16/cnn-cias-terror-report-didnt-inspire-much-hope-n2179302|title=CIA Director Gives Grim Assessment of Fight Against ISIS|last=O'Brien|first=Cortney|work=Townhall|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has been connected to deadly shootings such as the [[Paris attack of January 2015|Paris attack]] and the [[Pulse nightclub shooting|Pulse Nightclub Shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/06/16/cnn-cias-terror-report-didnt-inspire-much-hope-n2179302|title=CIA Director Gives Grim Assessment of Fight Against ISIS|last=O'Brien|first=Cortney|work=Townhall|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Flag of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.png|thumb|Flag of the Islamic State]]
In response to the international rise of the group, many websites and social media platforms have banned accounts and removed content promoting the Islamic State from their platforms.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Target audience ==
ISIS targets a variety of different groups both in the [[Middle East]] and [[Western world|Western Countries]]. There are a wide variety of motives for why fighters may be prompted to join [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS.]] Quantum researchers cite nine attributes characteristic of a fighter looking to join ISIS: status seeking, identity seeking, revenge, redemption, thrill, ideology, justice, and death.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/12/why-people-join-isis/419685/|title=Why Join ISIS? How Fighters Respond When You Ask Them|last=Tucker|first=Patrick|date=|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-11-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard ISIS recruit, both from the Middle East and Western countries, is relatively young. The average age of ISIS fighters is around 26 years old, with 86% of recruits being male.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Middle Eastern recruits come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds in Northern Iraq. Recent destruction in the [[Iraq War]] and [[Syrian Civil War]] has created hatred of [[Western Powers]] in the region.
[[File:İD bayrağı ile bir militan.jpg|thumb|

]]
Western recruits are often 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants.  Computer scientists Zeeshan ul-hassan Usmani also found that the majority of the Western recruits don’t feel “at home” in their home country. As a result, these fighters often have desires to go abroad and escape conditions in their home country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/15/news/economy/isis-recruit-characteristics/index.html|title=Big Data reveals the surprising profile of an ISIS recruit|last=Long|first=Heather|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to recruitment, ISIS's social media presence is also meant to intimidate and spread terror around the world. ISIS's posting of beheadings and other execution videos primarily target the Western world.

== Content and messages ==
ISIS produces propaganda videos that range from video executions to full-length documentaries. The videos have a high production quality and incorporate montages, slow motion scenes, and are often accompanied by a short dialogue. ISIS has a dedicated team of over 100 media insurgents dedicated to recording these videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-propaganda-terror-group-losses-syria-iraq-a7228286.html|title=The new Isis magazine is hiding a huge signal the group's days may be numbered|date=2016-09-06|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISIS executions typically consist of [[ISIL beheading incidents|beheadings]] or mass shootings in retaliation to western intervention in ISIS territory. The particular videos that ISIS often post include executions of “enemies of the [[Caliphate]],” which often consist of westerners or Jordanian nationals. Most infamously, an executioner named [[Jihadi John]] was seen in many of these videos prior to his death in 2015. [[Jihadi John]] is notorious for executing many US, UK, and Japanese citizens such as [[Steven Sotloff]], [[David Haines (aid worker)|David Haines]], and [[Alan Henning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-31641569|title=Who is Mohammed Emwazi?|last=Casciani|first=Dominic|date=2015-11-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many of the videos and materials produced by ISIS, there is the theme of inclusion and brotherhood. Additionally, the videos also focus on 3 main messages:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/ISW%20The%20Virtual%20Caliphate%20Gambhir%202016.pdf|title=Virtual Caliphate|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Convey Narrative of Global War and Ultimate Victory
# Radicalize Populations Globally
# Encourage international lone state actor and small cell attacks in support of ISIS
These messages can be seen throughout all content produced by the Islamic State such as war documentaries, execution videos, and [[Rumiyah (magazine)]].

== Social media usage ==
From 2013 to 2014, the organization primarily used mainstream platforms such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[YouTube|Youtube]]. In 2014, these large social media platforms removed ISIS content. Since then, ISIS has chosen to utilize social media platforms that either protect their content or allow for content to quickly be reposted. These platforms of choice are [[Telegram (messaging service)|Telegram]], [[JustPaste.it|Justpaste.it]], and [[Surespot]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

ISIS also implements marketing initiatives like “Jihadist Follow Friday,” which encourages users to follow new ISIS-related accounts each Friday.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Wright, Shaun; Denney, David; Pinkerton, Alasdair; Jansen, Vincent A.A.; Bryden, John (2016-05-17). "Resurgent Insurgents: Quantitative Research Into Jihadists Who Get Suspended but Return on Twitter". Journal of Terrorism Research. 7 (2). ISSN 2049-7040. doi:10.15664/jtr.1213.&lt;/ref&gt; This specific [[hashtag]] mirrors commonly used hashtags such as #motivation monday or #throwbackthursday. To augment their online presence and popularity, the organization encourages their followers to use a plethora of arabic hashtags, which translate to #theFridayofSupportingISIS, and #CalamityWillBefalltheUS. This allows them to gain followers each week while promoting their community and message on a weekly basis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Berger, Morgan (2015-03-05). "Defining and describing the population of ISIS supporters on Twitter". The Brookings Institution. Retrieved 2016-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Twitter ===
During 2014, there was an estimated 46,000-90,000 Twitter accounts that advocated for ISIS or were run by supporters of the group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2015, Twitter reported that it banned 125,000 ISIS sympathetic accounts.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Koerner, Brendan I. “Why ISIS Is Winning the Social Media War.” Wired, Conde Nast, 1 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it published an update of 325,000 deleted accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Twitter Inc. “An Update on Our Efforts to Combat Violent Extremism.” ''Twitter'', Twitter, 18 Aug. 2016, blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2016/an-update-on-our-efforts-to-combat-violent-extremism.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many accounts have been suspended, ISIS supporters often create new accounts. Twitter defines those who recreate accounts as “resurgents” and explains that these are often difficult accounts to remove completely, since they tend to pop back up in alternate forms. It is estimated that approximately 20% of all ISIS affiliated Twitter accounts can be traced back to fake accounts created by the same user. Many of these accounts are traced back to the “Baqiya family,” which is an online network of thousands of ISIS followers.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; Many of these accounts are active during important ISIS military victories. During the ISIS march on Mosul, there were about 42,000 tweets on Twitter supporting the invasion.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Telegram ===
During 2014, ISIS became very active on [[Telegraphy|Telegram]] after many major social media platforms banned ISIS content and sympathetic accounts. Telegram is an encrypted messaging application. The platform by nature is created as an end-to-end user encryption platform. Further, it also has special features such as the self-destruct timer which erase all evidence and messages. The app has a user data protection policy because violating this policy could potentially damage the app’s brand of customer privacy. Government agencies have been unable to break Telegram's encryption technology.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/world/2017/6/30/15886506/terrorism-isis-telegram-social-media-russia-pavel-durov-twitter|title=Russia wants to stop terrorists by banning their app of choice. Good luck.|work=Vox|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Telegram, ISIS often uses the hashtag #KhilafahNews to attract their users. Telegram is used by ISIS to plan social media campaigns on alternate platforms. The organization also uses Telegram as an anchor platform to connect with their user base when their other accounts are banned on Twitter and Facebook.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In July 2017, Telegram came under scrutiny from the media and news media outlets. It has been documented that ISIS gunmen have used this app to maintain contact with ISIS leaders in [[Raqqa campaign (2016–2017)|Raqqa]] days before terror attacks in Turkey, [[Berlin]], and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. Despite concerns from Western media, there has been little to no action taken against ISIS accounts on Telegram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/isis-winning-social-media-war-heres-beat/|title=Why ISIS Is Winning the Social Media War—And How to Fight Back|last=Koerner|first=Brendan I.|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Justpaste.it ===
[[JustPaste.it|Justpaste.it]], an anonymous photo and text sharing website, has also been utilized heavily. With the option to lock images, the website allows anonymous users to send and receive content without registration. For this reason, ISIS members have shared photos of countless murders, executions, and battlegrounds onto the app to be disseminated to other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/islamic-state-twitter-110418?o=1|title=Loose Tweets Sink Ships--Will the Islamic State’s aggressive Internet strategy expose it to investigators?|last=Silverman|first=Jacob|date=August 28, 2014|work=Politico|access-date=November 2, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to stop ISIS from using the website, there is only one option: shutting it down. However, founder Mariusz Żurawek has previously stated his opinion against doing so. He stated, "I do not want to interfere with any type of conflict and stay on one side. Justpaste.it has many users. I cannot focus on a single group. I don’t see any reason why they should shut down the service. Should they shut down Twitter, too?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/-sp-polish-man-website-isis-propaganda-tool|title=How a Polish student's website became an Isis propaganda tool|last=Fishwick|first=Carmen|date=August 15, 2014|work=The Guardian|access-date=November 1, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Justpaste.it removed graphic content from the website—this prompted ISIS to launch their own content-sharing pages. These new options include Manbar.me, in 2014, Nasher.me in January 2015, and Alors.ninja, in July 2015.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stalinsky|first=Steven|date=June 6, 2016|title=The Jihadi Cycle On Content-Sharing Web Services 2009-2016 And The Case Of Justpaste.it: Favored By ISIS, Al-Qaeda, And Other Jihadis For Posting Content And Sharing It On Twitter - Jihadis Move To Their Own Platforms (Manbar, Nashir, Alors.Ninja) But Then Return To Justpaste.it|url=https://www.memri.org/reports/jihadi-cycle-content-sharing-web-services-2009-2016-and-case-justpasteit-favored-isis-al|journal=Inquiry &amp; Analysis Series|volume=No.1255|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISIS social media offices relied most heavily on Manbar.me to distribute propagandist photos of battles and city raids. In 2016, ISIS introduced PasteMaker and Sharetext, which mirrored the encrypted messages of Justpaste.it. Despite creating their own platforms periodically, they were considerably more difficult to navigate; thus ISIS returned to using Justpaste.it.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== The Dawn of Glad Tidings - Smartphone Application ===
ISIS created The Dawn of Glad Tidings, an Arabic Language application. This app shares many of the tweets, pictures, and videos from ISIS sympathetic Twitter accounts. Additionally, it allowed users to see and monitor hashtags, tweets, images, videos, and comments that were posted on their accounts. The application was originally intended for ISIS followers to have a private online forum to communicate.  This app was downloaded several hundred times on the Google Play app store before being taken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2014-06-17/isiss-official-app-available-to-download-on-google-play/|title=Isis official app available to download on Google Play|work=ITV News|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Offline impact ===
As the November 2015 attacks in Paris demonstrate, ISIS also resorts to old-fashioned methods of communication and [[propaganda]]. Lewis notes that the attacks in Paris represent a '[[propaganda of the deed]]', a method developed by 19th century anarchists in Europe. The November 2015 ISIS attacks were perpetrated without prior warning, largely because the operatives met face-to-face and used other [[non-digita]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l means of communication. Additionally, it is common for ISIS to claim responsibility of many terror attacks around the world such as the [[Paris attacks of January 2015|Paris Attacks]], the [[Pulse nightclub shooting|Pulse night club shooting]], and the Las Vegas attack.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Usage of the dark web ==
ISIS’s activities on the [[surface web]] are subject to scrutiny and regulations by corporations, government agencies, and hackers. ISIS has been forced to look for a new online safe haven. ISIS also posts a variety of content on the [[Dark web|Dark Web]]. The Dark Web is untraceable and provides complete anonymity to both the viewer and the original poster. They also actively publish a variety of their content on the dark web as well as their own internally generated platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand, Natasha. “ISIS Is Taking Full Advantage of the Darkest Corners of the Internet.” Business Insider, Business Insider, 11 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; ISIS's usage of dark web has made [[anti-terrorism]] work more difficult.

Using the dark web, ISIS has made their own platform to increase their ability to spread their message. Without the intervention of corporate actors or government entities, ISIS has been able to freely spread their messages on their own platforms and websites. In 2017, Europol, the European Police, was able to uncover 52 unique online ISIS networks on the dark web. These 52 unique networks contained over 2,000 unique extremist items.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

== Relevant impact of the ISIS social media usage ==
ISIS social media posts have mobilized ordinary citizens throughout the world and other radical [[Jihadist terrorism|jihadists]] groups to act upon their digitized demands. Their methods have worked to effectively recruit younger individuals to join their groups in a consolidated setting. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and [[YouTube|Youtube]] are more impressionable mediums, especially on a younger demographic. For this reason, ISIS strategically places their polished messages on these platforms to attract potential new members from an early age.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Awan, Imran. “Cyber-Extremism: ISIS and the Power of Social Media.” Social Science and Public Policy.&lt;/ref&gt; A study about the repercussions of social media demonstrated that there were approximately 1,264 cases that could be categorized as “violent-inciting” examples; in these cases, ISIS social media experts have deliberately posted threatening propaganda to provoke offline aggression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many “call for action” verbs that have a positive connotation have also been utilized to establish feelings of justification towards any pertinent violence.

== Critiques of movement and backlash ==
Both national governments and corporations have taken a stand against ISIS in both the physical and virtual spheres.

[[United States Department of State|The U.S. Department of State]] announced an international coalition in 2014, in which they list five lines of effort to expose ISIS. They include:
* Providing military support to partners
* Impeding the flow of foreign fighters
* Stopping financing and funding
* Addressing humanitarian crises in the region
* Exposing true nature&lt;ref&gt;“The Global Coalition To Defeat ISIS.” U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of State, 10 Sept. 2014, www.state.gov/s/seci/.&lt;/ref&gt;
Companies are also taking action to hinder ISIS social media recruitment attempts. [[Google]]’s [[Think tank|ThinkTank]], [[Jigsaw (company)|Jigsaw]], launched a collaboration with Youtube in July, 2017 to redirect any potential recruits using the Redirect Method.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Snider, Mike. “YouTube Redirects ISIS Recruits to Anti-Terrorist Videos.” USA Today, Gannett Satellite Information Network, July 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; After facing growing pressure from the government leaders, Facebook announced that the company is using Artificial Intelligence to detect terrorism related contents, their effort would extend to other Facebook owned platforms such as [[WhatsApp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-using-a-i-artificial-intelligence-against-terrorism/|title=Facebook using artificial intelligence to fight terrorism|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“The Redirect Method uses [[AdWords|Adwords]] targeting tools and curated YouTube videos uploaded by people all around the world to confront online radicalization. It focuses on the slice of ISIS’ audience that is most susceptible to its messaging, and redirects them towards curated YouTube videos debunking ISIS recruiting themes. This open methodology was developed from interviews with ISIS defectors, respects users’ privacy and can be deployed to tackle other types of violent recruiting discourses online.”&lt;ref&gt;“The Redirect Method.” The Redirect Method, redirectmethod.org/.&lt;/ref&gt;

By using this tactic, Jigsaw catches slogans that manifest any positive ISIS sentiments, like “Baqiyah wa Tatamadad” (Remaining and Expanding), and “Al Dawla Al Islameyah,” which includes “al-Dawla,” a sign of respect.

Lastly, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] declared war against ISIS in November 2015, attempting to thwart the social media recruitment efforts by targeting ISIS’s communication networks.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Paula. “Anonymous Hackers' Group Declares War on ISIS.” CBS News, CBS, 16 Nov. 2015, www.cbsnews.com/news/anonymous-hackers-declare-war-on-isis/.&lt;/ref&gt;
