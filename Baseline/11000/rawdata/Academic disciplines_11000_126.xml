'''Abstract Meaning Representation''' ('''AMR''') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amr.isi.edu|title=Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|semantic representation language]]. AMR graphs are rooted, labeled, directed, acyclic graphs ([[Directed acyclic graph|DAGs]]), comprising whole sentences. They are intended to abstract away from syntactic representations, in the sense that sentences which are similar in meaning should be assigned the same AMR, even if they are not identically worded. By nature, the AMR language is biased towards English – it is not meant to function as an international auxiliary language.

[[File:Beckton STP, Activated Sludge Tank - geograph.org.uk - 1481906.jpg|thumb|Activated sludge tank at Beckton [[sewage treatment plant]], UK - the white bubbles are due to the diffused air aeration system]]
The '''activated sludge''' process is a type of [[wastewater treatment]] process for treating [[sewage]] or [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewaters]] using [[aeration]] and a biological [[floc (biofilm)|floc]] composed of bacteria and [[protozoa]].

The general arrangement of an activated sludge process for removing carbonaceous pollution includes the following items: An aeration tank where air (or oxygen) is injected in the mixed liquor. This is followed by a settling tank (usually referred to as "final clarifier" or "secondary settling tank") to allow the biological flocs (the sludge blanket) to settle, thus separating the biological sludge from the clear treated water.

==Purpose==
[[Image:Activated Sludge 1.svg|thumb|right|300 px|A generalized, schematic diagram of an activated sludge process.]]
[[File:Activated sludge addition to membrane bioreactor (5729651741).jpg|thumb|Activated sludge addition (seeding) to a pilot scale membrane bioreactor in Germany]]
[[File:Mikrofoto.de-Belebtschlamm 6.jpg|thumb|Activated sludge under the microscope]]
In a sewage (or industrial wastewater) treatment plant, the activated sludge process is a biological process that can be used for one or several of the following purposes: oxidizing [[biotic material|carbonaceous biological matter]], oxidizing nitrogenous matter: mainly [[ammonium]] and [[nitrogen]] in biological matter, removing [[nutrients]] (nitrogen and phosphorus).

==Process description==
The process takes advantage of [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] micro-organisms that can digest organic matter in sewage, and clump together (by [[flocculation]]) as they do so. It thereby produces a liquid that is relatively free from suspended solids and organic material, and flocculated particles that will readily settle out and can be removed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nesc.wvu.edu/pdf/WW/publications/pipline/PL_SP03.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  

The general arrangement of an activated sludge process for removing carbonaceous pollution includes the following items:
* Aeration tank where air (or oxygen) is injected in the mixed liquor.
* Settling tank (usually referred to as "final clarifier" or "secondary settling tank") to allow the biological flocs (the sludge blanket) to settle, thus separating the biological sludge from the clear treated water.
  
Treatment of nitrogenous matter or phosphate involves additional steps where the mixed liquor is left in anoxic condition (meaning that there is no residual dissolved oxygen).

===Bioreactor and final clarifier===
The process involves air or [[oxygen]] being introduced into a mixture of screened, and primary treated sewage or industrial wastewater ([[wastewater]]) combined with organisms to develop a biological [[flocculation|floc]] which reduces the [[organic matter|organic]] content of the [[sewage]]. This material, which in healthy sludge is a brown floc, is largely composed of [[saprotrophic]] [[bacterium|bacteria]] but also has an important [[protozoa]]n flora component mainly composed of [[amoeba]]e, [[Spirotrich]]s, [[Peritrich]]s including [[Vorticella|Vorticellids]] and a range of other filter-feeding species. Other important constituents include motile and sedentary [[Rotifer]]s. In poorly managed activated sludge, a range of [[mucilage|mucilaginous]] filamentous bacteria can develop including ''[[Sphaerotilus natans]]'' which produces a sludge that is difficult to settle and can result in the sludge blanket decanting over the weirs in the settlement tank to severely contaminate the final effluent quality. This material is often described as sewage fungus but true fungal communities are relatively uncommon.

The combination of wastewater and biological mass is commonly known as ''mixed liquor''. In all activated sludge plants, once the wastewater has received sufficient treatment, excess mixed liquor is discharged into settling tanks and the treated [[supernatant]] is run off to undergo further treatment before discharge. Part of the settled material, the [[sludge]], is returned to the head of the [[aeration]] system to re-seed the new wastewater entering the tank. This fraction of the floc is called ''return activated sludge'' (R.A.S.).

The space required for a sewage treatment plant can be reduced by using a [[membrane bioreactor]] to remove some wastewater from the mixed liquor prior to treatment. This results in a more concentrated waste product that can then be treated using the activated sludge process.

Many sewage treatment plants use [[axial flow pump]]s to transfer nitrified mixed liquor from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for denitrification.  These pumps are often referred to as internal mixed liquor recycle pumps (IMLR pumps). The raw sewage, the RAS, and the nitrified mixed liquor are mixed by [[submersible mixer]]s in the anoxic zones in order to achieve denitrification.

=== Sludge production===
Activated sludge is also the name given to the active biological material produced by activated sludge plants. Excess sludge is called "surplus activated sludge" or "waste activated sludge" and is removed from the treatment process to keep the ratio of biomass to food supplied in the wastewater in balance. This [[sewage sludge]] is usually mixed with primary sludge from the primary clarifiers and undergoes further [[sewage sludge treatment|sludge treatment]] for example by [[anaerobic digestion]], followed by thickening, dewatering, [[composting]] and land application.

The amount of sewage sludge produced from the activated sludge process is directly proportional to the amount of wastewater treated. The total sludge production consists of the sum of primary sludge from the primary sedimentation tanks as well as waste activated sludge from the bioreactors. The activated sludge process produces about 70–100&amp;nbsp;kg/ML of waste activated sludge (that is kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). A value of 80&amp;nbsp;kg/ML is regarded as being typical.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title = Wastewater engineering : treatment and reuse|publisher = Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., McGraw Hill, USA|isbn = 0-07-112250-8|page = 1456|edition = 4th|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, about 110–170&amp;nbsp;kg/ML of primary sludge is produced in the primary sedimentation tanks which most - but not all - of the activated sludge process configurations use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A variant of the activated sludge process is the [[Nereda]] process where aerobic granular sludge is developed by applying specific process conditions that favour slow growing organisms.

===Process control===

The general process control method is to monitor sludge blanket level, SVI (Sludge Volume Index), MCRT (Mean Cell Residence Time), F/M (Food to Microorganism), as well as the biota of the activated sludge and the major nutrients DO ([[Dissolved oxygen]]), [[nitrogen]], [[phosphate]], BOD ([[Biochemical oxygen demand]]), and COD ([[Chemical oxygen demand]]). In the reactor/aerator and clarifier system, the sludge blanket is measured from the bottom of the clarifier to the level of settled solids in the clarifier's water column; this, in large plants, can be done up to three times a day.

The SVI is the volume of settled sludge in milliliters occupied by 1 gram of dry sludge solids after 30 minutes of settling in a 1000 milliliter graduated cylinder.&lt;ref name="MECC"&gt;[http://water.me.vccs.edu/courses/ENV149/operationb.htm#svi Operation and Control] From the Water/ Wastewater Distance Learning Website of the Mountain Empire Community College in Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WastewaterMath"&gt;[http://www.ragsdaleandassociates.com/WastewaterSystemOperatorsManual/Chapter%2017%20-%20Mathematics.pdf Mathematics For Wastewater Operators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907112903/http://www.ragsdaleandassociates.com/WastewaterSystemOperatorsManual/Chapter%2017%20-%20Mathematics.pdf |date=2012-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCRT is the total mass (lbs) of mixed liquor suspended solids in the aerator and clarifier divided by the mass flow rate (lbs/day) of mixed liquor suspended solids leaving as WAS and final effluent.&lt;ref name="MECC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WastewaterMath" /&gt; The F/M is the ratio of food fed to the microorganisms each day to the mass of microorganisms held under aeration. Specifically, it is the amount of BOD fed to the aerator (lbs/day) divided by the amount (lbs) of [[Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids]] (MLVSS) under aeration. Note:  Some references use MLSS (Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids) for expedience, but MLVSS is considered more accurate for the measure of microorganisms.&lt;ref name="MECC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WastewaterMath" /&gt; Again, due to expedience, COD is generally used, in lieu of BOD, as BOD takes five days for results.

Based on these control methods, the amount of settled solids in the mixed liquor can be varied by wasting activated sludge (WAS) or returning activated sludge (RAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eckenfelder, Jr.|first1=W.

==Types of plants==

There are a variety of types of activated sludge plants.&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt; These include:

===Package plants===
There are a wide range of types of package plants, often serving small communities or industrial plants that may use hybrid treatment processes often involving the use of aerobic sludge to treat the incoming sewage. In such plants the primary settlement stage of treatment may be omitted. In these plants, a biotic floc is created which provides the required substrate.  Package plants are designed and fabricated by specialty engineering firms in dimensions that allow for their transportation to the job site in public highways, typically width and height of 12 by 12 feet.  Length varies with capacity with larger plants being fabricated in pieces and welded on site.  Steel is preferred over synthetic materials (e.g., plastic) for its durability.

Package plants are commonly variants of [[extended aeration]], to promote the 'fit &amp; forget' approach required for small communities without dedicated operational staff. There are various standards to assist with their design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishwater.co.uk/Document/Download.aspx?uid=3d63842c-eb86-48b1-be17-12eebf7487a5 Code of Practice, ''Flows and Loads-2'', British Water]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://products.ihs.com/cis/Doc.aspx?AuthCode=&amp;DocNum=252510 Review of UK and international standards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105619/http://products.ihs.com/cis/Doc.aspx?AuthCode=&amp;DocNum=252510 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardsdirect.org/standards/standards4/StandardsCatalogue24_view_5158.html British Standard BS 6297:1983]&lt;/ref&gt;

To use less space, treat difficult waste, and intermittent flows, a number of designs of hybrid treatment plants have been produced. Such plants often combine at least two stages of the three main treatment stages into one combined stage. In the UK, where a large number of wastewater treatment plants serve small populations, package plants are a viable alternative to building a large structure for each process stage. In the US, package plants are typically used in rural areas, highway rest stops and trailer parks.&lt;ref name="EPA Package"&gt;EPA. Washington, DC (2000). [http://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/package_plant.pdf "Package Plants."] Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet. Document no. EPA 832-F-00-016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxidation ditch===
In some areas, where more land is available, sewage is treated in large round or oval ditches with one or more horizontal aerators typically called brush or disc aerators which drive the mixed liquor around the ditch and provide aeration.&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt; These are oxidation ditches, often referred to by manufacturer's trade names such as Pasveer, Orbal, or Carrousel. They have the advantage that they are relatively easy to maintain and are resilient to shock loads that often occur in smaller communities (i.e. at breakfast time and in the evening).

Oxidation ditches are installed commonly as 'fit &amp; forget' technology, with typical design parameters of a [[hydraulic retention time]] of 24 – 48 hours, and a sludge age of 12 – 20 days. This compares with nitrifying activated sludge plants having a retention time of 8 hours, and a sludge age of 8 – 12 days.

===Deep shaft / Vertical treatment===
Where land is in short supply sewage may be treated by injection of oxygen into a pressured return sludge stream which is injected into the base of a deep columnar tank buried in the ground. Such shafts may be up to 100 metres deep and are filled with sewage liquor. As the sewage rises the oxygen forced into solution by the pressure at the base of the shaft breaks out as molecular oxygen providing a highly efficient source of oxygen for the activated sludge biota. The rising oxygen and injected return sludge provide the physical mechanism for mixing of the sewage and sludge. Mixed sludge and sewage is decanted at the surface and separated into supernatant and sludge components. The efficiency of deep shaft treatment can be high.

Surface aerators are commonly quoted as having an aeration efficiency of 0.5 - 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh, diffused aeration as 1.5 - 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/KWh. Deep Shaft claims 5 – 8&amp;nbsp;kg O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh.

However, the costs of construction are high. Deep Shaft has seen the greatest uptake in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wholewater.com/H2OTREATMENT/verticalshaftprojects.htm Vertical Shaft Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; because of the land area issues. Deep Shaft was developed by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]], as a spin-off from their [[Pruteen]] process. In the UK it is found at three sites: Tilbury, Anglian water, treating a wastewater with a high industrial contribution;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=8054833 Tilbury construction]&lt;/ref&gt; Southport, United Utilities, because of land space issues; and Billingham, ICI, again treating industrial effluent, and built (after the Tilbury shafts) by ICI to help the agent sell more.

DeepShaft is a patented, licensed, process. The licensee has changed several times and currently (2015) Noram Engineering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noram-eng.com/groups/biosystems-group-overview.html NORAM VERTREAT™ (VERtical TREATment)]&lt;/ref&gt; sells it.

===Surface-aerated basins===
{{further|Aerated lagoon}}
[[Image:Surface-Aerated Basin.png|thumb|right|318px|A Typical Surface-Aerated Basing (using motor-driven floating aerators)]]
Most biological oxidation processes for treating industrial wastewaters have in common the use of oxygen (or air) and microbial action. Surface-aerated basins achieve 80 to 90% removal of [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] with retention times of 1 to 10 days.&lt;ref name=Basin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beychok, M.R.|year=1971|title=Performance of surface-aerated basins|journal=Chemical Engineering Progress Symposium Series|volume=67|issue=107|pages=322–339|issn=}} [http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7112203&amp;q=&amp;uid=788301038&amp;setcookie=yes Available at CSA Illumina website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114140052/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7112203&amp;q=&amp;uid=788301038&amp;setcookie=yes |date=2007-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basins may range in depth from 1.5 to 5.0 metres and utilize motor-driven aerators floating on the surface of the wastewater.&lt;ref name=Basin/&gt;

In an aerated basin system, the aerators provide two functions: they transfer air into the basins required by the biological oxidation reactions, and they provide the mixing required for dispersing the air and for contacting the reactants (that is, oxygen, wastewater and microbes). Typically, the floating surface aerators are rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7&amp;nbsp;kg [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]/[[kW]]h. However, they do not provide as good mixing as is normally achieved in activated sludge systems and therefore aerated basins do not achieve the same performance level as activated sludge units.&lt;ref name=Basin/&gt;

Biological oxidation processes are sensitive to temperature and, between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 40&amp;nbsp;°C, the rate of biological reactions increase with temperature. Most surface aerated vessels operate at between 4&amp;nbsp;°C and 32&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Basin/&gt;

=== Sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) ===
{{Main|Sequencing batch reactor}}
[[Sequencing batch reactor]]s (SBRs) treat wastewater in batches within the same vessel. This means that the bioreactor and final clarifier are not separated in space but in a timed sequence. The installation consists of at least two identically equipped tanks with a common inlet, which can be switched between them. While one tank is in settle/decant mode the other is [[aeration|aerating]] and filling.

== Aeration methods ==

===Diffused aeration ===

Sewage liquor is run into deep tanks with [[Diffuser (sewage)|diffuser]] grid aeration systems that are attached to the floor. These are like the diffused [[airstone]] used in [[tropical fish]] tanks but on a much larger scale. Air is pumped through the blocks and the curtain of bubbles formed both oxygenates the liquor and also provides the necessary mixing action. Where capacity is limited or the sewage is unusually strong or difficult to treat, oxygen may be used instead of air. Typically, the air is generated by some type of blower or compressor.

=== Surface aerators (cones) ===
Vertically mounted tubes of up to 1-metre diameter extending from just above the base of a deep concrete tank to just below the surface of the sewage liquor. A typical shaft might be 10 metres high. At the surface end, the tube is formed into a cone with helical vanes attached to the inner surface. When the tube is rotated, the vanes spin liquor up and out of the cones drawing new sewage liquor from the base of the tank. In many works, each cone is located in a separate cell that can be isolated from the remaining cells if required for maintenance. Some works may have two cones to a cell and some large works may have 4 cones per cell.

===Pure oxygen aeration===
Pure oxygen activated sludge aeration systems are sealed-tank reactor vessels with surface aerator type impellers mounted within the tanks at the oxygen carbon liquor surface interface. The amount of oxygen entrainment, or DO (Dissolved Oxygen), can be controlled by a weir adjusted level control, and a vent gas oxygen controlled oxygen feed valve. Oxygen is generated on site by cryogenic distillation of air, [[pressure swing adsorption]], or other methods. These systems are used where wastewater plant space is at a premium and high sewage throughput is required as high energy costs are involved in purifying oxygen.

== Recent developments ==
A new development of the activated sludge process is the [[Nereda]] process which produces a granular sludge that settles very well (the sludge volume index is reduced from 200-300 to 40 mL/g). A new process reactor system is created to take advantage of this quick settling sludge and is integrated into the aeration tank instead of having a separate unit outside.&lt;ref name="thesourcemagazine.org"&gt;http://www.thesourcemagazine.org/mark-van-loosdrecht-professor-at-delft-university-of-technology/&lt;/ref&gt; About 30 Nereda wastewater treatment plants worldwide are operational, under construction or under design, varying in size from 5,000 up to 858,000 person equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/15338-first-of-three-nereda-wastewater-treatment-plants-in-ireland-took-flow.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610185342/http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/15338-first-of-three-nereda-wastewater-treatment-plants-in-ireland-took-flow.html |archive-date=2016-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Davyhulme Laboratory - early 20th century.jpg|thumb|The [[Davyhulme#Davyhulme Sewage Works|Davyhulme Sewage Works Laboratory]], where the activated sludge process was developed in the early 20th century.]]
The activated sludge process was discovered in 1913 in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] by two engineers, Edward Ardern and W.T. Lockett,&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]]| edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd | year=1967 | id=[[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were conducting research for the Manchester Corporation Rivers Department at [[Davyhulme Sewage Works]]. This development led to arguably the single most significant improvement in [[public health]] and the [[Ecology#Physical environments|environment]] during the course of the century.

In 1912, Dr. [[Gilbert John Fowler|Gilbert Fowler]], a scientist at the [[University of Manchester]], observed experiments being conducted at the Lawrence Experiment Station at [[Massachusetts]] involving the aeration of sewage in a bottle that had been coated with algae. Fowler's engineering colleagues, Ardern and Lockett,&lt;ref name="Beychok"/&gt; experimented on treating sewage in a [[sequencing batch reactor|draw-and-fill reactor]], which produced a highly treated effluent. They aerated the waste-water continuously for about a month and were able to achieve a complete nitrification of the sample material. Believing that the sludge had been activated (in a similar manner to [[activated carbon]]) the process was named ''activated sludge''. Not until much later was it realized that what had actually occurred was a means to concentrate biological organisms, decoupling the liquid retention time (ideally, low, for a compact treatment system) from the solids retention time (ideally, fairly high, for an effluent low in BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ammonia.)

Their results were published in their seminal 1914 paper, and the first full-scale continuous-flow system was installed at [[Worcester]] two years later. In the aftermath of the [[First World War]] the new treatment method spread rapidly, especially to the USA, [[Denmark]], [[Germany]] and [[Canada]]. By the late 1930s, the activated sludge treatment became a well-known biological wastewater treatment process in those countries where [[sanitary sewer|sewer systems]] and [[sewage treatment plant]]s were common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_v0WjdM6sLoC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Culture of Flushing: A Social and Legal History of Sewage|author=Benidickson, Jamie|year=2011|publisher=UBC Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Newberg, M.D.''' is an American [[neuroscientist]] who is the Director of Research at the Myrna Brind Center for Integrative Medicine at [[Thomas Jefferson University Hospital]],&lt;ref name="Jefferson University Physician Profile"&gt;Jefferson University Physician Profile. "[http://hospitals.jefferson.edu/find-a-doctor/n/newberg-andrew-b/]",  [[Jefferson University Physician Profile]], 2016-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt; an Adjunct Professor of [[Religious Studies]] and an Associate Professor of Radiology at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="University of Pennsylvania Staff/Faculty"&gt;Staff/Faculty. "[https://www.med.upenn.edu/stc/staff1.html]",  [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Staff/Faculty]], 2016-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been a prominent researcher in the field of [[nuclear medicine|nuclear medical]] [[brain imaging]] and [[neurotheology]]. In particular, his research has focused on the development of neurotransmitter tracers for the evaluation of [[Religion|religiosity]] as well as neurological and psychiatric disorders including [[clinical depression]], [[head injury]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[Parkinson's disease]].

His book Principles of Neurotheology gives a basic understanding on the research done so far on Neurotheology.

==Professional career==
Newberg graduated from [[Haverford College]] in 1988 with a degree in chemistry and then received his medical degree in 1993 from the University of Pennsylvania. He then completed postgraduate training in [[Internal Medicine]] with a Residency at the Graduate Hospital from 1993 to 1996, and then did a Fellowship in Nuclear Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Radiology from 1996 to 1998. He was certified in Internal Medicine by the American Board of Internal Medicine in 1997 and certified in Nuclear Medicine by the American Board of Nuclear Medicine in 1998.

Because of his work in the intersection between religion and the brain, he has become an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. From 2005 to 2010 he was also the Director of the Center for Spirituality and the Mind.

==Academic research==
In the early 1990s, he began to research the intersection between the brain and [[Religious experience|religious and spiritual experiences]]. In this work, also sometimes referred to as “[[neurotheology]]”, Newberg described the possible neurophysiological mechanisms associated with religious and spiritual experiences.&lt;ref name="religionandbrain"&gt;Begley, Sharon. "[http://www.newsweek.com/id/79341/output/print Religion And The Brain]",  [[Newsweek]], 2001-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  His initial research included the use of functional brain imaging to study [[Buddhist meditation|Buddhist meditators]]&lt;ref&gt;Newberg AB, Alavi A, Baime M, Pourdehnad M, Santanna J, d'Aquili EG.  The measurement of regional cerebral blood flow during the complex cognitive task of meditation: A preliminary SPECT study.  Psychiatry Research:  Neuroimaging 106: 113-122, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Franciscan]] [[nun]]s in prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Newberg A, Pourdehnad M, Alavi A, d’Aquili E. Cerebral blood flow during meditative prayer: Preliminary findings and methodological issues. Perceptual and Motor Skills 97: 625-630, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This work was eventually published in three books, ''The Mystical Mind'', ''Why God Won’t Go Away'', and ''Why We Believe What We Believe''.

Newberg's research has been featured in ''[[Newsweek]],'' the ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' and the ''[[New Scientist]].''  He has been a guest speaker at the Forum at Grace Cathedral&lt;ref name="NewbergHerzfeldForum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gracecathedral.org/enrichment/forum/for_20010506.shtml |title=God in Our Minds? |authors=Guests: Andrew Newberg, [[University of Pennsylvania Health System]] researcher in [[neurophysiology]], and Noreen Herzfeld, [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|St. John's University]] professor of [[theology]] and [[computer science]] |work=The Forum at [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco|Grace Cathedral]] |date=6 May 2001 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129171706/http://www.gracecathedral.org/enrichment/forum/for_20010506.shtml |archivedate=29 January 2008 }} (Includes [[RealAudio]] links).&lt;/ref&gt;  and appeared in the films ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' and ''[[Religulous]]''. He has continued to study religious and spiritual phenomena including topics related to forgiveness, meditation, prayer, spiritual development, morality, and belief.  This work has been incorporated more recently into a new Center for Spirituality and the Mind at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;“New Center for Spirituality and the Mind at Penn Unites Intellectual Resources” Newswise (April 25, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary activities==
Newberg is the author of six books, and numerous articles on neuroimaging in neuropsychiatric disorders and also on [[neuroscience and religion]]. His book, ''Why God Won’t Go Away'', is a popularized account of this topic which describes some of the brain imaging studies and his theories regarding the nature of religious and spiritual experiences. ''Why We Believe What We Believe'', co-authored with Mark Robert Waldman (Executive MBA Faculty, Loyola Marymount University) describes the relationship between the brain and beliefs and also describes brain imaging studies of an [[atheist]] and individuals speaking in tongues (or [[glossolalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;“Tongues on the Mind”. Science (November 10, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent book, ''How Enlightenment Changes Your Brain'', also co-authored with Waldman, is a scientific and practical look at how faith and meditation can enhance brain function. Steering away from the topic of faith, his latest book, co-authored with Mark Waldman, ''Words Can Change Your Brain'' describes how a research-based communication practice, "compassionate communication", can be used to improve brain health and interpersonal communication. The book and communication strategies are now part of the NeuroLeadership course offered in the EMBA program at Loyola Marymount University. The communication strategies have been documented and published in the ''Journal of Executive Education''.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/jee/vol11/iss1/3/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
Newberg’s research has been criticized from two main perspectives.{{non sequitur|date=July 2016}}  From the religious perspective, concerns have been raised that the study of practices such as meditation does not necessarily extrapolate to the broader array of religious and spiritual phenomena.&lt;ref name="religionandbrain"/&gt; However, Newberg tends to agree with this concern and has argued that future studies are needed to elucidate the more complex elements of religious and spiritual phenomena. Newberg has maintained that science and brain imaging studies are only tools to evaluate the brain during such experiences but do not necessarily negate such experiences. Newberg has argued that the integration of science and religion is critical for a better understanding of how human beings think and behave in a global context.

{{Economics sidebar}}
'''Applied economics''' is the application of [[economic theory]] and [[econometrics]] in specific settings. As one of the two sets of fields of [[economics]] (the other set being the ''core''),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aeaweb.org/students/Fields.php&lt;/ref&gt; it is typically characterized by the application of the ''core'', i.e. economic theory and [[econometrics]], to address practical issues in a range of fields including  [[demographic economics]], [[labour economics]], [[business economics]], [[industrial organization]], [[agricultural economics]], [[development economics]], [[education economics]], [[Engineering economics (civil engineering)|engineering economics]], [[health economics]], [[monetary economics]], [[public economics]], and [[economic history]]. The process often involves a reduction in the level of abstraction of this core theory. There are a variety of approaches including not only empirical estimation using [[econometrics]], [[Input-output model|input-output analysis]] or simulations but also case studies, historical analogy and so-called common sense or the "vernacular".&lt;ref name =Swann&gt;Swann, G. M. P. (2006) ''Putting Econometrics in Its Place: A New Direction in Applied Economics'' (published by Edward Elgar).&lt;/ref&gt;  This range of approaches is indicative of what [[Roger Backhouse (economist)|Roger Backhouse]] and Jeff Biddle argue is the ambiguous nature of the concept of applied economics. It is a concept with multiple meanings.&lt;ref name=backhouse&gt;Backhouse, R. and Jeff Biddle (2000) ‘[https://read.dukeupress.edu/hope/article-pdf/32/Suppl_1/1/427135/01-Biddlebackhouse.pdf The concept of applied economics: a history of ambiguity and multiple meanings]’, ''History of Applied Economics 32'' (annual supplement), 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Among broad [[Economic methodology|methodological]] distinctions, one source places it in neither [[positive economics|positive]] nor [[normative economics]] but the ''art of economics'', [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]ed as "what most economists do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=David Colander |last=Colander |first=David |year=1992 |title=Retrospectives: The Lost Art of Economics |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=191–198 [p. 197–198] |jstor=2138310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The origin and meanings of Applied Economics has a long history going back to the writing of [[Jean-Baptiste Say|Say]] and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]]. Say wrote about "applying" the “general principles of political economy” to "ascertain the rule of action of any combination of circumstances presented to us." The full title of Mill’s (1848) work is Principles of Political Economy with Some of Their Applications to Social Philosophy.&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;

==J.N. Keynes discussion==
[[John Neville Keynes]] was perhaps the first to use the phrase “applied economics”. He noted that the "English School" ([[John Stuart Mill]], [[John Elliott Cairnes]], and [[Nassau William Senior]])&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart. 1877. Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy. London: Longmans, Green and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senior, Nassau. 1828. An Introductory Lecture on Political Economy. The Pamphleteer 29:33–47. Reprinted in vol. 1 of The Methodology of Economics: Nineteenth-Century British Contributions, edited by Roger Backhouse. London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; believed that political economy was a positive, abstract, deductive science; and that this school made a clear distinction  “between political economy itself and its applications to practice" (1917, 12). This School thought that a general body of theory could be established through abstract reasoning&amp;nbsp;– not relying on a wide knowledge of economic facts. From this point of view applying this theory involved making allowances for some of the factors ignored in building the abstract theories.  Keynes wrote about applying the political economies hypothetical laws to interpreting and explaining of “concrete industrial facts." The issue of conceptual distinction between political economy as a science (involving formulating laws which govern  the production and distribution of wealth) and political economy as an art (using the laws to tackle practical problems).&lt;ref name=keynes&gt;Keynes, John Neville. 1917. The Scope and Method of Political Economy. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst noting the rival view of the historical economists, who believed that the goals being pursued by policy makers and the means to pursue them were an integral part of the science of economics, J.N Keynes believed in the desirability of the "English School's" distinction between the discovery of principles and their application (1917, 54).&lt;ref name=keynes /&gt;

Indeed, it was he who proposed using the phrase “applied economics” instead of “the art of political economy”.  Keynes further discussed the uses of the phrases applied political economy and applied economics noting three different uses:&lt;ref name=keynes /&gt;

# in the sense suggested in the text [in association with the art of political economy];
# to designate the application of economic theory to the interpretation and explanation of particular economic phenomena, without any necessary reference however, to the solution of practical questions;
# to mark off the more concrete and specialized portions of economic doctrine from those more abstract doctrines that are held to pervade all economic reasoning. (1917, 58–59) and applying theories of economy on what we have in reality to get a healthy enterprise and business prosperity.

==Other 19th and early 20th century economists use of the term==

[[Léon Walras]], for example, planned to organize his main work into volumes on "pure," "applied," and "social" economics. Jaffé (1983) describes Walras's plan as involving making a distinction between that which is true, is useful, and is just.  In using the term true, Walras referred to propositions that necessarily followed from the nature of things. Pure economics then involves pure logic. Applied economics involves examining ways to achieve practical goals and requires the making judgments about whether or not the logic of pure economics was relevant to the real world. Social economics also presumed pure economics, but dealt with a different range of questions than did applied economics.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé,William. 1983.William Jaffé's Essays on Walras. Edited by Donald A.Walker. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vilfredo Pareto]] ([1906] 1971, 104) follows as similar usage suggesting economics might begin by eliminating that which is inessential to  examine problems as reduced to their principal and essentials. He distinguishes between "pure economics" from "applied economics" with pure economics containing only the principal lines of argument and applied economics involving supplying the details.&lt;ref&gt;Pareto, Vilfredo. [1906] 1971. Manual of Political Economy. Translated by Ann S. Schwier. New York: Kelley.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1954, 23) referred to some applied fields in economics the repetition of which might help highlight some of the issues involved in what defining applied economics involves. He discussed the following fields:&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, J. A. 1954. A History of Economic Analysis. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

# those that are typically thought of as part of economics but which also looked at individually to allow greater attention to detail – e.g. money and banking, trade, cycles, and location
# those that are independent of economics but study of them is needed for economics. These include subjects such as [[accounting]], actuarial science, and [[insurance]]
# those that are areas of public policy: agriculture, labour, transportation, utility industries, control of industry, and public finance
# [[comparative economic systems]]
# [[demography]]
# [[area studies]]

==More modern views==

===Mainstream view===
Modern mainstream economics holds the view that there is a body of abstract economic theory –  the "core"  –  and applied economics involves the practitioner in the lowering some elements of the abstraction of this to examine particular issues. This lowering of the level of abstraction may involve:&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;
* relabeling variables as more specific, concrete concepts;
* providing some structure to allow the drawing of more detailed conclusions;
* producing numerical estimates for some of the parameters ;
* using the analysis to interpret the real world phenomenon which are interpreted as examples of some more general class of events that the core theory might be used to examine.

===Economics as a science===
Pesaran and Harcourt (2000) describe [[Richard Stone|Stone]]'s attempt to face the challenge of making economics into a science by combining theory and measurement within a cohesive framework. They report Stone’s proposal for the establishment of the now famous Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge.&lt;ref name=Pesaran&gt;Pesaran, M. H.  and G. C. Harcourt (2000),“The life and work of John Richard Nicholas Stone 1913–1991,”Economic Journal&lt;/ref&gt; Stone argued that:
:''"The ultimate aim of applied economics is to increase human welfare by the investigation and analysis of economic problems of the real world. It is the view of the Department that this can best be achieved by the synthesis of three types of study which now tend to be pursued in isolation. The Department will concentrate simultaneously on the work of observations, i.e. the discovery and preparation of data; the theoretical appraisal of problems, i.e. the framing of hypotheses in a form suitable for quantitative testing; and the development of statistical methods appropriate to the special problems of economic information. The special character of the Department’s approach to problems of the real world will lie in this attempt at systematic synthesis."'' (Stone in Pesaran and Harcourt (2000) pp. 149–150)&lt;ref name="Pesaran"/&gt;

===Other views===

The basis for rival approaches tends to be the denial that sound theory can be made without some concrete linking with its area of application. Both the 19th century [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]] and the 20th Century [[Institutional economics|Institutionalists]] argue in this way. [[Wesley Clair Mitchell|Mitchell]] (1936) noted that those working in "specialized fields" had little use for kind of qualitative theory postulated by [[Alfred Marshall|Marshall]] and [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]]. Mitchell suggested that knowledge of "real markets," would cause the complexion and content of economic theory (Mitchell 1937, 26–28). [[Milton Friedman|Friedman]] shared this view that theoretical concepts might or rather should arise out of the analysis of real world data. For both Mitchell and Friedman economics should involve an interaction between examining data and formulating hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Wesley C. 1937. The Backward Art of Spending Money. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue which is related to the [[McCloskey critique]]. This is economists do not necessarily practice what they preach. In this context that is the claim to be an "applied economist," is just shorthand for saying they are looking at the real economy. What is being applied need not be "economic theory", as conventionally defined rather something more basic. [[Eli Devons]] made a distinction between three different kinds of "things", any of which might be being applied:&lt;ref&gt;Devons, Eli. 1961. Applied Economics: The Application of What? In The Logic of Personal Knowledge: Essays Presented to [[Michael Polanyi]] on His Seventieth  Birthday 11 March 1961 (no editor named). London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

* theoretical models;
* commonsense axioms, and
* theoretical concepts.

===Journals===

====''The Journal of Applied Economics''====
The Journal of Applied Economics publishes original contributions on applied issues in micro and macroeconomics. The primary criteria for selecting papers are quality and importance for the field. Papers based on a well motivated research problem that make a concrete contribution to empirical economics or applied theory are especially encouraged.

====''Applied Economics''====
''Applied Economics'' is a journal that interprets its subject area as "the application of economic analysis to specific problems in both the public and private sectors" and seeks to publish "quantitative studies, the results of which are of use in the practical field" and thus may help "bring economic theory nearer to reality"; ''Applied Economics'' is a leading peer-reviewed journal in economics and its practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;''Applied Economics'', [http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/Routledge/00036846.html Aims &amp; Scope] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105022013/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/Routledge/00036846.html |date=January 5, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics''====
This quarterly journal which began publication in 2009 is from the [[American Economic Association]]. It publishes papers on a range of topics in applied economics, particularly empirical microeconomic issues, such as in labor economics, development microeconomics, health,  [[education economics|education]], [[demographic economics|demography]], empirical corporate finance, empirical studies of trade, and empirical [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref&gt;As described at ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'' [http://www.aeaweb.org/aej-applied/index.php links]  to back-issue titles and abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''American Journal of Agricultural Economics'' ====
These journals are published by the [[Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association]].  The ''American Journal of Agricultural Economics'' has been produced since 1919, and publishes research in the "economics of agriculture and food, natural resources and the environment, and rural and community development throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaea.org/publications/ajae&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Applied Economics Perspectives and Policy'' ====
Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy (AEPP) is the leading  peer-reviewed journal of applied economics and policy. Published four times per year by [[Oxford University Press]], it is the one of two journals published by the Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association (AAEA), along with the American Journal of Agricultural Economics (AJAE). Today is the leading journal in 'applied economics' with a 2011 impact factor of 1.552.The purpose of AEPP is to analyze areas of current applied economic research in an effort to inform the policy-makers and decision makers; and to generate connections between sub-fields of agricultural and applied economics in order to focus future research and increase knowledge of those in the field about the impact of public policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaea.org/publications/aepp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==

Backhouse and Biddle argues that the mainstream view, that there is an accepted "theoretical core" and that this can be applied in a range of areas, relies on this core having specific characteristics. That is that it has a wide scope and can be developed independently of individual applications. But they note that as with the definition of applied economics itself, there is within the economics profession, differing views as to what belongs in the core. Where one draws the line between research that is contributing to the core and research that is applying the core, and the relative importance or significance of research on topics in the core versus applied economics research.&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;

Some examples of the problems of applied economics from various fields and issues:
* Examples of problems of applied economics: [[Macroeconomics]]
One example of this is macroeconomics. In the 1960s and 1970s, macroeconomics was a part of the core of the subject. Why? Because macroeconomics was not only sufficiently important to be part of any economist's training, but also embodied a set of concepts and principles not found in microeconomic theory. However the replacement of Keynesian approach to macroeconomics with new classical macroeconomics and its successors, macroeconomics might now be regarded by the mainstream as merely an application of microeconomic theory.&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;

* Examples of problems of applied economics: [[Development economics|Development Economics]]
Another example is the situation within Development Economics. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s most development economist regarded  the application of standard "core" microeconomic theory to their area as being entirely inappropriate. An alternative set of models provided their core. This might be best described as the [[Structuralist economics|structuralist]] approach. More recently development economics texts have provided applications of mainstream core theory.&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;

* Examples of problems of applied economics: [[Economic growth|Economic Growth Theory]]
Comim uses the history of the economics of growth in order to illustrate the historical nature of the concept of applied economics. He first discusses the perspective of the theorists’ views of the applied dimension of their work and examines each from the perspective of the work carried out at the Department of Applied Economics (DAE) at Cambridge University. He emphasizes the divergences concerning economists’ understanding of the proper use of economic theory, divergences that might ultimately reveal the influence of distinct practices as far as applied economics is concerned and the role of institutional environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Comim |first=Flavio |year=2000 |title=On the Concept of Applied Economics: Lessons from Cambridge Economics and the History of Growth Theories |journal=History of Political Economy |volume=32 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=145–176 |doi=10.1215/00182702-32-Suppl_1-145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Examples of problems of applied economics: the [[Minimum-wage]] controversy
Leonard notes one area of disagreement amongst applied economists which became famous in the US. That was the minimum-wage controversy. He notes that the fierceness of this controversy was odd because the likely effects were small and that several seemingly more important policy issues such as (entitlement reform, health insurance, CPI calculation) generated nothing like the storm. His explanation is that while this controversy was not especially important to the economy, it was very important to economics and economics as a policy science. His explanation for this is that minimum wage research came to be seen as a test of the usefulness of applying neoclassical price theory to the wages and employment. In other words, it was not just a technical quarrel over such things as the sign and size of wage-elasticity but rather an installment in a long running  methodological dispute over whether neoclassical price theory is in reality of any use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leonard |first=Thomas C. |year=2000 |title=The Very Idea of Applying Economics: The Modern Minimum-Wage Controversy and Its Antecedents |journal=History of Political Economy |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=117–144 |doi=10.1215/00182702-32-Suppl_1-117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A critique of the dominance of [[econometrics]]
Swann (2006) queries the dominance of such econometric techniques within Applied Economics and suggests what he describes as the "vernacular of the everyday practice of economics" should be taken seriously. Swann points out that econometrics's privileged position has not been supported by its disappointing results  and rather suggests other applied techniques, the vernacular, are also worthy of consideration. These approaches to applied economics, include simulation, [[Engineering economics (civil engineering)|engineering economics]], case studies and common sense.&lt;ref name=Swann /&gt;

'''Bethany Theological Seminary''' is the official [[seminary]] of the [[Church of the Brethren]]. Bethany, located in [[Richmond, Indiana]], is accredited by the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]] and the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.

==History==
The seminary was founded in 1905 as Bethany Biblical Seminary by A.C. Wieand and E. B. Hoff. While the two were traveling in the Holy Land overlooking the village of Bethany from the Mount of Olives in 1901–02, they decided to name the new Bible institute Bethany.  In 1994, the seminary moved from [[Oak Brook, Illinois]], to [[Richmond, Indiana]], to form a partnership with the [[Earlham School of Religion]], a Christian theological school in the [[Quaker]] tradition.

==Educational opportunities==
Bethany offers students opportunities for a degree in ministry in the form of Master of Divinity and one in research through the Master of Arts degree.  Students can further refine their field of study through a degree emphasis in Peace Studies or Ministry With Youth and Young Adults. Peace-related courses cover topics ranging from non-violence and the biblical story, to peace witness in the [[Anabaptist]]/[[Pietist]] tradition, to mediating conflict in families and churches, to peacemaking in national and international arenas. Master of Divinity students pursuing a degree emphasis in Ministry With Youth and Young Adults complete a practicum experience, and Master of Arts students focus their thesis on youth and young adult ministry.

Bethany emphasizes peace, service, simple living, and the importance of the faith community. Along with the [[Quakers]] and [[Mennonites]], the [[Church of the Brethren]] is an historic peace church, conscientiously opposed to all war, and intentional about working with peacemaking and reconciliation concerns. Several Bethany professionals and graduates are also associated with a renewed interest in [[theopoetics]].

Students in either the Master of Divinity or Master of Arts programs can now enroll as residential or Connections students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethanyseminary.edu/academic_programs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223053100/http://bethanyseminary.edu/academic_programs |archivedate=2009-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Connections is designed for persons who cannot relocate to Richmond, and who can commit to taking a mix of classes online, offsite, and on campus as weekend or two-week intensives. One of the primary locations for off-site Bethany courses is the Susquehanna Valley Ministry Center, on the campus of [[Elizabethtown College]] in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania.

Bethany partners with a wide circle of theological schools to further enhance graduate-level educational opportunities. These schools include [[Christian Theological Seminary]] in Indianapolis, IN; Payne Theological Seminary in Yellow Springs, OH; [[United Theological Seminary]] in Dayton, OH; and [[The University of Dayton]] Graduate School in Dayton, Ohio.

The '''British Academy of Management''' ('''BAM'''), founded in 1986, is a [[learned society]] dedicated  to advancing the academic discipline of [[management]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is a member of the [[Academy of Social Sciences]]. The academy runs two [[academic journal]]s: the ''[[British Journal of Management]]'' and the ''[[International Journal of Management Reviews]]''. Once a year, it publishes an article which is presented at the annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = British Academy Of Management,London,UK|url = http://10times.com/organizers/british-academy-management|website = 10times.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquartered of the British Academy of Management is in London, United Kingdom.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
The British Academy of Management was founded in 1986, exactly 50 years after the [[Academy of Management|AoM]] was formed in [[Chicago]]. [[Cary Cooper]] was its first President and [[Andrew Pettigrew]] was its first Chairman. During the AoM conference in [[San Diego]] in 1985 they realize the lack of a multidisciplinary association in the UK and decided to establish BAM.

The biggest challenges for this new organisation were to set up a [[constitution]] and to exercise good governance through a strong executive committee. The inaugural conference of BAM was at the [[University of Warwick]] in 1987. This was organised by [[Andrew Pettigrew]]. With over 200 delegates, the conference had an immediate success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = 1 November 2015|accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |pages = 2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early days ===
From the mid 1980s to the early 1990s, the management of the Academy was still based on an amateur approach, because of the moving from one place to another. The nomadic life of the BAM office and the lack of a centralized system meant that outgoing chairpersons packaged the documents and sent them on to the institution of the new chair. Sometimes, this delivery arrived without all the key papers. BAM headquarters had to be moved from one city to another for a bit more than a decade, until they found a stable home in 2002 in [[London]]. Thus, the records eventually delivered to HQ were not very comprehensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |pages = 4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferences ===
In the 1990s, BAM struggled to find conference venues, and to attract persons due to the fact that the attendance was low. As the time passed there was a growth in both domestic and international attendance, especially from Europe. At this time, it was observed that the conferences were more about social interaction than about the discussion of serious research. Combining both consistently high academic quality and the fun factor became a priority by the late 1990s.

The first BAM Workshop took place on 5 January 1989 entitled ''‘Organisation and Strategic Decision Making’'' at [[Bradford Management Centre]], [[University of Bradford]]. It had 69 participants who came from [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Brazil]], [[United States|US]], [[China]] and [[France]]. It was organised by Richard Butler, Richard Pike and John Sharp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |pages = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First BAM Journal ===
BAM’s founders wanted to start publishing a journal. Cary Cooper managed one of the AoM divisions that had its own journal and he suggested that BAM should do the same.  Cooper coordinated a small group from Council who interviewed a number of  publishing companies for a five-year contract, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|John Wiley]] won the first contract. The [[British Journal of Management]] (BJM) was launched in early 1990 and had 4 issues a year running into 64 pages. The General Editor was [[David Otley]] and the Associate Editors were John Burgoyne, [[John McGee (editor)|John McGee]], Roy Payne, [[Nigel Piercy]] and [[Roy Rothwell]]. BJM purpose was to receive articles from a full range of business and management disciplines and to have a multi and inter disciplinary orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The formation of Special Interest Groups (SIGs) ===
One of the significant changes to BAM’s structure happened in 1999 with the formation of [[Special Interest Group]]s (SIGs). The aim of the SIGs was to encourage greater member participation and to provide a more diverse range of activities for members. The first SIGs were ''Entrepreneurship and Innovation and Management Consultancy but Learning and Knowledge, Interorganisational Relations, Performance Management, Philosophy of Management, Research Methodology, Creativity and Creative Industries'' and ''E-Business'' soon joined them. The SIG structure proved a thriving way to organise BAM’s  conferences,offering richer benefits for the membership. SIGs also provided new opportunities for less experienced academics to play active roles in the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = The History of British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Journal of Management Reviews (IJMR) ===
The success of the British Journal of Management (BJM) was joined by BAM’s acquisition of the [[International Journal of Management Reviews]] (IJMR). Cary Cooper and Alan Pearson had been the first editors.

== Governance ==
British Academy of Management has an Executive Committee and a Council.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Governance Structure {{!}} bam.ac.uk|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/governance-structure|website = www.bam.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BAM Executive ===
An Executive Committee, is elected to develop the strategy, work with Council and ensure an effective implementation of the chosen strategy. Since 2014 the leadership team was remodeled. This consist of a President, a Chair, four elected Vice-Chairs and an appointed Vice Chair of Resources/Treasurer.
* President : Professor Sir Cary Cooper
* Chair: Professor [[Nic Beech]]
* Treasurer/ Vice Chair: Resources: James Johnston
* Vice Chair:
** Research and Publications: Professor Bill Cooke
**  Academic Affairs of Conference and Capacity Building: Professor [[David Denyer]]
**  Special Interest Groups: [[Anne Clare Gillon]]
**  Management Knowledge and Education: Dr [[Katy Mason]]

=== BAM Council ===
The Council, which comprises approximately 30 people elected for a minimum of 3 years by the general membership, represents the interests of membership and contributes to the activities of the learned society through working with the vice-chairs. The role of Council is to elaborate strategy and policy, and to implement strategy in conjunction with the Executive and Academy office.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Special Interest Groups (SIGs) ==
Special Interest Groups are networks of researchers that are focused in a specific area of management research. They organize events throughout the year and provide the members with an academic forum for the discussion on relevant topics.

SIGs are run by BAM members, with support from the BAM office. They organise workshop and events on topics relevant to their research area, and take the lead in managing the academic programme at the annual BAM Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Special Interest Groups {{!}} bam.ac.uk|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/special-interest-groups|website = www.bam.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''conflict of interest''' ('''COI''') is a situation in which a [[person]] or [[organization]] is involved in multiple [[wikt:interest#Noun|interests]], [[finance|financial]] or otherwise, and serving one interest could involve working against another.  Typically, this relates to situations in which the personal interest of an individual or organization might adversely affect a duty owed to [[decision-making|make decisions]] for the benefit of a third party.

The presence of a conflict of interest is independent of the occurrence of [[Inappropriateness|impropriety]]. Therefore, a conflict of interest can be discovered and voluntarily defused before any [[corruption]] occurs. A conflict of interest exists if the circumstances are reasonably believed (on the basis of past experience and objective evidence) to create a risk that a decision ''may'' be unduly influenced by other, secondary interests, and not on whether a particular individual ''is actually'' influenced by a secondary interest.

A widely used definition is: "A conflict of interest is a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgement or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest."&lt;ref&gt;Lo and Field (2009). The definition originally appeared in Thompson (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Primary interest'' refers to the principal goals of the profession or activity, such as the protection of clients, the health of patients, the integrity of research, and the duties of public officer. ''Secondary interest'' includes personal benefit and is not limited to only financial gain but also such motives as the desire for professional advancement, or the wish to do favours for family and friends. These secondary interests are not treated as wrong in and of themselves, but become objectionable when they are believed to have greater weight than the primary interests. Conflict of interest rules in the public sphere mainly focus on financial relationships since they are relatively more objective, [[fungible]], and quantifiable, and usually involve the political, legal, and medical fields.

==Related to the practice of law==
{{Professional responsibility}}
[[Judicial disqualification]], also referred to as ''recusal'', refers to the act of abstaining from participation in an official action such as a court case/legal proceeding due to a conflict of interest of the [[Judge|presiding court official]] or administrative officer. Applicable statutes or canons of [[ethics]] may provide standards for recusal in a given proceeding or matter. Providing that the judge or presiding officer must be free from disabling conflicts of interest makes the fairness of the proceedings less likely to be questioned.&lt;ref name="RepublicLost"&gt;Lessig 2011, pp. 29-32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Practice of law|legal profession]], the duty of loyalty owed to a client prohibits an attorney (or a [[law firm]]) from representing any other party with interests adverse to those of a current client. The few exceptions to this rule require informed written consent from all affected clients, ''i.e.'', an "ethical wall". In some circumstances, a conflict of interest can never be waived by a client. In perhaps the most common example encountered by the general public, the same firm should not represent both parties in a divorce or child custody matter. Found conflict can lead to denial or [[disgorgement]] of legal fees, or in some cases (such as the failure to make mandatory disclosure), criminal proceedings. In 1998, a [[Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy]] partner was found guilty of failing to disclose a conflict of interest, disbarred, and sentenced to 15 months of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cT1BOgQ2Ys8C&amp;pg=PA11370&amp;lpg=PA11370&amp;dq=john+gellene+%2215+months%22+%22conflict+of+interest%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GO9XmpZcSq&amp;sig=R9AXUOiM166xEUmIFK60uZsa0dg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyj5vt0ILZAhWpmeAKHefyBOEQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20gellene%20%2215%20months%22%20%22conflict%20of%20interest%22&amp;f=false ''Congressional Record''], V. 146, Pt. 8, June 13, 2000 to June 21, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1148010.html ''US v. Gellene''] (Seventh Circuit, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corrine Cooper. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0gJ29QfukWkC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=john+gellene+%2215+months%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_8FHwD9-To&amp;sig=i-v1J7aQ569UbhiXoSbZ004mLWo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv9IuYz4LZAhXKMd8KHdtHAiAQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20gellene%20%2215%20months%22&amp;f=false ''Attorney Liability in Bankruptcy''] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a law firm usually cannot represent a client if the client's interests conflict with those of another client, even if the two clients are represented by separate lawyers within the firm, unless (in some jurisdictions) the lawyer is segregated from the rest of the firm for the duration of the conflict. Law firms often employ software in conjunction with their case management and accounting systems in order to meet their duties to monitor their conflict of interest exposure and to assist in obtaining waivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_7_conflict_of_interest_current_clients.html|title=Rule 1.7: Conflict of Interest: Current Clients {{!}} The Center for Professional Responsibility|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generally (unrelated to the practice of law)==
More generally, conflicts of interest can be defined as any situation in which an individual or corporation (either private or governmental) is in a position to exploit a professional or official capacity in some way for their personal or corporate benefit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics and Corporate Responsibility|last=Griseri|first=Paul|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|year=2010|isbn=9781408007433|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending upon the law or rules related to a particular organization, the existence of a conflict of interest may not, in and of itself, be evidence of wrongdoing. In fact, for many professionals, it is virtually impossible to avoid having conflicts of interest from time to time. A conflict of interest can, however, become a legal matter, for example, when an individual tries (and/or succeeds in) influencing the outcome of a decision, for personal benefit. A director or executive of a corporation will be subject to legal liability if a conflict of interest breaches his/her [[duty of loyalty]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There often is confusion over these two situations. Someone accused of a conflict of interest may deny that a conflict exists because he/she did not act improperly. In fact, a conflict of interest can exist even if there are no improper acts as a result of it. (One way to understand this is to use the term "conflict of roles". A person with two roles—an individual who owns [[stock]] and is also a [[government]] official, for example—may experience situations where those two roles conflict. The conflict can be mitigated—see below—but it still exists. In and of itself, having two roles is not illegal, but the differing roles will certainly provide an incentive for improper acts in some circumstances.)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As an example, in the sphere of business and control, according to the [[Institute of Internal Auditors]]:
{{quote|'''conflict of interest''' is a situation in which an [[internal auditor]], who is in a position of trust, has a competing professional or personal interest. Such competing interests can make it difficult to fulfill his or her duties impartially. A conflict of interest exists even if no [[unethical]] or improper act results. A conflict of interest can create an appearance of impropriety that can undermine confidence in the internal [[auditor]], the [[internal audit]] activity, and the profession. A conflict of interest could impair an individual's ability to perform his or her duties and responsibilities objectively.&lt;ref name="theiia_coi_definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theiia.org/guidance/standards-and-guidance/ippf/standards/standards-items/?i=8244|title=1120-Individual Objectivity|publisher=Institute of Internal Auditors|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ccsf_coi_definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsf.edu/Offices/Office_of_the_Internal_Auditor/Policies_and_Procedures.htm|title=Policies &amp; Procedures of the Internal Audit Activity|publisher=City College of San Francisco|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Organizational==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
An organizational conflict of interest (OCI) may exist in the same way as described above, for instance where a corporation provides two types of service to the government and these services conflict (e.g.: manufacturing parts and then participating on a selection committee comparing parts manufacturers). Corporations may develop simple or complex systems to mitigate the risk or perceived risk of a conflict of interest. These risks can be evaluated by a government agency (for example, in a U.S. Government [[RFP]]) to determine whether the risks create a substantial advantage to the organization in question over its competition, or will decrease the overall competitiveness of the bidding process.

==Conflict of interest in the health care industry==
{{main|Conflict of interest in the health care industry}}
The influence of the [[pharmaceutical industry]] on medical research has been a major cause for concern. In 2009 a study found that "a number of academic institutions" do not have clear guidelines for relationships between Institutional Review Boards and industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-03/mgh-pri032309.php Policies regarding IRB members' industry relationships often lacking].&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this viewpoint, an article and associated editorial in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] in May 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drazen|first=Jeffrey M.|date=2015-05-07|title=Revisiting the Commercial–Academic Interface|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=372|issue=19|pages=1853–1854|doi=10.1056/NEJMe1503623|issn=0028-4793|pmid=25946285}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the importance of pharmaceutical industry-physician interactions for the development of novel treatments, and argued that moral outrage over industry malfeasance had unjustifiably led many to overemphasize the problems created by financial conflicts of interest.  The article noted that major healthcare organizations such as National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health, the [[President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]], the World Economic Forum, the Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and the Food and Drug Administration had encouraged greater interactions between physicians and industry in order to bring greater benefits to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Conflicts of interest: Part 1: Reconnecting the dots--reinterpreting industry-physician relations|journal= New England Journal of Medicine|volume= 372|issue= 19|pages= 1860–1864|doi=10.1056/NEJMms1502493 |pmid= 25946288|year = 2015|last1 = Rosenbaum|first1 = Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

The following are the most common forms of conflicts of interests:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/business/textbooks/boundless-business-textbook/business-ethics-and-social-responsibility-3/business-ethics-33/conflicts-of-interest-177-10244/|title=Boundless|last=|first=|date=|website=www.boundless.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Self-dealing]], in which an official who controls an organization causes it to enter into a transaction with the official, or with another organization that benefits the official only. The official is on both sides of the "deal."
* Outside employment, in which the interests of one job conflict with another.
* [[Nepotism]], in which a spouse, child, or other close relative is employed (or applies for employment) by an individual, or where goods or services are purchased from a relative or from a firm controlled by a relative. To avoid nepotism in hiring, many employment applications ask if the applicant is related to a current employee of the company. This allows recusal if the employed relative has a role in the hiring process. If this is the case, the relative could then recuse from any hiring decisions. 
* Gifts from friends who also do business with the person receiving the gifts or from individuals or corporations who do business with the organization in which the gift recipient is employed. Such gifts may include non-tangible things of value such as transportation and lodging.
* Pump and dump, in which a stock broker who owns a security artificially inflates the price by "upgrading" it or spreading rumors, sells the security and adds [[Short (finance)|short position]], then "downgrades" the security or spreads negative rumors to push the price down.

Other improper acts that are sometimes classified as conflicts of interests may have better classification. For example, accepting [[bribe]]s can be classified as corruption, use of government or corporate property or assets for personal use is [[fraud]], and unauthorized distribution of confidential information is a [[security breach]]. For these improper acts, there is no inherent conflict.

{{Anchor|Competition of interest}} COI is sometimes termed '''competition of interest''' rather than "conflict", emphasizing a [[connotation]] of natural [[competition]] between valid interests - rather than the classical definition of conflict, which would include by definition including a victim and unfair aggression. Nevertheless, this [[denotation]] of conflict of interest is not generally seen.

===Environmental hazards and human health===
Baker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Nena|title=The Body Toxic|publisher=North Point Press|year=2008|page=142|url=http://www.thebodytoxic.com |quote=cited from Lessig 2011, p. 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarized 176 studies of the potential impact of [[Bisphenol A]] on human health as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Fisher's exact test]] computed using the fisher.test function in [[R (programming language)]] returned a significance probability of 2e-13, i.e., there are 200 chances in a million billion of getting a table as extreme as this with the given marginals by chance alone. In other words, it is not credible to claim that the funding source has no impact on the outcome of this many independent studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig&lt;ref name="RepLostAll"&gt;Lessig 2011&lt;/ref&gt; noted that this does not mean that the funding source influenced the results. However, it does raise questions about the validity of the industry-funded studies specifically, because the researchers conducting those studies have a conflict of interest; they are subject at minimum to a natural human inclination to please the people who paid for their work. Lessig provided a similar summary of 326 studies of the potential harm from cell phone usage with results that were similar but not as stark.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig 2011, pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Self-policing}} Self-regulation===
[[Industry self-regulation|Self-regulation]] of any group may also be a conflict of interest. If an, such as a corporation or government bureaucracy, is asked to eliminate unethical behavior within their own group, it may be in their interest in the short run to eliminate the appearance of unethical behavior, rather than the behavior itself, by keeping any ethical breaches hidden, instead of exposing and correcting them. An exception occurs when the ethical breach is already known by the public. In that case, it could be in the group's interest to end the ethical problem to which the public has knowledge, but keep remaining breaches hidden.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Insurance claims adjusters===
Insurance companies retain [[claims adjuster]]s to represent their interest in adjusting claims. It is in the best interest of the insurance companies that the very smallest settlement is reached with its claimants. Based on the adjuster's experience and knowledge of the insurance policy it is very easy for the adjuster to convince an unknowing claimant to settle for less than what they may otherwise be entitled which could be a larger settlement. There is always a very good chance of a conflict of interest to exist when one adjuster tries to represent both sides of a financial transaction such as an insurance claim. This problem is exacerbated when the claimant is told, or believes, the insurance company's [[claims adjuster]] is fair and impartial enough to satisfy both theirs and the insurance company's interests. These types of conflicts could easily be avoided by the use of disclosures.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Purchasing agents and sales personnel===
A person working as the equipment purchaser for a company may get a bonus proportionate to the amount he's under budget by year end. However, this becomes an incentive for him to purchase inexpensive, substandard equipment. Therefore, this is counter to the interests of those in his company who must actually use the equipment. [[W. Edwards Deming]] listed "purchasing on price alone" as number 4 of his famous [[W. Edwards Deming#Key principles|14 points]], and he often said things to the effect that "He who purchases on price alone deserves to get rooked."{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Government officials===
[[File:Corrupt-Legislation-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg|thumb|Conflict of interest in legislation; the interests of the poor and the interests of the rich. A personification of corrupt legislation weighs a bag of money and denies an appeal of poverty.]]
Regulating conflict of interest in government is one of the aims of [[political ethics]]. Public officials are expected to put service to the public and their constituents ahead of their personal interests. Conflict of interest rules are intended to prevent officials from making decisions in circumstances that could reasonably be perceived as violating this duty of office. Rules in the executive branch tend to be stricter and easier to enforce than in the legislative branch.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Richard (2009), ''Getting the Government America Deserves: How Ethics Reform Can Make a Difference'', Oxford University Press 978-0-19-537871-9&lt;/ref&gt; Two problems make legislative ethics of conflicts difficult and distinctive.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; First, as James Madison wrote, legislators should share a "communion of interests" with their constituents. Legislators cannot adequately represent the interests of constituents without also representing some of their own. As Senator Robert S. Kerr once said, "I represent the farmers of Oklahoma, although I have large farm interests. I represent the oil business in Oklahoma...and I am in the oil business...They don't want to send a man here who has no community of interest with them, because he wouldn't be worth a nickel to them."&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Robert S. "Senator Kerr Talks about Conflict of Interest", ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', September 3, 1962, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is to distinguish special interests from the general interests of all constituents. Second, the "political interests" of legislatures include campaign contributions which they need to get elected, and which are generally not illegal and not the same as a bribe. But under many circumstances they can have the same effect. The problem here is how to keep the secondary interest in raising campaign funds from overwhelming what should be their primary interest—fulfilling the duties of office.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Politics of the United States|Politics in the United States]] is dominated in many ways by political campaign contributions.&lt;ref name="RepublicLost"/&gt; Candidates are often not considered "credible" unless they have a campaign budget far beyond what could reasonably be raised from citizens of ordinary means. The impact of this money can be found in many places, most notably in studies of how campaign contributions affect legislative behavior. For example, the price of sugar in the United States has been roughly double the international price for over half a century. In the 1980s, this added $3 billion to the annual budget of U.S. consumers, according to Stern,&lt;ref name="BestCongress"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stern|first=Philip M.|title=Still the Best Congress Money Can Buy|publisher=Regnery Gatgeway|year=1992|pages=168–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; who provided the following summary of one part of how this happens:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Contributions from the sugar lobby, 1983–1986
! Percent voting in 1985 against gradually reducing sugar subsidies
|-
| &gt; $5,000
| 100%
|-
| $2,500–5,000
| 97%
|-
| $1,000–2,500
| 68%
|-
| $1–1,000
| 45%
|-
| $0
| 20%
|}
This $3 billion translates into $41 per household per year. This is in essence a [[tax]] collected by a nongovernmental agency: It is a cost imposed on consumers by governmental decisions, but never considered in any of the standard data on [[tax]] collections.

Stern notes that sugar interests contributed $2.6 million to political campaigns, representing well over $1,000 return for each $1 contributed to political campaigns. This, however, does not include the cost of lobbying. Lessig cites six different studies that consider the cost of [[lobbying]] with campaign contributions on a variety of issues considered in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="RepLost2"&gt;Lessig 2011, pp. 43–52, 117&lt;/ref&gt; These studies produced estimates of the anticipated return on each $1 invested in lobbying and political campaigns that ranged from $6 to $220. Lessig notes that clients who pay tens of millions of dollars to lobbyists typically receive billions.

Lessig insists that this does not mean that any legislator has sold his or her vote.&lt;ref name="RepLostAll"/&gt; One of several possible explanations Lessig gives for this phenomenon is that the money helped elect candidates more supportive of the issues pushed by the big money spent on lobbying and political campaigns. He notes that if any money perverts democracy, it is the large contributions beyond the budgets of citizens of ordinary means; small contributions from common citizens have long been considered supporting of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig 2011, pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

When such large sums become virtually essential to a politician's future, it generates a substantive conflict of interest contributing to a fairly well documented distortion on the nation's priorities and policies.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Beyond this, governmental officials, whether elected or not, often leave public service to work for companies affected by legislation they helped enact or companies they used to regulate or companies affected by legislation they helped enact. This practice is called the "[[Revolving door (politics)|revolving door]]". Former legislators and regulators are accused of (a) using inside information for their new employers or (b) compromising laws and regulations in hopes of securing lucrative employment in the private sector. This possibility creates a conflict of interest for all public officials whose future may depend on the [[revolving door (politics)|revolving door]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Finance industry and elected officials===
Conflicts of interest among elected officials is part of the story behind the increase in the percent of US corporate domestic profits captured by the finance industry depicted in that accompanying figure.

[[File:USFinanceIndustry.svg|thumb|'''Finance as a percent of US Domestic Corporate Profits'''

Finance includes banks, securities and insurance. In 1932-1933, the total U.S. domestic corporate profit was negative. However, the financial sector made a profit in those years, which made its percentage negative, below 0 and off the scale in this plot.&lt;ref&gt;From Table 6.16 of the [[National Income and Product Accounts]] (NIPA) compiled by the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] of the [[federal government of the United States]]. For more information, see the US Finance Industry data set in the Ecdat package for [[R (programming language)]] available from [https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1439 R-Forge].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

From 1934 through 1985, the finance industry averaged 13.8% of U.S. domestic corporate profit. Between 1986 and 1999, it averaged 23.5%. From 2000 through 2010, it averaged 32.6%. Some of this increase is doubtless due to increased efficiency from banking consolidation and innovations in new financial products that benefit consumers. However, if most consumers had refused to accept financial products they did not understand, e.g., [[negative amortization]] loans, the finance industry would not have been as profitable as it has been, and the [[Late-2000s recession]] might have been avoided or postponed. Stiglitz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|title=Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Shrinking of the World Economy|publisher=Norton|year=2010|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the [[Late-2000s recession]] was created in part because, "Bankers acted greedily because they had incentives and opportunities to do so". They did this in part by innovating to make consumer financial products like retail banking services and home mortgages as complicated as possible to make it easy for them to charge higher fees. Consumers who shop carefully for financial services typically find better options than the primary offerings of the major banks. However, few consumers think to do that. This explains part of this increase in financial industry profits. (Note, however, that Stiglitz has been accused of a conflict of interests and violation of [[Columbia University]] transparency policies for failing to disclose his status as a paid consultant to government of Argentina at the same time he was writing articles in defense of Argentina's planned default of over $1billion in bond debt during the [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression]], and for failing to disclose his paid consultancy to the government of Greece at the same time he was downplaying the risk of Greece defaulting on their debt during the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Eliana (2014). "[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/378122/joseph-stiglitzs-curious-outside-activities-eliana-johnson Joseph Stiglitz’s Curious ‘Outside Activities’: The self-styled champion of the poor is not eager to disclose his ties with foreign leaders]." National Review Online, May 16, 2014; URL accessed 14 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;)

However, it is argued that a major portion of this increase and a driving force behind [[Late-2000s recession]] has been the corrosive effect of money in politics, giving legislators and the President of the U.S. a conflict of interest, because if they protect the public, they will offend the finance industry, which contributed $1.7 billion to political campaigns and spent $3.4 billion ($5.1 billion total) on lobbying from 1998 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig 2011, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey D.
|authorlink=Jeffrey Sachs|title=The Price of Civilization: Reawakening American Virtue and Prosperity|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-0-679-60502-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reinhart|first1=Carmen M.|authorlink1=Carmen Reinhart|last2=Rogoff|first2=Kenneth S.|authorlink2=Kenneth Rogoff|title=This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-691-15264-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be conservative, suppose we{{tone inline|date=September 2015}} attribute only the increase from 23.5% of 1986 through 1999 to the recent 32.6% average to governmental actions subject to conflicts of interest created by the $1.7 billion in campaign contributions. That's 9% of the $3 trillion in profits claimed by the finance industry during that period or $270 billion. This represents a return of over $50 for each $1 invested in political campaigns and lobbying for that industry. (This $270 billion represents almost $1,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States.) There is hardly any place outside politics with such a high [[return on investment]] in such a short time.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Finance industry and economists===
Economists (unlike other professions such as sociologists) do not formally subscribe to a professional ethical code. Close to 300 economists have signed a letter urging the [[American Economic Association]] (the discipline’s foremost professional body), to adopt such a code. The signatories include [[George Akerlof]], a Nobel laureate, and [[Christina Romer]], who headed Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/other_publication_types/AEA_letter_Jan3b.pdf Letters from 300 economists] to the [[American Economic Association]], 3 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

This call for a code of ethics was supported by the public attention the documentary [[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]] (winner of an Academy Award) drew to the consulting relationships of several influential economists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204294504576613032849864232 "Stung by 'Inside Job,' economists pen a code of ethics"], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This documentary focused on conflicts that may arise when economists publish results or provide public recommendation on topics that affect industries or companies with which they have financial links. Critics of the profession argue, for example, that it is no coincidence that financial economists, many of whom were engaged as consultants by Wall Street firms, were opposed to regulating the financial sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/17849319 "Dismal ethics, An intensifying debate about the case for a professional code of ethics for economists"], ''[[The Economist]]'', 6 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticism that the profession not only failed to predict the [[2007-2008 financial crisis]] but may actually have helped create it, the [[American Economic Association]] has adopted new rules in 2012: economists will have to disclose financial ties and other potential conflicts of interest in papers published in [[academic journal]]s. Backers argue such disclosures will help restore faith in the profession by increasing transparency which will help in assessing economists' advice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203436904577148940410667970 "Economists set rules on ethics"], ''Wall Street Journal'', 9 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stockbrokers===
A conflict of interest is a manifestation of [[moral hazard]], particularly when a financial institution provides multiple services and the potentially competing interests of those services may lead to a concealment of information or dissemination of misleading information. A conflict of interest exists when a party to a transaction could potentially make a gain from taking actions that are detrimental to the other party in the transaction.&lt;ref name=Mehran&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mehran|first=Hamid|title=Economics of Conflicts of Interest in Financial Institutions|ssrn=943447 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.943447|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types of conflicts of interest such as a [[pump and dump]] by stockbrokers. This is when a stockbroker who owns a security artificially inflates the price by upgrading it or spreading rumors, and then sells the security and adds short position. They will then downgrade the security or spread negative rumors to push the price back down. This is an example of stock fraud. It is a conflict of interest because the stockbrokers are concealing and manipulating information to make it misleading for the buyers. The broker may claim to have the "inside" information about impending news and will urge buyers to buy the stock quickly. Investors will buy the stock, which creates a high demand and raises the prices.  This rise in prices can entice more people to believe the hype and then buy shares as well. The stockbrokers will then sell their shares and stop promoting, the price will drop, and other investors are left holding stock that is worth nothing compared to what they paid for it.  In this way, brokers use their knowledge and position to gain personally at the expense of others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The [[Enron scandal]] is a major example of pump and dump. Executives participated in an elaborate scheme, falsely reporting profits, thus inflating its stock prices, and covered up the real numbers with questionable [[accounting]]; 29 executives sold overvalued stock for more than a billion dollars before the company went bankrupt.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Media===
Any [[Mass media|media]] organization has a conflict of interest in discussing anything that may impact its ability to communicate as it wants with its audience. Most media, when reporting a story which involves a [[parent company]] or a [[subsidiary]], will explicitly report this fact as part of the story, in order to alert the audience that their reporting has the potential for bias due to the possibility of a conflict of interest.

The business model of commercial media organizations (i.e., any that accept advertising) is selling behavior change in their audience to advertisers.&lt;ref name="HermChom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herman|first1=Edward S.|authorlink1=Edward S. Herman|last2=Chomsky|first2=Noam|authorlink2=Noam Chomsky|title=Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|year=1988|publisher=Pantheon|isbn=0-394-54926-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProblemMedia"&gt;{{cite book|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|authorlink=Robert W.

Many major advertisers [[Advertising research|test]] their ads in various ways to measure the [[return on investment]] in advertising. Advertising rates are set as a function of the size and spending habits of the audience as measured by the [[Nielsen Ratings]]. Media action expressing this conflict of interest is evident in the reaction of [[Rupert Murdoch]], Chairman of [[News Corporation]], owner of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], to changes in data collection methodology adopted in 2004 by the Nielsen Company to more accurately measure viewing habits. The results corrected a previous overestimate of the market share of Fox. Murdoch reacted by getting leading politicians to denounce the [[Nielsen Ratings]] as racists.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry, Brian. {{cite web| title = Fox gives Nielsen, politicos a lesson in hardball | url=https://variety.com/2004/scene/columns/fox-gives-nielsen-politicos-a-lesson-in-hardball-1117904718/}} Variety: August 16–22, 2004, Vol 395 Issue 13, p 14-16, 2p.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2015}}&lt;!-- I don't get Variety, but I got this cite from [[People meter]] which uses it to support a similar claim. --&gt;&lt;!-- source found, will let other remove verify {{cite web| title = "Fox gives Nielsen, politicos a lesson in hardball" | url=https://variety.com/2004/scene/columns/fox-gives-nielsen-politicos-a-lesson-in-hardball-1117904718/}} --&gt; [http://www.susan-whiting.com/ Susan Whiting], president and CEO of Nielsen Media Research, responded by quietly sharing Nielsen's data with her leading critics. The criticism disappeared, and Fox paid Nielsen's fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bianco|first=Anthony|last2=Grover|first2=Ronald|title=How Nielsen Stood Up to Murdoch|journal=Business Week|date=September 20, 2004|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_38/b3900100_mz017.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch had a conflict of interest between the reality of his market and his finances.

Commercial media organizations lose money if they provide content that offends either their audience or their advertisers. The substantial media consolidation that occurred since the 1980s has reduced the alternatives available to the audience, thereby making it easier for the ever-larger companies in this increasingly [[oligopoly|oligopolistic]] industry to hide news and entertainment potentially offensive to advertisers without losing audience. If the media provide too much information on how congress spends its time, a major advertiser could be offended and could reduce their advertising expenditures with the offending media company; indeed, this is one of the ways the market system has determined which companies won and which either went out of business or were purchased by others in this media consolidation. (Advertisers don't like to feed the mouth that bites them, and often don't. Similarly, commercial media organizations are not eager to bite the hand that feeds them.) Advertisers have been known to fund media organizations with editorial policies they find offensive if that media outlet provides access to a sufficiently attractive audience segment they cannot efficiently reach otherwise.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Election years are a major boon to commercial broadcasters, because virtually all political advertising is purchased with minimal advance planning, paying therefore the highest rates. The commercial media have a conflict of interest in anything that could make it easier for candidates to get elected with less money.&lt;ref name="ProblemMedia"/&gt;

Accompanying this trend in media consolidation has been a substantial reduction in [[investigative journalism]],&lt;ref name="ProblemMedia"/&gt; reflecting this conflict of interest between the business objectives of the commercial media and the public's need to know what government is doing in their name. This change has been tied to substantial changes in law and culture in the United States. To cite only one example, researchers have tied this decline in investigative journalism to an increased coverage of the "police blotter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Potter|editor1-first=Gary W.|editor2-last=Kappeler|editor2-first=Victor E.|title=Constructing Crime: Perspectives on Making News and Social Problems|year=1998|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=0-88133-984-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has further been tied to the fact that the United States has the [[Incarceration in the United States|highest incarceration rate in the world]].

Beyond this, virtually all commercial media companies own substantial quantities of copyrighted material. This gives them an inherent conflict of interest in any public policy issue affecting copyrights. McChesney noted that the commercial media have lobbied successfully for changes in copyright law that have led "to higher prices and a shrinking of the marketplace of ideas", increasing the power and profits of the large media corporations at public expense. One result of this is that "the people cease to have a means of clarifying social priorities and organizing social reform".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|authorlink=Robert W. McChesney|title=The Political Economy of the Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemas|year=2008|publisher=Monthly Review Pr.|isbn=978-1-58367-161-0|pages=335–337}}&lt;/ref&gt; A free market has a mechanism for controlling abuses of power by media corporations: If their censorship becomes too egregious, they lose audience, which in turn reduces their advertising rates. However, the effectiveness of this mechanism has been substantially reduced over the past quarter century by "the changes in the concentration and integration of the media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|authorlink=Lawrence Lessig|title=[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]|year=2004|isbn=978-1-59420-006-9|pages=162ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Would the [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]] have advanced to the point of generating substantial [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement#Protests|protests]] without the secrecy behind which that agreement was negotiated—and would the government attempts to sustain that secrecy have been as successful if the commercial media had not been a primary beneficiary and had not had a conflict of interest in suppressing discussion thereof?

==Mitigation==

===Removal===
{{expand section|reason=frequency, efficacy|date=September 2015}}
Sometimes, people who may be perceived to have a conflict of interest resign from a position or sell a shareholding in a venture, to eliminate the conflict of interest going forward.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} For example, [[Jonathan Evans, Baron Evans of Weardale|Lord Evans of Weardale]] resigned as a non-executive director of the UK [[National Crime Agency]] after a [[tax avoidance|tax-avoidance]]-related controversy about [[HSBC]], where Lord Evans was also a non-executive director. This resignation was stated to have taken place in order to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/news-listings/563-resignation-of-non-executive-director|title=Resignation of non-executive director|publisher=[[National Crime Agency]]|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Blind trust"===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
A politician who owns shares in a company that may be affected by government policy may put those shares in a [[blind trust]] with themselves or their family as the beneficiary. It is disputed whether this really removes the conflict of interest, however.

Blind trusts may in fact obscure conflicts of interest, and for this reason it is illegal to fund political parties in the UK via a blind trust if the identity of the real donor is concealed.

===Disclosure===
Commonly, politicians and high-ranking government officials are required to disclose financial information—assets such as stock, [[debt]]s such as [[loan]]s, and/or corporate positions held, typically annually. To protect privacy (to some extent), financial figures are often disclosed in ranges such as "$100,000 to $500,000" and "over $2,000,000". Certain professionals are required either by rules related to their professional organization, or by [[statute]], to disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest. In some instances, the failure to provide full disclosure is a crime.

However, there is limited evidence regarding the effect of conflict of interest disclosure despite its widespread acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Institute of Medicine|title=Conflict of Interest in Research, Education and Practice|journal=National Academies Press|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study published in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] showed that routine disclosure of conflicts of interest by American medical school educators to pre-clinical medical students were associated with an increased desire among students for limitations in some industry relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1475179 "Article"], ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were no changes in the perceptions of students about the value of disclosure, the influence of industry relationships on educational content, or the instruction by faculty with relevant conflicts of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Azalea|author2=Lawrence Mumm|author3= Deborah Korenstein|title=Routine Conflict of Interest Disclosure by Preclinical Lecturers and Medical Students' Attitudes Toward the Pharmaceutical and Device Industries|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=5 December 2012|volume=308|issue=21|pages=2187–2189|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.25315|pmid=23212492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And, an increasing line of research suggests that disclosure can have "perverse effects" or, at least, is not the panacea regulators often take it to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cain | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Destksy | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Everyone's a little bit biased (even physicians) | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=182115 | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 299 | issue = 24| pages = 2893–2895 | doi=10.1001/jama.299.24.2893 | pmid=18577735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recusal===
{{Missing information|section|the fact that recusal is an ''expectation'', and no solution for situations where COI can't be verified, as is the case on WP|date=September 2015}} 
Those with a conflict of interest are expected to [[Judicial disqualification|recuse]] themselves from (i.e., abstain from) decisions where such a conflict exists. The imperative for recusal varies depending upon the circumstance and profession, either as common sense ethics, codified ethics, or by [[statute]]. For example, if the governing board of a government agency is considering hiring a consulting firm for some task, and one firm being considered has, as a partner, a close relative of one of the board's members, then that board member should not vote on which firm is to be selected. In fact, to minimize any conflict, the board member should not participate in any way in the decision, including discussions.

[[Judge]]s are supposed to recuse themselves from cases when personal conflicts of interest may arise. For example, if a judge has participated in a case previously in some other judicial role he/she is not allowed to try that case. Recusal is also expected when one of the lawyers in a case might be a close personal friend, or when the outcome of the case might affect the judge directly, such as whether a car maker is obliged to recall a model that a judge drives. This is required by law under Continental [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems and by the [[Rome Statute]], organic law of the [[International Criminal Court]].

===Third-party evaluations===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
Consider a situation where the owner of a majority of a public companies decides to buy out the minority shareholders and take the corporation private. What is a fair price? Obviously it is improper (and, typically, illegal) for the majority owner to simply state a price and then have the (majority-controlled) [[board of directors]] approve that price. What is typically done is to hire an independent firm (a third party), well-qualified to evaluate such matters, to calculate a "fair price", which is then voted on by the minority shareholders.

Third-party evaluations may also be used as proof that transactions were, in fact, fair ("[[Arm's length principle|arm's-length]]"). For example, a corporation that leases an office building that is owned by the [[CEO]] might get an independent evaluation showing what the market rate is for such leases in the locale, to address the conflict of interest that exists between the [[fiduciary]] duty of the CEO (to the stockholders, by getting the lowest rent possible) and the personal interest of that CEO (to maximize the income that the CEO gets from owning that office building by getting the highest rent possible).

A January 2018 report by the [[Public Citizen]] non-profit describes dozens of foreign governments, special interest groups and GOP congressional campaign committees that spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]]'s properties during his first year in office. The study said that these groups clearly intended to win over the president by helping his business empire profit as he sat in the Oval Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/trump-properties-profit-foreign-governments-gop-782260|title=Trump Properties Earned a Fortune from GOP and Foreign Governments During President's First Year in Office: Report|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3428">A '''conservation management system''' (CMS) is a procedure for maintaining a species or habitat in a particular state. It is a means whereby humankind secures wildlife in a favourable condition for contemplation, education or research, in perpetuity.  It is an important topic in [[cultural ecology]], where conservation management counterbalances the unchecked exploitative management of natural resources.  Conservation management systems are vital for turning [[sustainable development]] strategies into successful operations.

In New Zealand the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation|Department of Conservation]] develops conservation management strategies in conjunction with the community as a means of prioritising conservation issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/getting-involved/consultations/conservation-management-strategies/how-the-strategies-are-developed/|title=Developing conservation management strategies: Consulting|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation management has historically adopted ideals deriving from 3 discursive approaches: the classic approach, populist approach, and neoliberal approach. All three approaches have differing ideas about the nexus of conservation and development and their potential interactions. 
* The Classic Approach understands local people to be a threat environmental conservation and therefore people occupying landed intended for conservation have historically and presently been evicted from their land. 
* The Populist Approach understands that conservation requires the participation and the empowerment of local people in order to reach both social and environmental aims. 
* The Neoliberal Approach sees the need for value to be placed on biodiversity in order for conservation to be incorporated in the economic systems and be successful as a tool of economic development&lt;ref&gt;Brown, K. (2002). Innovations for Conservation and Development. The Geographical Journal,168(1), 6-17. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/stable/3451218 &lt;/ref&gt;.

National Parks are heavily managed conservations areas. The approach adopted by a conservation authority will influence the management of a Park and dictate how the park authorities view the role of the park and the relationship visitors may have with it.  
An example of a park adopting a populist approach is the [[Rouge National Urban Park]] located in Canada’s largest city [[Toronto]]. Though controlled by the Government of Canada through Parks Canada, the Rouge National Urban Park encourages the community to access the park to learn, play and live. The complexity of the Park being in a large metropolitan city has meant that [[Parks Canada]] has incorporated the surrounding communities into the planning, implementation, and management of the park. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/on/rouge/info/~/media/028EC69FE3264676AD660595012FED36.ashx&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dialog manager''' (DM) is a component of a [[dialog system]] (DS), responsible for the state and flow of the conversation. Usually:

* The '''input''' to the DM is the human utterance, usually converted to some system-specific semantic representation by the [[Natural language understanding]] (NLU) component. For example, in a flight-planning dialog system, the input may look like "ORDER(from=TA,to=JER,date=2012-01-01)".
* The DM usually maintains some '''state''' variables, such as the dialog history, the latest unanswered question, etc., depending on the system.
* The '''output''' of the DM is a list of instructions to other parts of the dialog system, usually in a semantic representation, for example "TELL(flight-num=123,flight-time=12:34)". This semantic representation is usually converted to human language by the [[Natural language generation]] (NLG) component.

There are many different DMs that fulfill very different roles. There can even be several DM components in a single DS.

The only thing common to all DMs is that they are '''stateful''', in contrast to other parts of the DS (such as the NLU and NLG components), which are just stateless functions. The DM roles can roughly be divided into these groups:

# Input-control DMs, which enable context-dependent processing of the human utterances.
# Output-control DMs. which enable state-dependent generation of text.
# Strategic flow-control
# Tactic flow-control

== Input-control DM ==

The human '''input''' has different meanings depending on the context. For example, in a travel-planning DS:
* Computer: Where do you want to depart from?
** Human: Tel Aviv.
* Computer: Where do you want to arrive at?
** Human: Gaza.

The meaning of the city name depends on the previously asked question. A DM may keep that question in a state variable, and use it to convert "Tel Aviv" to "I want to depart from Tel Aviv", and convert "Gaza" to "I want to arrive at Gaza".

This function is on the border between NLU and DM: in some systems it's included in the NLU, such as the context-dependent rules of [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/695379 Milward (2000)]; while in other systems it is included in the DM, such as the '''NP resolution''' module of [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/7844079 Mirkovic and Cavedon (2005)].

Another function between the NLU and DM is, determining which input utterances are part of a single utterance. Here is an example from a job negotiation dialog:

* I offer a salary of 20,000 NIS
* and a car
* The pension conditions will be decided later

All three utterances are actually a single offer. For the second utterance, the word "and" is a clue, but for the third utterance the only possible clue is that it was said immediately after the second one. To understand this, the DM should probably keep a timestamp of each utterance.

== Output-control DM ==

The computer '''output''' may be made more natural, by remembering the dialog history. For example, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120626180801/http://vhtoolkit.ict.usc.edu/index.php/NPCEditor NPCEditor] (a framework for authoring characters that answer human questions) allows the author to define question-answer pairs, such that for each question there are several possible answers. The DM selects the best answer for the question, unless it was already used, in which case it selects the 2nd best answer, etc.

A similar feature exists in [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6305/beyond_fa%C3%A7ade_pattern_matching_.php?page=1 ChatScript] (a framework for authoring chatter-bots):  Each time the DS uses a certain rule, the DM marks this rule as "used", so that it won't be used again.

A recent DS for technical assistance {{citation needed|date=September 2012}} uses advanced machine-learned rules to select the best terms for describing items. For example, if the DM notices that it's speaking with an adult, it will use terms such as "the left hand"; if it notices that it's speaking with a child, it will use less technical terms such as "the hand where you wear the clock".

This function is on the border between DM and NLG.

== Strategic flow-control DM ==

The main role of a DM is to decide what action the dialog agent should take at each point of the dialog.

A simple way to do this is to let the author completely specify the dialog structure. For example, a specification of a tutorial dialog structure may look like:

* Computer: "What forces act on the electron?"
** Human: "Electric force".
*** Computer: "Correct"
*** [go to next question]
* Computer: "What forces act on the mass?"
** Human: "Electric force".
*** Computer: "Incorrect, the mass has no charge".
*** [go to a tutorial about electricity]

The DM keeps a pointer to our current position in the script. The position is updated according to the human input.

There are many languages and frameworks that allow authors to specify dialog structures, such as: [https://web.archive.org/web/20120827035428/http://www.vxml.org/ VoiceXML] (optimized for speech dialogs), 
[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6305/beyond_fa%C3%A7ade_pattern_matching_.php?page=1 AIML, Facade and ChatScript] (optimized for chat-bots), [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/7844079 CDM] (Java-based, optimized for device-control dialogs), and [http://www.learnlab.org/technologies/tutalk/index.php TuTalk] (optimized for tutorial dialogs).

Additionally, the dialog structure can be described as a state-chart, using a standard language such as [[SCXML]]. This is done in [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/7885526 DomainEditor] (a framework for [[tactical questioning]] characters).

It is quite tedious for authors to write a full dialog structure. There are many improvements that allow authors to describe a dialog in a higher abstraction level, while putting more burden on the DM.

=== Hierarchical structure ===
[http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/4907954 Ravenclaw] (a DM for goal-oriented dialogs, based on the CMU communicator) allows the author an advanced, multi-level dialog structure description, such as:

* Room reservation task:
** Login
*** Ask user name
*** Ask user password
** Room selection
*** Building selection
*** Room number selection
** Time selection
** Finish

The Ravenclaw DM keeps a stack of dialog modules, and uses it to process the human input.

This structure encourages code reuse, for example, the login module can be used in other dialogs.

They also [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbohus/ravenclaw-olympus/research.html claim] to allow dynamic dialog-task construction, where the structure is not fixed in advance but constructed on the fly, based on information selected from a backend. For instance, in a system that helps aircraft maintenance personnel throughout the execution of maintenance tasks, the structure of the dialog depends on the structure of the maintenance task and is constructed dynamically.

=== Topic tracking ===

Frameworks for chatter-bots, such as ChatScript, allow to control the conversation structure with '''topics'''. The author can create rules that capture the topic that

* topic: CHILDHOOD (child boy girl young)
* t: I had a happy childhood.
* t: But it ended too early.
* ...

If the human says one of the words in parentheses, the DM remembers that the topic is "CHILDHOOD". The chat-bot now starts telling the story under the "CHILDHOOD" title, as long as the bot is in control of the conversation (the user passively responds by saying thinks like "OK" or "right"). Yet if the user asks questions, the system can either respond directly, or use up a line of the story it was going to say anyway.

This, too, allows authors to reuse topics, and combine several independent topics to create a smarter chatter-bot.

=== Form Filling ===
A common use of dialog systems is as a replacement to forms. For example, a flight-reservation agent should ask the human about his origin time and place, and destination time and place - just as if the human is filling a form with these 4 slots.

A simple solution is to use '''system-initiative''', where the dialog system asks the user about each piece of information in turn, and the user must fill them in that exact order, like in this dialog (from a presentation by [[David Traum]]):

* Welcome to the flight confirmation system. What is your flight number?
** United 123 on August 8 from Los Angeles
* What is your departure city?
** I told you, Los Angeles, on August 8
* I'm sorry, I didn't understand. What is your departure city?
** Los Angeles leaving August 8th.
* What is the day of departure?
** You don't listen! August 8!
* Please say the day of departure?
** August 8
* Flight United 123 confirmed to depart Los Angeles for London at 2pm on August 8.

The opposite of system-initiative is '''user-initiative''', where the user takes lead, and the system respond to whatever the user directs.

A common compromise between the two methods is '''mixed-initiative''', where the system starts with asking questions, but users can barge in and change the dialog direction. The system understands the user even when he speaks about details he was not asked about yet.

However, describing such a system manually, as a state-chart, is very tedious, since the human may first say the origin and then the destination, or vice versa. In each of them, the human may first say the time and then the place, or vice versa.

So, there are DMs that allow the dialog author to just say what information is required, without specifying the exact order. For example, the author may write:

* TRAVEL = {ORIGIN-PLACE, ORIGIN-TIME, DESTINATION-PLACE, DESTINATION-TIME}

The DM keeps track of which slots are already filled and which slots are still empty, and navigates the conversation in order to collect the missing information. For example, the DM may ask the human about the origin place first, but if the human adds the destination place, the DM will keep the information and not ask about it again.

Such DSs were developed in [[MIT]], for example, Wheels (for searching used car ads), Jupiter (for retrieving weather forecasts), and more.

Simple DMs handle slot-filling binarily: either a slot is "filled", or it is "empty". More advanced DMs also keep track of the '''degree of grounding''' - how sure are we, that we really understood what the user said: whether it was "Just recently introduced", "Introduced again", "acknowledged", "repeated", etc. We can also allow the author to specify, for each piece of information, the degree to which we NEED it to be understood, e.g. sensitive information need higher degree. The DM uses this information to control the course of dialog, e.g., if the human said something about a sensitive subject, and we are not sure we understood, then the DM will issue a confirmation question. See [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/11023993 Roque and Traum (2008)].

=== Information state ===

The [http://www.ling.gu.se/projekt/trindi/trindikit/ TrindiKit] DS, developed during the [http://www.ling.gu.se/projekt/trindi/ Trindi] project, allows authors to define a complex information state, and write general rules that process this state. Here is a sample rule:

integrateAnswer:
* preconditions: ("If the human gave a relevant answer to a question currently under discussion...")
** in(SHARED.LM, answer(usr, A))
** fst(SHARED.QUD, Q)
** relevant_answer(Q, A)
* effects: ("... then remove it from the Question Under Discussion, and add it to the shared ground")
** pop(SHARED.QUD)
** reduce(Q, A, P)
** add(SHARED.COM, P)

The DM decides, according to the input and the state, which rules are applicable, and applies them to get the new state.

This may help authors re-use general rules for dialog management rules, based on dialog theories. DSs developed with TrindiKit include: GoDiS, MIDAS, EDIS and SRI Autorate.

The information state approach was developed later in projects such as [http://www.ling.gu.se/projekt/siridus/ Siridus] and the [http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/dipper/ Dipper] toolkit.

Another example of an information state based dialogue manager is [http://nld.ict.usc.edu/group/publications/flores-forward-looking-reward-seeking-dialogue-manager FLoReS]. It uses a propositional information state to encode the current state and selects the next action using a [[Markov decision process]]. This dialogue manager is implemented in the [https://github.com/fmorbini/jmNL jmNL software].

=== General Planning ===
A generalization of this approach is to let the author define the '''goals''' of the agent, and let the DM construct a '''plan''' to achieve that goal. The plan is made of '''operations.''' Each speech act is an operation. Each operation has '''preconditions''' and '''postconditions''' (=effects), for example:

Inform(Speaker,Hearer,Predicate):
* Precondition: Knows(Speaker,Predicate) AND Wants(Speaker,Inform(Speaker,Hearer,Predicate))
* Effect: Knows(Hearer,Predicate)
* Body: Believes(Hearer,Wants(Speaker,Knows(Hearer,Predicate)))

The conversation can be navigated using a general planner, such as [[Strengths, Opportunities, Aspirations &amp; Results|SOAR]]. The planner maintains the current state, and tries to construct a plan to achieve the goal, using the given operations.

A similar approach is taken in [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/10242522 SASO-ST] (a DS for multi-agent negotiation training). Using SOAR allows the incorporation of complex emotional and social models, for example: the agent can decide, based on the human actions, whether he wants to cooperate with him, avoid him, or even attack him.

A similar approach is taken in [http://cs.rochester.edu/research/cisd/projects/trips/ TRIPS] (a DS for multi-agent collaborative problem solving). They split the dialog management into several modules: 
* '''Reference manager''' - Given a word (e.g. "the woman"), decide what object in the world it refers to (e.g. "WOM1234").
* '''Task manager''' - Identify the problem-solving acts that the user tries to achieve (create new objective, extend an existing objective, etc.).
* '''Interpretation manager''' - in addition to calling the first two, also identify discourse obligations, for example: "respond to the latest question".
* '''Behavioral agent''' - decides how to accomplish the goal that the user wants. The agent employs several task-specific agents that do the actual planning.

A different kind of planning is '''theorem proving'''. A dialog can be described as an attempt to prove a theorem. The system interacts with user to supply "missing axioms" to help complete the proof (this is called "backward chaining"). This approach was implemented by:
* Grammatical Framework, see [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/1177324 Ranta and Cooper (2004)].
* IPSIM (Interruptible Prolog SIMulator), in the Circuit Fixit system; see Smith, Hipp &amp; Biermann.

The dialog manager can be connected with an [[expert system]], to give the ability to respond with specific expertise.

== Tactic flow-control DM ==
In addition to following the general structure and goals of the dialog, some DMs also make some tactical conversational decisions - local decisions that affect the quality of conversation.

=== Error handling ===

The ASR and NLU modules are usually not 100% sure they understood the user; they usually return a confidence score reflecting the quality of understanding. In such cases, the DM should decide whether to:

* Just assume that the most probable interpretation is correct, and continue the conversation ('''no-confirmation''');
* Continue the conversation, but add some words that show understanding, such as "OK, you want to go to a restaurant. Where exactly?" ('''implicit-confirmation''').
* Ask the user what exactly he intended to say ('''explicit-confirmation'''): "Do you mean X?" "Did you say X or Y?", etc.
* Tell the user "I didn't understand, please say this again".

Choosing "no-confirmation" may make the dialog proceed quicker, but may also introduce mistakes which will take longer to correct later.

Error handling was researched extensively by [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbohus/ravenclaw-olympus/research.html Ravenclaw], which allows the author to manually control the error handling strategy in each part of the dialog.

=== Initiative control ===

Some DSs have several modes of operation: the default mode is '''user-initiative''', where the system just asks "what can I do for you?" and lets the user navigate the conversation. This is good for experienced users. However, if there are many misunderstandings between the user and the system, the DM may decide to switch to '''mixed-initiative''' or '''system-initiative''' - ask the user explicit questions, and accept one answer at a time.

=== Pedagogical decisions ===

Tactical decisions of a different type are done by [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/10021462 Cordillera] (a tutorial DS for teaching physics, built using TuTalk). In many points during the lesson, the DM should decide:
* Whether to Tell the pupil some fact, or try to Elicit this fact from him by asking guiding questions.
* Whether to ask the pupil to Justify his answer, or just Skip the justification and continue.

These decisions affect the overall quality of learning, which can be measured by comparing pre- and post-learning exams.

=== Learned tactics ===
Instead of letting a human expert write a complex set of decision rules, it is more common to use [[reinforcement learning]]. The dialog is represented as a [[Markov Decision Process]] (MDP) - a process where, in each state, the DM has to select an action, based on the state and the possible rewards from each action. In this setting, the dialog author should only define the reward function, for example: in tutorial dialogs, the reward is the increase in the student grade; in information seeking dialogs, the reward is positive if the human receives the information, but there is also a negative reward for each dialog step.

RL techniques are then used to learn a policy, for example, what kind of confirmation should we use in each state? etc. This policy is later used by the DM in real dialogs.

A tutorial on this subject were written by [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/10776325 Lemon and Rieser (2009)].

A different way to learn dialog policies is to try to imitate humans, using Wizard of Oz experiments, in which a human sits in a hidden room and tells the computer what to say; see for example [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/9998567 Passonneau et al (2011)].

[[Image:Ecotypes of Physcomitrella patens.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Four different [[ecotypes]] of ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'', stored at the [[International Moss Stock Center]]]]

In [[evolutionary ecology]], an '''ecotype''',&lt;ref group=note&gt;Greek: ''οίκος'' = home and ''τύπος'' = type, coined by [[Göte Turesson]] in 1922&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called '''ecospecies''', describes a genetically distinct geographic variety, [[Population biology|population]] or [[Race (biology)|race]] within a [[species]], which is genotypically [[Adaptation|adapted]] to specific environmental conditions.

Typically, though ecotypes exhibit [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences (such as in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] or [[physiology]]) stemming from environmental heterogeneity, they are capable of interbreeding with other geographically adjacent ecotypes without loss of fertility or vigor.
&lt;ref name="BTH"&gt;''Ecology: From individuals to ecosystems'' by Begon, Townsend, Harper, Blackwell Publishing 4th ed. (2006), p.5,6,7,8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G."&gt;{{cite book | last =Turesson | first =Turesson G. | title =The genotypical response of the plant species to the habitat | publisher =Hereditas 3 | year =1922 | pages =211–350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Molles"&gt;{{cite book | last =Molles | first =Manuel C., Jr. | title =Ecology: Concepts and Applications | publisher =The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.| edition = 3rd | year =2005 | location =New York | pages =201 | isbn = 978-0-07-243969-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ee"&gt;''Environmental Encyclopedia'' by Bortman, Brimblecombe, Mary Ann Cunningham, William P.

==Definition==
An ecotype is a variant in which the [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences are too few or too subtle to warrant being classified as a subspecies. These can occur in the same geographic region where distinct habitats such as meadow, forest, swamp, and sand dunes provide ecological niches. Where similar ecological conditions occur in widely separated places it is possible for a similar ecotype to occur. This is different than a subspecies, which may exist across a number of different habitats. In animals, ecotypes can be regarded as micro-subspecies that owe their differing characteristics to the effects of a very local environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernst Mayr|title=Systematics and the Origin of Species, from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|chapter=VIII-Nongeographic speciation|pages=194–195|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=mAIjnLp6r_MC&amp;pg=PA194|isbn=9780674862500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ecotypes have no [[taxonomic rank]].

==Terminology==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
Ecotypes are closely related to [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]]. In the context of [[evolutionary biology]], [[Polymorphism (biology)|genetic polymorphism]] is the occurrence in the equilibrium of two or more distinctly different phenotypes within a population of a species, in other words, the occurrence of more than one '''form''' or '''morph'''. The frequency of these discontinuous forms (even that of the rarest) is too high to be explained by [[mutation]]. In order to be classified as such, morphs must occupy the same habitat at the same time and belong to a [[panmictic]] population (whose all members can potentially interbreed). Polymorphism is actively and steadily maintained in populations of species by natural selection (most famously [[sexual dimorphism]] in humans) in contrast to ''transient polymorphisms'' where conditions in a habitat change in such a way that a "form" is being replaced completely by another.

In fact, Begon, Townsend, and Harper assert that

{{Cquote|''There is not always clear distinction between local ecotypes and genetic polymorphisms.''}}

The notions "form" and "ecotype" may appear to correspond to a static phenomenon, however; this is not always the case. Evolution occurs continuously both in time and space, so that two ecotypes or forms may qualify as distinct species in only a few generations. Begon, Townsend, and Harper use an illuminating analogy on this:

{{Cquote|''… the origin of a species, whether [[Allopatric speciation|allopatric]] or [[Sympatric speciation|sympatric]], is a process, not an event. For the formation of a new species, like the boiling of an egg, there is some freedom to argue about when it is completed.''}}

Thus ecotypes and morphs can be thought of as precursory steps of potential [[speciation]].

==Range and distribution==
Experiments indicate that sometimes ecotypes manifest only when separated by great spatial distances (of the order of 1,000&amp;nbsp;km). This is due to [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] whereby different but adjacent varieties of the same species (or generally of the same [[taxonomic rank]]) interbreed, thus overcoming local selection. However other studies reveal that the opposite may happen, i.e., ecotypes revealing at very small scales (of the order of 10 m), within populations, and despite hybridization.&lt;ref name="BTH" /&gt;

In ecotypes, it is common for continuous, gradual geographic variation to impose analogous phenotypic and genetic variation.&lt;ref name="BTH" /&gt; This situation is called [[Cline (biology)|cline]]. A well-known example of a cline is the skin color gradation in indigenous human populations worldwide, which is related to latitude and amounts of sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;"Race".  (2009). ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; But often the distribution of ecotypes is [[Bimodal distribution|bimodal]] or multimodal. This means that ecotypes may display two or more distinct and discontinuous phenotypes even within the same population. Such phenomenon may lead to [[speciation]] and can occur if conditions in a local environment change dramatically through space or time.&lt;ref name="BTH" /&gt;

* [[Earthworms]] fall into four different ecotypes. Compost earthworms prefer warm and moist environments with a ready supply of fresh compost material. [[Epigeic]] earthworms live on the surface of the soil in [[leaf litter]] and tend not to make burrows but live in and feed on the leaf litter. Endogeic earthworms live in and feed on the soil, making horizontal burrows through the soil to move around and to feed and they will reuse these burrows to a certain extent. Anecic earthworms make permanent vertical burrows in soil, feeding on leaves on the soil surface that they drag into their burrows.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.earthwormsoc.org.uk/earthworm-information/earthworm-information-page-2 Earthworm ecotypes], information from the Earthworm Society of Britain about the different ecotypes of British earthworms.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnoecology''' is the [[scientific method|scientific]] study of how different groups of people living in different locations understand the [[ecosystem]]s around them, and their relationships with surrounding environments.

It seeks valid, reliable understanding of how we as humans have interacted with the environment and how these intricate relationships have been sustained over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=mHj3RfaLCFYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=ethnoecology&amp;ots=xsl7-Ob-kj&amp;sig=gkKc38x93_fuB0S3Bo9IDTKwRvw#v=onepage&amp;q=ethnoecology&amp;f=false|title=Ethnoecology: Situated Knowledge/located Lives|last=Nazarea|first=Virginia D.|date=1999-01-01|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=9780816523641|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ethno" (see [[ethnology]]) prefix in ethnoecology indicates a localized study of a people, and in conjunction with [[ecology]], signifies people's understanding and experience of environments around them. Ecology is the study of the interactions between living organisms and their environment; enthnoecology applies a human focused approach to this subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IryOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=latin+morpeme+ethno&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7nRnF23dRA&amp;sig=LqE5uvdEmUIlTDLCpYAogk8yOo0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRxMjZk7TeAhWaHzQIHawABSMQ6AEwDnoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=latin%20morpeme%20ethno&amp;f=false|title=General Linguistics|last=Robins|first=R. H.|date=2014-05-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317887638|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the field lies in applying indigenous knowledge of [[botany]] and placing it in a global context.

== History ==
Ethnoecology began with some of the early works of Dr. [[Hugh Popenoe]], an agronomist and tropical soil scientist who has worked with the University of Florida, the National Science Foundation, and the National Research Council. Popenoe has also worked with Dr [[Harold Conklin]], a cognitive anthropologist who did extensive linguistic and ethnoecological research in Southeast Asia. &lt;sup&gt;[&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]&lt;/sup&gt;

In his 1954 dissertation "The Relation of the Hanunoo Culture to the Plant World", Harold Conklin coined the term ethnoecology when he described his approach as "ethnoecological". After earning his PhD, he began teaching at Columbia University while continuing his research among the Hanunoo.

In 1955, Conklin published one of his first ethnoecological studies. His "Hanunoo Color Categories" study helped scholars understand the relationship between classification systems and conceptualization of the world within cultures. In this experiment, Conklin discovered that people in various cultures recognize colors differently due to their unique classification system. Within his results he found that the Hanunoo uses two levels of colors. The first level consists of four basic terms of colors:; darkness, lightness, redness, and greenness. While, the second level was more abstract and consisted of hundreds of color classifications such as: texture, shininess, and moisture of objects also were used to classify objects.

Other anthropologists had a hard time understanding this color classification system because they often applied their own idea of color criteria to those of the Hanunoo. Conklin's studies were not only the breakthrough of ethnoecology, but they also helped develop the idea that other cultures conceptualize the world in their own terms, which helped to reduce ethnocentric views of those in western cultures. Other scholars such as [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Breedlove, and Raven endeavored to learn more about other systems of environment classifications and to compare them to [[Taxonomy (biology)|Western scientific taxonomies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prado|first=Helbert Medeiros|last2=Murrieta|first2=Rui Sérgio Sereni|last3=Prado|first3=Helbert Medeiros|last4=Murrieta|first4=Rui Sérgio Sereni|date=2015-12|title=ETHNOECOLOGY IN PERSPECTIVE: THE ORIGINS, INTERFACES AND CURRENT TRENDS OF A GROWING FIELD|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1414-753X2015000400009&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Ambiente &amp;amp; Sociedade|volume=18|issue=4|pages=139–160|doi=10.1590/1809-4422ASOC986V1842015|issn=1414-753X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

[[Ethnoscience]] emphasizes the importance of how societies make sense of their own reality. In order to understand how cultures perceive the world around them, like the classification and organization of the environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754670.001.0001/acref-9780199754670|title=The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9780199754670|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754670.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ethnoecology borrows methods from linguistics and cultural anthropology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lehigh.edu/~dac511/pages/research/ethnoecol.html|title=Ethnoecology, David Casagrande|website=www.lehigh.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ethnoecology is a major part of an anthropologist’s toolkit;  it helps researchers understand how the society conceptualizes their surrounding environment i and that it can determine what the society considers "worth attending to" in their ecological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864107613|title=An ethnoecological approach to the study of a village Himachal Pradesh|last=Anindita.|first=Ghosh,|date=2012|publisher=LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing|isbn=9783659305320|edition=1. Aufl|location=Saarbrücken|oclc=864107613}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information can ultimately be useful for other approaches used in [[environmental anthropology]].

Ethnoecology is a field of [[environmental anthropology]], and has derived much of its characteristics from classic as well as more modern theorists. [[Franz Boas]] was one of the first anthropologists to question [[unilineal evolution]], the belief that all societies follow the same, unavoidable path towards [[Western civilization]]. Boas strongly urged anthropologists to gather detailed ethnographic data from an [[emic]] standpoint in order to understand different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Irving|date=1959|title=Evolution and Anthropology|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3825587|journal=Victorian Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=55–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Steward]] was another anthropologist whose ideas and theories influenced the use of ethnoecology. Steward coined the term [[cultural ecology]], the study of human adaptations to social and physical environments, and focused on how evolutionary paths in similar societies result in different trajectories instead of the classic global trends in evolution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=Ecological%20Anthropology|title=Ecological Anthropology - Anthropological Theories - Department of Anthropology - The University of Alabama|website=anthropology.ua.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new perspective on [[cultural evolution]] was  later named [[multilineal evolution]]. Both Boas and Steward believed that a researcher must use an emic standpoint and that cultural adaptation to an environment is not the same for each society. Furthermore, Steward's cultural ecology provides an important theoretical antecedent for ethnoecology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another contributor to the framework of ethnoecology was anthropologist [[Leslie White]].  White emphasized the interpretation of cultures as [[System|systems]] and laid the foundations for interpreting the intersection of [[Cultural system|cultural systems]] with [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] as well as their integration into a coherent whole. Altogether, these anthropologists, established the foundations of ethnoecology we see today.

== Traditional ecological knowledge ==

[[Traditional Ecological Knowledge]] (TEK), also known as [[Indigenous Knowledge]], "refers to the evolving knowledge acquired by indigenous and local peoples over hundreds or thousands of years through direct contact with the environment."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/nativeamerican/traditional-knowledge.html|title=Fish and Wildlife Service - Native American Liaison|last=Service|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife|website=www.fws.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the accumulated knowledge, beliefs, and practices widely held by a specific community through their relationship with the environment. In this context, TEK consists of a community’s shared ideas when considering subjects such as the acceptable uses of plants and animals, the best approach to maximizing the potential uses of land, the social institutions in which members of society are expected to navigate, and holistically, their [[worldview]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|last2=Folke|first2=Mina Kislalioglu, Carl|last3=Gadgil|first3=Madhav|date=1998-09-01|title=Minireviews: Exploring the Basic Ecological Unit: Ecosystem-like Concepts in Traditional Societies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs100219900034|journal=Ecosystems|language=en|volume=1|issue=5|pages=409–415|doi=10.1007/s100219900034|issn=1432-9840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of TEK frequently includes critiques of the theoretical division between cultural systems and ecosystems, interpreting humans as an integral part of the whole.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Humans, for example, can represent a [[keystone species]] in a given ecosystem and can play critical roles in creating, maintaining, and sustaining it . They can contribute to processes such as [[pedogenesis]], [[seed dispersal]], and fluctuations in [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|title=Traditional Ecological Knowledge, Biodiversity, Resilience and Sustainability|date=1994|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-1006-8_15|work=Biodiversity Conservation: Problems and Policies|pages=269–287|publisher=Springer Netherlands|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-1006-8_15|isbn=9780792331407|access-date=2018-11-05|last2=Folke|first2=Carl|last3=Gadgil|first3=Madhav}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also modify and condition [[Ethology|animal behavior]] in either wild or domesticated species.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Traditional Ecological Knowledge has traditionally focused on what Western science can learn from these communities and how closely their cultural knowledge mirrors scientific structures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been argued that this previous understanding of ecological adaptation could have major influences on our ecological actions in the future. 

==Local knowledge in western society==

Within the discipline of Ethnoecology, there is a clear emphasis on those societies that are deemed "[[indigenous peoples|indigenous]]," "[[traditional]]," or "[[Noble savage|savage]]," a common trend in anthropological pursuits through the 20th century.&lt;ref name="haenn_calakmul"&gt;{{Cite journal

 | first = Nora
 | year = 2000
 | title = Biodiversity Is Diversity in Use: Community-Based Conservation in the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve
 | journal = America Verde Working Papers
 | volume = 7
 | pages = 5
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, societies exist within a wide range of biomes, and have needs to know and understand clear and present dangers beyond those of harmful plants or how to get the best crop.&lt;ref name="haenn_calakmul" /&gt;  Cruikshank contends that this may because many see Traditional Ecological Knowledge as a "static, timeless, and hermetically sealed" notion.&lt;ref name="cruikshank_glaciers"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Do Glaciers Listen? : Local Knowledge, Colonial Encounters, and Social Imagination|last=Cruikshank|first=Julie|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2005|location=Seattle|pages=9}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;  Locked within time and space, there is no opportunity to innovate, and is therefore not found within the very new structures of a [[post-industrial society]], such as that of the United States.

In this way, ethnoecologies may exist without the bounded notion of the ''other''.  For example, social scientists have attempted to understand the markers inner-city youth use to identify a threat to their livelihood, including the wearing of gang colors, tattoos, or protrusions through clothes that may represent or be a weapon.&lt;ref name="mathios_poverty"&gt;{{Cite journal

 | publisher = College of Human Ecology
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, concepts are spread about the health and needs of the community as they are related to the area around them.  Instilled with recognizing dangers at an early age, and who these threats come from, a set of beliefs are held by the members of the society on how to live in their country, city, or neighborhood.  This broadening of the discipline (bordering on [[human ecology]]) is important because it identifies the environment as not just the plants and animals, but also the humans and technologies a group of people have access to.

Similarly, social scientists have begun to use ethnoecological surveys in ethnographic studies in attempts to understand and address topics relevant in Western society as well as prevalent around the world.&lt;ref name="mathios_poverty" /&gt; This includes researching the ways in which people view their choices and abilities in manipulating the world around them, especially in their ability to subsist.

== Traditional Medicine ==
Traditional societies often treat medical issues through the utilization of their local environment. For example, in Chinese herbal medicine people consider how to utilize native plants for healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm|title=Traditional Chinese Medicine: In Depth|website=NCCIH|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost 80% of the world’s population utilizes ethnobotanical methods as a main source of treatment for illnesses, according to WHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farnsworth|first=Norman R.|last2=Akerele|first2=Olayiwola|last3=Bingel|first3=Audrey S.|last4=Soejarto|first4=Djaja D.|last5=Guo|first5=Zhengang|date=1985|title=Medicinal plants in therapy |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=63|issue=6|pages=965–981 |pmc=2536466|pmid=3879679}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the face of modern climate change, many traditional medicinal practices have been promoted for their environmental sustainability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1995-02-01|title=Ecology and ethnomedicine: Exploring links between current environmental crisis and indigenous medical practices|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0277953694E0098D|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=321–329|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(94)E0098-D|issn=0277-9536}}&lt;/ref&gt;, such as Ayurveda from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rastogi|first=Sanjeev|last2=Kaphle|first2=Krishna|date=2011|title=Sustainable Traditional Medicine: Taking the Inspirations from Ancient Veterinary Science|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/151435/|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|language=en|volume=2011|pages=1–6|doi=10.1093/ecam/nen071|issn=1741-427X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemological concerns==

According to Dove and Carpenter, "environmental anthropology sits astride the [[dichotomy]] between nature and culture, a conceptual separation between categories of nature, like wilderness and parks, and those of culture, like farms and cities.".&lt;ref name="dove_carpenter"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is inherent in this ideology that humans are a polluting factor violating a previously pristine locale.&lt;ref name="dove_carpenter" /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the idea of a corresponding, but not adversarial, relationship between society and culture was once in itself baffling and defiant to the generally accepted modes of understanding in the earlier half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="berkes_unit" /&gt;  As time went on, the understood dichotomy of nature and culture continued to be challenged by ethnographers such as [[Darrell A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19959">'''Failure rate''' is the [[frequency]] with which an [[systems engineering|engineered system]] or component fails, expressed in failures per unit of time.  It is often denoted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[λ]] (lambda) and is highly used in [[reliability engineering]].

The failure rate of a system usually depends on time, with the rate varying over the life cycle of the system.  For example, an automobile's failure rate in its fifth year of service may be many times greater than its failure rate during its first year of service.  One does not expect to replace an exhaust pipe, overhaul the brakes, or have major [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] problems in a new vehicle.

In practice, the [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF, 1/λ) is often reported instead of the failure rate. This is valid and useful if the failure rate may be assumed constant – often used for complex units / systems, electronics – and is a general agreement in some reliability standards (Military and Aerospace). It does in this case ''only'' relate to the flat region of the [[bathtub curve]], which is also called the "useful life period". Because of this, it is incorrect to extrapolate MTBF to give an estimate of the service lifetime of a component, which will typically be much less than suggested by the MTBF due to the much higher failure rates in the "end-of-life wearout" part of the "bathtub curve".

The reason for the preferred use for MTBF numbers is that the use of large positive numbers (such as 2000 hours) is more intuitive and easier to remember than very small numbers (such as 0.0005 per hour).

The MTBF is an important system parameter in systems where failure rate needs to be managed, in particular for safety systems. The MTBF appears frequently in the [[engineering]] design requirements, and governs frequency of required system maintenance and inspections.  In special processes called [[renewal process]]es, where the time to recover from failure can be neglected and the likelihood of failure remains constant with respect to time, the failure rate is simply the multiplicative inverse of the MTBF (1/λ).

A similar ratio used in the [[transport industry|transport industries]], especially in [[railway]]s and [[Truck driver|trucking]] is "mean distance between failures", a variation which attempts to [[Correlation|correlate]] actual loaded distances to similar reliability needs and practices.

Failure rates are important factors in the insurance, finance, commerce and regulatory industries and fundamental to the design of safe systems in a wide variety of applications.

==Failure rate in the discrete sense==

The failure rate can be defined as the following:

:The total number of failures within an item [[statistical population|population]], divided by the total time expended by that population, during a particular measurement interval under stated conditions. (MacDiarmid, ''et al.'')

Although the failure rate, &lt;math&gt;\lambda (t)&lt;/math&gt;, is often thought of as the [[probability]] that a failure occurs in a specified interval given no failure before time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, it is not actually a probability because it can exceed 1. Erroneous expression of the failure rate in % could result in incorrect perception of the measure, especially if it would be measured from repairable systems and multiple systems with non-constant failure rates or different operation times. It can be defined with the aid of the [[reliability function]], also called the survival function, &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the probability of no failure before time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{R(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the time to (first) failure distribution (i.e. the failure density function) and &lt;math&gt;R(t)=1-F(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{R(t_1)-R(t_2)}{(t_2-t_1) \cdot R(t_1)}
 = \frac{R(t)-R(t+\Delta t)}{\Delta t \cdot R(t)} \!&lt;/math&gt;

over a time interval &lt;math&gt;(t_2-t_1)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;) to &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;(t_2-t_1)&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that this is a [[conditional probability]], where the condition is that the failure has not occurred at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the denominator.

Hazard rate and ROCOF (rate of occurrence of failures) are often incorrectly seen as the same and equal to the failure rate. {{clarify|date=April 2015}} To clarify; the more promptly items are repaired, the sooner they will break again, so the higher the ROCOF. The hazard rate is however independent of the time to repair and of the logistic delay time.

==Failure rate in the continuous sense==
{{merge from|Unobserved heterogeneity in duration models|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Loglogistichaz.svg|thumb|right|300px|Hazard function &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt; plotted for a selection of [[log-logistic distribution]]s.]]
Calculating the failure rate for ever smaller intervals of time, results in the '''{{visible anchor|hazard function}}''' (also called '''hazard rate'''), &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt;. This becomes the ''instantaneous'' failure rate as &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &lt;/math&gt; tends to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t)=\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{R(t)-R(t+\Delta t)}{\Delta t \cdot R(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

A continuous failure rate depends on the existence of a '''failure distribution''', &lt;math&gt;F(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which is a [[cumulative distribution function]] that describes the probability of failure (at least) up to and including time ''t'',

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Pr}(T\le t)=F(t)=1-R(t),\quad t\ge 0. \!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the failure time.
The failure distribution function is the integral of the failure [[probability density function|''density'' function]], ''f''(''t''),

:&lt;math&gt;F(t)=\int_{0}^{t} f(\tau)\, d\tau. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The hazard function can be defined now as

:&lt;math&gt;h(t)=\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}=\frac{f(t)}{R(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Exponential pdf.svg|thumb|right|300px|Exponential failure density functions. Each of these has a (different) constant hazard function (see text).]]
Many probability distributions can be used to model the failure distribution (''see [[List of probability distributions|List of important probability distributions]]''). A common model is the '''exponential failure distribution''',

:&lt;math&gt;F(t)=\int_{0}^{t} \lambda e^{-\lambda \tau}\, d\tau = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

which is based on the [[exponential distribution|exponential density function]]. The hazard rate function for this is:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{R(t)} = \frac{\lambda e^{-\lambda t}}{e^{-\lambda t}} = \lambda .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for an exponential failure distribution, the hazard rate is a constant with respect to time (that is, the distribution is "[[memorylessness|memory-less]]").  For other distributions, such as a [[Weibull distribution]] or a [[log-normal distribution]], the hazard function may not be constant with respect to time. For some such as the [[deterministic distribution]] it is [[monotonic]] increasing (analogous to [[Wear and tear|"wearing out"]]), for others such as the [[Pareto distribution]] it is monotonic decreasing (analogous to [[Burn-in|"burning in"]]), while for many it is not monotonic.

==Decreasing failure rate==
A decreasing failure rate (DFR) describes a phenomenon where the probability of an event in a fixed time interval in the future decreases over time. A decreasing failure rate can describe a period of "infant mortality" where earlier failures are eliminated or corrected&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-1-84800-986-8_1 | chapter = Introduction | first = Maxim | last = Finkelstein| title = Failure Rate Modelling for Reliability and Risk | series = Springer Series in Reliability Engineering | pages = 1–84 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-84800-985-1 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and corresponds to the situation where λ(''t'') is a [[decreasing function]].

Mixtures of DFR variables are DFR.&lt;ref name="brown1980"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = M. | title = Bounds, Inequalities, and Monotonicity Properties for Some Specialized Renewal Processes | doi = 10.1214/aop/1176994773 | journal = The Annals of Probability | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 227 | jstor = 2243267| year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mixtures of [[exponential distribution|exponentially distributed]] random variables are [[Hyperexponential distribution|hyperexponentially distributed]].

===Renewal processes===

For a [[renewal process]] with DFR renewal function, inter-renewal times are concave.&lt;ref name="brown1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shanthikumar"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shanthikumar | first1 = J. G. | doi = 10.1214/aop/1176991910 | title = DFR Property of First-Passage Times and its Preservation Under Geometric Compounding | journal = The Annals of Probability | volume = 16 | pages = 397–406 | year = 1988 | jstor = 2243910| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown conjectured the converse, that DFR is also necessary for the inter-renewal times to be concave,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = M. | title = Further Monotonicity Properties for Specialized Renewal Processes | doi = 10.1214/aop/1176994317 | journal = The Annals of Probability | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 891 | year = 1981 | jstor = 2243747| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; however it has been shown that this conjecture holds neither in the discrete case&lt;ref name="shanthikumar" /&gt; nor in the continuous case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yu | first1 = Y. | title = Concave renewal functions do not imply DFR interrenewal times | doi = 10.1239/jap/1308662647 | journal = Journal of Applied Probability | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 583 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = | arxiv = 1009.2463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications===

Increasing failure rate is an intuitive concept caused by components wearing out. Decreasing failure rate describes a system which improves with age.&lt;ref name="proschan" /&gt;
Decreasing failure rates have been found in the lifetimes of spacecraft, Baker and Baker commenting that "those spacecraft that last, last on and on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Baker | first2 = G. A. S. . | doi = 10.2514/3.28040 | title = Impact of the space environment on spacecraft lifetimes | journal = Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 479 | year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1980JSpRo..17..479B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1002/9781119994077.ch1 | chapter = On Time, Reliability, and Spacecraft | first1 = Joseph Homer | last1 = Saleh | first2 =Jean-François | last2 =Castet| title = Spacecraft Reliability and Multi-State Failures | pages = 1 | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781119994077 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reliability of aircraft air conditioning systems were individually found to have an [[exponential distribution]], and thus in the pooled population a DFR.&lt;ref name="proschan"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Proschan | first1 = F. | title = Theoretical Explanation of Observed Decreasing Failure Rate | doi = 10.1080/00401706.1963.10490105 | journal = Technometrics | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 375–383 | jstor = 1266340| year = 1963 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coefficient of variation===

When the failure rate is decreasing the [[coefficient of variation]] is ⩾&amp;nbsp;1, and when the failure rate is increasing the coefficient of variation is ⩽&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wierman | first1 = A. | authorlink1 = Adam Wierman| last2 = Bansal | first2 = N. | last3 = Harchol-Balter | first3 = M.|author3-link=Mor Harchol-Balter | title = A note on comparing response times in the M/GI/1/FB and M/GI/1/PS queues | doi = 10.1016/S0167-6377(03)00061-0 | journal = Operations Research Letters | volume = 32 | pages = 73 | url = http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~adamw/papers/fbnote.pdf| year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this result only holds when the failure rate is defined for all t&amp;nbsp;⩾&amp;nbsp;0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Analysis of Queues: Methods and Applications | first = Natarajan | last =Gautam | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2012 | page = 703 | isbn = 1439806586}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the converse result (coefficient of variation determining nature of failure rate) does not hold.

==Failure rate data==
Failure rate [[data]] can be obtained in several ways. The most common means are:
;Historical data about the device or system under consideration: Many organizations maintain internal databases of failure information on the devices or systems that they produce, which can be used to calculate failure rates for those devices or systems. For new devices or systems, the historical data for similar devices or systems can serve as a useful estimate.
;Government and commercial failure rate data: Handbooks of failure rate data for various components are available from government and commercial sources. [[#Online|MIL-HDBK-217F]], ''Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment'', is a [[United States Military Standard|military standard]] that provides failure rate data for many military electronic components. Several failure rate data sources are available commercially that focus on commercial components, including some non-electronic components.
;Testing: The most accurate source of data is to test samples of the actual devices or systems in order to generate failure data. This is often prohibitively expensive or impractical, so that the previous data sources are often used instead.

===Units===
Failure rates can be expressed using any measure of time, but '''hours''' is the most common unit in practice. Other units, such as miles, revolutions, etc., can also be used in place of "time" units.

Failure rates are often expressed in [[engineering notation]] as failures per million, or 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, especially for individual components, since their failure rates are often very low.

The '''Failures In Time''' ('''FIT''') rate of a device is the number of failures that can be expected in one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) device-hours of operation.&lt;ref&gt;

2010.
p. 6.
&lt;/ref&gt;
(E.g. 1000 devices for 1 million hours, or 1 million devices for 1000 hours each, or some other combination.) This term is used particularly by the [[semiconductor]] industry.

The relationship of FIT to MTBF may be expressed as: MTBF = 1,000,000,000 x 1/FIT.

===Additivity===
Under certain [[engineering]] assumptions (e.g. besides the above assumptions for a constant failure rate, the assumption that the considered system has no relevant [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancies]]), the failure rate for a complex [[system]] is simply the sum of the individual failure rates of its components, as long as the units are consistent, e.g. failures per million hours. This permits testing of individual components or [[subsystem]]s, whose failure rates are then added to obtain the total system failure rate.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding "redundant" components to eliminate a [[single point of failure]] improves the mission failure rate, but makes the series failure rate (also called the logistics failure rate) worse—the extra components improve the mean time between critical failures (MTBCF), even though the mean time before something fails is worse.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.quanterion.com/mission-reliability-and-logistics-reliability-a-design-paradox/ "Mission Reliability and Logistics Reliability: A Design Paradox"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
Suppose it is desired to estimate the failure rate of a certain component. A test can be performed to estimate its failure rate. Ten identical components are each tested until they either fail or reach 1000 hours, at which time the test is terminated for that component. (The level of statistical [[confidence interval|confidence]] is not considered in this example.) The results are as follows:

Estimated failure rate is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{6\text{ failures}}{7502\text{ hours}} = 0.0007998\, \frac{\text{failures}}{\text{hour}} = 799.8 \times 10^{-6}\, \frac{\text{failures}}{\text{hour}}, &lt;/math&gt;

or 799.8 failures for every million hours of operation.

==Estimation==
The [[Nelson–Aalen estimator]] can be used to estimate the cumulative hazard rate function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6661">'''Formability''' is the ability of a given [[metal]] workpiece to undergo [[plastic deformation]] without being damaged. The plastic deformation capacity of [[metal]]lic materials, however, is limited to a certain extent, at which point, the material could experience tearing or fracture (breakage).

Processes affected by the formability of a material include: [[rolling]], [[extrusion]], [[forging]], [[rollforming]], [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamping]], and [[hydroforming]].

== Fracture strain ==
A general parameter that indicates the formability and [[ductility]] of a material is the [[fracture]] strain which is determined by a uniaxial [[tensile test]] (see also [[fracture toughness]]). The strain identified by this test is defined by elongation with respect to a reference length. For example, a length of {{convert|abbr=on|80|mm|in}} is used for the standardized uniaxial test of flat specimens, pursuant to [[EN 10002]]. It is important to note that deformation is homogeneous up to uniform elongation. Strain subsequently localizes until fracture occurs. Fracture strain is not an engineering strain since distribution of the deformation is inhomogeneous within the reference length. Fracture strain is nevertheless a rough indicator of the formability of a material. Typical values of the fracture strain are: 7% for ultra-high-strength material, and over 50% for mild-strength steel.

== Forming limits for sheet forming ==
One main failure mode is caused by tearing of the material. This is typical for sheet-forming applications.&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;Pearce, R.: “Sheet Metal Forming”, Adam Hilger, 1991, {{ISBN|0-7503-0101-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koist"&gt;Koistinen, D. P.; Wang, N.-M. edts.: „Mechanics of Sheet Metal Forming – Material Behavior and Deformation analysis“, Plenum Press, 1978, {{ISBN|0-306-40068-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marc"&gt;Marciniak, Z.; Duncan, J.: “The Mechanics of Sheet Metal Forming”, Edward Arnold, 1992, {{ISBN|0-340-56405-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A neck may appear at a certain forming stage. This is an indication of localized [[plastic deformation]]. Whereas more or less homogeneous deformation takes place in and around the subsequent neck location in the early stable deformation stage, almost all deformation is concentrated in the neck zone during the quasi-stable and instable deformation phase. This leads to material failure manifested by tearing. Forming-limit curves depict the extreme, but still possible, deformation which a sheet material may undergo during any stage of the stamping process. These limits depend on the deformation mode and the ratio of the surface strains. The major surface strain has a minimum value when plane strain deformation occurs, which means that the corresponding minor surface strain is zero. Forming limits are a specific material property. Typical plane strain values range from 10% for high-strength grades and 50% or above for mild-strength materials and those with very good formability.
[[Forming limit diagram]]s are often used to graphically or mathematically represent formability. It is recognized by many authors that the nature of fracture and therefore the [[Forming limit diagram]]s are intrinsically non-deterministic, since large variations might be observed even within a single experimental campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strano|first=M.|author2=Colosimo, B.M.|title=Logistic regression analysis for experimental determination of forming limit diagrams|journal=International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture|date=30 April 2006|volume=46|issue=6|pages=673–682|doi=10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2005.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deep drawability ==
A classic form of sheetforming is [[deep drawing]], which is done by drawing a sheet by means of a [[punch tool]] pressing on the inner region of the sheet, whereas the side material held by a blankholder can be drawn toward the center. It has been observed that materials with outstanding deep drawability behave anisotropically (see: [[anisotropy]]). Plastic deformation in the surface is much more pronounced than in the thickness. The [[lankford coefficient]] (r) is a specific material property indicating the ratio between width deformation and thickness deformation in the uniaxial tensile test. Materials with very good deep drawability have an ''r'' value of 2 or below. The positive aspect of formability with respect to the forming limit curve ([[forming limit diagram]]) is seen in the deformation paths of the material that are concentrated in the extreme left of the diagram, where the forming limits become very large.

== Ductility ==
Another failure mode that may occur without any tearing is [[ductile]] fracture after plastic deformation ([[ductility]]). This may occur as a result of bending or shear deformation (inplane or through the thickness). The failure mechanism may be due to void [[nucleation]] and expansion on a microscopic level. Microcracks and subsequent [[macrocrack]]s may appear when deformation of the material between the voids has exceeded the limit. Extensive research has focused in recent years on understanding and modeling [[ductile]] fracture. The approach has been to identify [[ductile]] forming limits using various small-scale tests that show different strain ratios or stress triaxialities.&lt;ref name="Hoop"&gt;Hooputra, H.; Gese, H.; Dell, H.; Werner, H.: "A comprehensive failure model for crashworthiness simulation of aluminium extrusions", IJ Crash 2004 Vol 9, No. 5, pp. 449-463.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wierz"&gt;Wierzbicki, T.; Bao, Y.; Lee, Y.-W.; Bai, Y.: “Calibration and Evaluation of Seven Fracture Models”, Int. J. Mech. Sci., Vol. 47, 719 – 743, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; An effective measure of this type of forming limit is the minimum radius in roll-forming applications (half the sheet thickness for materials with good and three times the sheet thickness for materials with low formability).

== Use of formability parameters ==
Knowledge of the material formability is very important to the layout and design of any industrial forming process. Simulations using the [[finite-element method]] and use of formability criteria such as the forming limit curve ([[forming limit diagram]]) enhance and, in some cases, are indispensable to certain tool design processes (also see: [[Sheet metal forming simulation]] and [[Sheet metal forming analysis]]).

== IDDRG ==
One major objective of the International Deep Drawing Research Group ([[IDDRG]], from 1957) is the investigation, exchange and dissemination of knowledge and experience about the formability of sheet materials.

[[File: Geodätisches Observatorium Wettzell 2014.jpg|thumb|Geodetic Observatory Wettzell, 2014]]
The '''Geodetic Observatory Wettzell''' is located atop the 616 meter-high mountain Wagnerberg, west of the village Wettzell in the [[Germany|German]] [[Cham (district)|district Cham]] in the [[Bavarian Forest]].

== Tasks ==
[[File:Twin-Teleskope.jpg|thumb|Twin telescopes with operational building, 2015]]
It is operated for the purpose of geodesy by the [[Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy]] together with the [[Technical University of Munich]] and is today one of the most important [[Geodesy|geodetic]] [[Observatory|observatories]] in the world.

As observing station, the Geodetic Observatory Wettzell has the task of gathering measuring data for the geodetic space techniques [[Very-long-baseline interferometry|VLBI]], [[Satellite laser ranging|SLR]], [[Satellite navigation|GNSS]] and [[DORIS (geodesy)|DORIS]]. These data are used for realizing global [[Spatial reference system|coordinate reference systems]] that form the basis for numerous issues in the field of geosciences (e.g. [[continental drift]], [[sea level rise]]), in aerospace, but also in areas of everyday life (e.g. surveying, navigation). These global tasks can today only be solved through international cooperation. The activities like observations, data flow, data analysis and provision of results are coordinated by the international services of the [[International Association of Geodesy|IAG]], e.g. [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|IERS]], IVS (International VLBI Service), ILRS (International Laser Ranging Service), IGS (International GNSS Service) and IDS (International DORIS Service).

The Federal Georeference Data Act (German: ''Bundesgeoreferenzdatengesetz'') is the legal basis for that.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgeorg/ Bundesgeoreferenzdatengesetz (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wettzell also supports the operation of the observatories AGGO in [[La Plata]]/[[Argentina]] and [[Base General Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme|GARS O'Higgins]] in [[Antarctica]].

== Measurement equipment ==
[[File:WLRS.jpg|thumb|Dome of the laser telescope WLRS with radar tower, multi target and three GNSS antennas, 2016]]
At the site with an approximate size of 300 by 150 meters, you find all modern observation techniques of [[satellite geodesy|satellite]] or [[space geodesy]] and complementary measuring techniques, especially
* a [[laser|laser telescope]] for ranging to satellites and the moon (WLRS)
* a [[laser|laser telescope]] for distance measurements to low-flying satellites with high temporal resolution (SOS-W)
* a 20 m [[radio telescope]] for intercontinental [[Very-long-baseline interferometry|VLBI]] measurements (RTW)
* a twin system consisting of two 13 m [[radio telescope|radio telescopes]], also for [[Very-long-baseline interferometry|VLBI]] measurements (TTW-1 and TTW-2)
* several Multi-[[Satellite navigation|GNSS]] receivers for continuous satellite measurements
* a high-precision time system with several [[atomic clock|atomic clocks]] and hydrogen [[maser|masers]] and a fibre-optic time distribution system with delay compensation
* a [[ring laser]] in an underground observatory for monitoring the [[Earth's rotation]]
* a beacon for the French Doppler system [[DORIS (geodesy)|DORIS]]
* a superconducting [[gravimeter]]
* complementary measuring equipment for ground and atmosphere monitoring (seismometer, tiltmeter, hydrological sensors, climate station, water vapour radiometer, temperature profiler, cloud detector)
* and facilities for administration and maintenance.

The reference points of the single measuring systems are linked by a local surveying network in order to obtain coordinate differences for a combination of the different techniques. This characteristic determines a geodetic [[fundamental station]].

== History ==
[[File:Laserentfernungs-Messsystem.jpg|thumb|upright|First generation laser ranging system SRS, 1973]]
The Geodetic Observatory Wettzell was founded nearby the former [[Iron Curtain]] to former [[Czechoslovakia]] and to the [[Air Defense Identification Zone]] in 1970 in order to have a night sky as dark as possible with only low [[light pollution]] and have to take little consideration of air traffic for [[Satellite laser ranging|Satellite]] and [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment|Lunar Laser Ranging]].
&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentalstation Wettzell - Ein geodätisches Observatorium'', Zeitschrift für Vermessungswesen, issue 132 (3), pp. 158-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginnings of the satellite observing station Wettzell go back to an early research project of the [[Technical University of Munich]] and the [[Institute for Applied Geodesy]] for optical observation and [[orbit determination]] of geodetic Earth satellites. The field of [[satellite geodesy]] newly arisen at that time promised great progress for global geodesy. The optical observations carried out until the end of the 1970s included images of satellite passages with the ''Zeiss Double [[Astrograph]]'' and the ballistic measuring camera ''Zeiss BMK 75'' for [[stellar triangulation|satellite triangulation]] and observations with a circumzenithal and the ''Danjon [[astrolabe|Astrolab]]'' for astronomical longitude and latitude determination.

In cooperation with the German Test and Research Institute for Aviation and Space Flight (DFVLR, today‘s [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]]), a first laser distance measuring system consisting of an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] [[gun carriage]] and a [[ruby laser]], was put in operation in 1972. With that, on 8 April 1973, the distance to a satellite (GEOS-1) was measured for the first time in Germany by laser. But only with the following, computer-adjusted systems SRS (Satellite Ranging System, 1977-1991) and WLRS (Wettzell Laser Ranging System, since 1991) large numbers of routine observations became possible. In addition, distances to the reflectors located at the moon were already measured with the WLRS.

In the mid-seventies, the station was extended by microwave measuring techniques. Since 1974, [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] measurements to satellites of the “Navy Navigational Satellite System” (N.N.S.S. or [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]]) were performed regularly for point determination in geodesy. The first measurements to the satellite navigation system [[Global Positioning System|NAVSTAR GPS]] were already performed during the test phase 1979-1981 with Wettzell as one of four tracking stations worldwide. In 1993 the Doppler measurements ended, after the N.N.S.S. was replaced with the full development of GPS.

With implementing a [[radio telescope]] in 1983, the satellite observation station turned into a [[fundamental station]] of geodesy, where the various space geodetic techniques [[Very-long-baseline interferometry|VLBI]], [[Satellite laser ranging|SLR]] and [[Satellite navigation|GNSS]] are combined in one place. Since 2012, the observatory has two further so-called twin telescopes, in order to take account of technical progress and the increasing observation tasks.

The '''Hand of God''', or '''Manus Dei''' in Latin, also known as '''Dextera domini/dei''', the "[[right hand of God]]", is a motif in [[Jew]]ish and [[Christian art]], especially of the [[Late Antique]] and [[Early Medieval]] periods, when depiction of [[Jehovah]] or [[God the Father]] as a full human figure was considered unacceptable. The hand, sometimes including a portion of an arm, or ending about the wrist, is used to indicate the intervention in or approval of affairs on Earth by God, and sometimes as a subject in itself. It is an artistic metaphor that is generally not intended to indicate that a hand was physically present or seen at any subject depicted. The Hand is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a [[blessing]] gesture (in Christian examples), but sometimes performing an action. In later Christian works it tends to be replaced by a [[God the Father in Western art|fully realized figure of God the Father]], whose depiction had become acceptable in [[Western Christianity]], although not in [[Eastern Orthodox]] or Jewish art.&lt;ref name="JVL Anthropomorphism"&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01141.html "Anthropomorphism"], Jewish Virtual Library, especially the section on Jewish art near the end.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the hand of God has traditionally been understood as a symbol for God's intervention or approval of human affairs, it is also possible that the hand of God reflects the anthropomorphic conceptions of the deity that may have persisted in late antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Bar Ilan, 321–35; Roth, 191; C. W. Griffith and David Paulsen, 97–118; Jensen, 120–21; Paulsen, 105–16; Jill Joshowitz, ''The Hand of God:The Anthropomorphic God of Late Antique Judaism: Archaeological and Textual Perspectives'', (B.A. thesis, Yeshiva University, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The largest group of Jewish imagery from the ancient world, the 3rd century [[Dura-Europos synagogue|synagogue at Dura-Europas]], has the hand of God in five different scenes, including the ''Sacrifice of Isaac'',&lt;ref&gt;Hachili, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; and no doubt this was one of the many iconographic features taken over by Christian art from what seems to have been a vigorous tradition of Jewish narrative art. Here and elsewhere it often represents the ''[[bath Kol]]'' (literally "daughter of a voice") or voice of God,&lt;ref&gt;A matter disputed by some scholars&lt;/ref&gt; a use also taken over into Christian art.

The hand may also relate to older traditions in various other religions in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Summarized by Hachili, 145&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Amarna art|art of the Amarna period]] in Egypt under [[Akhenaten]], the rays of the [[Aten]] sun-disk end in small hands to suggest the bounty of the supreme deity. Like the [[hamsa]] [[amulet]], the hand is sometimes shown alone on buildings, although it does not seem to have existed as a portable [[amulet]]-type object in Christian use. It is found from the 4th century on in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], including paintings of ''Moses receiving the Law'' and the ''Sacrifice of Isaac''.&lt;ref&gt;Hachili, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous references to the hand, or arm, of God in the [[Hebrew Bible]], most clearly metaphorical in the way that remains current in modern English, but some capable of a literal interpretation.&lt;ref name="JVL Anthropomorphism" /&gt; They are usually distinguished from references to a placement at the [[right hand of God]]. Later [[rabbinic literature]] also contains a number of references. There are three occasions in the gospels when the voice of God is heard, and the hand often represents this in visual art.&lt;ref&gt;"in Ravenna and in Western art from the ninth until the eleventh centuries" according to Schiller I, 149, although Western examples of the hand in depictions of these occasions extend well before and after these dates.&lt;/ref&gt; Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II 674 (Index headings)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sacred texts and commentary==

===Hebrew Bible===
The hand of God, which encompasses God's arm and fingers as well, is one of the most frequently employed anthropomorphisms of the Hebrew Bible. References to the hand of God occur numerous times in the Pentateuch alone, particularly in regards to the unfolding narrative of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt (cf. Exodus 3:19–20, Exodus 14: 3, 8, 31).&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of scholarship on anthropomorphism in biblical and rabbinic Judaism see Meir Bar Ilan, "The Hand of God: A Chapter in Rabbinic Anthropomorphism", in Rashi 1040–1990 ''Hommage a Ephraim'' E. Urbach ed. Gabrielle Sed Rajna. (1993): 321–35; Edmond Cherbonnier, "The Logic of Biblical Anthropomorphism", ''[[Harvard Theological Review]]'' 55.3 (1962): 187–206; Alon Goshen Gottstein, "The Body as Image of God In Rabbinic Literature", ''Harvard Theological Review'' 87.2 (1994): 171–95; Jacob Neusner, ''The Incarnation of God'' (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1988); Morton Smith, "On the Shape of God and Humanity of Gentiles", in ''Religion in Antiquity'' ed. Jacob Neusner (Leiden: Brill, 1968), 315–26; David Stern, "Imitatio Hominis: Anthropomorphism and the Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature", ''[[Prooftexts (journal)|Prooftexts]]'' 12.2 (1992): 151– 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
There are no references to the hand of God as an active agent or witness in the New Testament, though there are several to Jesus standing or sitting by the [[right hand of God]] in God's heavenly court,&lt;ref&gt;Mark 16:19, Luke 22:69, Matthew 22:44 and 26:64, Acts 2:34 and 7:55, 1 Peter 3:22&lt;/ref&gt; a conventional term for the place of honour beside a host or senior family member. For example, when Stephen is filled with the "holy spirit" he looks to heaven and sees Jesus standing by the right hand of God (Acts 7:55). There are three occasions in the [[Gospels]] when the voice of God is heard, and the hand of God often represents this in visual art.&lt;ref&gt;"in Ravenna and in Western art from the ninth until the eleventh centuries" according to Schiller I, 149, although Western examples of the hand in depictions of these occasions extend well before and after these dates.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbinic literature===
[[Anthropomorphic]] [[aggadot]] regarding the hand of God appear frequently in the corpus of rabbinic literature and expand upon anthropomorphic biblical narratives.

==Christian art==
[[File:Apsis mosaic San Clemente n2.jpg|thumb|right|Clothed hand clutching wreath, [[San Clemente, Rome]], 1140–43.]]
In Christian art, the hand of God has traditionally been understood as an artistic metaphor that is not intended to indicate that the deity was physically present or seen in any subject depicted. In the late antique and early medieval periods, the representation of the full-bodied figure of God the Father would have been considered a grave violation of the Second Commandment.&lt;ref&gt;Linda and Peter Murray, "Trinity", in ''The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), 544.&lt;/ref&gt; According to conventional art historical interpretation, the representation of the hand of God in early Christian art thus developed as a necessary and symbolic compromise to the highly anti-anthropomorphic tenor of the Second Commandment, though anthropomorphic interpretations are certainly plausible.&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Griffith and David Paulsen, "Augustine and the Corporeality of God", ''[[Harvard Theological Review]]'' 95.1 (2002): 97–118; Robin Jensen, Face to Face: Portraits of the Divine in Early Christianity (Minneapolis: Fortress, 2005), 120–21; David Paulsen, "Early Christian Belief in a Corporeal Deity: Origen and Augustine as Reluctant Witnesses", Harvard Theological Review, 83.2 (1990): 105–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In early Christian and Byzantine art, the hand of God is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a [[blessing]] gesture, but sometimes performing an action. Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II 674 (Index headings)&lt;/ref&gt; In later Christian works it tends to be replaced by a [[God the Father in Western art|fully realized figure of God the Father]], whose depiction had become acceptable in [[Western Christianity]], although not in [[Eastern Orthodox]] or Jewish art.&lt;ref name="JVL Anthropomorphism" /&gt;

===Iconography===
The motif of the hand, with no body attached, provides a problem for the artist in how to terminate it. In Christian narrative images the hand most often emerges from a small cloud, at or near the top of the image, but in iconic contexts it may appear cut off in the picture space, or spring from a border, or a victor's [[wreath]] (left). A cloud is mentioned as the source of the voice of God in the gospel accounts of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] (see below). Several of the examples in the [[Dura Europos synagogue]] (see below) show a good part of the forearm as well as the hand, which is not found in surviving Christian examples, and most show an open palm, sometimes with the fingers spread out. Later examples in Jewish art are closer in form to Christian styles.

In Christian art, the hand of God usually occupies the form of a blessing gesture, if they are not performing an action, though some just show an open hand. The normal blessing gesture is to point with the index and next finger, with the other fingers curled back and thumb relaxed. There is also a more complicated Byzantine gesture that attempts to represent the Greek letter ''[[Chi (letter)|chi]]'', [[Christ]]'s initial, which looks like a Latin letter "X". This is formed by crossing the thumb and little finger inside the palm, with only the forefinger and next one extended,&lt;ref&gt;Didron, I, 201–3&lt;/ref&gt; or a variant of this.

Especially in Roman mosaics, but also in some German imperial commissions, for example on the [[Lothair Cross]], the hand is clenched around a wreath that goes upwards, and behind which the arm then disappears, forming a tidy circular motif. Especially in these examples, the hand may show the sleeve of a garment, sometimes of two layers, as at [[San Clemente, Rome]]. In blessing forms the hand often has a [[Halo (art)|halo]], which also may provide a convenient termination point. This may or may not be a cruciform halo, indicating the divinity, and specifically the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], or [[Pre-existing Christ]] (see below).
[[File:San Pedro de la Nave capitel.JPG|thumb|left|[[Visigoth]]ic capital with the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]''.]]

The hand is regularly seen in depictions of certain scenes, though it may occur on occasion in a much wider range.&lt;ref&gt;See index of Schiller II under "Hand of God"&lt;/ref&gt; In many scenes one or more angels, acting as the messengers of God, may appear instead of the hand. A virtually unique mosaic depiction of the ''[[Ark of the Covenant]]'' (806) at [[Germigny-des-Prés]], also features the hand of God.

In Christian art the hand will often actually represent the hand of [[God the Son]], or the Logos; this is demonstrated when later depictions start to substitute for the Hand a small half-length portrait of Christ as Logos in a similar circular frame. It is nearly always Christ in the East, but in the West God the Father will sometimes be shown in this way. However, in many contexts the person of the Trinity intended cannot be confirmed from the image alone, except in those images, like the ''[[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]'', where Jesus the [[Incarnate Christ]] is also present, where the hand is clearly that of God the Father. Later [[Eastern Orthodox]] images often identify Hands as the Logos with the usual monogram used in [[icon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example [[:File:St George - Pskov school.jpg|in this icon]], as compared to [[:File:Borisgleb riding.jpg|this one]], which shows the Hand replaced with a Christ/Logos.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Old Testament imagery====
*In the [[Vienna Genesis]] the hand appears above the ''Expulsion of [[Adam and Eve]] from [[Paradise]]''. More often, God was shown in this story using the conventional [[depiction of Jesus]] representing the pre-existent Christ or ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'', who was seen as the Creator by Early Christian writers,&lt;ref&gt;The account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] naturally credits the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father. However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness", and New Testament references to Christ as creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the [[Logos]].&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Adam and Eve was the Old Testament subject most frequently seen in Christian art that needed a pictorial representation of God. A well known modern variant of the traditional hand motif is a sculpture of 1898 by [[Auguste Rodin]] called the ''Hand of God'', which shows a gigantic hand creating Adam and Eve.
*The [[Sacrifice of Isaac]] first appears in Christian art in 4th century depictions from the Roman catacombs and sarcophagi, as well as pieces like a fragment from a marble table from [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Weitzmann|Weitzmann, Kurt]], ed., ''[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll10/id/156533 Age of spirituality : late antique and early Christian art, third to seventh century]'', no. 380, 1979, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, {{ISBN|978-0-87099-179-0}}; full text available online from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham]] is restrained by the hand, which in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] grasped his knife hand, as the angel often does in other depictions.&lt;ref&gt;Though both hand and knife are now missing, with only a wrist stump now remaining.&lt;/ref&gt; However the angel mentioned in the biblical text is more usual, and often included as well. The use of the hand in this scene, at least in Christian art, indicates God's acceptance of the sacrifice, as well as his intervention to change it.
[[File:Paris psaulter gr139 fol422v.jpg|thumb|[[Moses]] receives the [[Tablets of the Law]], and hears the call of God. [[Paris Psalter]].]]
*Some depictions have the hand passing [[Moses]] the [[Tablets of the Law]], found in the Roman catacombs, various Bibles (see gallery), the [[Paris Psalter]], and in mosaic in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Noga-Banai, Galit. ''The Trophies of the Martyrs: An Art Historical Study of Early Christian Silver Reliquaries'', Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-19-921774-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-921774-8}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BUyGDWSsi4sC&amp;pg=PT37&amp;dq=Dura-Europos+Moses+receiving+the+law#v=onepage&amp;q=Dura-Europos%20Moses%20receiving%20the%20law&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The prophet [[Ezekiel]] (2:9–10) received his prophecy by hand: "Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+2&amp;version=NIV Ezekiel Ch. 2], NIV&lt;/ref&gt; and this and other moments from Ezekiel sometimes include the hand. In the [[Paris Psalter]], Moses, [[Jonah]] and [[Isaiah]] are all shown blessed by hands, from which rays of light come. Other prophets are sometimes also shown with the hand.
*In the [[Klosterneuburg]] Altar, [[Drogo Sacramentary]] (shown below) and San Vitale, Ravenna, [[Melchizedek]] is shown blessed by it, in the last combined with [[Abel]]. This relates to the approval of his sacrifice mentioned in the biblical text, and possibly also to the hand's association with divinely ordained monarchy (see below), as Melchizedek was both priest and king according to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:18–20, and his appearance in art is often to evoke this as well as his function as a [[typology (theology)|type]] for Christ.
*The hand can appear in other contexts; the Carolingian [[Utrecht Psalter]] atypically illustrates nearly all the [[Psalms]], probably following an Antique model, and shows the hand in at least 27 of these images, despite also using a figure of Christ-as-God in the heavens even more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psalter.library.uu.nl/default.asp Utrecht Psalter online] – for hands see Psalms 2,5,14,21–23,26,29,40,42,48,53–55,63,77,83,86,105,111,118,123–125,132,136–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A mosaic in the [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] in Ravenna shows the battle of [[Beth-horon]] with the [[Amorites]] ([[Joshua]], 10:11), where: "As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites" – with a large hand representing God.
*The story in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 5:1–31 of [[the writing on the wall]] is rarely depicted until the 17th century, when [[Belshazzar's Feast (Rembrandt)|Rembrandt's well known version]] and others were produced.

====New Testament imagery====

*In depictions of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', the hand often appears at the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]] representing the voice of God, above the [[dove]] representing the [[Holy Spirit]], which is much more common, thus showing the whole [[Trinity]] as present and active.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, 115 &amp; Schiller, I pp. 134 &amp; 137–9&lt;/ref&gt; The hand never seems to appear without the dove, as the Holy Spirit as a dove is mentioned in the Gospel of Mark: "As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."&lt;ref&gt;Mark 3:16–17 NIV; all three [[Synoptic Gospels]] have the voice.&lt;/ref&gt; Both dove and hand are normally located centrally, pointing straight down at Jesus. The hand is mostly found in ''Baptism''s between the 6th (e.g. [[Rabbula Gospels]]) and 11th centuries.
*The hand is found in some Western and later Armenian scenes of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]],&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I pp. 148–151. See also [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=riNIXZzr_NcC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=%22hand+of+God%22+iconography&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hand%20of%20God%22%20iconography&amp;f=false Mathews, p. 96]&lt;/ref&gt; where again the [[Synoptic Gospels]] have the voice of God speaking, this time from a cloud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/matthew/3-17.htm Bible texts and commentaries]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The hand is sometimes seen in the [[Agony in the Garden]], though an angel is more common. This is the third and final occasion when the voice of God is mentioned in the gospels, this time only in the [[Gospel of John]] (12:28). The earliest known example is in the [[St Augustine Gospels]] of c.600.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II, 49&lt;/ref&gt;
*From [[Carolingian art]] until the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]], the hand may appear above the top of the cross in the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], pointing straight down. Sometimes it holds a wreath over Christ's head, as on the rear of the [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] [[Lothair Cross]] at [[Aachen Cathedral]]. The hand represents divine approval, and specifically acceptance of his sacrifice,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II, 107–108 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly also the storm mentioned in the gospels.
*The hand may be seen in the [[Ascension of Christ]], sometimes, as in the [[Drogo Sacramentary]], reaching down and clasping that of Christ, as though to pull him up into the clouds. The ivory plaque now in [[Munich]] (left) with such a depiction is possibly the earliest [[Ascension of Jesus in Christian art|representation of the Ascension]] to survive. 
*In [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s of the [[Last Judgement]], the hand often holds the scales in which souls are weighed (in the West [[Saint Michael]] typically does this). The hand may emerge from the [[Hetoimasia]] usually present, and is typically huge in size compared to the full figures nearby in the composition.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Divine approval of rulers imagery====
[[File:Main Justice Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|The recreated "Hand of Justice" used in [[Napoleon]]'s coronation, [[Musée du Louvre]].]]
The hand often blesses rulers from above, especially in Carolingian and Ottonian works, and coins. The hand may hold a wreath or crown over the ruler's head, or place it on the head. A posthumous coin of [[Constantine the Great]] (the "deification issue") had shown the hand reaching down to pull up a veiled figure of Constantine in a [[quadriga]], in a famously mixed message that combined pagan conventions, where an [[eagle]] drew deified emperors up to the heavens, with Christian iconography. From the late 4th century coins of Late Antique rulers such as [[Arcadius]] (and his empress), [[Galla Placidia]] and others show them being crowned by it – it was in fact mostly used for empresses, and often only appears on issues from the Eastern Empire.&lt;ref&gt;''Catalogue of late Roman coins in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection and in the Whittemore Collection: from Arcadius and Honorius to the accession of Anastasius'', Philip Grierson, Melinda Mays, Dumbarton Oaks, 1992, {{ISBN|0-88402-193-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88402-193-3}}
[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sdCjnwoQLR0C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=coin+crowned+by+%22hand+of+god%22&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books] gives a full account of Late Antique usage. See also [http://www.davidrsear.com/academy/roman_glossary.html#Manus David Sear] coin glossary&lt;/ref&gt; This theme is not then seen in [[Byzantine art]] until the late 10th century, when it appears in coins of [[John I Tzimisces]] (969–976), long after it was common in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Zach Margulies, [http://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=christian%20themes%20in%20byzantine%20coinage "Christian Themes in Byzantine Coinage, 307 - 1204"]&lt;/ref&gt; In later Byzantine miniatures figures the hand is often replaced by a full figure of Christ (in these examples much smaller than the Emperor) placing a crown on the head.&lt;ref&gt;Examples [[:File:Basilios II.jpg|here]] and [[:File:Nicephorus III and Maria of Alania BnF Coislin79 fol2bis.jpg|here]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar symbolism was represented by the "Main de Justice" ("Hand of Justice"), part of the traditional [[French Crown Jewels#Sceptre of Charles V and Main de Justice|French Coronation Regalia]], which was a [[sceptre]] in the form of a short gold rod surmounted by an [[ivory]] hand in the blessing gesture. The object now in the [[Louvre]] is a recreation, made for Napoleon or a restored Bourbon king, of the original, which was destroyed in the [[French Revolution]], although the original ivory hand has survived (now displayed separately). [[Engraved gem]]s are used for an authentic medieval feel. Here the hand represents the justice-dispensing power of God as being literally in the hands of the king.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Saints imagery====
[[File:BambergGregoryUnkFolDedicationMin.jpg|thumb|[[Presentation miniature]] in a copy of [[St Gregory]]'s ''[[Moralia in Job]]'', 11th century.]]
The hand can also be shown with images of saints, either actioning a [[miracle]] associated with a saint – in Catholic theology it is God who performs all miracles – or above an iconic scene. In the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] the hand appears over [[Westminster Abbey]] in the scene showing the funeral of [[Edward the Confessor]]. The hand sometimes appears (see gallery) in scenes of the murder of [[martyr]]s like St [[Thomas Becket]], clearly indicating neither involvement nor approval of the deed, but approval of the saint. In the [[dedication miniature]] shown, the blessing hand seems pointed neither at [[Emperor Henry III]], nor [[St Gregory]] or the abbot, but at the copy of Gregory's book – the same copy that contains this miniature. This looser usage of the motif reaches its peak in Romanesque art, where it occasionally appears in all sorts of contexts – indicating the "right" speaker in a miniature of a [[disputation]], or as the only decoration at the top of a monastic [[charter]]. A number of Anglo-Saxon coins of [[Edward the Elder]] and [[Æthelred the Unready]] has a large hand dominating their reverse sides, although religious symbols were rarely so prominent on Anglo-Saxon coins.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 274 &amp; illustration on 269&lt;/ref&gt;

====Icons====
In [[Eastern Orthodox]] icons the hand remained in use far longer than in the Western church, and is still found in modern icons, normally emerging from circular bands. Apart from the narrative scenes mentioned above it is especially often found in icons of [[military saint]]s, and in some Russian icons is identified by the usual inscription as belonging to Jesus Christ. In other versions of the same composition a small figure of Christ of about the same size as the hand takes its place, which is also seen in many Western works from about 1000 onwards.
 
The earliest surviving [[icon]] of the [[Virgin Mary]], of about 600 from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], has an often overlooked hand, suggesting to Robin Cormack that the emphasis of the subject is on the [[Incarnation]] rather than a simple [[Virgin and Child]].&lt;ref&gt;See also the apse mosaic of the [[Euphrasian Basilica]], from about the 550s, which has a very similar composition.&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the very few major Eastern works showing the Virgin from before the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]], an apse mosaic (lost in 1922) from [[İznik|Nicaea]], also shows the hand above a standing Virgin. Few similar uses of the hand are seen in later Virgins, though the iconographically adventurous Byzantine [[Chludov Psalter]] (9th century) has a small miniature showing the hand and dove above a Virgin &amp; Child.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, p. 7 &amp; fig. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The hand occasionally appears in Western ''[[Annunciation]]s'', even as late as [[Simone Martini]] in the 14th century, by which time the dove, sometimes accompanied by a small image of God the Father, has become more common.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I pp. 43,44,45,47, figs 82, 97, 108&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BMprintAN00343789 001 l.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Anonymous print on the situation of the Netherlands in the 1570s, with three hands]]

====Ravenna mosaics====
The hand appears at the top of a number of Late Antique [[apse]] mosaics in Rome and Ravenna, above a variety of compositions that feature either Christ or the cross,&lt;ref&gt;One previously at [[Santi Cosma e Damiano]] (for example, see Dodwell, p. 5), seems now to have been restored away. Others are in [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]], [[Santa Prassede]], and others illustrated here or on Commons.&lt;/ref&gt; some covered by the regular contexts mentioned above, but others not. The motif is then repeated in much later mosaics from the 12th century.

====Late Medieval and early Renaissance art====
From the 14th century, and earlier in some contexts, [[God the Father in Western art|full figures of God the Father]] became increasingly common in Western art, though still controversial and rare in the Orthodox world. Naturally such figures all have hands, which use the blessing and other gestures in a variety of ways. It may be noted that the most famous of all such uses, [[Michelangelo]]'s creating hand of God in the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], breaks clear of God's encircling robe above the wrist, and is shown against a plain background in a way reminiscent of many examples of the earlier motif.

The motif did not disappear in later iconography, and enjoyed a revival in the 15th century as the range of religious subjects greatly expanded and depiction of God the Father became controversial again among Protestants. The prints of [[Daniel Hopfer]] and others make frequent use of the hand in a variety of contexts, and the personal [[emblem]] of [[John Calvin]] was a heart held in the Hand. Very free use of the motif is made in prints relating to the religious and political fall-out of the Reformation over the next two centuries, in prints on the [[Dutch Revolt]] for example. In a high [[Rococo]] setting at the [[Windberg Abbey]], [[Lower Bavaria]], the Hand of God holds scales in which a lily stem indicating Saint Catherine's purity outweighs the crown and sceptre of worldly pomp.

The similar but essentially unrelated arm-reliquary was a popular form during the medieval period when the hand was most used. Typically these are in precious metal, showing the hand and most of the forearm, pointing up erect from a flat base where the arm stopped. They contained [[relic]]s, usually from that part of the body of the saint, and it was the saint's hand that was represented.

==Examples in late antique and medieval Jewish art==
[[File:Ezekiel 3.jpeg|thumb|Ezekiel in the Valley of Dry Bones cycle [[Dura Europos synagogue]]]]
The hand of God appears in several examples from the small surviving body of figurative Jewish religious art. It is especially prominent in the wall paintings of the third-century [[Dura Europos synagogue]], and also seen in the nave mosaic of the sixth century [[Beth Alpha]] synagogue, and on a sixth-seventh century [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] screen found at the fourth-fifth century [[Susiya]] synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Roth, "Anthropomorphism, Jewish Art", in ''Encyclopedia Judaica'', ed. Fred Skolnik and Michael Berenbaum (Thomson Gale; Detroit : Macmillan Reference USA, 2007), 191 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Dura Europos synagogue===
In the Dura Europos synagogue, the hand of God appears ten times, in five out of the twenty-nine biblically themed wall paintings including the ''Binding of Isaac'', ''Moses and the Burning Bush'', ''Exodus and Crossing of the Red Sea'', ''Elijah Reviving the Child of the Widow of Zarepheth'', and ''Ezekiel in the Valley of Dry Bones''.&lt;ref&gt;Kraeling, 57&lt;/ref&gt;  In several examples the hand includes the forearm as well.

===Beth Alpha synagogue===
[[File:Beit alfa02.jpg|thumbnail|right|Binding of Isaac mosaic, [[Beth Alpha]]]]
In the [[Beth Alpha]] synagogue, the hand of God appears on the ''Binding of Isaac'' panel on the northern entryway of the synagogue's nave mosaic floor.&lt;ref&gt;Eleazar Sukenik, ''The Synagogue at Beth Alpha'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The hand of God appearing in the Beth Alpha ''Binding of Isaac'' mosaic panel is depicted as a disembodied hand emerging from a fiery ball of smoke, "directing the drama and its outcome" according to [[Meyer Schapiro]].&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, 30&lt;/ref&gt; The hand of God is positioned strategically in the upper center of the composition, directly above the ram that the angel of God instructs Abraham to sacrifice in place of Isaac.

===Susiya synagogue===

In the [[Susiya]] synagogue, the hand of God appears on the defaced remains of a marble bimah screen that perhaps once illustrated a biblical scene such as ''Moses Receiving the Law'' or the ''Binding of Isaac''.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Werlin, "Khirbet Susiya" in ''The Late Ancient Synagogues of Southern Palestine'', (Ph.D. diss., University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, 2012): 525.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the hand was subjected to intense [[iconoclastic]] hacking, the iconoclasts left some vestiges of the thumb and the receding fingers intact.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Fine, "Iconoclasm: Who Defeated this Jewish Art", ''Bible Review'' (2000): 32-43; Robert Shick, "Iconoclasm", in ''The Christian Communities of Palestine from Byzantine to Islamic Rule: A Historical and Archaeological Study'' (Darwin Press Inc.: Princeton, N.J.), 213.&lt;/ref&gt; A thumbnail has been carved into the thumb. Foerster asserts that the hand of God originally held a Torah scroll, identifying the small piece of raised marble located between the thumb and fingers as a Torah scroll.&lt;ref&gt;Foerster, ''Decorated Marble Chancel Screens'', 1820.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Birdhea5.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Birds' Head Haggadah]]]]

===Birds' Head Haggadah===
{{main|Birds' Head Haggadah}}
The hand of God appears in the early 14th-century [[Haggadah]], the [[Birds' Head Haggadah]], produced in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;"Bird's Head Haggadah", Israel Museum Digital Catalogue, Israel Museum, Jerusalem http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/popup?c0=13475.&lt;/ref&gt; Two hands of God appear underneath the text of the ''[[Dayenu]]'' song, dispensing the [[manna]] from heaven. The Birds' Head Haggadah is a particularly important visual source from the medieval period, as it is the earliest surviving example of a medieval illuminated Hebrew Haggadah.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4812">The '''Hoboken catalogue''' is a catalogue of the musical compositions by [[Joseph Haydn]] compiled by [[Anthony van Hoboken]]. It is intended to cover the composer's entire oeuvre and includes over 750 entries. Its full title in the original German is ''Joseph Haydn, Thematisch-bibliographisches Werkverzeichnis'' ("Joseph Haydn, thematic-bibliographic catalog of works"). The Haydn catalog that now bears Hoboken's name was begun in card format in 1934; work continued until the publication of the third and final book volume in 1978.

Works by Haydn are often indicated using their Hoboken catalogue number, typically in the format "[[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Haydn)|Violin Concerto No. 1]] in C major, Hob. VIIa:1".

==The catalog==
The catalog is a massive work; a currently available version runs to 1936 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Available in pdf format from [https://archive.org/details/JosephHaydnThematisch-bibliographischesWerkverzeichnis].&lt;/ref&gt; Each work is given with an identifying [[incipit]], printed on a single musical line. There is discussion of manuscript sources, early editions, listing in previous catalogs (including the two Haydn prepared), and critical commentary.

==Organization==

Catalogs of composers' works typically follow either a chronological arrangement (sorting by date of composition) or a sorting by musical genre.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of the chronological type are [[Köchel catalogue]] of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s works, or [[Schubert Thematic Catalogue|Otto Erich Deutsch's catalogue]] of [[Franz Schubert]]'s works. Another example of the genre-arranged type is [[Wolfgang Schmieder]]'s catalogue of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s works.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoboken's catalogue is of the latter type; thus the [[Symphony|symphonies]], for example, are in category I, all [[string quartet]]s are in category III, [[piano sonata]]s are in category XVI, and so on.

'''Hypoxemia''' (or '''hypoxaemia''' in [[British English]]) is an abnormally low level of [[oxygen]] in the [[blood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollak|first=Charles P.|title=The encyclopedia of sleep and sleep disorders |year=2010 |location=New York, NY |isbn=9780816068333|page=104|edition=3rd |author2=Thorpy, Michael J. |author3=Yager, Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MARTIN1999 /&gt; More specifically, it is oxygen deficiency in [[artery|arterial]] blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eckman|first=Margaret |title=Professional guide to pathophysiology |year=2010 |publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-1605477664 |page=208 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypoxemia has many causes, often [[respiratory disorders]], and can cause tissue [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] as the blood is not supplying enough oxygen to the body.

Hypoxemia is usually defined in terms of reduced [[partial pressure]] of oxygen (mm Hg) in arterial blood, but also in terms of reduced content of oxygen (ml oxygen per dl blood) or percentage saturation of [[hemoglobin]] (the oxygen binding [[protein]] within [[red blood cell]]s) with oxygen, which is either found singly or in combination.&lt;ref name=MARTIN1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Lawrence|title=All you really need to know to interpret arterial blood gases|year=1999|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0683306040|page=xxvi|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IntermountainManual&gt;

While there is general agreement that an [[arterial blood gas]] measurement which shows that the partial pressure of oxygen is lower than normal constitutes hypoxemia,&lt;ref name=IntermountainManual /&gt;&lt;ref name='Nadel_Hypoxemia' /&gt;&lt;ref name=CRITICAL2007&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=William C. |editor-last=Wilson |editor-first2=Christopher M. |editor-last2=Grande |editor-first3=David B. |editor-last3=Hoyt|title=Critical care|year=2007|publisher=Informa Healthcare|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8247-2920-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is less agreement concerning whether the oxygen content of blood is relevant in determining hypoxemia. This definition would include oxygen carried by [[hemoglobin]]. The oxygen content of blood is thus sometimes viewed as a measure of tissue delivery rather than hypoxemia.&lt;ref name=CRITICAL2007 /&gt;

Just as extreme hypoxia can be called anoxia, extreme hypoxemia can be called anoxemia.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Main|Hypoxia (medical)#Signs and symptoms}}

In an acute context, hypoxemia can cause symptoms such as those in [[respiratory distress]]. These include [[dyspnoea|breathlessness]], an increased rate of breathing, use of the chest and abdominal muscles to breathe, and [[Pursed lip breathing|lip pursing]].&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;{{rp|642}}

Chronic hypoxemia may be compensated or uncompensated. The compensation may cause symptoms to be overlooked initially, however, further disease or a stress such as [[Basal metabolic rate|any increase in oxygen demand]] may finally unmask the existing hypoxemia. In a compensated state, blood vessels supplying less-ventilated areas of the lung may [[vasoconstriction|selectively contract]], to redirect the blood to areas of the lungs which are better ventilated. However, in a chronic context, and if the lungs are not well ventilated generally, this mechanism can result in [[pulmonary hypertension]], overloading the right ventricle of the heart and causing [[cor pulmonale]] and [[Heart failure#Right-sided failure|right sided heart failure]]. [[Polycythemia]] can also occur.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSONS2010"&gt;{{cite book |veditors = Colledge NR, Walker BR, Ralston SH |title=Davidson's principles and practice of medicine |year=2010 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-7020-3085-7|edition=21st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In children, chronic hypoxemia may manifest as delayed growth, neurological development and motor development and decreased sleep quality with frequent sleep arousals.&lt;ref name=ADDE2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adde |first=FV |author2=Alvarez, AE |author3=Barbisan, BN |author4= Guimarães, BR  |title=Recommendations for long-term home oxygen therapy in children and adolescents |journal=Jornal de Pediatria |date=Jan–Feb 2013 |volume=89|issue=1 |pages=6–17 |doi=10.1016/j.jped.2013.02.003 |pmid=23544805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other symptoms of hypoxemia may include [[cyanosis]], [[digital clubbing]], and symptoms that may relate to the cause of the hypoxemia, including [[cough]] and [[hemoptysis]].&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;{{rp|642}}

Serious hypoxemia occurs (1) when the partial pressure of oxygen in blood is less than 60&amp;nbsp;mm Hg, (the beginning of the steep portion of the [[oxygen–haemoglobin dissociation curve]], where a small decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen results in a large decrease in the oxygen content of the blood);&lt;ref name='Nadel_Hypoxemia'&gt;

Martin, Talmadge E. King, Dean E. Schraufnagel, John F. Murray and Jay A. Nadel (eds.) 5th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders Elsevier. {{ISBN|1-4160-4710-7}}. 
&lt;/ref&gt; or (2) when hemoglobin [[oxygen saturation]] is less than 90%.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2013}} Severe hypoxia can lead to [[respiratory failure]] &lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;

==Causes==
Hypoxemia refers to insufficient oxygen in the blood. Thus any cause that influences the rate or volume of air entering the lungs ('''ventilation''') or any cause that influences the transfer of air from the lungs to the blood may cause hypoxemia. As well as these respiratory causes, [[cardiovascular]] causes such as [[shunt (medical)|shunts]] may also result in hypoxaemia.

Hypoxemia is caused by five categories of etiologies: hypoventilation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, right-to-left shunt, diffusion impairment, and low PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Low PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hypoventilation are associated with a normal A-a gradient whereas the other categories are associated with an increased A-a gradient.&lt;ref name=HARRISONS2008v1&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Anthony S. |editor-last=Fauci |editor-first2=T. R. |editor-last2=Harrison|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-147692-8|edition=17th}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|229}}

===Ventilation===
If the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] ventilation is insufficient, there will not be enough  oxygen delivered to the alveoli for the body's use. This can cause hypoxemia even if the lungs are normal, as the cause is in the brainstem's control of ventilation or in the body's inability to breathe effectively.

====Respiratory drive====
[[Control of respiration|Respiration is controlled]] by centres in the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]], which influence the rate of breathing and the depth of each breath. This is influenced by the blood level of carbon dioxide, as determined by central and peripheral chemoreceptors located in the central nervous system and carotid and aortic bodies, respectively. Hypoxia occurs when the breathing center doesn't function correctly or when the signal is not appropriate:
* [[Stroke]]s, [[epilepsy]] and cervical neck fractures can all damage the medullary [[respiratory centres]] that generates rhythmic impulses and transmit them along the [[phrenic nerve]] to the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], the muscle that is responsible for breathing.
* A decreased respiratory drive can also be the result of [[metabolic alkalosis]], a state of decreased [[carbon dioxide]] in the blood
* [[Central sleep apnea]]. During sleep, the breathing centers of the brain can pause their activity, leading to prolonged periods of apnea with potentially serious consequences.
* Hyperventilation followed by prolonged breath-holding. This hyperventilation, attempted by some swimmers, reduces the amount of carbon dioxide in the lungs. This reduces the urge to breathe. However, it also means that falling blood oxygen levels are not sensed, and can result in hypoxemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craig |first=Albert B. |title=Summary of 58 cases of loss of consciousness during underwater swimming and diving |journal=Medicine and Science in Sports|date=Fall 1976|volume=8|issue=3|pages=171–5|pmid=979564 |doi=10.1249/00005768-197600830-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical states====
A variety of conditions that physically limit airflow can lead to hypoxemia.
* [[Asphyxia|Suffocation]], including temporary interruption temporary cessation of breathing as in [[obstructive sleep apnea]], or bedclothes may interfere with breathing in infants, a putative cause of [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]].
* Structural deformities of the chest, such as [[scoliosis]] and [[kyphosis]], which can restrict breathing and lead to hypoxia.
* [[Myopathy|Muscle weakness]], which may limit the ability of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], the primary muscle for drawing new air into lungs, to function. This may be a result of a congenital disease, such as [[motor neuron disease]], or an acquired condition, such as fatigue in severe cases of [[COPD]].

====Environmental oxygen====
[[File:Oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve.png|thumb|Oxygen-Haemoglobin Dissassociation Curve.]]

In conditions where the proportion of oxygen in the air is low, or when the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen has decreased, less oxygen is present in the alveoli of the lungs. The alveolar oxygen is transferred to [[hemoglobin]], a carrier protein inside [[red blood cell]]s, with an efficiency that decreases with the partial pressure of oxygen in the air. 
  
*[[Altitude]]. The external partial pressure of oxygen decreases with altitude, for example in areas of high altitude or when [[Aviation|flying]]. This decrease results in decreased carriage of oxygen by haemoglobin.&lt;ref name="02_calc"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Kenneth Baillie |author2=Alistair Simpson | title=Altitude oxygen calculator | url=http://www.altitude.org/oxygen_levels.php | publisher= Apex (Altitude Physiology Expeditions) | accessdate=2006-08-10}} – Online interactive oxygen delivery calculator.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly seen as a cause of [[cerebral hypoxia]] and [[Altitude sickness|mountain sickness]] in climbers of [[Mount Everest]] and other peaks of extreme altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=West JB, Boyer SJ, Graber DJ, Hackett PH, Maret KH, Milledge JS, Peters RM, Pizzo CJ, Samaja M, Sarnquist FH |title=Maximal exercise at extreme altitudes on Mount Everest |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology: Respiratory, Environmental and Exercise Physiology|date=September 1983 |volume=55|issue=3 |pages=688–98 |pmid=6415008 |doi=10.1152/jappl.1983.55.3.688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grocott|first=MP|author2=Martin, DS |author3=Levett, DZ |author4=McMorrow, R |author5=Windsor, J |author6=Montgomery, HE |author7= Caudwell Xtreme Everest Research, Group |title=Arterial blood gases and oxygen content in climbers on Mount Everest |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=Jan 8, 2009|volume=360|issue=2|pages=140–9|pmid=19129527|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0801581}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at the peak of Mount Everest, the partial pressure of oxygen is just 43 mmHg, whereas at sea level the partial pressure is 150 mmHg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=John B.|title=Human limits for hypoxia: the physiological challenge of climbing Mt. Everest |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |year=2000 |volume=899|pages=15–27|pmid=10863526|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb06173.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, [[Cabin pressurization|cabin pressure in aircraft]] is maintained at 5,000 to 6,000 feet (1500 to 1800 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ersnet.org/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&amp;view=items&amp;id=4106:airlines-are-cu|title=Airlines are cutting costs – Are patients with respiratory diseases paying the price? {{!}}|last=Administrator|website=www.ersnet.org|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Underwater diving|Diving]]. Hypoxia in diving can result from sudden surfacing. The partial pressures of gases increases when diving, increases by one ATM every ten metres. This means that a partial pressure of oxygen sufficient to maintain good carriage by haemoglobin is possible at depth, even if it is insufficient at the surface. A diver that remains underwater will slowly consume their oxygen, and when surfacing, the partial pressure of oxygen may be insufficient ([[shallow water blackout]]). This may manifest at depth as [[deep water blackout]].
*[[Suffocation]]. Decreased concentration of oxygen in inspired air caused by reduced replacement of oxygen in the breathing mix.
*[[Anaesthetic]]s. Low partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs when switching from inhaled [[anesthesia]] to atmospheric air, due to the [[Fink effect]], or diffusion hypoxia.
* Air depleted of oxygen has also proven fatal.  In the past, [[Anaesthetic machine|anesthesia machines]] have malfunctioned, delivering low-oxygen gas mixtures to patients.  Additionally, oxygen in a confined space can be consumed if [[carbon dioxide scrubber]]s are used without sufficient attention to supplementing the oxygen which has been consumed.

===Perfusion===

====Ventilation-perfusion mismatch====
This refers to a disruption in the ventilation/perfusion equilibrium. Oxygen entering the lungs typically diffuses across the alveolar-capillary membrane into blood. However this equilibration does not occur when the alveolus is insufficiently ventilated, and as a consequence the blood exiting that alveolus is relatively hypoxemic.  When such blood is added to blood from well ventilated alveoli, the mix has a lower oxygen partial pressure than the alveolar air, and so the A-a difference develops. Examples of states that can cause a ventilation-perfusion mismatch include:
* Exercise. Whilst modest activity and exercise improves ventilation-perfusion matching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whipp|first=BJ|author2=Wasserman, K|title=Alveolar-arterial gas tension differences during graded exercise |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=September 1969 |volume=27|issue=3 |pages=361–5 |pmid=5804133 |doi=10.1152/jappl.1969.27.3.361}}&lt;/ref&gt; hypoxemia may develop during intense exercise as a result of preexisting lung diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hopkins|first=SR|title=Exercise induced arterial hypoxemia: the role of ventilation-perfusion inequality and pulmonary diffusion limitation |year=2006|volume=588|pages=17–30|pmid=17089876|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-34817-9_3|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|isbn=978-0-387-34816-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During exercise, almost half of the hypoxemia is due to diffusion limitations (again, on average).&lt;ref name="Agustí 219–25"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Agustí|first=AG|author2=Roca, J |author3=Gea, J |author4=Wagner, PD |author5=Xaubet, A |author6= Rodriguez-Roisin, R  |title=Mechanisms of gas-exchange impairment in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis |journal=The American Review of Respiratory Disease |date=February 1991|volume=143|issue=2|pages=219–25|pmid=1990931 |doi=10.1164/ajrccm/143.2.219}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aging]]. An increasingly poor match between ventilation and perfusion is seen with age, as well as a decreased ability to compensate for hypoxic states.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSONS2010"/&gt; {{rp|646}}
* Disease that affect the pulmonary interstitum can also result in hypoxia, by affecting the ability of oxygen to diffuse into arteries. An example of these diseases is [[pulmonary fibrosis]], where even at rest a fifth of the hypoxemia is due to diffusion limitations (on average).&lt;ref name="Agustí 219–25"/&gt;
* Diseases that result in acute or chronic [[respiratory distress]] can result in hypoxia. These diseases can be acute in onset (such as obstruction by inhaling something or a [[pulmonary embolus]]) or chronic (such as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]). 
* [[Cirrhosis]] can be complicated by refractory hypoxemia due to high rates of blood flow through the lung, resulting in ventilation-perfusion mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agusti|first=AG|author2=Roca, J |author3=Rodriguez-Roisin, R |title=Mechanisms of gas exchange impairment in patients with liver cirrhosis |journal=Clinics in Chest Medicine|date=March 1996|volume=17|issue=1|pages=49–66|pmid=8665790|doi=10.1016/s0272-5231(05)70298-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shunting====
[[Shunt (medical)|Shunting]] refers to blood that bypasses the pulmonary circulation, meaning that the blood does not receive oxygen from the alveoli. In general, a shunt may be within the heart or lungs, and cannot be corrected by administering oxygen alone. Shunting may occur in normal states:
* Anatomic shunting, occurring via the [[Bronchial artery|bronchial circulation]], which provides blood to the tissues of the lung. Shunting also occurs by the [[smallest cardiac veins]], which empty directly into the left ventricle.
* Physiological shunts, occur due to the effect of gravity. The highest concentration of blood in the pulmonary circulation occurs in the bases of the pulmonary tree compared to the highest pressure of gas in the apexes of the lungs. [[alveolus|Alveoli]] may not be ventilated in shallow breathing. 
Shunting may also occur in disease states:
* Acute lung injury and [[adult respiratory distress syndrome]], which may cause alveolar collapse. This will increase the amount of physiological shunting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=YC|author2=Fracica, PJ |author3=Simonson, SG |author4=Crapo, JD |author5=Young, SL |author6=Welty-Wolf, KE |author7=Moon, RE |author8= Piantadosi, CA |title=VA/Q abnormalities during gram negative sepsis |journal=Respiration Physiology|date=August 1996 |volume=105|issue=1–2 |pages=109–21 |pmid=8897657 |doi=10.1016/0034-5687(96)00039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unlike many forms of shunting, can be managed by administering 100% Oxygen.
* Pathological shunts such as [[patent ductus arteriosus]], [[patent foramen ovale]], and [[atrial septal defect]]s or [[ventricular septal defect]]s. These states are when blood from the right side of the heart moves straight to the left side, without first passing through the lungs. This is known as a [[right-to-left shunt]], which is often congenital in origin.

=== Exercise ===
Exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia occurs during exercise when a trained individual exhibits an arterial oxygen saturation below 93%. It occurs in fit, healthy individuals of varying ages and genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|first1=JA|last1=Dempsey|first2=PD|last2=Wagner|date=December 1999|volume=87|issue=6|pages=1997–2006|pmid=10601141|doi=10.1152/jappl.1999.87.6.1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations due to training include an increased cardiac output from cardiac hypertrophy, improved venous return, and metabolic vasodilation of muscles, and an increased VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Max. There must be a corresponding increase in VCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thus a necessity to clear the carbon dioxide to prevent a metabolic acidosis. The hypoxemia occurs in these individuals whereby due to increased pulmonary blood flow:
*'''Reduced capillary transit time''' occurs due to an increased blood flow within the pulmonary capillary. Capillary transit time (tc), at rest is around 0.8s, allowing plenty of time for the diffusion of oxygen into the circulation and the diffusion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; out of the circulation.  After training, the capillary volume is still the same however cardiac output is increased, resulting in a decreased capillary transit time, reducing to around 0.16s in trained individuals at maximal work rates. This does not give sufficient time for gas diffusion and results in a hypoxaemia.
*'''Intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunts''' are dormant capillaries within the lungs that become recruited when venous pressures become too high. They are normally located within deadspace area thus the blood passing through does no become oxygenated resulting in a hypoxemia.

==Physiology==
{{Main|Hypoxia (medical)#Physiological compensation}}
Key to understanding whether the lung is involved in a particular case of hypoxemia is the [[Alveolar–arterial gradient|difference between the alveolar and the arterial oxygen levels]]; this A-a difference is often called the A-a ''gradient'' and is normally small. The arterial oxygen partial pressure is obtained directly from an arterial [[Blood gas|blood gas determination]].  The oxygen contained in the alveolar air can be calculated because it will be directly proportional to its fractional composition in air. Since the airways humidify (and so dilute) the inhaled air, the [[barometric pressure]] of the [[atmosphere]] is reduced by the vapor pressure of water.

==History==
The term hypoxemia was originally used to describe low blood oxygen occurring at high altitudes and was defined generally as defective oxygenation of the blood.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14015">'''Invertebrate zoology''' is the subsystem of [[zoology]] that consists of the study of [[invertebrate]]s, animals without a [[vertebral column|backbone]] (a structure which is found only in [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s.)

Invertebrates are a vast and very diverse group of animals that includes [[sponges]], [[echinoderm]]s, [[tunicate]]s, numerous different [[phylum|phyla]] of [[worm]]s, [[mollusc]]s, [[arthropod]]s and many additional phyla. [[Unicellular organism|Single-celled organisms]] or [[protist]]s are usually not included within the same group as invertebrates.

==Subdivisions==
Invertebrates represent 97% of all named [[animal]] [[species]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert M.|last=May|date=16 September 1988|title=How Many Species Are There on Earth?|journal=Science|volume=241|pages=1441–1449|url=http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-253/002-253.html|jstor=1702670|doi=10.1126/science.241.4872.1441|pmid=17790039|issue=4872}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because of that fact, this subdivision of [[zoology]] has many further 
subdivisions, including but not limited to:

*[[Arthropodology]] - the study of [[arthropods]], which includes
:*[[Arachnology]] - the study of [[spiders]] and other [[arachnid]]s
:*[[Entomology]] - the study of [[insect]]s
:*[[Carcinology]] - the study of [[crustacean]]s
:*[[Myriapodology]] - the study of [[centipede]]s, [[millipede]]s, and other [[myriapod]]s
*[[Cnidariology]] - the study of [[Cnidaria]]
*[[Helminthology]] - the study of [[parasitic worm]]s.
*[[Malacology]] - the study of [[mollusk]]s, which includes
:*[[Conchology]] - the study of [[mollusc shell|Mollusk shells]].
:*[[Limacology]] - the study of [[slug]]s.
:*[[Teuthology]] - the study of [[Cephalopoda|cephalopods]].
*[[Invertebrate paleontology]] - the study of [[fossil]] invertebrates

These divisions are sometimes further divided into more specific specialties.  For example, within arachnology, acarology is the study of [[mite]]s and [[tick]]s; within entomology, [[lepidoptery]] is the study of [[butterflies]] and [[moth]]s, [[myrmecology]] is the study of [[ant]]s and so on.

== History ==

=== Early Modern Era ===
In the period starting in the late 16th century, invertebrate zoology saw growth in the number of publications made and improvement in the experimental practices associated with the field.

One of the major works to be published in the area of zoology was [[Conrad Gessner]]'s [[Historia animalium (Gessner)|Historia animalium]], which was published in numerous editions from 1551 to 1587.  Though it was a work more generally addressing zoology in the large sense, it did contain information on insect life.  Much of the information came from older works; Gessner restated the work of [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Aristotle]] while mixing old knowledge of the natural history of insects with his own observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Harry B.|date=1927-01-01|title=Four Encyclopedic Entomologists of the Renaissance|jstor=25004198|journal=Journal of the New York Entomological Society|volume=35|issue=2|pages=193–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the invention of the [[Microscope]] in 1599 came a new way of observing the small creatures that fall under the umbrella of invertebrate.  [[Robert Hooke]], who worked out of the Royal Society in England, conducted observation of insects—including some of their larval forms—and other invertebrates, such as ticks.  His [[Micrographia]], published in 1665, included illustrations and written descriptions of the things he saw under the microscope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NERI|first=JANICE|date=2008-01-01|title=Between Observation and Image: Representations of Insects in Robert Hooke's "Micrographia"|jstor=42622433|journal=Studies in the History of Art|volume=69|pages=82–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others also worked with the microscope following its acceptance as a scientific tool.  [[Francesco Redi]], an Italian physician and naturalist, used a microscope for observation of invertebrates, but is known for his work in disproving the theory of [[spontaneous generation]].  Redi managed to prove that flies did not spontaneously arise from rotting meat.  He conducted controlled experiments and detailed observation of the fly life cycle in order to do so.  Redi also worked in the description and illustration of parasites for both plants and animals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Egerton|first=Frank N.|date=2005-01-01|title=A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 17: Invertebrate Zoology and Parasitology during the 1600s|jstor=bullecosociamer.86.3.133|journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America|volume=86|issue=3|pages=133–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other men were also conducting research into pests and parasites at this time. [[Felix Plater]], a Swiss physician, worked to differentiate between two types of tape worm.  He also wrote descriptions of both the worms he observed and the effects these worms had on their hosts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Following the publication of [[Francis Bacon]]'s ideas about the value of experimentation in the sciences came a shift toward true experimental efforts in the biological sciences, including invertebrate zoology. [[Jan Swammerdam]], a Dutch microscopist, supported an effort to work for a 'modern' science over blind belief in the work of ancient philosophers.  He worked—like Redi—to disprove spontaneous generation using experimental techniques.  Swammerdam also made a number of advancements in the study of anatomy and physiology.  In the field of entomology, he conducted a number of dissections of insects and made detailed observations of the internal structures of these specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb|first=Matthew|date=2000-09-01|title=Reading and writing The Book of Nature: Jan Swammerdam (1637–1680)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160932700013065|journal=Endeavour|volume=24|issue=3|pages=122–128|doi=10.1016/S0160-9327(00)01306-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swammerdam also worked on a classification of insects based on life histories; he managed to contribute to the literature proving that an egg, larva, pupa, and adult are indeed the same individual.&lt;ref&gt;Beier, Max. "The Early Naturalists and Anatomists During the Renaissance and Seventeenth Century." In ''History of Entomology'', edited by Ray F. Smith, Thomas E. Mittler, and Carroll N. Smith, 90. Palo Alto: Annual Reviews, Inc, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th and 19th Centuries ===
In the 18th century, the study of invertebrates focused on the naming of species that were relevant to economic pursuits, such as agricultural pests.  Entomology was changing in big ways very quickly, as many naturalists and zoologists were working with hexapods.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Egerton|first=Frank N.|date=2008-10-01|title=A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 30: Invertebrate Zoology and Parasitology During the 1700s|journal=The Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America|language=en|volume=89|issue=4|pages=407–433|doi=10.1890/0012-9623(2008)89[407:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2|issn=2327-6096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work was also being done in the realm of [[parasitology]] and the study of worms.  A French physician named [[Nicolas Andry|Nicolas Andry de Bois-Regard]] determined that worms were the cause of some diseases.  He also declared that worms do not spontaneously form within the animal or human gut; de Bois-Regard stated that there must be some kind of 'seed' which enters the body and contains the worm in some form.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[Antonio Vallisneri]] also worked with parasitic worms, specifically members of the genera ''[[Ascaris]]'' and ''Neoascaris''.  He found that these worms came from eggs.  In addition, Vallisneri worked to elucidate the reproduction of insects, specifically the [[sawfly]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1735, the first edition of [[Carl Linnaeus]]' ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' was published; this work included information on both insects and intestinal worms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  However, the tenth edition is considered the true starting point for the modern classification scheme for living things today.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=Gordon McGregor|date=2009-01-01|title=Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778): His Life, Philosophy and Science and Its Relationship to Modern Biology and Medicine|jstor=27756820|journal=Taxon|volume=58|issue=1|pages=18–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Linnaeus' universal system of classification made a system based on [[binomial nomenclature]], but included higher levels of classification than simply the genus and species names.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winsor|first=Mary P.|date=1976-01-01|title=The Development of Linnaean Insect Classification|jstor=1220406|journal=Taxon|volume=25|issue=1|pages=57–67|doi=10.2307/1220406}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Systema Naturae'' was an investigation into the [[biodiversity]] on Earth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, because it was based only on very few characters, the system developed by Linnaeus was an artificial one.&lt;ref&gt;Tuxen, S L. "Entomology Systematizes and Describes: 1700-1815." In ''History of Entomology'', edited by Ray F. Smith, Thomas E. Mittler, and Carroll N. Smith, 107. Palo Alto: Annual Reviews, Inc, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book also included descriptions of the organisms named inside of it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1859, [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[On the Origin of Species]] was published.  In this book, he described his theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].  Both the work of Darwin and his contemporary, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] —who was also working on the theory of evolution—were informed by the careful study of insects.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Herbert H. "Evolution and Phylogeny." In ''History of Entomology'', edited by Ray F. Smith, Thomas E. Mittler, and Carroll N. Smith, 171-84. Palo Alto: Annual Reviews, Inc, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Darwin collected many species of invertebrate during his time aboard the [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']]; many of the specimens collected were insects.  Using these collections, he was able to study [[sexual dimorphism]], geographic distribution of species, and [[mimicry]]; all of these concepts influenced Darwin's theory of evolution.  Unfortunately, a firm popular belief in the immutability of species was a major hurdle in the acceptance of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, John F. ''Bugs and the Victorians''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th Century ===
Classification in the twentieth century shifted toward a focus on evolutionary relationships over morphological description.  The development of [[phylogenetics]] and systematics based on this study is credited to [[Willi Hennig]], a German entomologist.  In 1966, his ''Phylogenetic Systematics'' was published; inside, Hennig redefined the goals of systematic schemes for classifying living things.  He proposed that the focus be on evolutionary relationships over similar morphological features.  He also defined [[monophyly]] and included his ideas about hierarchical classification.  Though Hennig did not include information on [[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]] comparison, he was apparently aware of the practice, which is considered important to today's systematic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richter|first=Stefan|last2=Meier|first2=Rudolf|date=1994-01-01|title=The Development of Phylogenetic Concepts in Hennig's Early Theoretical Publications (1947-1966)|jstor=2413462|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=43|issue=2|pages=212–221|doi=10.2307/2413462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interesting Invertebrates==
* The [[Japanese spider crab]] (Arthropoda: ''Macrocheira kaempferi'') is one of the world's most impressive [[arthropod]]s. The Japanese spider crab is largest known species of [[crab]] and may live up to 100 years.  With a leg span of that can reach four feet, it has the longest span of any arthropod. They are typically found in the Pacific waters near Japan on the bottom of the continental shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eol.org/pages/2924326/details|title=Japanese Spider Crab - Macrocheira kaempferi - Details - Encyclopedia of Life|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia of Life|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[lion's mane jellyfish]] (Cnidaria: ''Cyanea capillata'') is the largest known type of [[jellyfish]]. Their [[tentacle]]s can reach up to 190 feet long, and they may have a bell diameter of almost 7 feet. These animals are usually found in cold northern [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] waters and in the Northern portions of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eol.org/pages/1005690/details|title=Lion's Mane Jellyfish - Cyanea capillata - Details - Encyclopedia of Life|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia of Life|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[giant squid]] (Mollusca: ''Architeuthis dux'') comes from the family Architeuthidae. These [[squid]] are both the largest known [[cephalopod]] and the largest known [[Mollusca|mollusc]]. They can grow to a length of about 45–50 feet long. They developed large eyes, the largest of any animal, to be able to detect small amounts of [[bioluminescence]] in the dark and deep ocean where they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eol.org/pages/488790/details|title=Oceanic Squid - Architeuthis dux - Details - Encyclopedia of Life|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia of Life|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Invisible Women: Forgotten Artists of Florence''''' is a 2009 book in English and Italian by [[Jane Fortune]] through the [[Advancing Women Artists Foundation]] (AWA) and published by The Florentine Press. It describes the history of female artists in Florence and their hundreds of works in the city's museums or storehouses. Contributing authors include Linda Falcone, Serena Padovani, Rosella Lari and Sheila Barker. It has twenty-six chapters on thirty-five women artists active in Florence.&lt;ref name="Fortune 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortune|first=Jane|title=Invisible Women: Forgotten Artists of Florence|year=2010|publisher=The Florentine Press|location=[Florence, Italy]|isbn=9788890243455|edition=2.|language=English, Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was the basis of a five-part [[Emmy award]] winning television documentary, produced by [[WFYI (TV)|WFYI]] Productions, which first aired on [[PBS]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="TF Emmy article"&gt;{{cite web|title=Invisible Women wins the Emmy|url=http://www.theflorentinepress.com/invisible-women-wins-emmy-award/|publisher=The Florentine Press|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

''Invisible Women'' discusses female artistic influence in Florence starting with the first known Florentine nun-artist [[Suor Plautilla Nelli]]. It describes the city as a center for women court artists in the [[Baroque]] period as exemplified by the teacher-student succession of [[Giovanna Fratellini]], Violante Siries Cerroti, and Anna Bacherini Piattoli. Other chapters highlight painters granted the honor of displaying their self-portrait in the [[Vasari Corridor]] such as the Venetian [[Giulia Lama]], the first woman known to draw and study the male nude from a live model, and [[Marietta Robusti]], the daughter of [[Tintoretto]] who was often called "La Tintoretta." The book covers still-life painters such as [[Maria van Oosterwyck|Maria Van Oosterwyck]] and [[Margherita Caffi]] best known for her elaborate bouquets with freely hanging wild flowers. Fortune focuses on six specific buildings in Florence including the Marucelliana Library, the Last Supper Museum of Andrea del Sarto, and the Gallery of Modern Art in the Pitti Palace. Other chapters include work on [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] whose admirers included [[Michelangelo]] and [[Anthony van Dyck]]; [[Lavinia Fontana]], the first female painter in Western Europe to reach the same level of professional acclaim as her male contemporaries; [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] who created large-scale images of heroines; and seventeenth-century pastelist [[Rosalba Carriera]] known for her [[Rococo]] style and flattering portraits of the wealthy.&lt;ref name="Fortune 2010"/&gt;
''Invisible Women: Forgotten Artists of Florence'' focuses on oil paintings, pastels, watercolors, and drawings. The chapters are followed by ''The Woman Artists' Trail'', a map and an inventory of works by women artists in Florence, which was later adapted into the separate, pocket-size guidebook, ''[[Art by Women in Florence|Art by Women in Florence: A Guide through Five Hundred Years]].''

== Documentary ==

Producer Todd Gould and executive producer Clayton Taylor worked with Fortune and the AWA to produce a five-part television documentary. It describes a six-year project to research, restore, and exhibit works of art by women in Florence's museums and storage covering the restoration of works by three artists: Plautilla Nelli, Artemisia Gentileschi, and Irene Parenti Duclos who is the only woman featured in Florence's Accademia Gallery today. The documentary illustrates main themes featured in the book along with additional interviews with the Advancing Women Artists Foundation team, restoration experts, and executives from several museums in the United States and from the Polo Museale Florentino.&lt;ref name="TF Emmy article" /&gt;

WFYI Productions filmed the documentary which included footage provided by The Florentine Press, Artmedia, and Bunker Film. It first aired in the U.S. on [[PBS]] in [[Indianapolis]] on November 5, 2012.&lt;ref name="TF Emmy article" /&gt;

On June 1, 2013, the documentary won an [[News &amp; Documentary Emmy Award|Emmy Award as Best Documentary]] in the Cultural/Historical Program category.&lt;ref name="TF Emmy article" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2133">Lattice models in biophysics represent a class of statistical-mechanical models which consider a biological macromacromolecule (such as DNA, protein, actin, etc.) as a lattice of units, each unit being in different states or conformations.

For example, [[DNA]] in chromatin can be represented as a one-dimensional lattice, whose elementary units are the [[nucleotide]], [[base pair]] or [[nucleosome]]. Different states of the unit can be realized either by chemical modifications (e.g. [[DNA methylation]] or modifications of DNA-bound [[histones]]), or due to quantized internal degrees of freedom (e.g. different angles of the bond joining two neighboring units), or due to binding events involving a given unit (e.g. reversible binding of small [[ligands]] or [[proteins]] to [[DNA]], or binding/unbinding of two [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] nucleotides in the DNA base pair).&lt;ref name="Teif2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Teif VB, Rippe K.|title=Statistical-mechanical lattice models for protein-DNA binding in chromatin. |journal=J.

'''Lichenin''', also known as '''lichenan''' or '''moss starch''', is a complex [[glucan]] occurring in certain species of [[lichen]]s. It can be extracted from ''Cetraria islandica'' ([[Iceland moss]]).&lt;ref name="PerlinSuzuki"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perlin |first1=A. S. |last2=Suzuki |first2=S. |year=1962 |title=The Structure of Lichenin: Selective Enzymolysis Studies |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Chemistry]] |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=50–56 |publisher=[[National Research Council of Canada]] |location=Canada |doi=10.1139/v62-009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been studied since about 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cunningham |first1=WL |last2=Manners |first2=DJ |date=March 1964 |title=Studies on carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes. 11.

It is an important carbohydrate for [[reindeer]]s and [[northern flying squirrel]]s, which eat the lichen [[wila (lichen)|wila]].

It can be extracted by digesting Iceland moss in a cold, weak solution of [[sodium bicarbonate|carbonate of soda]] for some time, and then boiling. By this process the lichenin is dissolved and on cooling separates as a colorless jelly. [[Iodine]] imparts no color to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{NIE|wstitle=Lichenin|year=1905|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of the name==
In his 1960 novel ''[[Trouble with Lichen]]'', [[John Wyndham]] gives the name ''Lichenin'' to a biochemical extract of lichen used to extend life expectancy beyond 300 years.

In [[mechanical engineering]], '''limits and fits''' are a set of rules regarding the dimensions and tolerances of mating machined parts if they are to achieve the desired ease of assembly, and security after assembly - [[Fit (manufacturing)|sliding fit]], interference fit, rotating fit, non-sliding fit, loose fit, etc.

Tolerances are typically specified in thousandths of an inch or hundredths of a millimetre.

'''Neuroimmunology''' is a field combining [[neuroscience]], the study of the [[nervous system]], and [[immunology]], the study of the [[immune system]].  Neuroimmunologists seek to better understand the interactions of these two complex systems during development, [[homeostasis]], and response to injuries.  A long-term goal of this rapidly developing research area is to further develop our understanding of the pathology of certain neurological [[diseases]], some of which have no clear [[etiology]]. In doing so, neuroimmunology contributes to development of new pharmacological treatments for several neurological conditions.  Many types of interactions involve both the nervous and immune systems including the [[physiological]] functioning of the two systems in [[health]] and disease, malfunction of either and or both systems that leads to disorders, and the physical, chemical, and environmental stressors that affect the two systems on a daily basis.

==Background==

Neural targets that control [[thermogenesis]], [[behavior]], [[sleep]], and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] can be affected by pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s which are released by activated [[macrophages]] and [[monocytes]] during infection. Within the [[central nervous system]] production of cytokines has been detected as a result of brain injury, during [[virus|viral]] and [[bacterial]] infections, and in [[neurodegenerative]] processes.

From the US National Institute of Health:&lt;ref&gt;[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/pa-05-054.html Functional Links between the Immune System, Brain Function and Behavior]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Despite the [[brain]]'s status as an immune privileged site, an extensive bi-directional communication takes place between the nervous and the [[immune system]] in both health and disease. Immune cells and neuroimmune molecules such as cytokines, [[chemokines]], and growth factors modulate brain function through multiple signaling pathways throughout the lifespan. Immunological, physiological and psychological stressors engage cytokines and other immune molecules as mediators of interactions with [[neuroendocrine]], neuropeptide, and [[neurotransmitter]] systems. For example, brain cytokine levels increase following stress exposure, while treatments designed to alleviate [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] reverse this effect.

"Neuroinflammation and neuroimmune activation have been shown to play a role in the etiology of a variety of neurological disorders such as stroke, Parkinson's and [[Alzheimer's]] disease, [[multiple sclerosis]], [[pain]], and AIDS-associated [[dementia]]. However, [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s also modulate CNS function in the absence of overt immunological, physiological, or psychological challenges. For example, cytokines and cytokine receptor inhibitors affect cognitive and emotional processes. Recent evidence suggests that immune molecules modulate brain systems differently across the lifespan. Cytokines and chemokines regulate [[neurotrophins]] and other molecules critical to neurodevelopmental processes, and exposure to certain neuroimmune challenges early in life affects brain development. In adults, cytokines and chemokines affect [[synapse|synaptic]] plasticity and other ongoing neural processes, which may change in aging brains. Finally, interactions of immune molecules with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal system indicate that sex differences are a significant factor determining the impact of neuroimmune influences on brain function and behavior."

Recent research demonstrates that reduction of lymphocyte populations can impair cognition in mice, and that restoration of lymphocytes restores cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kipnis J, Derecki NC, Yang C, Scrable H |title=Immunity and cognition: what do age-related dementia, HIV-dementia and 'chemo-brain' have in common? |journal=Trends Immunol. |volume=29 |issue=10 |pages=455–63 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18789764 |doi=10.1016/j.it.2008.07.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epigenetics==

===Overview===
[[Epigenetic]] medicine encompasses a new branch of neuroimmunology that studies the brain and behavior. This new branch has already provided unique insights into the mechanisms underlying [[brain development]], [[evolution]], [[neuronal]] and network plasticity and homeostasis, [[senescence]], the [[etiology]] of diverse [[neurological diseases]] and neural regenerative processes.  This new study is leading to the discovery of environmental stressors that dictate initiation of specific neurological disorders and specific disease [[biomarker]]s.  The goal of this is to "promote accelerated recovery of impaired and seemingly irrevocably lost cognitive, behavioral, sensorimotor functions through epigenetic reprogramming of [[endogenous]] regional neural [[stem cells]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Abdolmaleky H.M. |author2=Thiagalingam S. |author3=Wilcox M. | year = 2005 | title = Genetics and epigenetics in major psychiatric disorders: dilemmas, achievements, applications, and future scope | url = | journal = American Journal of Pharmacogenomics | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 149–160 | doi=10.2165/00129785-200505030-00002 | pmid=15952869}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Understanding epigenetic medicine is important to understanding possible future pharmacological treatments.  Many of the immediate gaps in [[knowledge]] are attributed to basic lack of understanding of [[gene expression]] and regulation and are thus the limiting factors for creating advanced treatments or cures to many diseases.  To better understand these processes, neuroimmunological experiments are being created and tested to once and for all amass a more complete [[anthology]] of knowledge pertaining to the complex interactions between the nervous and immune systems along with that of gene expression.  While some disorders may affect the nervous and immune systems independently of one another, it is impossible to truly understand neuroimmnulogical science without a complex understanding of how each system works independently and also how they work together.

===Neural stem cell fate===

Several studies have shown that regulation of stem cell maintenance and the subsequent fate determinations are quite complex.  The complexity of determining the fate of a stem cell can be best understood by knowing the "circuitry employed to orchestrate stem cell maintenance and progressive neural fate decisions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Diamandis P. |author2=Wildenhain J. |author3=Clarke I.D. |author4=Sacher A.G. |author5=Graham J. |author6=Bellows D.S. |author7=Ling E.K. |author8=Ward R.J. |author9=Jamieson L.G. | year = 2007 | title = Chemical genetics reveals a complex functional ground state of neural stem cells. Nat | url = | journal = Chem. Biol. | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 268–273 | doi=10.1038/nchembio873|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neural fate decisions include the utilization of multiple neurotransmitter signal pathways along with the use of epigenetic regulators.  The advancement of neuronal stem cell differentiation and glial fate decisions must be orchestrated timely to determine subtype specification and subsequent maturation processes including myelination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shen S. |author2=Casaccia-Bonnefil P. | year = 2007 | title = Post-translational modifications of nucleosomal histones in oligodendrocyte lineage cells in development and disease | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Neuroscience | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 13–22 | doi=10.1007/s12031-007-9014-x| pmc=2323904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurodevelopmental disorders===

Neurodevelopmental disorders result from impairments of growth and development of the brain and nervous system and lead to many disorders.  Examples of these disorders include [[Asperger syndrome]], [[traumatic brain injury]], [[communication]], speech and language disorders, genetic disorders such as [[fragile-X syndrome]], [[Down syndrome]], [[epilepsy]], and [[fetal alcohol syndrome]]. Studies have shown that [[autism spectrum disorders]] (ASDs) may present due to basic disorders of epigenetic regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Herbert M.R.|author1link=Martha Herbert|author2=Russo J.P.|author3=Yang S.|author4=Roohi J.|author5=Blaxill M.|author6=Kahler S.G.|author7=Cremer L.|author8=Hatchwell E. | year = 2006 | title = Autism and environmental genomics | url = | journal = Neurotoxicology | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 671–684 | doi=10.1016/j.neuro.2006.03.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other neuroimmunological research has shown that deregulation of correlated epigenetic processes in ASDs can alter gene expression and brain function without causing classical genetic lesions which are more easily attributable to a cause and effect relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Badcock C. |author2=Crespi B. | year = 2006 | title = Imbalanced genomic imprinting in brain development: an evolutionary basis for the aetiology of autism | url = | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 1007–1032 | doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01091.x | pmid=16780503}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings are some of the numerous recent discoveries in previously unknown areas of gene misexpression.

===Neurodegenerative disorders===

Increasing evidence suggests that neurodegenerative diseases are mediated by erroneous epigenetic mechanisms.  Neurodegenerative diseases include [[Huntington's disease]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Neuroimmunological research into these diseases has yielded evidence including the absence of simple Mendelian inheritance patterns, global transcriptional dysregulation, multiple types of pathogenic [[RNA alterations]], and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greene L.A. |author2=Liu D.X. |author3=Troy C.M. |author4=Biswas S.C. | year = 2007 | title = Cell cycle molecules define a pathway required for neuron death in development and disease | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1772 | issue = | pages = 392–401 | doi=10.1016/j.bbadis.2006.12.003 | pmid=17229557 | pmc=1885990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one of the experiments, a treatment of Huntington’s disease with histone deacetylases (HDAC), an enzyme that removes acetyl groups from lysine, and DNA/RNA binding anthracylines that affect nucleosome positioning, showed positive effects on behavioral measures, neuroprotection, nuclesome remodeling, and associated chromatin dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Abel T. |author2=Zukin R.S. | year = 2008 | title = Epigenetic targets of HDAC inhibition in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 57–64 | doi=10.1016/j.coph.2007.12.002| pmc=2405764}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another new finding on neurodegenerative diseases involves the overexpression of HDAC6 suppresses the neurodegenerative phenotype associated with Alzheimer’s disease pathology in associated animal models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pandey U.B. |author2=Nie Z. |author3=Batlevi Y. |author4=McCray B.A. |author5=Ritson G.P. |author6=Nedelsky N.B. |author7=Schwartz S.L. |author8=DiProspero N.A. |author9=Knight M.A. | year = 2007 | title = HDAC6 rescues neurodegeneration and provides an essential link between autophagy and the UPS | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7146| pages = 859–863 | doi=10.1038/nature05853 | pmid=17568747|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other findings show that additional mechanisms are responsible for the "underlying transcriptional and post-transcriptional dysregulation and complex chromatin abnormalities in Huntington's disease".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ballas N. |author2=Mandel G. | year = 2005 | title = The many faces of REST oversee epigenetic programming of neuronal genes | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 500–506 | doi=10.1016/j.conb.2005.08.015 | pmid=16150588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroimmunological disorders===

The nervous and immune systems have many interactions that dictate overall body health.  The nervous system is under constant monitoring from both the [[adaptive]] and [[innate immune system]].  Throughout development and adult life, the immune system detects and responds to changes in [[cell identity]] and neural connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, S.L., Carpentier, P.A., McMahon, E.J., Begolka, W.S., Miller, S.D., 2006. Innate and adaptive immune responses of the central nervous system. [[Critical Reviews in Immunology]]. 26, 149–188.&lt;/ref&gt;  Deregulation of both adaptive and acquired immune responses, impairment of crosstalk between these two systems, as well as alterations in the deployment of innate immune mechanisms can predispose the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) to autoimmunity and neurodegeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hauser S.L. |author2=Oksenberg J.R. | year = 2006 | title = The neurobiology of multiple sclerosis: genes, inflammation, and neurodegeneration | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 61–76 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other evidence has shown that development and deployment of the innate and acquired immune systems in response to stressors on functional integrity of cellular and systemic level and the evolution of autoimmunity are mediated by [[epigenetic mechanisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sawalha A.H. | year = 2008 | title = Epigenetics and T-cell immunity | url = | journal = Autoimmunity | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 245–252 | doi=10.1080/08916930802024145}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Autoimmunity has been increasingly linked to targeted deregulation of epigenetic mechanisms, and therefore, use of epigenetic therapeutic agents may help reverse complex pathogenic processes.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, S.G., Dangond, F., 2006. Rationale for the use of histone [[deacetylase]] inhibitors as a dual therapeutic modality in multiple sclerosis. Epigenetics 1, 67–75.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Multiple sclerosis]] (MS) is one type of neuroimmunological disorder that affects many people.  MS features CNS inflammation, immune-mediated demyelination and neurodegeneration, and may represent an emerging class of epigenetic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brooks W.H. | year = 2005 | title = Autoimmune disorders result from loss of epigenetic control following chromosome damage | url = | journal = [[Medical Hypotheses]] | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 590–598 | doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2004.08.005 | pmid=15617874}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (also known as [[Chronic fatigue syndrome]]), is a multi-system disease that causes dysfunction of neurological, immune, endocrine and energy-metabolism systems. Though many patients show neuroimmunological degeneration, the correct roots of ME/CFS are unknown. Symptoms of ME/CFS include significantly lowered ability to participate in regular activities, stand or sit straight, inability to talk, sleep problems, excessive sensitivity to light, sound or touch and/or thinking and memory problems (defective cognitive functioning). Other common symptoms are muscle or joint pain, [[sore throat]] or [[night sweats]]. There is no treatment but symptoms may be treated. Patients that are sensitive to [[mold]] may show improvement in symptoms having moved to drier areas. Some patients in general have less severe ME, whereas others may be bedridden for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WHAT IS ME? |url=https://www.meaction.net/about/what-is-me/ |website=MEAction |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major themes of research==

The interaction of the CNS and immune system are fairly well known.  Burn-induced organ dysfunction using vagus nerve stimulation has been found to attenuate organ and serum cytokine levels.  Burns generally induce abacterial cytokine generation and perhaps parasympathetic stimulation after burns would decrease cardiodepressive mediator generation.  Multiple groups have produced experimental evidence that support proinflammatory cytokine production being the central element of the burn-induced stress response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Oke S.L. |author2=Tracey K.J. | year = 2008 | title = From CNI-1493 to the immunological homunculus: physiology of the inflammatory reflex | url = | journal = Journal of Leukocyte Biology | volume = 83 | issue = 3| pages = 512–517 | doi=10.1189/jlb.0607363 | pmid=18065685}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Still other groups have shown that vagus nerve signaling has a prominent impact on various inflammatory pathologies.  These studies have laid the groundwork for inquiries that vagus nerve stimulation may influence postburn immunological responses and thus can ultimately be used to limit organ damage and failure from burn induced stress.

Basic understanding of neuroimmunological diseases has changed significantly during the last ten years. New data broadening the understanding of new treatment concepts has been obtained for a large number of neuroimmunological diseases, none more so than multiple sclerosis, since many efforts have been undertaken recently to clarify the complexity of pathomechanisms of this disease.  Accumulating evidence from animal studies suggests that some aspects of depression and fatigue in MS may be linked to inflammatory markers.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Stefan M, Irwin, Michael R, 2009. Depression and Immunity: Inflammation and Depressive Symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis. 29, 309.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have demonstrated that Toll like-receptor (TLR4) is critically involved in neuroinflammation and T cell recruitment in the brain, contributing to exacerbation of brain injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter sphaeroides Attenuates Microglia-Mediated Inflammation and Phagocytosis and Directs Regulatory T Cell Response|journal = International Journal of Inflammation|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 2090-8040|pmc = 4589630|pmid = 26457222|pages = 361326|volume = 2015|doi = 10.1155/2015/361326|first = Sagar|last = Gaikwad|first2 = Reena|last2 = Agrawal-Rajput}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Molecular insights revealed that TLR4 mediated activation of JNK and p38 MAPK critically involved in microglia mediated neuronal loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://pelagiaresearchlibrary.com/european-journal-of-experimental-biology/vol5-iss8/EJEB-2015-5-8-34-42.pdf|title = The critical role of JNK and p38 MAPKs for TLR4 induced microgliamediated neurotoxicity|last = Gaikwad|first = Sagar|date = 2015-11-25|journal = European Journal of Experimental Biology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into the link between smell, depressive behavior, and autoimmunity has turned up interesting findings including the facts that inflammation is common in all of the diseases analyzed, depressive symptoms appear early in the course of most diseases, smell impairment is also apparent early in the development of neurological conditions, and all of the diseases involved the amygdale and hippocampus.  Better understanding of how the immune system functions and what factors contribute to responses are being heavily investigated along with the aforementioned coincidences.

Neuroimmunology is also an important topic to consider during the design of neural implants.  Neural implants are being used to treat many diseases, and it is key that their design and [[Surface Chemistry of Neural Implants|surface chemistry]] do not elicit an immune response.

==Future directions==

The nervous system and immune system require the appropriate degrees of cellular differentiation, organizational integrity, and neural network connectivity.  These operational features of the brain and nervous system may make signaling difficult to duplicate in severely diseased scenarios.  There are currently three classes of therapies that have been utilized in both animal models of disease and in human clinical trials.  These three classes include DNA methylation inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, and RNA-based approaches.  DNA methylation inhibitors are used to activate previously silenced genes.  HDACs are a class of enzymes that have a broad set of biochemical modifications and can affect DNA demethylation and synergy with other therapeutic agents.  The final therapy includes using RNA-based approaches to enhance stability, specificity, and efficacy, especially in diseases that are caused by RNA alterations.  Emerging concepts concerning the complexity and versatility of the epigenome may suggest ways to target genomewide cellular processes.  Other studies suggest that eventual seminal regulator targets may be identified allowing with alterations to the massive epigenetic reprogramming during gametogenesis.  Many future treatments may extend beyond being purely therapeutic and may be preventable perhaps in the form of a vaccine. Newer high throughput technologies when combined with advances in imaging modalities such as in vivo optical nanotechnologies may give rise to even greater knowledge of genomic architecture, nuclear organization, and the interplay between the immune and nervous systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rauch J. |author2=Knoch T.A. |author3=Solovei I. |author4=Teller K. |author5=Stein S. |author6=Buiting K. |author7=Horsthemke B. |author8=Langowski J. |author9=Cremer T. | year = 2008 | title = Light optical precision measurements of the active and inactive [[Prader–Willi syndrome]] imprinted regions in human cell nuclei | doi =10.1111/j.1432-0436.2007.00237.x  | journal = Differentiation | volume = 76 | issue = | pages = 66–82 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17709">'''Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA)''' is an approval granted by the [[United States]] [[Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)]] to a manufacturer of aircraft parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/01jan20061500/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/janqtr/14cfr21.303.htm 14 C.F.R. 21.303 PMA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approval==
It is generally illegal in the United States to install replacement or modification parts on a certificated aircraft without an airworthiness release such as a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) or Parts Manufacturing Approval (PMA).  There are a number of other methods of compliance, including parts manufactured to government or industry standards, parts manufactured under technical standard order authorization [TSO], owner-/operator-produced parts, experimental aircraft, field approvals, etc.&lt;ref name="14_C.F.R._21.9(a)"&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.9&amp;idno=14#14:1.0.1.3.9.1.11.9  14 C.F.R. 21.9(a)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC%2020-62E.pdf|publisher=FAA|title=Advisory Circular 20-62E: Eligibility, Quality, and Identification of Aeronautical Replacement Parts|accessdate=2015-04-02|date=2010-12-23|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMA-holding manufacturers are permitted to make replacement parts for aircraft, even though they are not the original manufacturer of the aircraft.&lt;ref name ="14_C.F.R._21.9(a)(2)"&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.9&amp;idno=14#14:1.0.1.3.9.1.11.9  14 C.F.R. 21.9(a)(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The process is analogous to 'after-market' parts for automobiles, except that the United States aircraft parts production market remains tightly regulated by the FAA.

An applicant for a PMA applies for approval from the FAA. The FAA prioritizes its review of a new application based on its internal process called Project Prioritization.&lt;ref&gt;See Aircraft Technology, Calnek, Matthew, December 2014, A Change of Priorities, http://www.aecotechnologies.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AECO_AircraftTechnology_Dec2014.pdf, Seattle, January 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FAA Order covering the application for PMA is Order 8110.42 revision D.  This document is worded as instructions to the FAA reviewing personnel.  An accompanying Advisory Circular (AC) 21.303-4 is intended to address the applicant.  8110.42C addressed both the applicant and the reviewer.  Per the order, application for a PMA can be made per the following ways:  '''Identicality''' in which the applicant attempts to convince the FAA that the PMA part is identical to the OAH (Original Approval Holder) part.  '''Identicality by Licensure i'''s accomplished by providing evidence to the FAA that the applicant has licensed the part data from the OAH.  This evidence is usually in the form of an Assist Letter provided to the applicant by the OAH.  PMA may also be granted based upon prior approval of an STC .  As an example:  If an STC were granted to alter an existing aircraft design then that approval would also apply to the parts needed to make that modification.  A PMA would be required, however, to manufacture the parts.  The last method to obtain a PMA is '''Test &amp; Computation.'''  This approach consist of one or a combination of both of the following methods:  '''General Analysis''' and '''Comparative Analysis'''.  General analysis compares the proposed part to the functional requirements of that part when installed.  Comparative Analysis compares the function of the proposed part to the OAH part.  As an example:  If a PMA application for flight control cables were to show that the PMA part exceeds the pull strength requirements of the aircraft system it is meant for, that is general analysis.  To show that it exceeds that of the OAH part is comparative analysis.  The modern trend is to use a variety of techniques in combination in order to obtain approval of complicated parts - relying on the techniques that are most accurate and best able to provide the proof of airworthiness desired.&lt;ref name="FAA_Order_8110.42C"&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.9&amp;idno=14#14:1.0.1.3.9.1.11.9  Parts Manufacturer Approval Procedures, FAA Order 8110.42C, Chapter 2, Paragraph 5 (June 23, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The cognizant regional FAA Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) determines if the applicant has shown compliance with all relevant airworthiness regulations and is thus entitled to design approval.

The second step in the application process is to apply to the FAA Manufacturing Inspection Divisional Office (MIDO) to obtain approval of the manufacturing quality assurance system (known as production approval).  Production approval will be granted when the FAA is satisfied that the system will not permit parts to leave the system until the parts have been verified to meet the requirements of the approved design, and the system otherwise meets the requirements of the FAA quality system regulations.&lt;ref name ="14_C.F.R._21.137"&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.9&amp;idno=14#14:1.0.1.3.9.7.11.5  14 C.F.R. 21.137]&lt;/ref&gt;  A Production Approval Holder (PAH) will typically already have satisfied this requirement before PMA application is made.

PMA applications based upon licensure or STC do not require ACO approval (since the data has already been approved) and can go straight to the MIDO.

== History ==
Under the Civil Air Regulations (CARs), the government had the authority to approve aircraft parts in a predecessor to the PMA rules.  This authority was found in each of the sets of airworthiness standards published in the Civil Air Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;See, Certification Procedures for Products and Parts, 29 Fed. Reg. 14562 (Oct. 24, 1964) (explaining in the preamble that the authority for producing parts had previously been in the ".18" sections of CARs 3, 4b, 5, 6, 7, 13, and 14).&lt;/ref&gt;  CAR 3.31, for example, permitted the Administrator to approve aircraft parts as early as 1947.&lt;ref&gt;See 12 Fed. Reg. 7898 (1947) (promulgating Amendment 03-3 to CAR 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the Civil Aeronautics Board adjusted the location of the parts production authority from the ".31" regulations to the ".18" regulations.&lt;ref&gt;17 Fed. Reg. 1083 (Feb 5, 1952) (Civil Air Regulation Amendment 3-7 was effective March 5, 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the CAR 3 authority for modification and replacement parts could be found in section 3.18 after 1952.

In 1955, the Civil Aeronautics Board separated the parts authority out of the airworthiness standards, and placed it in a more general location so that one standard would apply to replacement and modification parts for all different forms of aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Air Regulation (CAR) 1.55 (adopted on April 13, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 CAR 1.55 became Federal Aviation Regulation section 21.303.&lt;ref&gt;Certification Procedures for Products and Parts, 29 Fed. Reg. 14562 (Oct. 24, 1964) (this change became effective February 1, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1965 regulatory change also imposed specific obligations on the PMA holder related to the Fabrication Inspection System.&lt;ref&gt;14 C.F.R. § 21.303(c) (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

Amendment 21-38 of Part 21 was published May 26, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Replacement and Modification Parts, 37 Fed. Reg. 10658 (May 26, 1972) (this change became effective June 26, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the next rule change to affect PMAs.  This rule eliminated the incorporation by reference of type certification requirements in favor of PMA-specific data submission requirements.  This change established the separate process and separate requirements for data that must be submitted by an applicant for a PMA (prior to this there was no explicit distinction between the application data requirements for type certificated products and the data requirements for PMAed articles).&lt;ref&gt;14 C.F.R. § 21.303(c) (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft parts [[Aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] expanded greatly in the 1980s as airlines sought to reduce the costs of spares by finding alternative sources of parts. During this time period, though, many manufacturers failed to obtain PMA approvals from the FAA.

In the 1990s, the FAA engaged in an "Enhanced Enforcement" program that educated the industry about the importance of approval and as a consequence a huge number of parts were approved through formal FAA mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=1995_register&amp;docid=fr27fe95-2 60 Fed. Reg. 10480 (February 27, 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;   Under this program, companies that had previously manufactured aircraft parts without PMAs could apply for PMAs in order to bring their manufacturing operations into full compliance with the regulations.  This movement brought an explosion of PMA parts to the marketplace.

== 2009 Rule Change ==
The FAA published a significant revision to the U.S. manufacturing regulations on October 16, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/production_approvals/14cfr_amendments/media/FAA-2006-25877.pdf &lt;u&gt;Production and Airworthiness Approvals, Part Marking, and Miscellaneous Amendments&lt;/u&gt;, 74 Fed. Reg. 53368 (October 16, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;  This new rule eliminates some of the legal distinctions between forms of production approval issued by the FAA, which should have the effect of further demonstrating the FAA's support of the quality systems implemented by PMA manufacturers.  Specifically, instead of having a separate body of regulations for a PMA Fabrication Inspection System (FIS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/janqtr/pdf/14cfr21.303.pdf 14 C.F.R. 21.303(h)(2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; as was the case in prior regulations, the PMA regulations now include a cross reference to the 14 C.F.R. § 21.137,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2010/janqtr/pdf/14cfr21.137.pdf 14 C.F.R. 21.137]&lt;/ref&gt; which is the regulation defining the elements of a quality system for all production approval holders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/production_approvals/14cfr_amendments/media/FAA-2006-25877.pdf &lt;u&gt;See&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;Production and Airworthiness Approvals, Part Marking, and Miscellaneous Amendments&lt;/u&gt;, 74 Fed. Reg. 53368, 53377 (October 16, 2009) (describing the elimination of the FIS requirements and the new cross reference to section 21.137)]&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, all production approval holders were held to the same production quality standards before the rule change&lt;ref&gt;[http://rgl.faa.gov/regulatory_and_guidance_library/rgorders.nsf/0/d1d550bbc2c82dd386257472005724ef/$FILE/Order%208110.42C.pdf &lt;u&gt;Parts Manufacturer Approval Procedures&lt;/u&gt;, FAA Order 8110.42C (June 23, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; - this will now be more obvious in the FAA's regulations.  Accomplishing this harmonization of standards was an important goal of the [[Modification and Replacement Parts Association]] ([[MARPA]]).

The new rule became effective April 16, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/production_approvals/14cfr_amendments/media/FAA-2006-25877.pdf &lt;u&gt;See&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;Production and Airworthiness Approvals, Part Marking, and Miscellaneous Amendments&lt;/u&gt;, 74 Fed. Reg. 53368, 53380 (October 16, 2009) (describing the implementation schedule, and setting the implementation date at 18 months after publication in the Federal Register)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The  FAA's FAQ on Part 21 stated that PMA quality systems would be evaluated for compliance by the FAA during certificate management activity after the compliance date of the rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/production_approvals/14cfr_amendments/QandA/part21/21G/ &lt;u&gt;FAA Questions &amp; Answers: 14 CFR Part 21 Amendments, Subpart G – Production Certificates&lt;/u&gt;, Section 21.137, Question Four (updated April 27, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, all FAA production approvals - whether for complete aircraft or for piece parts - rely on a common set of quality assurance system elements.  E.g. 14 C.F.R. §§ 21.137 (quality system requirements for production certificates), 21.307 (requiring PMA holders to establish a quality system that meets the requirements of § 21.137), 21.607 (requiring TSOA holders to establish a quality system that meets the requirements of § 21.137).

== Relationship to repair ==
The FAA is also working on new policies concerning parts fabricated in the course of repair.  This practice has historically been confused with PMA manufacturing, although the two are actually quite different practices supported by different FAA regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.9&amp;idno=14#14:1.0.1.3.9.1.11.9 Compare 14 C.F.R. 21.9(a)(6)(authority for fabrication in the course of maintenance)] with 14 C.F.R. 21.301 et seq. (PMA regulations)&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, FAA Advisory Circular 43.18 provides guidance for the fabrication of parts to be consumed purely during a maintenance operation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/99860|title=AC 43-18 - Fabrication of Aircraft parts by Maintenance Personnel|publisher=FAA|accessdate=2015-04-02|date=March 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and additional guidance is expected to be released in the near future.  One of the key features of FAC 43.18 is that it recommends implementation of a quality assurance system quite similar to the fabrication inspection systems that PMA manufacturers are required to have.

== Industry association ==
The [[trade association]] representing the PMA industry is the Modification and Replacement Parts Association ([[MARPA]]).  [[MARPA]] works closely with the FAA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/news/conferences_events/2008_eu_us_conference/media/agenda.pdf Agenda for the 2008 FAA-EASA International Safety Conference, in which MARPA's President (Jason Dickstein) is speaking on collaborative efforts to improve supplier control] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920095444/http://www.faa.gov/news/conferences_events/2008_eu_us_conference/media/agenda.pdf |date=2008-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/ContentViewer?objectId=09000064801df696&amp;disposition=attachment&amp;contentType=pdf 70 Fed. Reg. 65713 (November 9, 2006)(FAA acknowledges the assistance of Jack Buster, MARPA Airworthiness Directive Committee)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520123435/http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/ContentViewer?objectId=09000064801df696&amp;disposition=attachment&amp;contentType=pdf |date=May 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other agencies to promote PMA safety.  [[MARPA]] maintains a website at [http://www.pmaparts.org http://www.pmaparts.org].

==Developments Outside the United States==
The United States has Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreements (BASA) with most of its major trading partners, and the standard language of these BASAs requires the trading partner to treat FAA-PMA as an importable aircraft part that is airworthy and eligible for installation on aircraft registered in the importing jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/international/bilateral_agreements/baa_basa_listing/ FAA Bilateral Agreement Listing]&lt;/ref&gt;  This process has been facilitated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) which has published a book on accepting PMA parts. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/workgroups/Documents/MCTF/PMA-DER-2nd-Edition.pdf ''Guidance Material and Best Practices for Alternate Parts (PMA) and Approved (non-OEM) Repairs (DER). 2nd Edition.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the PMA industry began in the United States, several countries have begun promoting production of approved aircraft parts within their own borders.  These jurisdictions include:
*Australia&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.casa.gov.au/airworthiness/standard-page/production-approvals See, e.g., Australian Government Production Approvals Page]&lt;/ref&gt;
*China&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caac.gov.cn/en/ZCFG/ZCXWJ/HKCX/201602/P020160226590367624634.pdf See, e.g., ''Standardization Procedure for Design Approval of Civil Aircraft and Parts'', AP-21-AA-2012-20 (Nov. 5, 2012) (published by the Civil Aviation Authority of China and describing PMA parts in China)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The European Union (which produces them as "EPA Parts")&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.easa.europa.eu/faq/20095 See, e.g. ''Why and how must Parts and Appliances be marked, when are the letters EPA required, and which exceptions are acceptable?'', EASA FAQ n.20095 (November 23, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other jurisdictions have established PMA regulations and are working with trading partners to achieve acceptance of their PMA industries, and thus should be expected to enter the PMA marketplace in the near future.  For example, Japan has PMA regulations and has secured a bilateral agreement with the United States that authorizes the export of these parts to the United States as airworthy aircraft parts.  &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/international/bilateral_agreements/baa_basa_listing/media/Japan_IPA_Amdt_2.pdf ''Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness Under the Agreement between The Government of the United States of America and The Government of Japan For Promotion of Aviation Safety'', Amendment 2, Chapter 1 (explaining that "This amendment will allow the FAA to accept JCAB Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) produced by JCAB Approved Production Organization (APO) ....")]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Photoelasticity''' describes changes in the [[optical properties]] of a material under mechanical deformation. It is a property of all [[dielectric|dielectric media]] and is often used to experimentally [[stress analysis|determine the stress distribution]] in a material, where it gives a picture of stress distributions around [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuities]] in materials. Photoelastic experiments (also informally referred to as ''photoelasticity'') are an important tool for determining critical stress points in a material, and are used for determining stress concentration in irregular geometries.

==History==
The photoelastic phenomenon was first discovered by the Scottish [[physicist]] [[David Brewster]]&lt;ref&gt;D. Brewster, Experiments on the depolarization of light as exhibited by various mineral, animal and vegetable bodies with a reference of the phenomena to the general principle of polarization, Phil. Tras. 1815, pp. 29–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Brewster, On the communication of the structure of doubly-refracting crystals to glass, murite of soda, flour spar, and other substances by mechanical compression and dilation, Phil. Tras. 1816, pp. 156–178.&lt;/ref&gt;.
Experimental frameworks were developed at the beginning of the twentieth century with the works of [[E. G. Coker]] and [[Louis Napoleon George Filon|L. N. G. Filon]] of [[University of London]]. Their book ''Treatise on Photoelasticity'', published in 1930 by [[Cambridge Press]], became a standard text on the subject. Between 1930 and 1940, many other books appeared on the subject, including books in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]. At the same time, much development occurred in the field – great improvements were achieved in technique, and the equipment was simplified. With refinements in the technology, photoelastic experiments were extended to determining three-dimensional states of stress. In parallel to developments in experimental technique, the first phenomenological description of photoelasticity was given in 1890 by [[Friedrich_Carl_Alwin_Pockels|Friedrich Pockels]]&lt;ref&gt;Pockels, F. Ueber die durch einseitigen Druck hervorgerufene Doppelbrechung regulärer Krystalle, speciell von Steinsalz und Sylvin, ''Annalen der Physik'', 275, 1890, 440.&lt;/ref&gt;, however this was proved inadequate almost a century later by Nelson &amp; [[Melvin_Lax|Lax]]&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, D.F., and Lax, M. New Symmetry for Acousto-Optic Scattering, ''Physical Review Letters'', 1970, 24:8, 379-380.&lt;/ref&gt; as the description by Pockels only considered the effect of mechanical strain on the optical properties of the material.

With the advent of the digital [[polariscope]] – made possible by light-emitting diodes – continuous monitoring of structures under load became possible. This led to the development of dynamic photoelasticity, which has contributed greatly to the study of complex phenomena such as [[fracture]] of materials.

==Applications==

Photoelasticity has been used for a variety of stress analyses and even for routine use in design, particularly before the advent of numerical methods, such as for instance finite elements or boundary elements.&lt;ref&gt;Frocht, M.M., ''Photoelasticity''.

Another important application of the photoelasticity experiments is to study the stress field around bi-material notches.&lt;ref&gt;Ayatollahi, M. R.,  Mirsayar, M. M.,  Dehghany, M., Experimental determination of stress field parameters in bi-material notches using photoelasticity, "Materials &amp; Design," 2011, 32, 4901–4908.&lt;/ref&gt; Bi-material notches exist in many engineering application like welded or adhesively bonded structures

==Formal definition==
For a linear [[dielectric|dielectric material]] the change in the inverse permittivity tensor &lt;math&gt;\Delta(\varepsilon^{-1})_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the deformation (the gradient of the displacement &lt;math&gt;\partial_l u_k&lt;/math&gt;)  is described by &lt;ref&gt;J. F. Nye, "Physical Properties of Crystals: Their Representation by Tensors and Matrices", Oxford University Press, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(\varepsilon^{-1})_{ij} = P_{ijkl} \partial_k u_l &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt; is the fourth-rank photoelasticity tensor, &lt;math&gt;u_l&lt;/math&gt; is the linear displacement from equilibrium, and &lt;math&gt;\partial_l&lt;/math&gt; denotes denotes differentiation with respect to the Cartesian coordinate &lt;math&gt;x_l&lt;/math&gt;. For isotropic materials, this definition simplifies to &lt;ref&gt;R. E. Newnham, "Properties of Materials: Anisotropy, Symmetry, Structure", Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(\varepsilon^{-1})_{ij} = p_{ijkl} s_{kl} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetric part of the photoelastic tensor (the photoelastic strain tensor), and &lt;math&gt;s_{kl}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Infinitesimal_strain_theory|linear strain]]. The antisymmetric part of &lt;math&gt;P_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[roto-optic tensor]]. From either definition, it is clear that deformations to the body may induce optical anisotropy, which can cause an otherwise optically isotropic material to exhibit [[birefringence]]. Although the symmetric photoelastic tensor is most commonly defined with respect to mechanical strain, it is also possible to express photoelasticity in terms of the [[Hooke's law|mechanical stress]].

==Experimental Principles==
[[Image:Plastic Protractor Polarized 05375.jpg|thumb|Tension lines in plastic protractor seen under cross-polarized light.]]
The experimental procedure relies on the property of [[birefringence]], as exhibited by certain transparent materials. Birefringence is a phenomenon in which a ray of light passing through a given material experiences two [[refractive index|refractive indices]]. The property of birefringence (or double refraction) is observed in many optical [[crystal]]s. Upon the application of stresses, photoelastic materials exhibit the property of birefringence, and the magnitude of the refractive indices at each point in the material is directly related to the state of stresses at that point. Information such as maximum shear stress and its orientation are available by analyzing the birefringence with an instrument called a [[polariscope]].

When a ray of [[Electromagnetic radiation|light]] passes through a photoelastic material, its electromagnetic wave components are resolved along the two [[Stress (mechanics)|principal stress directions]] and each component experiences a different refractive index due to the birefringence. The difference in the refractive indices leads to a relative [[phase (waves)|phase]] retardation between the two components. Assuming a thin specimen made of [[Hooke's law|isotropic]] materials, where two-dimensional photoelasticity is applicable, the magnitude of the relative retardation is given by the ''stress-optic law'':&lt;ref&gt;Dally, J.W. and Riley, W.F., ''Experimental Stress Analysis,'' 3rd edition, McGraw-Hill Inc., 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta = \frac{2\pi t } \lambda C ( \sigma_1 - \sigma_2) &lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;Delta; is the induced retardation, ''C'' is the stress-optic coefficient, ''t'' is the specimen thickness, ''λ'' is the vacuum wavelength, and &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the first and second principal stresses, respectively. The retardation changes the polarization of transmitted light. The polariscope combines the different polarization states of light waves before and after passing the specimen. Due to optical [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of the two waves, a fringe pattern is revealed. The number of fringe order ''N'' is denoted as

: &lt;math&gt; N = \frac \Delta {2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

which depends on relative retardation. By studying the fringe pattern one can determine the state of stress at various points in the material.

For materials that do not show photoelastic behavior,  it is still possible to study the stress distribution. The first step is to build a model, using photoelastic materials, which has geometry similar to the real structure under investigation. The loading is then applied in the same way to ensure that the stress distribution in the model is similar to the stress in the real structure.

==Isoclinics and isochromatics==

Isoclinics are the loci of the points in the specimen along which the principal stresses are in the same direction.

Isochromatics are the loci of the points along which  the difference in the first and second principal stress remains the same. Thus they are the lines which join the points with equal maximum shear stress magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh, K., ''Digital Photoelasticity,'' Springer, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two-dimensional photoelasticity==
[[File:Photoelasticimetry1.JPG|thumb|Photoelastic experiment showing the internal stress distribution inside a thin piece of plastic]]
Photoelasticity can describe both three-dimensional and two-dimensional states of stress. However, examining photoelasticity in three-dimensional systems is more involved than two-dimensional or plane-stress system. So the present section deals with photoelasticity in a plane stress system. This condition is achieved when the thickness of the prototype is much smaller as compared to dimensions in the plane. 
Thus one is only concerned with stresses acting parallel to the plane of the model, as other stress components are zero. The experimental setup varies from experiment to experiment. The two basic kinds of setup used are plane polariscope and circular polariscope.

The working principle of a two-dimensional experiment allows the measurement of retardation, which can be converted to the difference between the first and second principal stress and their orientation. To further get values of each stress component, a technique called stress-separation is required.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez M.S-B., Calderon, J. M. A., Diez, P. M. B. and Segura, I. I. C., Stress-separation techniques in photoelasticity: A review. ''The Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design'', 2010, 45:1 [doi:10.1243/03093247JSA583]&lt;/ref&gt; Several theoretical and experimental methods are utilized to provide additional information to solve individual stress components.

==Plane polariscope setup==
The setup consists of two linear [[polarizer]]s and a light source.  The light source can either emit monochromatic light or white light depending upon the experiment. First the light  is passed through the first polarizer which converts the light into plane polarized light. The apparatus is set up in such a way that this plane polarized light then passes through the stressed specimen. This light then follows, at each point of the specimen, the direction of principal stress at that point. The light is then made to pass through the analyzer and we finally get the fringe pattern.

The fringe pattern in a plane polariscope setup consists of both the isochromatics and the isoclinics. The isoclinics change with the orientation of the polariscope while there is no change in the isochromatics.
[[Image:Transmission Circular Polariscope.svg|right|thumb|400px|Transmission Circular Polariscope&lt;br /&gt;The same device functions as a plane polariscope when quarter wave plates are taken aside or rotated so their axes parallel to polarization axes]]

==Circular polariscope setup==
In a circular polariscope setup two quarter-[[wave plate]]s are added to the experimental setup of the plane polariscope. The first quarter-wave plate is placed in between the polarizer and the specimen and the second quarter-wave plate is placed between the specimen and the analyzer. The effect of adding the quarter-wave plate after the source-side polarizer is that we get [[circular polarization|circularly polarized light]] passing through the sample. The analyzer-side quarter-wave plate converts the circular polarization state back to linear before the light passes through the analyzer.

The basic advantage of a circular polariscope over a plane polariscope is that in a circular polariscope setup we only get the isochromatics and not the isoclinics. This eliminates the problem of differentiating between the isoclinics and the isochromatics.

'''Prehistoric religions''' are the [[religion|religious beliefs and practices]] of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] peoples. The term may cover [[Paleolithic religion]], [[Mesolithic]] religion, [[#Neolithic|Neolithic religion]] and [[Bronze Age religion (disambiguation) | Bronze Age religions]].

==Paleolithic==
{{Main|Paleolithic religion}}
 
Intentional [[burial]], particularly with [[grave goods]], may be one of the earliest detectable forms of religious practice (the onset of burial itself being a canonical indicator of [[behavioral modernity]]) since, as [[Philip Lieberman]] suggests, it may signify a "concern for the dead that transcends daily life".&lt;ref name="lieberman"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA162 | title= Uniquely Human|isbn=0-674-92183-6| year= 1991| authorlink= Philip Lieberman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Gabillou Sorcier.png|thumb|left|150px|Picture of a half-animal half-human being in a Paleolithic [[cave painting]] in [[Dordogne]], [[France]] which archeologists believe may provide evidence for early shamanic practices]]
A number of archeologists propose that Middle Paleolithic societies such as [[Neanderthal]] societies may also have practiced early forms of [[totemism]] or of [[animal worship]]. Emil Bächler in particular suggests (based on archeological evidence from Middle Paleolithic caves) that a widespread [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Neanderthal]] [[bear cult|bear-cult]] existed ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;434-435).  A claim that evidence was found for [[Middle Paleolithic]] animal worship [[circa|c]] 70,000 BCE (originating from the [[Tsodilo Hills]] in the African Kalahari desert) has been denied by the original investigators of the site.&lt;ref&gt;World's Oldest Ritual Discovered -- Worshipped The Python 70,000 Years Ago The Research Council of Norway (2006, November 30).

Retrieved March 2, 2008, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061130081347.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Robbins|first= Lawrence H.|author2= Alec C.

Narr |title= Prehistoric religion |accessdate= 2008-03-28 |work= Britannica online encyclopedia 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal worship during the Upper Paleolithic intertwined with hunting rites.&lt;ref name="Narr"/&gt; For instance, archeological evidence from [[Paleolithic art]]  and from bear remains reveals that the bear cult apparently had a type of sacrificial bear ceremonialism in which a bear was shot with [[arrow]]s, then finished off with a shot in the lungs and ritualistically buried near a clay bear-statue covered by a bear fur, with the skull and the body of the bear buried separately.&lt;ref name="Narr"/&gt;

==Neolithic==
There are no extant textual sources from the [[Neolithic]] era, the most recent available dating from the [[Bronze Age]], and therefore all statements about any [[belief system]]s Neolithic societies may have possessed are glimpsed from archaeology.

[[Jacques Cauvin]] suggested that the [[Neolithic Revolution]] was influenced by an important theme he termed the "[[Jacques Cauvin#The Revolution of the Symbols|Revolution of the Symbols]]", suggesting the birth of "religion" in the Neolithic. He argued that Neolithic humans were influenced by a change in thinking as much as changes in the environment and noted a series of stages in this process.&lt;ref name="Aurenche"&gt;Olivier Aurenche, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_2001_num_27_2_4728 Jacques Cauvin et la préhistoire du Levant], Paléorient, Volume 27, Number 27-2, pp. 5-11, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; His work suggested important concepts in the evolution of human thinking, by examining figurines and early art depicting first women as goddesses and bulls as gods, he suggested several important ideas about the evolution of perception and duality.&lt;ref name="CauvinWatkins2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacques Cauvin|author2=Trevor Watkins|title=The birth of the Gods and the origins of agriculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4epGQpNyucC|accessdate=1 April 2011|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65135-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structures known as [[circular enclosure (archaeology)|Circular Enclosures]] built in Central Europe during the 5th millennium BCE have been interpreted as serving a cultic function. In the case of the [[Goseck circle]], remains of [[human sacrifice]] were found. Many of these structures had openings aligned with sunset and/or sunrise at the [[solstice]]s, suggesting that they served as a means of maintaining a [[lunisolar calendar]]. The construction of [[Megalithic]] monuments in Europe also began in the 5th millennium, and continued throughout the Neolithic and in some areas well into the early Bronze Age.

[[Marija Gimbutas]], pioneer of [[feminist archaeology]], put forward a notion of a "woman-centered" society surrounding "goddess worship" in [[Neolithic Europe]]. The Neolithic "matristic" cultures would have been replaced by [[patriarchy]] only with the arrival of the [[Bronze Age]]. Gimbutas' views on this matter do not have widespread support today.&lt;ref&gt;Archaeologist Sarah M. Nelson criticizes Gimbutas suggesting that she used the same techniques used in the past to disparage women but in this case to glorify them, and quotes another archaeologist, Pamela Russell, as saying "The archaeological evidence is, in some cases, distorted enough to make a careful prehistorian shudder". See {{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Sarah M|title=Gender in archaeology: analyzing power and prestige|year=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|isbn=978-0-7591-0496-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46UlbBqCE9AC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=neolithic+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=B-tJTMb6G4__Ocaw2ZgD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pamela%20russell&amp;f=false|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bronze Age==
{{Main|Religions of the ancient Near East|Minoan religion|Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Ancient Egyptian religion}}

===Reconstructions===
The early [[Bronze Age]] [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] (itself [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]]), and the attested early [[Semitic gods]], are presumed continuations of certain traditions of the late Neolithic.

====Bronze Age Europe====
Hints to the religion of [[Bronze Age Europe]] include images of [[solar barge]]s, frequent appearance of the [[Sun cross]], deposits of bronze [[axe]]s, and later [[sickle]]s, so-called [[moon idol]]s, the conical [[golden hat]]s, the [[Nebra skydisk]], and burial in [[tumulus|tumuli]], but also [[cremation]] as practised by the [[Urnfield culture]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Iron Age==
{{Further|Axial Age}}
While the [[Iron Age]] religions of the [[Mediterranean]], [[Near East]], [[Iron Age India|India]] and [[Iron Age China|China]] are well attested in written sources, much of [[Iron Age Europe]], from the period of about 700 BCE down to the [[Migration Period|Great Migrations]], falls within the prehistoric period. There are scarce accounts of non-Mediterranean religious customs in the records of Hellenistic and Roman era [[Greek ethnography|ethnography]].
*[[Scythian mythology]] ([[Herodotus]])
*[[Celtic polytheism]] ([[Posidonius]])
*[[Paleo-Balkan mythology]]
*[[Germanic polytheism]] ([[Tacitus]])
*[[Slavic polytheism]] ([[Procopius]])
*[[Mythology of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples]]

In the case of Circumpolar religion ([[Shamanism in Siberia]], [[Finnic mythology]]), [[traditional African religions]], [[native American religions]] and [[Pacific religions]], the prehistoric era mostly ends only with the [[Early Modern period]] and European [[colonialism]]. These traditions were often only first recorded in the context of [[Christianization]].

For these reasons, the interpretations and understanding of the Iron Age cult in Europe has to rely primarily on archaeological material.

The [[plug flow reactor model|Plug Flow Tube Reactor]] (PFTR) is a model of an ideal reactor characterized by the input of a premixed reaction mixture of reactants and solvents on one side and a removal of the product on the other side. During the flow of the mixture the reactants react with each other. An ideal [[plug flow]] is assumed i.e. any flow velocities are constant and no back mixing of components happens.&lt;ref name="PFTR" /&gt;

Real [[plug flow]] reactors do not satisfy the idealized flow patterns, back mix flow or plug flow deviation form ideal behavior can be due to channeling of fluid through the vessel, recycling of fluid within the vessel or due to the presence of stagnant region or dead zone of fluid in the vessel.&lt;ref name="Levenspiel, 260-265" /&gt; Real plug flow reactors with non ideal behavior have also been modelled.&lt;ref name="Adeniyi et al, 2003" /&gt;

The [[Residence time distribution|residence-time distribution (RTD)]] of a reactor is a characteristic of the mixing that occurs in the chemical reactor. There is no axial mixing in a [[Plug flow reactor|plug-flow reactor]], and this omission is reflected in the RTD which is exhibited by this class of reactors.&lt;ref name="Fogler, 812" /&gt;

To predict the exact behavior of a vessel as a [[chemical reactor]], RTD or stimulus response technique is used.
The [[tracer technique]], the most widely used method for the study of axial dispersion, is usually used in the form of:&lt;ref name="Coulson &amp; Richardson, 87-92" /&gt;
* Pulse input
* Step input
* Cyclic input
* Random input

The RTD is determined experimentally by injecting an inert chemical, molecule, or atom, called a tracer, into the reactor at some time t = 0 and then measuring the tracer concentration, C, in the effluent stream as a function of time.&lt;ref name="Fogler, 812" /&gt;

The [[Residence time distribution|residence time distribution (RTD)]] curve of fluid leaving a vessel is called the E-Curve. This curve is normalized in such a way that the area under it is unity:
: (1) 
: &lt;math&gt;\int E \partial t = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The mean age of the exit stream or [[Residence time distribution|mean residence time]] is:
: (2)
: &lt;math&gt;\tau = \int t E \partial t = \sum t E \nabla t&lt;/math&gt;

When a tracer is injected into a reactor at a location more than two or three particle diameters downstream from the entrance and measured some distance upstream from the exit, the system is analogous to an open-open system. For such a system where there is no discontinuity in type of flow at the point of tracer injection or at the point of tracer measurement, the variance for open system is:
: (3)
: &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_\theta)^2 = (\sigma_t )^2 /\tau^2 = 2/P_e + 8/(P_e)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Where,
: (4)
: &lt;math&gt;P_e = L U/ D_L &lt;/math&gt;

which represents the ratio of rate of transport by convection to rate of transport by [[diffusion]] or dispersion.
: &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = characteristic length (m)
: &lt;math&gt;D_L&lt;/math&gt; = effective dispersion coefficient ( m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s)
: &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; = superficial velocity (m/s) based on empty cross-section

Vessel dispersion number is defined as:
: &lt;math&gt; 1/P_e = D_L/L U &lt;/math&gt;

The [[variance]] of a continuous distribution measured at a finite number of equidistant locations is given by:
: (5)
: &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_t )^2 = \sum t_i ^2 C_i / \sum C_i - \sum [t_i C_i / \sum C_i ]^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Where mean residence time τ is given by:
: (6)
: &lt;math&gt;\tau = \sum t_i C_i / \sum C_i &lt;/math&gt;
: (7)
: &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_\theta)^2 = (\sigma_t)^2/\tau^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus (σ&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be evaluated from the experimental data on C vs. t and for known values of &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_\theta)^2&lt;/math&gt;, the dispersion number &lt;math&gt;(1/P_e)&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained from eq. (3) as:
: (8)
: &lt;math&gt; D_L/L U =  -1 + \sqrt{1 + 8 ( \sigma_\theta )^2 \over 8} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus axial dispersion coefficient D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; can be estimated (L = packed height)&lt;ref name="Levenspiel, 260-265" /&gt;

There are also other boundary conditions that can be applied to the dispersion model giving different relationships for the dispersion number.&lt;ref&gt;Electrochimica Acta 56 (2011) 7312-7318. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2011.06.047&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Electrochimica Acta 176 (2015) 463-471. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2015.07.019&lt;/ref&gt;

; Advantages:
From the safety technical point of view the PFTR has the advantages that &lt;ref name="PFTR" /&gt;
# It operates in a [[steady state]]
# It is well controllable 
# Large [[heat transfer]] areas can be installed

; Concerns:
The main problems lies in difficult and sometimes critical start-up and shut down operations.&lt;ref name="PFTR" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2264">'''Refresher training''' is a form of updating military knowledge of the [[reservist]] troops. After one has completed the [[conscription]] service, he or she can be called for refresher training for some number of days.

==Refresher training in the Finnish Defence Forces==

In the [[Finnish Defence Forces]] (FDF) [[Officer (armed forces)|Officers]] and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] can be ordered to refresher training for 100 days in addition to their original military service and the [[Military rank|rank]] and file (privates and other lower ranks) for 75 or 40 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/reservilainen/index_en.dsp The Finnish Defence Forces: Reservist pages]&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of refresher training that a reservist is called to depends on the importance of the reservists assignment, [[Military deployment|deployment]], the amount of [[Special forces|special training]] (i.e. training that requires constant upkeep of skills) and willingness. The aim is to train the most important wartime units at intervals of about 5 years. The average duration of the exercises is approximately 5 days and nights. Many never get called to refresher training, some get called frequently and some even apply for voluntary additional training. The obligation for refresher training ends at the age of 60 for [[Officer (armed forces)|Officers]] and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] and at 50 for the lower ranks.

==Refresher training in the Swedish Defence Forces==
As part of the changes in the post-[[Cold War]] reorganization if the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] from an invasion defence force to a targeted mission force, refresher training session were not held starting in the late 1990s. Refresher training was reintroduced by the [[Löfven Cabinet|Swedish government]] on December 11, 2014.&lt;ref name=sr&gt;{{cite web|title=Government reintroduces refresher training|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikle6043308|website=Sveriges Radio|publisher=Sveriges Radio|accessdate=December 11, 2014|language=Swedish}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education has been identified as a common social vaccine against contracting HIV, resulting in the more educated less likely to be infected. Accurate information of health risks suggests a negative linear relationship between years of education and HIV infection rate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Baker, David Multiple Effects of Education on Disease: The Intriguing Case of HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] Director-General made a statement during 2011 [[World AIDS Day]], identifying education as one of the three primary concerns, and urging for it to become a full-fledged priority. By implementing educational policies, UNESCO aims to make sure all individuals, in and out of formal education, have access to comprehensive HIV education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/resources/online-materials/single-view/news/flying_the_flag_for_hiv_and_aids_education/#.UyITMvldUuc&lt;/ref&gt; Improving the education of HIV/AIDS has become a growing concern, with 1 in 4 students aged 16 and above stating they had learned nothing about HIV/AIDS in school during a Sex Education Forum survey in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncb.org.uk/media/333229/young_people_experiences_of_hiv_and_aids.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207183451/http://www.ncb.org.uk/media/333229/young_people_experiences_of_hiv_and_aids.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concerns are further stressed since learning about sexually transmitted diseases is the only aspect of sex education that is compulsory for all secondary schools in England and Wales.

==Availability of information==

Education is a strong factor in improving population health by building in individuals the capacity to process and understand risks related to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Adversely, poor information hinders individuals from analyzing their behavioural choices by masking potential health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pop.psu.edu/news/2012/the-causal-effect-of-education-on-population-dynamics |title=Population Research Institute |publisher=Pop.psu.edu |date=2017-08-10 |accessdate=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inadequate information becomes a risk factor for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. The mischaracterization of HIV/AIDS as a homosexual disease has led higher status heterosexuals that participate in risky sexual behaviour to continue without considering the risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, Ryan; Wiseman, Alexander: The Impact of HIV/AIDS on Education Worldwide&lt;/ref&gt; Education is important in the growth of adolescent reasoning, as having less prior knowledge shows a compulsion to construct reality based on recent experiences.

Data analysis collected in Sydney, Australia in 2007 found that within 236 adults, age 20 to 65, respondents were concerned about risks of HIV/AIDS transmitted through casual contact, leading to disapproval of homosexuality and drug use. In contrast, highly educated respondents were shown to be less likely to overestimate the possibility of HIV transmission through casual contact compared to respondents with a lower level education.&lt;ref&gt;Hosseinzadeh, Hassan: Functional Analysis of HIV/AIDS Stigma: Consensus or Divergence?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudinal changes==

Negative attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS stem from misconceptions regarding the disease. Georgian sex workers were found to be highly lacking knowledge, with only 61% knowing that a healthy-looking person can be infected, and 44% thinking one can get HIV from a mosquito bite. Only 64% think that using condoms for every sexual act can reduce the risk of HIV.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;The World Bank: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior Related To HIV/AIDS Among Transport Sector Workers: A Case Study of Georgia.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sex workers in Georgia who were interviewed regarding people living with HIV/AIDS were found to have negative attitudes towards infected individuals. Only 25% thought a teacher who is HIV-positive should be allowed to continue teaching, and only 25% would buy food from an infected vendor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Stigma associated with those who have HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa prevents many from getting tested. The relation predicts, as formal education continues to change attitudes towards those living with HIV/AIDS, the reduction of stigma enhances prevention techniques.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Cognitive abilities==

As cognitive abilities are built, individuals become more motivated and develop a capacity to absorb more accurate information. Over half of English students agree that teaching about HIV/AIDS should start between 11 and 13 years old, while just under one third believe between 14 and 16 is the best age to learn about sexual education.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the introduction of partially accurate information in Sub-Saharan Africa led to a decline in HIV rates among more educated, suggesting they may have the greater cognitive skill required to sift through the various levels of accuracy and mount a more effective response.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Increased motivation needed to analyze personal risks and behavioural choices were increased by cognitive abilities enhanced by formal education, suggesting a direct correlation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Africa ==
The result in a shortage of teaching materials and inadequate capacities in the teaching of HIV and AIDS and life skills education.In addition, it was found that HIV and AIDS are highly stigmatized, colleges are ill equipped with health facilities, and national policies on condom use are ambiguous. The report presents a discussion of these and other issues, and makes policy and programmatic recommendations for strengthening the response of teacher training colleges to HIV and AIDS.
HIV/AIDS affects the economics of both individuals and countries.The gross domestic product of the most affected countries has decreased due to the lack of human capital.Without proper nutrition, health care and medicine, large numbers of people die from AIDS-related complications. They will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. It is estimated that as of 2007 there where 12 million Many are cared for by elderly grandparents.
By affecting mainly young adults, AIDS reduces the taxable population, in turn reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state's finances and slower growth of the economy. This causes a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.
At the household level, AIDS results in both the loss of income but also increased spending on healthcare. A study in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] showed that households with an [[HIV/AIDS]] patient, spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households.&lt;ref name="WBank"&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment.

==Critique==

Studies of the effectiveness of HIV education programs often rely on self-reported information about knowledge and behavior, leading to a possible social desirability bias if subjects report what they think the interviewer wants to think&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 
Encouraging Kenyan students to write essays on way of protecting oneself against HIV/AIDS led to increased self-reported use of condoms without an increase in self-reported sexual activity. There is no evidence to determine whether an increase in condom use by students corresponds to actual reduction in HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Early findings adversely identified formal education as a risk factor (with the more educated individuals being most likely to be infected). As wealthier individuals are usually more educated, the risk of many of these individuals was accompanied by the presence of formal wealth as a risk factor. Twenty years into the pandemic, education began to shift from risk factor to social vaccine.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11508">In [[differential calculus]], the '''Reynolds transport theorem''' (also known as the Leibniz–Reynolds transport theorem), or in short '''Reynolds' theorem''', is a three-dimensional generalization of the [[Leibniz integral rule]] which is also known as [[differentiation under the integral sign]].
The theorem is named after [[Osborne Reynolds]] (1842–1912). It is used to recast derivatives of integrated quantities and is useful in formulating the basic equations of [[continuum mechanics]].

Consider integrating {{math|'''f''' {{=}} '''f'''('''x''',''t'')}} over the time-dependent region {{math|Ω(''t'')}} that has boundary {{math|∂Ω(''t'')}}, then taking the derivative with respect to time:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;
If we wish to move the derivative within the integral, there are two issues: the time dependence of {{math|'''f'''}}, and the introduction of and removal of space from {{math|Ω}} due to its dynamic boundary. Reynolds' transport theorem provides the necessary framework.

== General form ==
Reynolds' transport theorem can be expressed as follows:&lt;ref name=LGLp23&gt;[[L. Gary Leal|L. G. Leal]], 2007, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OR14&gt;[[Osborne Reynolds|O. Reynolds]], 1903, Vol. 3, p. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MTp23&gt;[[Jerrold E. Marsden|J.E. Marsden]] and [[Anthony Tromba|A. Tromba]], 5th ed. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV = \int_{\Omega(t)} \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t}\,dV + \int_{\partial \Omega(t)} \left(\mathbf{v}^b\cdot\mathbf{n}\right)\mathbf{f}\,dA&lt;/math&gt;

in which {{math|'''n'''('''x''',''t'')}} is the outward-pointing unit normal vector, {{math|'''x'''}} is a point in the region and is the variable of integration, {{math|''dV''}} and {{math|''dA''}} are volume and surface elements at {{math|'''x'''}}, and {{math|'''v'''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;('''x''',''t'')}} is the velocity of the area element (''not'' the flow velocity). The function {{math|'''f'''}} may be tensor-, vector- or scalar-valued.&lt;ref&gt;H. Yamaguchi, ''Engineering Fluid Mechanics, ''Springer c2008 p23&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the integral on the left hand side is a function solely of time, and so the total derivative has been used.

== Form for a material element ==
In continuum mechanics, this theorem is often used for [[material element]]s.  These are parcels of fluids or solids which no material enters or leaves. If {{math|Ω(''t'')}} is a material element then there is a velocity function {{math|'''v''' {{=}} '''v'''('''x''',''t'')}}, and the boundary elements obey
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}^{b}\cdot\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n}.&lt;/math&gt;
This condition may be substituted to obtain:&lt;ref name=BLM&gt;[[Ted Belytschko|T. Belytschko]], W. K. Liu, and B. Moran, 2000, '' Nonlinear Finite Elements for Continua and Structures'', John Wiley and Sons, Ltd., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left(\int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV\right) = \int_{\Omega(t)} \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t}\,dV + \int_{\partial \Omega(t)} (\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{f}\,dA.&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="50%" style="text-align:left"
!Proof for a material element
|-
|
Let {{math|Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} be reference configuration of the region {{math|Ω(''t'')}}. Let
the motion and the [[deformation gradient]] be given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X}, t),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}(\mathbf{X},t) = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|''J''('''X''',''t'') {{=}} det '''''F'''''('''X''',''t'')}}. Define
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X}, t) = \mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X}, t), t).&lt;/math&gt;
Then the integrals in the current and the reference configurations are related by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV &amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X},t),t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t) \,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)\,dV_0.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

That this derivation is for a material element is implicit in the time constancy of the reference configuration: it is constant in material coordinates. The time derivative of an integral over a volume is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\Delta t} \left(\int_{\Omega(t + \Delta t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t+\Delta t)\,dV - \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Converting into integrals over the reference configuration, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t) \, dV\right) = 
\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\Delta t} \left(\int_{\Omega_0} \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t+\Delta t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t+\Delta t)\,dV_0 - \int_{\Omega_0} \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)\, dV_0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is independent of time, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right)
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \left(\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{ \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t+\Delta t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t+\Delta t) - \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)}{\Delta t} \right)\,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)\right)\,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\big(\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\big)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)+ \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\,\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\big(J(\mathbf{X},t)\big)\right) \,dV_0. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The time derivative of {{mvar|'''F'''}} is given by:
&lt;ref name=Gurtin&gt;[[Morton Gurtin|Gurtin M. E.]], 1981, ''An Introduction to Continuum Mechanics''. Academic Press, New York, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\partial J(\mathbf{X},t)}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\det\boldsymbol{F}) &amp;= (\det\boldsymbol{F})(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \\
&amp;= J(\mathbf{X},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}\big(\boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X},t),t\big) \\
&amp;= J(\mathbf{X},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t). \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right)
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\right)\,J(\mathbf{X},t)+ \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\,J(\mathbf{X},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)\right) \,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\right)+ \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)\right)\,J(\mathbf{X},t) \,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega(t)} \left(\dot{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{x},t)+ \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)\right)\,dV.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{f}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[material time derivative]] of {{math|'''f'''}}. The material derivative is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial t} + \big(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\big)\cdot\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t).&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right) =
\int_{\Omega(t)} \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial t} + \big(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\big)\cdot\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t) + \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)\right)\,dV,&lt;/math&gt;

or,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV\right)
= \int_{\Omega(t)} \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f}\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}\right)\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot (\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{v}(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{w}) + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{w},&lt;/math&gt;

we then have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV\right)
= \int_{\Omega(t)} \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot (\mathbf{f}\otimes\mathbf{v})\right)\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[divergence theorem]] and the identity {{math|('''a''' ⊗ '''b''') · '''n''' {{=}} ('''b''' · '''n''')'''a'''}}, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV\right)
&amp;= \int_{\Omega(t)}\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t}\,dV + \int_{\partial \Omega(t)}(\mathbf{f}\otimes\mathbf{v})\cdot\mathbf{n}\,dA \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega(t)}\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t}\,dV + \int_{\partial \Omega(t)}(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{f}\,dA. \qquad \square
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

== A special case ==
If we take {{math|Ω}} to be constant with respect to time, then {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} and the identity reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega} f\,dV = \int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

as expected. (This simplification is not possible if the flow velocity is incorrectly used in place of the velocity of an area element.)

=== Interpretation and reduction to one dimension ===
The theorem is the higher-dimensional extension of [[differentiation under the integral sign]] and reduces to that expression in some cases. Suppose {{mvar|f}} is independent of {{mvar|y}} and {{mvar|z}}, and that {{math|Ω(''t'')}} is a unit square in the {{mvar|yz}}-plane and has {{mvar|x}} limits {{math|''a''(''t'')}} and {{math|''b''(''t'')}}. Then Reynolds transport theorem reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} f(x,t)\,dx = \int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\,dx + \frac{\partial b(t)}{\partial t} f\big(b(t),t\big) - \frac{\partial a(t)}{\partial t} f\big(a(t),t\big) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which, up to swapping {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|t}}, is the standard expression for differentiation under the integral sign.

'''Robert Charles Venturi Jr.''' (June 25, 1925 – September 18, 2018) was an American [[architect]], founding principal of the firm [[Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates]], and one of the major architectural figures of the twentieth century.

Together with his wife and partner, [[Denise Scott Brown]], he helped shape the way that architects, planners and students experience and think about architecture and the American-built environment. Their buildings, planning, theoretical writings, and teaching have also contributed to the expansion of discourse about architecture.

Venturi was awarded the [[Pritzker Prize]] in Architecture in 1991; the prize was awarded to him alone, despite a request to include his equal partner, Brown. Subsequently, a group of women architects attempted to get her name added retroactively to the prize, but the Pritzker Prize jury declined to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/no-pritzker-prize-for-denise-scott-brown/?_r=0 |title=No Pritzker Prize for Denise Scott Brown |first=Robin |last=Pogrebin |date=14 June 2013 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/01/business/denise-scott-brown-pritzker-prize |title=Denise Scott Brown: Architecture favors 'lone male genius' over women |newspaper=CNN |author= Catriona Davies |date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ARCHITECTURE VIEW; Robert Venturi, Gentle Subverter of Modernism |author=Goldberger, Paul|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDD1338F937A25757C0A967958260|publisher=The New York Times|date=14 April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venturi is also known for having coined the maxim "Less is a bore", a [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] antidote to [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe's]] famous [[Modernism|modernist]] dictum "Less is more". Venturi lived in [[Philadelphia]] with Denise Scott Brown. He was the father of James Venturi, founder and principal of ReThink Studio.

==Early life and education==
Venturi was born in Philadelphia to Robert Venturi Sr. and Vanna (née Luizi) Venturi and was raised as a [[Quaker]].&lt;ref name=yearbook&gt;The Nassau Herald 1947, Princeton University yearbook&lt;/ref&gt; Venturi attended school at the [[Episcopal Academy]] in [[Merion]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He was awarded the [[Rome Prize Fellowship]] at the [[American Academy in Rome]] in 1954, where he studied and toured Europe for two years.

From 1959 to 1967, Venturi held teaching positions at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he served as Kahn's teaching assistant, an instructor, and later, as associate professor. It was there, in 1960, that he met fellow faculty member, architect and planner [[Denise Scott Brown]]. Venturi taught later at the [[Yale School of Architecture]] and was a visiting lecturer with Scott Brown in 2003 at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Graduate School of Design]].

==Writings==
A controversial critic of the blithely [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] and symbolically vacuous architecture of corporate modernism during the 1950s, Venturi was considered a [[counterrevolutionary]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} He published his "gentle manifesto", ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'' in 1966; in its introduction, [[Vincent Scully]] called it "probably the most important writing on the making of architecture since [[Le Corbusier]]'s [[Towards a New Architecture|''Vers Une Architecture'']] of 1923." The work was derived from course lectures at the University of Pennsylvania, and Venturi received a grant from the [[Graham Foundation]] in 1965 to aid in its completion. The book demonstrated, through countless examples, an approach to understanding architectural composition and complexity, and the resulting richness and interest. Citing [[vernacular]] as well as high-style sources, Venturi drew new lessons from the buildings of architects familiar ([[Michelangelo]], [[Alvar Aalto]]) and then-forgotten ([[Frank Furness]], [[Edwin Lutyens]]). He made a case for "the difficult whole" rather than the diagrammatic forms popular at the time, and included examples — both built and unrealized — of his own work to demonstrate the possible application of such techniques. The book has been published in 18 languages to date.

Immediately hailed as a theorist and designer with radical ideas, Venturi went to teach a series of studios at the [[Yale School of Architecture]] in the mid-1960s. The most famous of these was a studio in 1968 in which Venturi and Scott Brown, together with [[Steven Izenour]], led a team of students to document and analyze the [[Las Vegas Strip]], perhaps the least likely subject for a serious research project imaginable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/lessons-from-las-vegas/|title=Lessons from Las Vegas - 99% Invisible|work=99% Invisible|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour published the folio, ''A Significance for A&amp;P Parking Lots, or [[Learning from Las Vegas]].'' It was revised using the student work as a foil for new theory, and reissued in 1977 as ''Learning from Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form''. This second manifesto was an even more stinging rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes.  The book coined the terms "Duck" and "Decorated Shed," descriptions of the two predominant ways of embodying iconography in buildings. The work of Venturi, Scott Brown, and [[John Rauch]] adopted the latter strategy, producing formally simple "decorated sheds" with rich, complex, and often shocking ornamental flourishes. Venturi and his wife co-wrote several more books at the end of the century, but these two have so far proved to the most influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Mark Alan Hewitt |title=Venturi, Robert |work=Grove Art Online |publisher=Oxford Art Online |date=28 November 2011 |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T2086166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Guildhouse Philly.JPG|thumb|The [[Guild House (Philadelphia)|Guild House]], completed 1964, on Spring Garden Street, Philadelphia]]
The architecture of Robert Venturi, although perhaps not as familiar today as his books, helped redirect American architecture away from a widely practiced, often banal, modernism in the 1960s to a more exploratory design approach that openly drew lessons from architectural history and responded to the everyday context of the American city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.archdaily.com/130389/interview-robert-venturi-denise-scott-brown-by-andrea-tamas |title=Interview: Robert Venturi &amp; Denise Scott Brown |date=April 25, 2011 |publisher=Archdaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venturi's buildings typically juxtapose architectural systems, elements and aims, to acknowledge the conflicts often inherent in a project or site. This "inclusive" approach contrasted with the typical modernist effort to resolve and unify all factors in a complete and rigidly structured—and possibly less functional and more simplistic—work of art. The diverse range of buildings of Venturi's early career offered surprising alternatives to then current architectural practice, with "impure" forms (such as the North Penn Visiting Nurses Headquarters), apparently casual asymmetries (as at the Vanna Venturi House), and pop-style supergraphics and geometries (for instance, the Lieb House).

[[File:Espicopal Acad int.JPG|thumb|Chapel at the Episcopal Academy, Newtown Square, PA. (2010)]]
Venturi created the firm Venturi and Short with William Short in 1960. After John Rauch replaced Short as partner in 1964, the firm's name changed to Venturi and Rauch. Venturi married [[Denise Scott Brown]] on July 23, 1967, in [[Santa Monica, California]], and in 1969, Scott Brown joined the firm as partner in charge of planning. In 1980, The firm's name became Venturi, Rauch, and Scott Brown, and after Rauch's resignation in 1989, Venturi, Scott Brown, and Associates. The firm, based in [[Manayunk, Philadelphia]], was awarded the Architecture Firm Award by the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1985.  The practice's recent work includes many commissions from academic institutions, including campus planning and university buildings, and civic buildings in London, [[Toulouse]], and Japan.

Venturi's architecture has had worldwide influence, beginning in the late 1960s with the dissemination of the broken-gable roof of the Vanna Venturi House and the segmentally arched window and interrupted string courses of Guild House. The playful variations on vernacular house types seen in the Trubeck and Wislocki Houses offered a new way to embrace, but transform, familiar forms.  The facade patterning of the Oberlin Art Museum and the laboratory buildings demonstrated a treatment of the vertical surfaces of buildings that is both decorative and abstract, drawing from vernacular and historic architecture while still being modern. Venturi's work arguably provided a key influence at important times in the careers of architects [[Robert A. M. Stern]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Philip Johnson]], [[Michael Graves]], [[Graham Gund]] and [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Venturi was a Fellow of the [[American Academy in Rome]], the [[American Institute of Architects]], [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].

==Death==
Venturi died on September 18, 2018, in Philadelphia from complications of [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archpaper.com/2018/09/robert-venturi-passes-away/|title=Robert Venturi passes away - Archpaper.com|website=archpaper.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/obituaries/robert-venturi-dead.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was 93.

In the wake of Venturi's death, [[Michael Kimmelman]], the current architecture critic for the ''[[New York Times]]'',  tweeted..."RIP the great, inspiring Robert Venturi who opened millions of eyes and whole new ways of thinking about the richness of our architectural environment, and whose diverse work with Denise Scott Brown contains a mix of wit and humanity that continues to transcend labels and time".&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/kimmelman/status/1042496869564395521&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4573">'''Special Interest Group on Computer–Human Interaction''' ('''SIGCHI''') is the one of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s special interest groups which is focused on [[human–computer interaction]]s (HCI).

It hosts the major annual international HCI conference, [[CHI (conference)|CHI]], with around 2,500 attendees, and publishes ''[[ACM Interactions]]'' and ''[[ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction]]'' (TOCHI).

SIGCHI was formed in 1982 by renaming and refocusing the Special Interest Group on Social and Behavioral Computing (SIGSOC); [[Lorraine Borman]], previously editor of the ''[[SIGSOC Bulletin]]'', was its first chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=SIGCHI: The Early Years|first=Lorraine|last=Borman|authorlink=Lorraine Borman|journal=SIGCHI Bulletin|date=January 1996|volume=28|issue=1|url=http://old.sigchi.org/bulletin/1996.1/borman.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

SIGCHI has two membership publications, the ''[[SIGCHI Bulletin]]'' and ''ACM Interactions''.

==Awards==
Each year SIGCHI inducts around 7 or 8 people into the [[CHI Academy]], honoring them for their significant contribution to the field of human–computer interaction.  It also gives out a CHI Lifetime Achievement Award for research and practice, the CHI Lifetime Service Award, and the CHI Social Impact Award.

'''''Sphaerotilus natans''''' is an aquatic [[periphyton]] organism associated with polluted water.  It forms colonies commonly known as "sewage fungus", but later identified as tightly sheathed filamentous [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;Fair, Geyer &amp; Okun p.32-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==
Straight or smoothly curved filaments 1.5&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter and 100 to more than 500&amp;nbsp;µm in length are formed by rod-shaped cells with clear [[septum|septa]] growing within a long, tubular sheath.  An adhesive basal element at one end of the filament can aid attachment to solid surfaces.&lt;ref name="aem"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pellegrin |first1=Véronique  |last2=Juretschko |first2=Stefan  |last3=Wagner |first3= Michael |last4=Cottenceau  |first4=Gilles |year=1999 |title=Morphological and Biochemical Properties of a Sphaerotilus sp.

''S. natans'' stores reserves of [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|poly- ''beta'' -hydroxybutyrate]] as internal globules making up 30 to 40% of the dry weight of a colony.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;   Gram and Neisser staining reactions are negative.&lt;ref name="ebs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebsbiowizard.com/resources/micro-gallery/sphaerotilus-natans/|title=Sphaerotilus natans|publisher=Environmental Business Specialists LLC|accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
''S. natans'' requires dissolved simple [[sugar]]s or [[organic acid]]s as a food supply, but needs less [[phosphorus]] than many competing organisms and can tolerate low [[oxygen]] concentrations.&lt;ref name="ebs"/&gt;  Capability to deposit elemental [[sulfur]] intracellularly in the presence of [[hydrogen sulfide]] is believed to be a detoxifying mechanism.  ''S. natans'' requires either [[cobalamin]] or [[methionine]] as a trace nutrient.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;  ''S. natans'' filaments can aid development of a periphyton [[biofilm]] trapping suspended particles and stabilizing colonies of other organisms including ''[[Klebsiella]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]''.&lt;ref name="aem"/&gt;

==Significance==
''Sphaerotilus natans'' is often associated with a buoyant floc (or "bulking sludge") causing poor solids separation in [[activated sludge]] [[clarifier]]s of [[Sewage treatment#Secondary treatment|secondary sewage treatment]].&lt;ref name="h55"/&gt;  Metal surfaces covered with ''S. natans'' may experience accelerated [[corrosion]] if the slime creates a barrier causing differential oxygen concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Betz pp.288&amp;289&lt;/ref&gt;  ''S. natans'' slimes may reduce quality of paper produced by [[paper mill]]s using recycled water streams.&lt;ref name="aem"/&gt;

{{About|the interdisciplinary field|the analysis of systems in electrical engineering|system analysis}}
The [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary defines '''system analysis''' as "the process of studying a procedure or [[business]] in order to identify its goals and purposes and create [[system]]s and procedures that will achieve them in an efficient way". Another view sees system analysis as a [[problem-solving]] technique that breaks down a system into its component pieces for the purpose of the studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Analysis-Design-Global-Enterprise/dp/0071107665 System Analysis and Design for the Global Enterprise] by Lonnie D. Bentley p.160 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of system analysis relates closely to [[Requirement analysis|requirements analysis]] or to [[operations research]]. It is also "an explicit formal inquiry carried out to help a [[decision maker]] identify a better course of action and make a better decision than she might otherwise have made."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070822025602/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/SYSTEM_ANALY.html SYSTEMS ANALYSIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms [[wiktionary:analysis|analysis]] and [[wiktionary:synthesis|synthesis]] stem from Greek, meaning "to take apart" and "to put together," respectively. These terms are used in many [[scientific discipline]]s, from mathematics and logic to economics and psychology, to denote similar investigative procedures. Analysis is defined as "the procedure by which we break down an intellectual or substantial whole into parts," while synthesis means "the procedure by which we combine separate elements or components in order to form a coherent whole." &lt;ref&gt;Tom Ritchey, [http://www.swemorph.com/pdf/anaeng-r.pdf  Analysis and Synthesis.]&lt;/ref&gt; System analysis researchers apply [[methodology]] to the systems involved, forming an overall picture.

System analysis is used in every field where something is developed. Analysis can also be a series of components that perform organic functions together, such as system engineering. [[System engineering]] is an [[interdisciplinary field]] of engineering that focuses on how complex engineering projects should be designed and managed.

==Information technology==
The development of a computer-based information system includes a system analysis phase. This helps produce the [[data model]], a precursor to creating or enhancing a [[database]]. There are a number of different approaches to system analysis. When a computer-based information system is developed, system analysis (according to the [[Waterfall model]]) would constitute the following steps:

* The development of a feasibility study: determining whether a project is economically, socially, technologically and organizationally feasible
* Fact-finding measures, designed to ascertain the requirements of the system's end-users (typically involving interviews, questionnaires, or visual observations of work on the existing system)
* Gauging how the end-users would operate the system (in terms of general experience in using computer hardware or software), what the system would be used for and so on

Another view outlines a phased approach to the process. This  approach breaks system analysis into 5 phases:

* Scope Definition: Clearly defined objectives and requirements necessary to meet a project's requirements as defined by its stakeholders
* Problem analysis: the process of understanding problems and needs and arriving at solutions that meet them
* Requirements analysis: determining the conditions that need to be met
* Logical design: looking at the logical relationship among the objects
* Decision analysis: making a final decision
 
[[Use case]]s are widely used system analysis modeling tools for identifying and expressing the functional requirements of a system. Each use case is a business scenario or event for which the system must provide a defined response. Use cases evolved from object-oriented analysis.

==Policy analysis==
The discipline of what is today known as [[policy analysis]] originated from the application of system analysis when it was first instituted by United States [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]].{{cn|date=April 2016}}

==Practitioners==
Practitioners of system analysis are often called up to dissect systems that have grown haphazardly to determine the current components of the system. This was shown during the year 2000 re-engineering effort as business and manufacturing processes were examined as part of the [[Y2K]] automation upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;Géza HUSI: Mechatronics Control Systems&lt;/ref&gt; Employment utilizing system analysis include [[system analyst]], [[business analyst]], [[Industrial engineering|manufacturing engineer]], [[system architect]], [[enterprise architect]], [[software architect]], etc.

While practitioners of system analysis can be called upon to create new systems, they often modify, expand or document existing systems ([[Process (engineering)|processes]], [[Procedure (term)|procedures]] and [[Methodology|methods]]). Researchers and practitioners rely on system analysis. Activity system analysis has been already applied to various research and practice studies including business management, educational reform, educational technology, etc.

The '''taxonomy of Liliaceae''' has had a complex history since the first description of this [[flowering plant]] [[family (biology)|family]] in the mid-eighteenth century. Originally, the [[Liliaceae]] or Lily family were defined as having a "[[Calyx (flower)|''calix'']]" (perianth) of six equal-coloured parts, six [[stamens]], a single [[Style (botany)|style]], and a superior, three-chambered (trilocular) [[Ovary (botany)|ovary]] turning into a [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] fruit at maturity. The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the Liliaceae family progressively expanded until it became the largest plant family and also extremely diverse, being somewhat arbitrarily defined as all [[species]] of plants with six [[tepals]] and a superior ovary. It eventually came to encompass about 300 [[genus (biology)|genera]] and 4,500 [[species]], and was thus a "[[Catch-all taxon|catch-all]]"  and hence [[paraphyletic]] [[taxon]]. Only since the more modern taxonomic systems developed by the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] (APG) and based on [[phylogenetic]] principles, has it been possible to identify the many separate taxonomic groupings within the original family and redistribute them, leaving a relatively small core as the modern Liliaceae family, with fifteen genera and 600 species.

The Liliaceae emerged from the [[Liliales]] [[Order (biology)|order]], separating from its [[sister clade]] around 52&amp;nbsp;million years ago ([[mya (unit)|mya]]), and [[Genetic divergence|diversifying]] around 34&amp;nbsp;mya. Of the major [[clades]], the [[Lilieae]] arose in [[Eurasia]] while the [[Medeoleae]] arose in [[North America]]  but was subsequently dispersed, as may have the [[Streptopoideae]] and [[Calochortoideae]]. Liliaceae [[fossils]] have been dated to the [[Paleogene]] and [[Cretaceous]] eras in the [[Antarctic]].

The Liliaceae probably arose as shade plants, with subsequent evolution to open areas including [[deciduous forest]] in the more open autumnal period. This was accompanied by a shift from [[rhizomes]] to [[bulbs]], to more showy flowers, the production of capsular fruit and narrower parallel-veined leaves.

While the suprageneric (above genus level) structure of the family has varied greatly with its ever-changing [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]], as currently constituted the family consists of three [[subfamily|subfamilies]], [[Lilioideae]], [[Calochortoideae]] and [[Streptopoideae]]. [[Lilioideae]] is further divided into two [[Tribe (biology)|tribes]], [[Medeoleae]] and [[Lilieae]]. The three subfamilies contain fifteen genera and approximately 600 species in all.

== History ==

=== Pre-Darwinian ===
The [[type genus]], ''[[Lilium]]'', from which the name of the family was derived, was originally formally described by Carl [[Linnaeus]] in 1753, with seven species.{{sfn|Linnaeus|1753|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/358106#page/314/mode/1up Lilium vol.&amp;nbsp;i p.&amp;nbsp;302]}} He placed ''Lilium'' within the ''Hexandria Monogynia'' (six [[stamens]], one [[carpel]]) in his [[Linnaean taxonomy|sexual classification]] in the ''[[Species Plantarum]]''.{{sfn|Linnaeus|1753|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/358106#page/297/mode/1up Hexandria monogynia vol.&amp;nbsp;i pp.&amp;nbsp; 285–352]}} The Liliaceae [[family (biology)|family]] was first described by [[Michel Adanson]] in 1763,{{sfn|Lobstein|2013}}{{sfn|Adanson|1763|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/6958#page/588/mode/1up VIII Liliaceae p.&amp;nbsp;42–60]}} but formally named by [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu]] in 1789.{{sfn|Jussieu|1789|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/7125#page/143/mode/1up Lilia pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49]}}{{sfn|Stevens|2013}} Adanson described eight subfamilies with 78 genera, however the subfamily he described as ''Lis'' (Lilies) had seven genera (''Uvularia'', ''[[Erythronium|Mithridatium]]'', ''[[Gloriosa (plant)|Mendoni]]'', ''Lilium'', ''Fritillaria'', ''Imperialis'' — now part of ''Fritillaria'' — and ''Tulipa'') of which four are in the modern genus.{{sfn|Adanson|1763|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/6958#page/594/mode/1up Liliaceae Section II Les Lis ''Lilia''  p.&amp;nbsp;48]}} Jussieu placed these into the ''Ordo'', ''Lilia'' in the ''Classis'', ''Stamina Perigyna'' of the [[Monocots|''Monocotyledones'']] (monocots), with eight genera (''Tulipa'', ''Erythronioum'', ''[[Gloriosa (plant)|Methonica]]'', ''[[Uvularia]]'', ''[[Fritillaria]]'', ''Imperialis'', ''Lilium'', ''[[Yucca]]'') only four of which remain in the family. He defined ''Lilia'' as "[[Calyx (flower)|calix]]" ([[perianth]]) of six equal coloured parts, six stamens, a superior ovary, single style, and trilocular capsule. The term ''Ordo'' at that time was closer to what we now understand as Family, rather than [[Order (biology)|Order]].{{sfn|ICN|2012|loc=[http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art18 18.2 Names of families and subfamilies, tribes and subtribes]}}{{sfn|Candolle|1813|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/88297#page/204/mode/1up Des familles et des tribus pp.&amp;nbsp;192–195]}} Although Jussieu used the [[Latin]] "''Lilia''" in his ''Genera Plantarum'', elsewhere he used the French "''Liliacées''",{{sfn|de Jussieu|1778|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/89076#page/388/mode/1up p.&amp;nbsp;228]}} as had Adanson. The word "Liliaceae" was soon widely used by botanists such as [[Samuel Frederick Gray]],{{sfn|Gray|1821|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/95185#page/185/mode/1up Fam IX Liliaceae Jussieu.  vol 2: p.&amp;nbsp;173]}} [[John Lindley]],{{sfn|Lindley|1830|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/31944#page/347/mode/1up CCLI: Liliaceae. p.&amp;nbsp;279]}} and [[Pierre-Joseph Redouté]]{{sfn|Redouté|1802–1816}} in the early nineteenth century.

Gray (1821) provided the first description of Jussieu's scheme in English, identifying two genera occurring in Britain (''Tulipa'', ''Fritillaria''), distinguished by the absence or presence of basal nectaries. His key used the presence of six equal stamens, a single style, a simple [[petaloid]] (undifferentiated [[tepals]] resembling petals) perianth and a trilocular capsule with flat seeds to identify the family.{{sfn|Gray|1821|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/95185#page/10/mode/1up An Arrangement of the Families, and of the anomalous Genera of phenogamous Plants, according to their sexual Organs. vol 2: p.&amp;nbsp;vi]}} Although [[Augustin De Candolle]] (1813) had not explicitly described the Liliaceae, his overall [[de Candolle system|classification scheme]] influenced many later writers including Gray.{{sfn|Gray|1821|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/95186#page/26/mode/1up The genera of British plants, according to their mutual relations, with the number of species in each genus. 2. Plantae Endogenae: B Plantae Endogenae Phenogamae - 14. Liliaceae. vol 1: p.&amp;nbsp;xx]}} In this scheme, {{sfn|Candolle|1813|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/88297#page/231/mode/1up Esquisse. D'une Série linéaire et par conséquent artificielle, pour la disposition des familles naturelles du règne végetal p.&amp;nbsp;219]}} the Liliaceae were considered a family within those [[vascular plants]] (''Vasculares'') whose vascular bundles were thought to arise from within (''Endogènes'', [[endogenous]]), a term he preferred to ''Monocotylédonés''. Jussieu's ''Monocotyledones'' became the ''[[Phanerogams|Phanérogames]]'' (''Phenogamae'' in Gray), meaning "visible seed", hence ''Endogenæ phanerogamæ''.{{sfn| Marilaun|1890–1891}} Candolle also instituted the concept of [[Taxonomic rank|ordered ranks]], based on classes, subclasses, ''familles'' (Latin: ''ordines naturales'') and ''tribus'' ([[Tribe (biology)|tribes]]),{{sfn| Candolle|1813|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/88297#page/204/mode/1up Des familles et des tribus pp.&amp;nbsp;192–195]}} subdividing the Liliaceae.

Lindley was the first post-Linnaean English [[systematist]], publishing his work in 1830,{{sfn|Lindley|1830}} and following the reasoning of Jussieu he used the term tribe to describe the Liliaceae as a division of the [[Petaloid monocots|hexapetaloid monocots]], characterised by a superior ovary, highly developed perianth, inward turning anthers, a trilocular polyspermous capsule and seeds with a soft spongy coat. He offered seven genera as examples (''[[Erythronium]]'', ''[[Lilium]]'', ''[[Calochortus]]'', ''[[Blandfordia]]'', ''[[Polianthes]]'', ''[[Hemerocallis]]'' and ''[[Funkia]]''). By 1846, in his final work, he refined and greatly expanded his taxonomy, favouring the term ''Alliances of Endogens'' over monocots as a class, of which there were eleven. Of these "alliances", the [[Liliales]] consisted of four Orders (families) including Liliaceae, which he referred to as ''lilyworts'' in the vernacular, with 133 genera and 1200 species.{{sfn|Lindley|1846|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/32198#page/274/mode/1up Order LXII: Liliaceae - Lilyworts. pp.&amp;nbsp;200–205]}} In this work he unhappily acknowledged the confusing array of different approaches to the classification of the Liliaceae, the lack of a clear definition, and the great diversity in the [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the order, which had expanded vastly, with many subdivisions. As he saw it, the Liliaceae had already become a ("[[Catch-all taxon|catch-all]]") grouping,{{sfn|Kubitzki|Rudall|Chase|1998}} being "everything that does not belong to the other parts of the Lilial Alliance", but expressed hope that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better.{{sfn|Lindley|1846|loc=p&amp;nbsp;.201}} In other words, he foresaw that Liliaceae would come to be regarded as [[paraphyletic]]. By the time of the next major British classification, that of [[Bentham and Hooker]] in 1883 (published in Latin) several of Lindley's other families had been absorbed into the Liliaceae.{{sfn|Bentham|Hooker|1862–1883|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/14690#page/309/mode/1up Vol III Part II Liliaceae pp. 748–836]}} This was the last major classification using the "natural" or pre-evolutionary approach to classification, based on characteristics selected ''[[a posteriori]]'' in order to group together taxa that have the greatest number of shared characteristics. This approach, also referred to as polythetic was superseded by ones based on an understanding of the acquisition of characteristics through evolution, referred to as [[phyletic]].{{sfn|Stuessy|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=b9Q2EOkw7toC&amp;pg=PA47 Natural classification p.&amp;nbsp;47]}}{{sfn|Datta|1988|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=X7lfMACvjs4C&amp;pg=PA21 Systems of classification p.&amp;nbsp;21]}}{{sfn|Stace|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VfQnuwh3bw8C&amp;pg=PA19 The development of plant taxonomy p.&amp;nbsp;17]}}

=== Post-Darwinian ===

[[File:Wettstein Fritillaria ophioglossifolia.jpg|thumb|''[[Fritillaria ophioglossifolia]]'', [[R Wettstein]] ''Handbuch der Systematischen Botanik'' 1901–1924]]Although [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Origin of Species]] (1859) preceded Bentham and Hooker's publication, the latter project was commenced much earlier and [[George Bentham]] was initially sceptical of [[Darwinism]].{{sfn|Stuessy|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=b9Q2EOkw7toC&amp;pg=PA47 Natural classification p.&amp;nbsp;47]}} The new [[phyletic]] approach changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating [[evolutionary]] information into their schemata, but this did little to further define the circumscription of Liliaceae.{{sfn|Singh|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=In_Lv8iMt24C&amp;pg=10 Historical background of plant classification. pp.&amp;nbsp;10–29]}} The major works in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century employing this approach were in the [[German language|German]] literature, the [[Eichler system|Eichler]] (1875–1886), [[Engler system|Engler and Prantl]] (1886–1924) and [[Wettstein system|Wettstein]] (1901–1935) systems. These placed the Liliaceae into one of the major subdivisions of the [[monocotyledons]], the [[Liliiflorae]].{{sfn|Eichler|1886|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XE0bAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 Liliiflorae p.&amp;nbsp;34]}}{{sfn|Engler|1900–1968}}{{sfn|Engler|1903|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/63778#page/127/mode/1up Liliiflorae p.&amp;nbsp;93]}}{{sfn|Carter|1913}}{{sfn|Wettstein|1924|loc=[http://biolib.mpipz.mpg.de/wettstein/botanik/high/IMG_5926.html Liliiflorae p.&amp;nbsp;862]}} In the English literature, [[Bessey system|Charles Bessey]] (1915)  followed [[Adolf Engler]] in defining Liliaceae as "Pistil mostly 3-celled;  stamens 6; perianth of two similar whorls, each of three similar leaves", although placing the Liliales in a novel subclass of monocots, the [[Strobiloideae]],{{sfn|Bessey|1915}} while from [[Hutchinson system|John Hutchinson]] (1959) onwards the Liliaceae were treated as part of the [[Liliales]] (see [[#Tab1|Table 1]]).

Over time the Liliaceae became increasingly broadly, and somewhat arbitrarily, defined as all species of plants with six tepals and a superior ovary. They eventually came to encompass about 300 genera and 4,500 species, within the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Liliales]] in the [[Cronquist system|scheme]] of [[Arthur Cronquist]] (1981).{{sfn|Cronquist|1981}} Cronquist was a "[[Lumpers and splitters|lumper]]" preferring a small number of very large groupings and his classification of the Liliaceae represented the greatest expansion of the family to date. Cronquist placed most flowering [[petaloid monocots]] with six stamens in this very broad (and clearly [[polyphyletic]]) family, hence the alternative name lilioid monocots.{{sfn|Rasmussen|1985}} He rejected the importance of ovary position and thus included with the Liliaceae with their superior ovary ([[hypogynous]]), the [[Amaryllidaceae]], some species of which had an inferior ovary (epigynous), and which others separated into a distinct family.{{sfn|Lawrence|1951}}{{sfn|Judd et al.|2007}}{{sfn|Thorne|1992}} The Liliaceae were one of the major families in the Cronquist system which included 22 families in addition to Liliaceae in the more restricted sense (''[[sensu stricto]]'', ''s.s.'') used by others.{{sfn|Reveal|1997}}{{sfn|Datta|1988}} Later more conventional schemes include the [[Thorne system (1992)|system]] of [[Robert F. Thorne]]{{sfn|Thorne|1992}} and that of [[Armen Takhtajan]]{{sfn|Takhtajan|1980}} which characterised the family as [[petaloid]] monocots, characterised by showy flowers with tepals and without [[starch]] in the [[endosperm]].

=== Deconstructing Liliaceae ===

Other botanists in the twentieth century echoed Lindley's concerns about the lack of a clearly defined grouping for Liliaceae. The earliest of these was [[Johannes Paulus Lotsy]] (1911),{{sfn|Lotsy|1907–1911|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/68460#page/721/mode/1up 3: Cormophyta Siphonogamia. Liliifloren p.&amp;nbsp;715]}} building on Wettstein's work. Lotsy suggested four separate families, Liliaceae, Alliaceae, Agapanthaceae and Gilliesiaceae, within the ''Liliifloren''. This recognised the major groupings that would later be transferred to [[Amaryllidaceae]] as subfamilies [[Allioideae]] and [[Agapanthoideae]], with [[Gilliesieae]] as a tribe within the Allioideae. This approach was later followed by [[Herbert Huber (botanist)|Herbert Huber]] in 1969.{{sfn|Huber|1969}} These various proposals to separate small groups of genera into more homogeneous families made little impact until [[Dahlgren system|Rolf Dahlgren]] (1985), following Huber's lead,{{sfn|Meerow|2002}} developed a system incorporating new information, including [[synapomorphy|synapomorphic characters]] (i.e., shared characters believed to have evolved from a common ancestor).{{sfn|Rasmussen|1985}} While Cronquist was a "lumper", Dahlgren was a "[[Lumpers and splitters|splitter]]", preferring a larger number of more homogeneous groupings. Where Cronquist saw one family, Dahlgren saw forty distributed over three orders (predominantly [[Liliales]] and [[Asparagales]]), reducing Liliaceae to ten genera (see [[#Tab3|Table 3]]).{{sfn|Walters|Keil|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbaNxSnNoecC&amp;pg=418 Liliaceae p.&amp;nbsp;418]}}{{sfn|Kelch|2002}} Over the 1980s, in the context of a more general review of the classification of [[angiosperms]], the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. By the end of that decade, the [[Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew]], the [[British Museum of Natural History]] and the [[Edinburgh Botanical Gardens]] formed a committee to examine the possibility of separating the family into smaller taxa, at least for the purpose of organizing their [[herbaria]]. That committee finally recommended that 24 new families be created in the place of the original broad Liliaceae, largely by elevating subfamilies to the rank of separate families.{{sfn|Datta|1988}}{{sfn|Mathew|1989}}

The 1990s saw considerable progress in plant [[phylogenetics]] and [[cladistic]] theory, enabling a [[phylogenetic tree]] to be constructed for the flowering plants.{{sfn|Chase et al|1993}} The establishment of major new [[clades]] necessitated a departure from the older but widely used classifications such as Cronquist and Thorne, based largely on morphology rather than genetic data. These developments complicated discussions on plant evolution and necessitated a major taxonomic restructuring.{{sfn|Utech|2003}}{{sfn|APG III|2009}} ''[[rbcL]]'' gene sequencing and cladistic analysis of monocots in 1995 had redefined the Liliales [[Order (biology)|order]]{{sfn|Chase et al.| 1995a}} out of four original morphological orders ''[[sensu]]'' [[Rolf Dahlgren|Dahlgren]]. The largest clade within this redefined Liliales, christened the "core Liliales" representing a now much reduced Liliaceae, had all previously been included in the Liliales, and included three taxonomic groups: (i) Liliaceae ''sensu'' Dahlgren,{{sfn|Rasmussen|1985|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3iGndTFY0skC&amp;pg=PA233 Liliaceae pp.233–238]}} but also both the (ii) [[Calochortaceae]] as defined by [[MN Tamura|Minoro Tamura]] (''[[sensu]]'' Tamura){{sfn|Tamura|1998b}} and (iii) ''Clintonia-Medeola'' which had been included in Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura{{sfn|Tamura|1998b}} (see [[#Tab3|Table 3]]).{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}

This newly, more narrowly (''[[sensu stricto]]'', ''s.s.'') circumscribed Liliaceae, corresponded to the emerging circumscription of the family in the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] system (1998).{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}} While this also corresponded most closely with Dahlgren's circumscription relative to the older much broader (''sensu lato'', ''s.l.'') constructions, it gave rise to some potentially confusing terminology. Compared to the very broad historical ''s.l.'' construction of Liliaceae, the Dahlgren, Tamura and APG constructions were much narrower. These have variously been referred to as "core Liliales" and ''sensu'' APG{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}} for the broadest construction, while the intervening schemes of Tamura and [[Takhtajan]] (who was also a "splitter"){{sfn|APG|1998}} which are narrower have been referred to as Liliaceae ''s.s.'', ''sensu'' Dahlgren, and ''sensu'' Tamura. Of these the narrowest circumscription is that of Dahlgren, including only [[Lilieae]] ''s.l.''.{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}} In modern terminology, while "core Liliales" represents Liliaceae ''sensu'' APG, Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura corresponds to [[Lilioideae]] ''s.l.'', and ''sensu'' Dahlgren with [[Lilieae]] ''s.l.'' or Lilioideae ''s.s.''. [[Calochortoideae]] and [[Streptopoideae]] ''sensu APG'' represent  and [[Calochortaceae]] ''sensu'' Tamura, and ''Clintonia'' plus ''Medeola'' ([[Medeoleae]]) Medeoloideae ''sensu'' Tamura (see [[#Tab3|Table 3]]).{{sfn|Stevens|2015|loc=[http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APWeb/orders/Lilialesweb.htm#Liliaceae Liliaceae]}}

== Modern classification of Liliaceae ==

To meet the need for a thorough revision of the taxonomy of the flowering plants ([[angiosperms]]), [[systematist]]s formed the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] (APG), resulting in a new classification published in 1998.{{sfn|APG|1998}} The scheme was largely based on the work of [[Kåre Bremer]] and colleagues at [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] and [[University of Stockholm|Stockholm]] universities in the late 1970s,{{sfn|Bremer|Wanntorp|1978}}{{sfn|Bremer|Bremer|Thulin|1997}}{{sfn|Williams et al.|2010}} and became universally accessible on the internet in 1996.{{sfn|Bremer|Bremer|2005}}
It was an ordinal system, concentrating on orders rather than families, prioritising [[monophyly]], in which Liliales were recognised as one of ten monocot orders, containing nine families.{{sfn|APG|1998}}  However progress was rapid and the modern era of the taxonomy of the Liliaceae family comes from [[Walter S. Judd|Judd]] and colleagues{{sfn|Judd et al.|2007}} (2002), the [[APG II]] (2003{{sfn|APG II|2003}}) and [[APG III]] (2009{{sfn|APG III|2009}}{{sfn|Chase|Reveal|2009}}), while the Linear APG III assigned it the family number 61.{{sfn|LAPGIII|2009}} The original APG did not specifically address the issues of the [[polyphyly]] within Liliaceae, but APG II did so within the two closely morphologically related orders, Liliales and Asparagales{{sfn|Rudall et al.|2000}} recognising the continued common use of Liliaceae in the broad sense (''[[sensu lato]]'', ''s.l.'').

These studies of [[DNA]] and [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] data (particularly reproductive morphology) together with [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic analyses]], allowed the conclusion that the "[[lilioid monocot|petaloid monocots]]" do not belong to one botanical family but rather are distributed across two separate orders, the [[Asparagales]] and [[Liliales]]. The [[monophyly]] of these newly defined orders is supported by [[cladistic]] analysis based on morphology, [[18S rDNA]], the [[plastid]] [[gene]] ''rbcL'', and other DNA sequences.{{sfn|Chase et al.|2000}}{{sfn|Chase et al.|2006}}{{sfn|Davis et al.|2004}}{{sfn|Graham et al.|2006}}{{sfn|Hilu et al.|2003}}{{sfn|Pires et al.|2006}}{{sfn|Rudall et al.|1997a}}{{sfn|Källersjö et al.|1998}}{{sfn|Fay|2000}}{{sfn|Soltis et al.|2000}}{{sfn|Stevenson et al.|2000}}{{sfn|McPherson|Graham |2001}}{{sfn|Goldblatt|1995}}{{sfn|Stevenson|Loconte|1995}}{{sfn|Vinnersten|Bremer|2001}}{{sfn|Givnish et al.|2005}}{{sfn|Givnish et al.|2006}}{{sfn|Rønsted et al.|2005}}{{sfn|Zomlefer et al.|2001}}

These studies, together with other analyses within each of these two orders, allowed the redistribution of the original genera of Liliaceae ''s.l.'' into a variety of families across the Liliales and Asparagales, as illustrated in [[#Clad1|Cladogram 1]].{{sfn|Soltis et al.|2005}} This redistribution resulted in considerable changes both in the suprafamilial positioning of Liliaceae within the overall APG classification (as shown in Table 1 below), as well as the subfamilial structure (see [[#Suprageneric subdivisions|Suprageneric subdivisions]]).{{sfn|Reveal|2010}}

== Phylogeny ==

The synthesis of molecular data with [[cladistic analysis]] suggests eleven orders of [[monocotyledons]], one of fourteen [[clades]] of [[Angiosperms]], and forming a [[Evolutionary grade|grade]] with six other orders.{{sfn|Meerow|2012}} Sequencing of the ''[[rbcL]]'' and ''trnL-F'' [[chloroplast DNA|plastid genes]] revealed four main Liliales lineages:{{sfn|Rudall et al.|2000}}
# Liliaceae group: [[Liliaceae]] (including some former [[Uvulariaceae]] and [[Calochortaceae]]), [[Philesiaceae]] and [[Smilacaceae]];
# [[Campynemataceae]];
# Colchicaceae group (Colchicoid lilies): [[Colchicaceae]] (including ''Petermannia'' and ''Uvularia''), [[Alstroemeriaceae]] and ''Luzuriaga'';
# [[Melanthiaceae]] (including [[Trilliaceae]]).

The original Liliaceae family in the broad sense (''[[sensu lato]]'', ''s.l.''), which encompassed a large number of differing groups of genera, was highly [[polyphyletic]] (see [[#Clad|Cladogram 1]]). This led to botanists increasingly adopting a more narrow [[monophyletic]] concept, ''i.e.'' strict sense (''[[sensu stricto]]'', ''s.s.'') of the family based on [[molecular phylogenetic]] relationships, as expressed in the 2009 APG III system, rather than the older ''sensu lato'' one. Former members of the Liliaceae are now principally classified in different families and subfamilies of the Liliales and Asparagales as shown in the phylogeny represented in Cladogram I. Other families and orders containing former Liliaceae taxa are the [[Nartheciaceae]] ([[Dioscoreales]]), [[Tofieldiaceae]] ([[Alismatales]]), [[Tecophilaeaceae]] ([[Asparagales]]) and the former [[Uvulariaceae]]. The achlorophyllous (non-[[photosynthesising]])  [[Corsiaceae]] were added to Liliales by APG III in 2009.{{sfn|APG III|2009}}{{sfn|Meerow|2012}}

[[Sequencing]] of the ''[[rbcL]]'' and [[Maturase K|''matK'']] [[chloroplast DNA|chloroplast genes]] of ''Lilium'' and related genera{{sfn|Hayashi|Kawano|2000}} confirmed the [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the family in the ''sensu stricto'' usage of [[Minoru N. Tamura|Tamura]] (1998).{{sfn|Tamura|1998a}} Chloroplast ''[[ndhF]]'' gene sequencing also supported Liliaceae monophyly, reuniting the Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura and Calochortaceae ''sensu'' Tamura (see [[#tab2|Table 2]] &amp; [[#tab3|Table 3]] below).

== Evolution and biogeography ==

The major [[Genetic divergence|diversification]] amongst the [[Angiosperms]] (flowering plants) can be dated to the end of the [[Early Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]] which stretched from 146 to 100 million years ago ([[Mya (unit)|mya]]).{{sfn|Vinnersten|Bremer|2001}}{{sfn|Bremer|2000}}{{sfn|Wikström|Savolainen|Chase|2001}} The development of a phylogenetic approach to taxonomy, starting with [[Charles Bessey]]'s ''[[Bessey system|The phylogenetic taxonomy of flowering plants]]'' (1915) suggested the Liliales formed some of the earliest [[monocots]],{{sfn|Bessey|1915}} with an estimated date of origin of 124&amp;nbsp;mya for the [[stem group|stem node]] (most recent common ancestor of the clade of interest and its [[sister clade]]) age{{sfn|Janssen|Bremer|2004}} and between 117&amp;nbsp;mya{{sfn|Janssen|Bremer|2004}} to 82&amp;nbsp;mya{{sfn|Vinnersten|Bremer|2001}} for the crown node (most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest) age. Molecular analysis suggests that the Liliaceae ''sensu'' APG ("core Liliales") were part of one of four early clades of Liliales, namely [[Campynemataceae]], [[Melanthiaceae]], [[Alstroemeriaceae]] + [[Luzuriagaceae]] + [[Colchicaceae]] and [[Smilacaceae]] + Liliaceae, dated to 68–65&amp;nbsp;mya (stem node) with the separation of the Smilaceae and Liliaceae [[sister clade]]s (crown node) occurring later at around 55–52&amp;nbsp;mya.{{efn|Janssen and Bremer (2004) have somewhat earlier dates of 91 and 80&amp;nbsp;mya respectively but consider these similar within methodological limits{{sfn|Janssen|Bremer|2004}}}}  [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] within the Liliaceae appeared at about 36–34&amp;nbsp;mya, within Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura ([[Lilioideae]] ''s.l.'') at 27&amp;nbsp;mya, Liliaceae ''sensu'' Dahlgren ([[Lilieae]] ''s.s.'' and [[Tulipeae]]) at 20&amp;nbsp;mya ([[Miocene]]).

Within the Liliaceae ''sensu'' Dahlgren there developed two main evolutionary subclades (see [[#Clad2|Cladogram II]] and [[#Tab3|Table 3]]). The first of these, characterised as the Lilieae s.s. (''Lilium, Fritillaria, Nomocharis), Cardiocrinum), Notholirion'') diverged around 12&amp;nbsp;mya. The second subclade was the Tulipeae (''Erythronium, Tulipa''), (''Gagea''). Divergence within ''[[Calochortus]]'' is dated to 7&amp;nbsp;mya. This places the emergence of the Liliaceae at approximately the last ([[Maastrichtian]] period) of the [[Late Cretaceous]] periods (72 to 66&amp;nbsp;mya) to early ([[Paleocene]]) [[Paleogene]] periods (66 to 23&amp;nbsp;mya), formerly the Cretaceous–[[Tertiary]] boundary, 65&amp;nbsp;mya.{{sfn|Vinnersten|Bremer|2001}}{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}{{sfn|Leitch et al.|2007}}

The southern hemisphere intercontinental distributions of Liliales suggests a connection to [[Gondwana]], whose breakup into western (Africa, South America) and eastern (Australia, Antarctica, Madagascar, India) portions occurred at 180–150&amp;nbsp;mya, and the final separation of the western portion into Africa and South America at 80&amp;nbsp;mya coinciding with the emergence of the Liliales. Thus the immediate ancestor of the Liliales is likely to have existed during the period of interconnection of the African and South American-Antarctic-Australian portions of Late Cretaceous Gondwana. While the ancestral clade appears to have been distributed in both northern and southern hemispheres, Liliaceae ''per se'' is [[holarctic]], confined to the northern hemisphere with both Eurasian (including some North African representatives) and North American lineages. It is likely that they originated in North America but were able to expand to Eurasia ~30–40&amp;nbsp;mya via [[Beringia]] that connected the two during the Tertiary period. The presence of genera whIch are restricted to Eurasia suggests a [[vicariance]] (separation of populations by continental division) split between Medeoleae and Lilieae involving Eurasia and North America ([[#Clad2|Cladogram II]]).{{sfn|Vinnersten|Bremer|2001}}

Liliaceae ''sensu'' Dahlgren arose in [[Eurasia]],{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}{{sfn|Vinnersten|Bremer|2001}}{{sfn|Leitch et al.|2007}} while within Liliaceae ''sensu'' Dahlgren the [[Lilieae]] ''s.s.'' subclade arose in the [[Himalayas]] ([[Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau]]), with later [[Evolutionary radiation|radiation]] there in [[montane]] and alpine habitats. Species of ''Lilium'' and ''Fritillaria'' then dispersed into the rest of Eurasia and North America. The second subclade, the Tulipeae arose in [[East Asia]] with subsequent colonisation of North America by ''Erythronium'' and ''Lloydia''. On the other hand, ''Clintonia-Medeola'' ([[Medeoleae]]) may have appeared in North America but subsequently underwent intercontintental dispersal (although some evidence points to a Eurasian origin). The Calochortaceae ''sensu'' Tamura ([[Streptopoideae]] and [[Calochortoideae]]) appears to have evolved in western North America, with subsequent colonisation of East Asia by ''Streptopus'' and the ancestral ''Tricyrtis''.{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}

Liliaceae probably arose as [[shade plants]] in closed shaded habitats, with subsequent evolution of Liliaceae ''sensu'' Dahlgren and ''Calochortus'' to open areas including [[deciduous forest]] in the more open autumnal period, but then a return of some species (e.g. ''Cardiocrinum''). This was accompanied by a shift from rhizomes to bulbs, to more showy flowers, the production of capsular fruit and narrower parallel-veined leaves. Again, some reversal to the broader reticulate-veined leaves occurred (e.g. ''Cardiocrinum'').{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}} In addition such molecular studies show that share characteristics do not necessarily indicate descent from a common ancestor but rather may arise from adaptive [[Convergence (evolution)|convergence]] in similar habitats. {{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}

The fossil record of Liliales is relatively poor,{{sfn|Wilkin|Mayo|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sEfKwaRHQj4C&amp;pg=PA43 p.&amp;nbsp;43]}} but Liliaceae [[fossils]] have been dated to the Paleogene{{sfn|Stilwell|Feldmann|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;162}} and Cretaceous periods in the [[Antarctic]].{{sfn|Goin et al.|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=D0jDXAWyylMC&amp;pg=PA58 West Antarctic Paleoflora p.&amp;nbsp;58]}}{{sfn|Sambamurty|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FrdidPp6HuAC&amp;pg=PA172 p.&amp;nbsp;172]}}{{sfn|Friis et al.|2011}}

== Characteristics ==
{{main|Liliaceae#Description}}

=== Liliaceae ===

The diversity of characteristics complicates description of Liliaceae morphology, and confused taxonomic classification for centuries. The diversity is also of considerable evolutionary significance (see [[#Evolution|Evolution]]).{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}} The Liliaceae family are characterised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or [[rhizomatous]] in the case of [[Medeoleae]]){{sfn|Tamura|1998a}} flowering plants with simple [[trichomes]] (root hairs) and contractile [[root]]s.{{sfn|Spichiger|Perret|2002}} The flowers may be [[inflorescence|arranged]] along the stem, developing from the base, or as a single flower at the tip of the stem, or as a cluster of flowers. They contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics and are symmetric radially, but sometimes as a mirror image. Most flowers are large and colourful, except for Medeoleae. Both the petals and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups (whorls) of "petals", that are often striped or multi-coloured, and produce nectar at their bases. The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is superior, i.e. placed above the attachment of the other parts. There are three fused carpels (syncarpous) with one to three chambers ([[locule]]s), a single style and a three-lobed stigma. The embryo sac is of the ''Fritillaria'' type. The fruit is generally a wind-dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on the stem, but may form a rosette at the base of the stem.

===Subclades===

(See [[#Tab3|Table 3]]). The ten genera (two genera of Table 3 are subsumed into other genera) of the [[Lilioideae]] subfamily are characterised by contractile [[bulb]]s and roots and a [[megagametophyte]] (embryo-sac) of the ''[[Fritillaria]]''-type with four [[megaspore]]s. Within the Lilioideae, the eight genera considered as Liliaceae by Dahlgren (''sensu'' Dahlgren), that is [[Lilieae]] ''s.l.'', are characterised by [[loculicidal]] [[Capsule (botany)|capsules]] and a basic chromosome number x=12. Within this clade, Lilieae ''s.s.'' are characterised by papillose [[tepals]] (with the exception of ''Fritillaria'') and numerous fleshy bulb-scales as well as a morphologically distinct karyotype with two long [[Centromere#metacentric|metacentric]] [[chromosomes]] and 10 [[telocentrics]] of medium length.{{sfn|Gao et al.|2012}} The two genera within Tulipeae are distinguished by pseudo-basifixed [[anthers]] and single bulb scales. The two genera of [[Medeoleae]] are distinguished by having rhizomes instead of bulbs and [[berries]] instead of capsules, and a very unusual form of vesicular-arbuscular [[mycorrhizae]].{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}

The five genera constituting the [[Streptopoideae]] and [[Calochortoideae]] subfamilies form another distinct group, previously characterised under the Calochortoideae alone. These have creeping [[rhizome]]s, styles divided at their apices, and an embryo-sac of the ''[[Polygonum]]''-type with a simple megaspore and triploid [[endosperm]]. At times, these genera were considered as a separate family (Calochortaceae; e.g. Tamura) or even placed in the more heterogeneous [[Uvulariaceae]] ''sensu'' Dahlgren. However most of the latter had low morphological similarity to the Liliaceae, and ''[[Uvularia]]'' and ''[[Disporum]]'' are now classified in the [[Colchicaceae]]. ''Disporum '' contained both Asian and North American species which had always been distinguishable. Following molecular analysis, the North American species were restored to the genus ''[[Prosartes]]'' and retained in Liliaceae, subfamily Streptopoideae, while the Asian species were moved to Colchicaceae.{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}{{sfn|Shinwari et al.|1994}}{{sfn|Simpson|2011}}

== Subdivisions ==

=== Suprageneric subdivisions ===

Due to the diversity of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae (''s.l.''), many attempts have been made to form supageneric classification systems, organizing the genera into [[subfamilies]], [[Tribe (biology)|tribes]], or other suprageneric taxa (taxonomic groupings between genus and family).{{sfn|Peruzzi|Leitch|Caparelli|2009}} By 1813, Candolle recognised five subdivisions which he called tribes (''[[Asparagaceae|Asparagées]]'', ''[[Trilliaceae|Trilliacées]]'', ''[[Asphodeloideae|Asphodelées]]'', ''[[Bromeliaceae|Bromeliées]]'', ''[[Tulipa]]cées''),{{sfn|Candolle|1813|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/88297#page/231/mode/1up Esquisse. D'une Série linéaire et par conséquent artificielle, pour la disposition des familles naturelles du règne végetal p.&amp;nbsp;219]}} all of which Jussieu had made separate families, with the exception of ''Tulipa'', which was a genus within the Liliaceae. By 1845, John Lindley observed that the family had become extremely diverse, ill-defined and unstable, not only by its overall circumscription, but also by its subdivisions. For the 133 genera he included, he described eleven ''suborders''.{{sfn|Lindley|1846|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/32198#page/274/mode/1up Order LXII: Liliaceae - Lilyworts. pp.&amp;nbsp;200–205]}} By the 1870s, as [[John Gilbert Baker|Baker]] describes in his revision of the family, the taxonomy of Liliaceae had become vast and complicated. His approach was to divide the family into eight tribes.{{sfn|Baker|1871}}{{sfn|Baker|1873}}

In 1879, a revision of the North American Liliaceae by [[Sereno Watson]] described sixteen tribes, of which the Lilieae correspond most closely to current concepts of the family,{{sfn|Watson|1879}} [[Bentham and Hooker]] described twenty tribes in 1883, and Engler and Prantl in their [[Engler system|extensive description]] of the Liliaceae in 1899 identified 31 tribes distributed over 11 subfamilies, with Tulipeae and Alieae representing the modern family.{{sfn|Engler|Prantl|1888|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/56456#page/672/mode/1up Engler Liliaceae pp.&amp;nbsp;10–91 ]}} In 1936, [[Franz Buxbaum]] undertook a major revision of the Liliaceae and among others described the subfamily [[Lilioideae]] with three tribes: [[Lloydieae]] (''[[Gagea]]'', ''[[Lloydia]]'' and ''Szechenya'' and ''Giradiella'' — both now included in ''Lloydia''), [[Tulipeae]] (''[[Erythronium]]'', ''[[Tulipa]]'' and ''Eduardoregalia'' — now part of ''Tulipa'') and Lilieae (''[[Korolkowia]]'', ''[[Fritillaria]]'', ''[[Notholirion]]'', ''[[Cardiocrinum]]'', ''Nomocharis'' and ''[[Lilium]]'').{{sfn|Buxbaum|1936}}{{sfn|Buxbaum|1937}}{{sfn|Vinnersten|Reeves|2003}} Hutchinson included most of these genera within the Tulipeae tribe.{{sfn|Hutchinson|1959}} The complex rearrangements of the various genera, tribes and subfamilies over a 30-year period from 1985, discussed by Peruzzi and colleagues (2009),{{sfn|Peruzzi|Leitch|Caparelli|2009}} are partly summarised in [[#tab2|Table 2]] below.

Classifications published since the use of [[molecular phylogenetics]] have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (''s.s.''). In 1998, [[Minoru N. Tamura|Tamura]] considered ''[[Calochortus]]'' sufficiently distinct to elevate the subfamily [[Calochortoideae]] to family status as Calochortaceae,{{sfn|Tamura|1998a}}{{sfn|Tamura|1998b}} resulting in the term Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura to indicate Liliaceae without the Calochortoideae. In 2009, [[Takhtajan]] used an even narrower definition (see [[#tab2|Table 2]] &amp; [[#tab3|Table 3]] below).{{sfn|Takhtadzhi︠a︡n|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oumyfO-NHuUC&amp;pg=PA634 Liliaceae p.&amp;nbsp;634 ]}}

Despite now having established a taxonomic grouping for the Liliaceae family that is genetically monophyletic, compared to the prior longstanding [[polyphyletic]] assemblages under this name,{{sfn|Chase et al.| 1995a}}{{sfn|Chase|Stevenson|Wilkin|Rudall|1995b}} the morphology remains diverse,{{sfn|Tamura|1998a}} and there exists within the Liliaceae clade a number of subclades. There appeared to be two major clades, the first and largest of these consisted of three subclades: ''Clintonia''—''Medeola''—''Gagea'', ''Lilium'' ''Fritillaria''—''Notholirion'', and ''Tulipa—Erythronium''. The second smaller clade, ''Streptopus''—''Tricyrtis'' contained elements of Dahlgren's Uvulariaceae. The position of ''Calochortus'' remained problematic, being considered a sister clade to Liliaceae, as treated by Tamura, but further analysis suggested it was in fact sister to ''Tricyrtis'', although it is now considered separate once again (see [[#Tab3|Table 3]]).{{sfn|Rudall et al.|2000}}{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}{{sfn|Fay et al.|2006}}{{sfn|Kim et al.|2013a}}{{sfn|Kim et al.|2013b}}

Also enigmatic were ''Clintonia'', ''Medeola'', ''Scoliopus'', and ''Tricyrtis''. ''Clintonia'', with a [[disjunct distribution]] involving East Asia and North America, and the closely related ''Medeola'' form a subclades and are now considered a separate tribe (Medeoleae) within the Lilioideae, although at different times they have been considered a separate subfamily (Medeoloideae) or family (Medeolaceae). Sequencing of the ''rbcL ''and ''matK'' chloroplast genes established monophyly for ''Clintonia'', but with separate clades corresponding to the two areas of distribution.{{sfn|Hayashi et al.|2001}} The [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Website]] (APWeb){{sfn|Stevens|2015|loc=[http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APWeb/orders/Lilialesweb.htm#Liliaceae Liliaceae]}} includes four of Takhtajan's families in Liliaceae, recognizing three subfamilies, one of which is divided into two tribes and referred to as Liliaceae ''sensu'' APG III.{{sfn|Mabberley|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFFgAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA489 Liliaceae p.&amp;nbsp;489]}}

=== Genera ===
{{main|List of Liliaceae genera}}

==== Historical treatment ====

Historically, the inclusion of genera within Liliaceae has been extremely broad. Of the various published systems, one of the best known and also the broadest modern circumscription is the [[Cronquist system]] (1981),{{sfn|Cronquist|1981}} which included nearly 300 genera in Liliaceae. Most of these have been reassigned to other families, as shown in the following collapsed list, following [[ITIS]], together with their disposition as APG III transfers to other families and subfamilies, within [[Liliales]] and three other orders, [[Alismatales]], [[Asparagales]] and [[Dioscoreales]]. Current members of Liliaceae are shown in '''bold'''.{{sfn|Chase et al.|2009}}

Various authorities (''e.g.'' [[ITIS]] 16,{{sfn|ITIS|2015|loc=[https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=42633&amp;source=from_print Liliaceae]}} [[Germplasm Resources Information Network|GRIN]] 27,{{sfn|GRIN|2015|loc=[http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/family.pl?652 Liliaceae]}} [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families|WCSP]],{{sfn|WCLSPF|2015|loc=[http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/qsearch.do?plantName=Liliaceae Liliaceae]}} [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]],{{sfn|NCBI|2015|loc=[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=4677 Liliaceae]}} DELTA{{sfn|Watson|Dallwitz|2015|loc=[http://delta-intkey.com/angio/www/liliacea.htm Liliaceae Juss.]}}) differ on the exact number of genera included in Liliaceae ''s.s.'', but generally there are about fifteen to sixteen genera, depending on whether or not ''[[Amana (plant)|Amana]]'' is included in ''[[Tulipa]]'' and ''Lloydia'' in ''[[Gagea]]''. For instance ''Amana'' is still listed separately in WCSP.

The exact subdivision of Liliaceae differs between authors. In 2002 Patterson and Givnish identified two major clades corresponding to Tamura's Calochortaceae and Liliaceae,{{sfn|Tamura|1998a}} but preferred to retain his original division into two separate families rather than the overarching "core Liliales" (Liliaceae ''sensu'' APG). Within Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura they confirmed his decision to include Medeola-Clintonia as a separate subfamily, Medeolioideae, with the remaining genera as subfamily Lilioideae. Liliodeae was then divided into two tribes, Lilieae and Tulipeae (''Tulipa'', ''Erythronium'', ''Gagea'', ''Lloydia''). Within Calochortaceae ''sensu'' Tamura, they proposed erecting a second subfamily, Streptopoideae (''Prosartes'', ''Scoliopus'', ''Streptopus''), with the remaining genera in subfamily Calochortoideae.{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}} Subsequent work by Rønsted ''et al.''(2005){{sfn|Rønsted et al.|2005}} and by Fay ''et al.'' (2006) confirmed the overall phylogenetic relationships of Patterson and Givnish and their subdivisions, and further elucidated the position of ''Gagea'' within the tribe Tulipae, but the latter authors restored the broader circumscription of Liliaceae ''sensu'' APG .{{sfn|Fay et al.|2006}} In 2013, Kim ''et al.'' proposed further subdivision, placing the two genera of Calochortoideae (''Calochortus'' and ''Tricyrtis'') into subfamilies of their own and splitting off ''Gagea'' from the rest of Tulipeae by resurrecting the tribe [[Lloydieae]].{{sfn|Kim et al.|2013a}}{{sfn|Kim et al.|2013b}} (see [[#tab 3|Table 3]])

The best known schema, the [[APWeb]], lists fifteen genera, arranged as follows, and illustrated in Table 4, with three subfamilies, [[Lilioideae]] representing Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura and the two subfamilies of Calochortaceae ''sensu'' Tamura ([[Streptopoideae]] and [[Calochortoideae]]) as proposed by Patterson and Givnish now included within Lilaceae sensu APG.{{sfn|Stevens|2015|loc=[http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APWeb/orders/Lilialesweb.htm#Liliaceae Liliaceae]}}

== Etymology ==
The name Liliaceae was coined by [[Michel Adanson]] in 1763.{{sfn|Adanson|1763|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/6958#page/588/mode/1up VIII Liliaceae p.&amp;nbsp;42–60]}} The name was derived from ''[[Lilium]]'' and the [[Taxonomic rank#Terminations of names|family suffix]] ''-aceae''. ''Lilium'' is the [[type genus]] of the family, which is the [[Latin]] for Lily, which in turn came from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] name for it, ''λείριον'' (leírion).{{sfn|Gledhill|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NJ6PyhVuecwC&amp;pg=PA16 Family names p.&amp;nbsp;16]}}{{sfn|OED|2005}}

'''Timoclea''' or '''Timocleia of Thebes''' is a woman whose story is told by [[Plutarch]] in his ''Life of Alexander'', and at greater length in his ''Mulierum virtutes'' ("Virtues of Women").  According to Plutarch's biography of [[Alexander the Great]], when his forces took [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] during [[Alexander's Balkan campaign]] of 335 BC, [[Thracian]] forces pillaged the city, and a captain of the Thracian forces [[rape]]d Timocleia.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/alexandr.html Plutarch – Life of Alexander]&lt;/ref&gt;  After raping her, the captain asked if she knew of any hidden money.  She told him that she did, and led him into her garden, and told him there was money hidden in her [[Water well|well]].&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;  When the Thracian captain stooped to look into the well, Timoclea pushed him into the well, and then hurled heavy stones into the well until the captain was dead.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;

Timoclea was seized by the Thracian soldiers and brought before Alexander the Great.  She comported herself with great dignity and told Alexander that her brother was Theagenes, last commander of the [[Theban Sacred Band]], who died "for the liberty of Greece" at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] in 338 BC, defeated by Alexander's father [[Philip of Macedon]].  Alexander was so impressed with Timocleia that he ordered her and her children released and she was not punished for killing the Thracian captain.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; 

The story in the ''Mulierum virtutes'' is essentially the same, except that the captain is told that the treasure, of silver bowls, gold and some money, was at the bottom of a dry well, which he climbs down into. When Timoclea hears that he has reached the bottom, she throws down rocks on him. Alexander dismisses her without punishment but does not set her or her family free. He instead tells his officers to take special care of them and other renowned families, making sure there is no more abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F9uCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71 Excerpt in] ''Alexander the Great: A Reader'', Ian Worthington, ed, pp. 70–71, Routledge, {{ISBN|1134435924}}, 9781134435920; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0208%3Achapter%3D24 Example 24 in the ''Mulierum virtutes'']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Timoclée et Alexandre, Domenichino (Louvre INV 796) 02.jpg|thumb|Timoclea before [[Alexander the Great]], painting by [[Domenichino]], c. 1615, [[Louvre]].]]

Plutarch's main source for the incident, as he mentions in passing elsewhere, was the account by [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia]],&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, N. G. L., ''Sources for Alexander the Great: An Analysis of Plutarch's "Life" and Arrian's "Anabasis Alexandrou"'', pp. 154–155, 2007, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521714710}}, 9780521714716[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gay_i14p9oEC&amp;pg=PA154 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; who knew Alexander well; this survives only in quotations by others, which may not all be accurate.  The taking of Thebes took place in the second year of Alexander's reign, and was otherwise a very bloody affair, as the city was the leader in a Greek revolt, taking advantage of Philip's assassination, against the treaties he had enforced.  Perhaps 6,000 Thebans died, and 30,000 were enslaved, and the city virtually ceased to exist for some decades.  The only other act of clemency recorded is that Alexander ordered the house and descendants of the poet [[Pindar]] (died c. 443 BC) to be left alone.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Thomas R., Blackwell, Christopher W., ''Alexander the Great: The Story of an Ancient Life'', pp. 48–50, 2012, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1139576534}}, 9781139576536, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4_MgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Timoclea was a rare subject in art from the Renaissance onwards, never becoming a regular subject in the range of incidents showing classical and biblical female violence against men known as the [[Power of Women]] [[literary topos|topos]].  But she featured in cycles on the ''Life of Alexander'', and there was an increasing tendency in court art to depict Alexander as a proxy for the actual monarch, and to emphasize acts of generosity or mercy.&lt;ref&gt;Aghion I., Barbillon C., Lissarrague, F., ''Gods and Heroes of Classical Antiquity'', Flammarion Iconographic Guides, pp. 30–31, 1996, {{ISBN|2080135805}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most depictions show her brought before Alexander, which might form part of a cycle illustrating his life.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 12&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the case in the cycle of [[fresco]]s painted in the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] in the 1540s by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] and his team.  This was in the bedroom of [[Francis I of France|Francois I's]] mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly|the Duchess of Étampes]] (1508–1580), and a total of eleven compositions surviving today are known from surviving paintings or prints or drawings.  The cycle showed the life of Alexander, but with little emphasis on his military career. This was one of the three subjects from the cycle [[etching|etched]] as a print by [[Léon Davent]].&lt;ref&gt;Boorsch, Suzanne, in: Jacobson, Karen (ed), (often wrongly cat. as [[George Baselitz]]), ''The French Renaissance in Prints'', pp. 256–257, 1994, Grunwald Center, UCLA, {{ISBN|0962816221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unusually in this subject, but rather typically for the First [[School of Fontainebleau]], Timoclea is naked when brought to Alexander. 

Here and in other depictions, the subject was given a composition similar to ones of the much more common ''[[The Continence of Scipio]]''; the subject likewise emphasized the magnamimity of the commander.  Timoclea sometimes accompanied the ''Continence'' in a series,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2010/important-old-master-paintings-and-sculpture-n08610/lot.177.html "Giovanni Battista Gaulli, called Il Baciccio ''The Continence of Scipio''], [[Sotheby's]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also capable of being confused with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=715754&amp;partId=1 British Museum, Drawing Cat. 1860,0616.118], by [[Perino del Vaga]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard de Montfaucon]] paired the two stories as his "Examples of the clemency and continence of conquerors" in a book of 1724.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-b_ojfBm3EQC&amp;pg=PT122&amp;lpg=PT122 ''Supplement au livre de l'antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures: tome quatrième: qui comprend la guerre, les ponts, les aqueducs, la navigation, les phares &amp; les tours octogones''], Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

As the ''Life of Alexander'' was a popular subject, the story of Timoclea probably would have been more a popular element if there had not been a grander and less sordid competitor in the form of [[The Family of Darius before Alexander]], best known from [[The Family of Darius before Alexander|Veronese's painting in London]], which was normally included in cycles, and also showed Alexander being generous to women captives brought before him.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most influential image of Timoclea's story, judging by copies in prints for two centuries after,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=timoclea British Museum search]&lt;/ref&gt; was the painting by [[Domenichino]] of c. 1615, which was in the French royal collection from the time of [[Louis XIV]], and then the [[Louvre]].  Unlike most depictions, this shows her children prominently.  A very different composition, showing only one and a half figures, with the Thracian disappearing upside down into the well, first appears in an [[engraving]] of 1629–30 by [[Matthäus Merian]], a book illustration for a popular German world history by [[Johann Ludwig Gottfried]].  This was later adapted in an oil painting by [[Elisabetta Sirani]].&lt;ref&gt;Golahny, Amy, [https://www.lycoming.edu/art/amy/Golahny-Timoclea-SOURCE-2011.pdf 1 "Elisabetta Sirani’s Timoclea and Visual Precedent", ''Source'', 30, 2011, 37–42 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later literature==
A play, now lost, called ''Timoclea at the Siege of Thebes'' was performed at [[Hampton Court Palace]] before [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and the English court at [[Candlemas]] 1574, on February 2 (this was five years before the influential English translation of Plutarch by [[Thomas North]] was published). The author is unknown, and the performers were boys from the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylor's School, London]], directed by their master [[Richard Mulcaster]].&lt;ref name=lost&gt;[https://www.lostplays.org/lpd/Timoclea_at_the_Siege_of_Thebes Lost Plays Database], University of Melbourne, "Timoclea at the Siege of Thebes", Anon. (1574) &lt;/ref&gt;  They were one of a number of [[Boy player#Children's companies|companies of boy players]] active in [[English Renaissance theatre]] in London.  The performance and its expenses was recorded in the accounts of the [[Master of the Revels]], and from the number of children's gloves paid for may have included twenty four performers.  It may not have been a great success, as the [[masque]] prepared to follow it, with ladies "with lightes being vj vertues" was "not showen for the Tediusnesse of the playe that nighte."&lt;ref name=lost/&gt;

Timoclea also appears in ''Gynaikeion or Nine Books of Various History Concerning Women'' by [[Thomas Heywood]], 1624, and as a minor character in [[John Lyly]]'s play  ''[[Campaspe (play)|Campaspe]]'',&lt;ref name=lost/&gt; a comedy also performed by boy players.  According to this, Timoclea and [[Campaspe]] were both captives at Alexander's conquest of Thebes, and are brought together before Alexander, where Timoclea's aristocratic dignity contrasts with Campaspe's self-description as "a humble handmaid to Alexander".&lt;ref&gt;''"Campaspe" and "Sappho and Phao": John Lyly", ''The Revels Plays'', eds.

'''Trinity University''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[liberal arts college]] in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. Founded in 1869, its campus is located in the [[Monte Vista Historic District]] adjacent to [[Brackenridge Park]]. The campus is three miles north of downtown San Antonio and the [[San Antonio River Walk|River Walk]] and six miles south of the [[San Antonio International Airport]]. The student body consists of approximately 2,300 undergraduate and 200 graduate students. Trinity offers 42 [[College major|majors]] and 57 minors among 6 degree programs&lt;ref name="Fast Facts"/&gt; and has an endowment of $1.24 billion, the 85th largest in the country,&lt;ref name=NACUBO/&gt; which permits it to provide resources typically associated with much larger colleges and universities.

Trinity is a member institution of the [[Annapolis Group]], a consortium of national independent colleges that share a commitment to [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts values and education]], and the [[Associated Colleges of the South]], 16 southern liberal arts colleges that collaborate on staff and curricular enhancements.

== History ==
[[File:Trinity University Banner.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Trinity University Banner]]
[[Cumberland Presbyterian Church|Cumberland Presbyterian]]s founded Trinity in 1869 in [[Tehuacana, Texas]]  from the remnants of three small Cumberland Presbyterian colleges that had lost significant enrollment during the [[Texas in the Civil War|Civil War]]. [[John Boyd (Texas Congressman)|John Boyd]], who had served in the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]] from 1836 to 1845 and in the [[Texas Senate]] from 1862 to 1863, donated 1,100 acres of land and financial assistance to establish the new university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Cecil, Jr. |last=Harper |title=BOYD, JOHN |encyclopedia=Handbook of Texas Online |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbo59 |date=2010-06-12 |publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]] |access-date=2014-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Elizabeth LeNoir |last=Jennett |title=Biographical Directory of the Texan Conventions and Congresses, 1832-1845 |date=1942 |pages=54–55 |url=http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/members/bios/Bio_Directory_Texas_Convs_Congresses_1832-1845.pdf#page=49 |access-date=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Second Trinity University Campus 1.JPG|250px|thumb|Former Trinity University campus in [[Waxahachie, Texas]]]]
Believing that the school needed the support of a larger community, the university moved in 1902 to [[Waxahachie, Texas]]. In 1906, the university, along with many Cumberland Presbyterian churches, affiliated with the [[United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|United Presbyterian Church]]. The [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]], however, severely hindered the university's growth. Enrollment declined sharply, indebtedness and faculty attrition mounted, and trustees began using endowment funds to maintain daily operations. Consequently, the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] placed Trinity's accreditation status on probation in 1936, jeopardizing its future. Once again, its leaders began to consider relocation to a larger community to improve the university's viability.

Meanwhile, in 1942, the [[Methodist Church (USA)|Methodist]]-affiliated [[University of San Antonio]] was failing. San Antonio community leaders, who wished to maintain a [[Protestant]]-affiliated college in the city, approached Trinity with a relocation offer. The university left Waxahachie and took over the campus and alumni of the University of San Antonio. (The old Waxahachie campus is currently home to [[Southwestern Assemblies of God University]]). For the next decade the Woodlawn campus, on the city's near-west side, was Trinity's home while it developed a permanent home. Lacking adequate facilities, the university functioned by using military [[barracks]] and [[Quonset hut]]s to house students and to provide library and classroom space.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/about-us/trinity-history |title=Trinity University History |website=Trinity University |access-date=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Trinity acquired a former [[limestone]] [[quarry]] for a new campus and hired Texas [[architect]] [[O'Neil Ford]] to design a master plan and many of the buildings. Construction began in 1950, and the current campus opened in 1952.

When it moved, the campus was largely undeveloped (one classroom building, one dorm, and a nearly empty library were the only completed buildings).&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Yet, under the leadership of Dr. James W. Laurie, the university's 14th president, Trinity took advantage of its new location in a rapidly growing major urban center to grow in academic stature.  Dr. Laurie was responsible for drastically increasing Trinity's endowment, largely funded by the [[James A. Chapman|James A. and Leta M. Chapman]] Charitable Trust of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Donald E. |last=Everett |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kbt32| title=TRINITY UNIVERSITY |encyclopedia=The Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogersandbell.com/Trusts.aspx |title=Chapman Charitable Trusts - Preserving the Legacy of the Chapman Trusts |website=Rogers and Bell |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stronger endowment allowed Trinity to construct a new, modern campus on its “University on the Hill” location and to increase the quality and range of its faculty while maintaining a high faculty to student ratio. In 1969 Trinity entered into a covenant agreement with the regional synod of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] that affirmed historical connections, but transformed Trinity into a private, independent university with a self-perpetuating board of trustees. The campus continues to be a "historically connected" member of the [[Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities]].

Trinity's growth continued under Ronald Calgaard, who followed Laurie's successor, Duncan Wimpress. Under Dr. Calgaard, the university implemented a number of changes to raise its profile. For example, Trinity transformed into a residential undergraduate school, requiring all freshmen to live on campus and cutting the number of master's programs offered from more than twenty to four. As well, Trinity decreased its student population from about 3,300 to 3,000 (and eventually to 2,700), increased merit scholarships, increased the focus on national student recruitment, and began scheduling a strong series of speakers and cultural events open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617073736/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1987_454397/trinity-university-stakes-its-future-on-recruiting.html|title=Trinity University stakes its future on recruiting intelligence 04/05/1987 - Archives - Chron.com - Houston Chronicle|date=17 June 2012|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calgaard's successor, [[John R. Brazil]], focused on replacing outdated campus buildings and improving the school's financial resources.  The "Campaign for Trinity University", which launched in September 2005, sought to raise US $200 million for a variety of purposes.  At its conclusion on September 25, 2009, the Campaign raised $205.9 million, surpassing the original goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/development/campaign/news_events/0909_campaign_conclusion.htm |date=2009-09-25 |title=Trinity University’s Capital Campaign Totals $205.9 Million |publisher=Trinity University |accessdate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222024740/http://www.trinity.edu/departments/development/campaign/news_events/0909_campaign_conclusion.htm |archivedate=February 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Brazil served as Trinity's President in through January 2010. Upon announcement of his retirement, the Board of Trustees awarded him Trinity's Distinguished Service Award, Trinity's most prestigious honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first=Sharon Jones |last=Schweitzer  |url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/news_releases/090123brazilretire.htm |title=Trinity University President Announces Retirement in 2010 |publisher=Trinity University |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dennis A. Ahlburg]] served as president from January 2010 to January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first=Sharon Jones |last=Schweitzer  |url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/news_releases/090925_ahlburg.htm |title=Trinity University Selects 18th President |publisher=Trinity University |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Ahlburg's presidency, Trinity developed and executed a strategic plan to shape the future of the university. Academically, Trinity refined its curriculum in order to further define a liberal arts education, developed an entrepreneurship program, and realigned the business program. As well, Trinity refocused its marketing to raise the university's national profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.trinity.edu/news/university-president-step-down-2015 | title=University President to Step Down in 2015 | publisher=Trinity University | date=2014-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, under Ahlburg, Trinity built the Center for Sciences and Innovation, which modernized and combined science facilities to ease collaboration across disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.trinity.edu/news/university-president-step-down-2015 |title=University President to Step Down in 2015|publisher=Trinity University |date=May 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danny J. Anderson, a Latin American literature scholar and dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the [[University of Kansas]], succeeded Ahlburg as president in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first=Sharon Jones |last=Schweitzer  |url=http://new.trinity.edu/news/trinity-university-selects-19th-president |title=Trinity University Selects 19th President |publisher=Trinity University |date=2014-12-15 |access-date=2015-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President Michael Fischer served as the interim president.

=== Strategic plan ===
In 2011, Trinity undertook the development of a comprehensive ten-year strategic plan, ''Trinity Tomorrow'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://strategicplan.trinity.edu/|website=Trinity University |title=Trinity Tomorrow |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure the long-term sustainability of the university. The board of trustees approved the plan in May 2013, which details four strategic objectives:
*Strengthen opportunities for experiential learning
*Foster productive collisions as a defining characteristic
*Enhance students international engagement and awareness
*Maximize the educational and personal benefits of a residential liberal arts university

and four foundations in order to achieve them:
*Strengthen market position and improve student recruitment
*Be an innovative leader for excellence in teaching and research
*Improve alumni relations, engagement, and giving
*Build the infrastructure to support a 21st-century university

Administrators have begun enacting the details of the plan with positive outcomes. Among other highlights, Trinity:
*adopted a new curriculum;
*increased its marketing locally and nationally; 
*launched centers to focus on college success, experiential learning and career preparedness, and international citizenship;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://new.trinity.edu/news/trinity-launches-three-strategic-centers|website=Trinity University |title=Trinity Launches Three Strategic Centers |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
*launched the Tiger Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://new.trinity.edu/live|website=Trinity University |title=Tiger Network |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase access to campus events via the Internet.

=== Notable buildings and structures ===
[[File:Murchison Tower, Trinity University.JPG|125px|thumb|Murchison Tower]]
* The {{convert|166|ft|m|0|adj=on}} tall Murchison Tower is the most dominant landmark on the campus, designed, as many other buildings on campus, by [[O'Neil Ford]], who also designed San Antonio Landmark the [[Tower of the Americas]] a few years later based on this design. It was previously the highest point in San Antonio. The tower is now lit at night (excepting evenings when the lighting interferes with on-campus astronomical observances), a tradition begun on September 22, 2002 to commemorate Trinity's 60th anniversary in San Antonio.&lt;ref name=Traditions/&gt;
[[File:Laurie Auditorium, Trinity University.JPG|170px|left|thumb|[[Laurie Auditorium]]]]
* [[Laurie Auditorium]] seats 2,865 and hosts both campus and community events. The university has many lecture series, such as the high-profile Trinity Distinguished Lecture Series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/about-us/our-facilities/laurie-auditorium |title=Laurie Auditorium |website=Trinity University |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stieren Arts Enrichment Series, Nobel Economists Lecture Series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trinity.edu/nobel/ |title=Nobel Economists Lecture Series |website=Trinity University |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Flora Cameron Lecture on Politics and Public Affairs.

[[File:Library, Trinity University.JPG|170px|thumb|Coates Library]]
* The {{convert|164000|sqft|m2|-2|adj=on}} Elizabeth Huth Coates Library houses more than 1 million books and bound periodical volumes. The library, an advanced facility for a school of Trinity's size, also houses over 200,000 volumes of government documents, over 1.3 million microforms, over 65,000 media items, and maintains 2,400 periodical subscriptions and access to over 20,000 electronic periodicals. The library's annual acquisition budget is over US $1.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.trinity.edu/libinfo/factsheet.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506023002/http://lib.trinity.edu/libinfo/factsheet.pdf |date=May 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the library was awarded the Excellence in Academic Libraries Award from the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]] (ACRL). Sponsored by ACRL and Blackwell's Book Services, the award recognizes the staff of a college library for programs that deliver exemplary services and resources to further the educational mission of the institution&lt;ref name="trinity.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/about_trinity/profile.htm |title=Trinity Facts |website=Trinity University |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, the Ruth Taylor Fine Arts Center, consisting of the Jim and Janet Dicke Art Building, the Campbell and Eloise Smith Music Building, and the Ruth Taylor Recital Hall was substantially renovated under the guidance of [[Kell Muñoz Architects]], providing 20,000 additional square feet of space.

== Academics and rankings ==
[[File:Trinity University Sign.png|thumb|150px|left]]
As defined by the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|Carnegie Foundation]]'s classification, Trinity University is a small, highly residential university with a majority of enrollments coming from undergraduate students. The full-time, four-year undergraduate program is classified as "more selective, lower transfer-in" and has an arts and sciences focus with some graduate student coexistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup_listings/view_institution.php?unit_id=229267 |title=Trinity University |website=Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Learning |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and is a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. Full-time undergraduate tuition is $39,560; room and board are $12,754 for 2016-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.trinity.edu/admissions-aid/tuition-fees |title=Tuition &amp; Fees |website=Trinity University |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academics ===
Trinity offers 47 majors and 59 minors in the traditional [[liberal arts]], business, [[Natural science|sciences]], [[fine arts]], and [[engineering]], and graduate programs in [[accounting]], [[teaching]], [[school psychology]], [[Academic administration|school administration]], and [[health care|health care administration]].&lt;ref name="Fast Facts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/about-us/fast-facts |title=Fast Facts |website=Trinity University |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity stresses close interaction between students and faculty members across all disciplines, with a 9:1 student/faculty ratio. The full-time faculty numbers 228, 98% of whom hold a [[Ph.D]]. or other terminal degree in their field.  About 47% of the student body has studied abroad, in over 35 countries.

All undergraduates must demonstrate proficiency across a broad range of academic disciplines, regardless of major. At its core, the Common Curriculum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inside.trinity.edu/student-success/advising/common-curriculum |website=Inside Trinity |title=Common Curriculum |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides the liberal arts foundation for all undergraduate degrees awarded by Trinity. The Common Curriculum consists of the following components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/x28972.xml |title=Courses of Study 2013-14 |website=Trinity University |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The First-Year Experience (FYE) Program'''''
Starting in fall 2015, all first-year students must complete a 6-credit hour course in their first semester that meets five days a week. The FYE consists of a writing workshop, discussion seminar, and a common day where everyone from the different sections meet for guest speakers, student conferences, or library sessions to assist students in the research process.

'''''Foreign Language, Computer, and Mathematics Skills'''''
*Foreign Languages 
Trinity students must reach a minimum level of competence corresponding to that attained after successful completion of the first semester of the second year of college foreign language study. Students may waive this requirement if they completed the appropriate high school courses. An international baccalaureate course at standard level with a 6 or 7 will suffice. 
*Computer Skills
Students must be able to use computers to collect, organize, analyze and communicate information in an academic environment. Students who do not pass a test demonstrating these competencies must fulfill this requirement by completing an approved course built around these criteria.
*Mathematics 
Trinity requires completion of three years of high school mathematics, including either trigonometry or precalculus, for admission as a first-year student. While there is no further requirement, all students are urged to undertake further study of mathematics at Trinity.

40 percent of students attend graduate school immediately after earning their bachelor's, and 65 percent of all students attend within five years of graduation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.trinity.edu/Documents/student_affairs_docs/Career_Services_docs/Data/11_Graduating_Student_Survey.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121033620/http://web.trinity.edu/Documents/student_affairs_docs/Career_Services_docs/Data/11_Graduating_Student_Survey.pdf |date=January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis by the Office of Institutional Research indicated that Trinity has made considerable progress in the number of graduates going on to earn doctoral degrees. Of students earning a bachelor's between 1982 and 1986, 2.9% went on to earn doctorates; of those earning a bachelor's between 1997 and 2001, 8.5% had. Trinity improved its ranking in this category from 328th to 38th among other colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/x402.xml |website=Trinity University |title=Office of Institutional Research |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trinity fields strong teams, evidenced by its finishes in the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]] (NACDA) Learfield Directors' Cup, which recognizes the strength of athletic programs by division. Since the Directors' Cup inception in 1995, Trinity has finished in the top 10 on five occasions out of over 400 [[NCAA Division III|Division Ill]] programs; it finished 31st in 2017-18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/nacda/sports/directorscup/auto_pdf/2017-18/misc_non_event/May31overallDIII_final.pdf |title=Directors' Cup Division III Final Standings|website=NACDA |date=2018-05-31 |accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trinity has historically had a strong [[tennis]] program. In 1963, Al G. Hill, Jr, grandson of oilman H L Hunt, entered as a Freshman Tennis Player.  When he graduated in 1967 as Tiger Captain, the College Tennis Courts were named after him. Under the tutelage of Coach Clarence Mabry, Trinity Player [[Chuck McKinley]] won the Wimbledon Singles Championship in 1963 and was rated the #1 men's Singles Player in the World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Time Magazine |title=One for the Yanks |date=1963-07-12 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940309,00.html |access-date=2015-06-13 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; With partner [[Dennis Ralston]], McKinley won the US Men's Doubles Championship in 1961, 1963, and 1964. McKinley and Ralston also played all of the matches while winning the Davis Cup for the US in 1963.  All of these accomplishments occurred while McKinley was a Trinity undergraduate.

In 1970, as a Freshman at Trinity, [[Brian Gottfried]] won the [[United States Tennis Association|USTA]] boys 18s Singles Championship, as well as the Doubles Championship with [[Sandy Mayer|Alexander Mayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ustaboys.com/tournament/past_winners.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100637/http://ustaboys.com/tournament/past_winners.php|archivedate=2007-09-29|accessdate=24 April 2014|title=USTA Boys 18 &amp; 16: Past Winners}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 Trinity won the NCAA Division I Men's Tennis Championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/Hall_of_Fame/stockton.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205070944/http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/Hall_of_Fame/stockton.htm |date=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tiger Captain that year, [[Dick Stockton]], won the NCAA Men's Singles Championship.

'''William Seifriz''' (August 11, 1888 &amp;ndash; July 13, 1955) was a Professor of Biology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and an important figure in the history of [[plant physiology]] and [[plant]] [[cell biology]].

==Personal life==

William Seifriz was born on August 11, 1888 outside of Washington, D.C. to Paul Seifriz M.D. and his wife, both of whom emigrated from Germany in 1887. After Paul Seifriz died, Seifriz' mother ran a boarding house for scientists from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. This association with botanists led the young Seifriz to pursue the study of botany. After graduating [[McKinley Technical High School]] in 1907 as [[valedictorian]], he worked as a laboratory assistant in the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], working on experimental electroculture. After working as a laboratory assistant for three years, he spent one year as a practical student in a shipyard in [[Bremen, Germany]]. After returning to America, he spent one year studying law at [[Georgetown University]]. Realizing that science would be a worthwhile way for him to accomplish his life's work, he entered [[The Johns Hopkins University]] where he was awarded a B.S. ''[[honoris causa]]'' in 1917 and earned a Ph.D. in [[botany]] in 1920. After graduation, Seifriz went to [[Geneva, Switzerland]] to study cell physiology with [[Robert Hippolyte Chodat]].  He continued to do research at [[Imperial College London]] and [[King's College London]] in England. Then Seifriz joined [[Herbert Freundlich]] at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] to learn the techniques he would need to understand the physical properties of [[protoplasm]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kamiya|first1=Noburô |title=In Memoriam William Seifriz|journal=Protoplasma|date=1956|volume=45|issue=4|pages=513–524|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01252673?view=classic#page-1|accessdate=September 14, 2016|doi=10.1007/bf01252673}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freundlich, H. and W. Seifriz|title=Über die Elastizität von Solen und Gelen|journal=Z. Phys. Chem.|date=1923|volume=104|issue=3/4|pages=233–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seifriz spent time with [[Ernest Rutherford]], [[Jacobus van't Hoff]], [[Svante Arrhenius]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Max Planck]], [[Walther Nernst]] and [[Max von Laue]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seifriz|first1=William|title=A New University|journal=Science|volume=120|issue=3107|pages=87–91|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/120/3107/87|accessdate=September 14, 2016|doi=10.1126/science.120.3107.87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 when he was head of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] botanical laboratories, he led an expedition to the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] mountains in Colombia to collect and study flora there.&lt;ref&gt;"19,000-Foot Snow-Capped Peak Goal of Expedition Hunting New Flora in South American Wilderness." Philadelphia Record July 28, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seifriz held 'Philosophical Meetings' at his home ''Seifriziana'' to which he invited artists, musicians, scientists, medical doctors, psychologists, and other intellectuals. He loved animals and kept birds, monkeys, donkeys, cats, rabbits, peacocks and a dog. He also collected French porcelain and Italian bronze. He did not have a telephone.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Glorious handful| journal=Time |volume=30 |issue=33 |page=29|date=December 6, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Seifriz married Myra George when he was 64.

Seifriz died on July 13, 1955 while collecting botanical specimens near the Chesapeake Bay.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

William Seifriz was an Associate Editor for the journal Protoplasma from its founding in 1926 to his death in 1955. He was also an Associate Editor of [[Journal of Colloid Science]] and Biodynamica.

==University life==

Seifriz was a Seessel Fellow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anon|title=Catalog of Yale University (1921-1922) Eighteenth Series, Number 16|date=1922|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=444|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Yale University]] from 1922 to 1923. He became an instructor at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1923 and came to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] as a National Research Fellow in 1924 and became a professor of protoplasmatology and [[plant geography]] in 1925.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Research==

Seifriz was a [[naturalist]] and a laboratory scientist who studied the viscoelastic properties and microscopic structure of [[protoplasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dietrich|first1=Michael R.|title=Explaining the "Pulse of Protoplasm": The Search for Molecular Mechanisms of Protoplasmic Streaming.|journal=Journal of Integrative Plant Biology|date=2015|volume=57|issue=1|pages=14–22|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jipb.12317/abstract|accessdate=September 14, 2016|doi=10.1111/jipb.12317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Loose Protoplasm" has Rhythmic Flow of Higher Life Tissue|url=https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/cgi-bin/colorado?a=d&amp;d=ADT19371202.2.63#|accessdate=September 19, 2016|agency=Aspen Daily Times (December 2, 1937)|issue=page 7|publisher=Colorado Historic Newspapers Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a [[micromanipulator]] and [[microdissection]], Seifriz showed that protoplasm was [[non-Newtonian]], [[thixotropic]] and [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wayne|first1=Randy|title=Plant Cell Biology: From Astronomy to Zoology|date=2009|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_biw80LgjwC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;dq=plant+cell+biology+from+astronomy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pUUSyYOa2l&amp;sig=LsATJCrd-aqLaGbLCYe9vB1Zm68&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwins63hmY_PAhULaD4KHa0KBYkQ6AEIODAE#v=onepage&amp;q=plant%20cell%20biology%20from%20astronomy&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seifriz proposed that the physical properties of protoplasm were a consequence of long chain molecules attached to one another like a brush heap. Seifriz studied the streaming protoplasm of the slime mold [[Physarum polycephalum]] and coined the word, ''protoplasmatologist'' for someone who studies the properties of living protoplasm. Seifriz' expertise ranged from physics to philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seifriz|first1=William|title=A materialistic interpretation of life|journal=Philosophy of Science|date=1939|volume=6|issue=3|pages=266–284|doi=10.1086/286557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seifriz's work appeared in ''[[Time Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal|title= The pulse of protoplasm|journal=Time |volume=36 |issue=22 |page=46|date=November 24, 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Seifriz' book, ''Protoplasm'', E. O. Kraemer wrote, "Professor Seifriz is a versatile scientist. His work on emulsions, gels, and other colloid topics is well known among chemists and physicists, but they may not be aware that Professor Seifriz is a member of a botany department and is an active investigator in botany and biology. Professor Seifriz's general attitude toward science, and, in particular, his point of view in his book is typified by the quotation from Descartes with which he introduces his preface: If, therefore, anyone wishes to search out the truth of things in serious earnest, he ought not to select one special science; for all the sciences are conjoined with each other and interdependent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraemer|first1=E. O.|title=Protoplasm. By William Seifriz|journal=J. Phys. Chem.|date=1937|volume=41|issue=2|pages=341–342|doi=10.1021/j150380a028|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/j150380a028|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Seifriz' book, ''The Structure of Protoplasm'', C. A. Shull described it as "One of the most important summaries of protoplasmic structure in the English language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shull|first1=C. A.|title=The Structure of Protoplasm: William Seifriz|journal=Botanical Gazette|date=1942|volume=103|issue=3|pages=630–631|doi=10.1086/335080|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/335080|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This gifted young man had done postgraduate work in botany at Tokyo's Imperial University, was studying at Giessen in Germany in the fateful summer of 1939. When Germany invaded Poland, the Japanese Government ordered Kamiya to get out. Not stopping for books or clothing, he left posthaste for the U. S. by way of Hamburg and Bergen. He wrote to Dr. Seifriz, asking if he could go to work in his laboratory. Seifriz welcomed him. "First thing I did," Seifriz recalls, "was to lend him a raincoat." Kamiya still has it"''.''&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

==Teaching==

In his lectures in ''Physics and Chemistry of Protoplasm'', Seifriz gave not only the facts, but the background of the subject and the ''lines of thought by which the discoveries have come about''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; When he lectured on ''Plants and Climates'', he showed slides of photographs that he took while on his many botanical trips throughout the world.
