'''''A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts''''', also known as '''''Lorenzo Tornabuoni Presented by Grammar to Prudentia and the other Liberal Arts''''' or '''''Lorenzo Tornabuoni Being Introduced to the Liberal Arts''''' ({{lang-it|Giovane Introdotto tra le Arti Liberali}}), is a painting by the Italian [[Renaissance]] painter [[Sandro Botticelli]], circa 1483-1486. The painting and its companion piece, [[Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman (Botticelli)|''Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman'']], originally decorated Villa Lemmi, a country villa near [[Florence]] owned by [[Giovanni Tornabuoni]], uncle of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] and head of the Roman branch of the [[Medici]] Bank. They were probably commissioned for the 1486 wedding of Giovanni's son Lorenzo to Giovanna of the [[Albizzi]] family, and are therefore thought to depict the two.&lt;ref name=deimlink&gt;{{cite book|title=Sandro Botticelli 1444/5 - 1510|last=Deimling|first=Barbara|publisher=Taschen|location=Cologne, Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjHEhT5wRiwC|year=2007|isbn=978-3-8228-5992-6|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts'' depicts a young man, perhaps Lorenzo Tornabuoni, led by a personification of [[Grammar]] into a circle of allegorical figures representing the [[Seven Liberal Arts]]. Presided over by [[Prudence|Prudentia]], the circle also includes [[Rhetoric]], [[Logic]], [[Arithmetic]], [[Geometry]], [[Astronomy]] and [[Music]], each recognizable by means of various attributes. In antiquity, the liberal arts denoted the education worthy of a free person and the painting therefore testifies to the young man's broad education. The figure of Arithmetic is seen holding its hand out in greeting to the young man. Tornabuoni, a scion to a banking family, would have probably had an education focused on numbers.&lt;ref name=deimlink/&gt;

Both paintings were discovered at Villa Lemmi in 1873 under a coat of whitewash and removed from their original location. They are currently housed in the [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/activite/detail_parcours.jsp?CURRENT_LLV_PARCOURS%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226925&amp;CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226882&amp;CURRENT_LLV_CHEMINEMENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226882&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302024407&amp;bmLocale=en |title=Thematic Trails : Italian Renaissance Painting - The Allegory of the Liberal Arts |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |publisher=Louvre }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vincent van Gogh in Paris Agostina Segatori.webm|{{largethumb}}|[[Van Gogh Museum]]'s senior researcher Louis van Tilborgh talks about the lesser known aspects of this painting.]]
'''''Agostina Segatori Sitting in the Café du Tambourin''''' was painted by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in 1887.  [[Agostina Segatori]] owned the [[Café du Tambourin]] that Van Gogh knew intimately.  It was a gathering spot for Parisian artists, a place where their work was exhibited. Van Gogh, unable to pay in cash for his meals, exchanged paintings for his fare.  The paintings then adorned the restaurant.  He held a special exhibit of [[Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)|his Japanese prints]] in the café as well.  His connection with Agostina and the cafe came to a sad end when she went bankrupt and van Gogh's paintings were confiscated by creditors.  This painting, however, demonstrates an artistic discovery that culminated in his unique, creative style not quite on the brink of being understood and revered.

==Van Gogh's influence in Paris==
In 1886 van Gogh left the Netherlands, never to return, for Paris and the guidance of his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]].  He entered Paris as a shy, somber man and while his personality would never change, he emerged artistically into what one critic described as a "singing bird". While van Gogh had been influenced by great Dutch masters, coming to Paris meant that he was influenced by [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], [[Symbolists]], [[Pointillism|Pointillists]], and [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese prints]].  His circle of friends included [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Henri Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]] and others.  The works of Japanese artists [[Hiroshige]] and [[Hokusai]] greatly influenced van Gogh, both for the beautiful subject matter and the style of flat patterns of colors without shadow.  Van Gogh explored the various influences and molded them into a style that was uniquely his own.  In the years 1886 to 1888, van Gogh emerged as a sophisticated, thoughtful and provoking artist. This painting demonstrates his journey of creativity in that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853-1890) | author=Wallace, R | publisher=Time-Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | pages=40, 69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The painting==
In the painting Agostina, a woman in her forties, can be seen smoking a cigarette while having her second glass of beer, evidenced by two saucers under the mug of beer.  In demeanor and style, such as her clothing, make-up and hairstyle, she is a modern woman. She is wearing a fashionable hat.  According to the style at the time, her jacket is a different design than her dress.  A parasol sits on one of the seats next to her.

Van Gogh used the theme of a woman sitting at a small table, introduced by Impressionists, such as [[Edgar Degas]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. The table and stools were in the shape of tambourines, befitting the café's theme. On the wall behind her are [[Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)|van Gogh's Japanese prints]], which he began exhibiting at the café in February 1887.&lt;ref name="VGM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3652&amp;collection=1288&amp;lang=en |title=In the café: Agostina Segatori in Le tambourin, 1887  |author= |date=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam |accessdate=March 18, 2011 | postscript=See the video on the page for more information about the painting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leaf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Galbally"/&gt;

[[File:Van Gogh - Portrait of Pere Tanguy 1887-8.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Portrait of Père Tanguy]],'' 1887]]The brightly colored painting and confident subject represent a shift in Van Gogh's attitude in comparison to his earlier subjects, such as his dark and tragic peasants.  Even more, van Gogh's ''[[Portrait of Père Tanguy]]'' from the fall of the same year further explores his use of color and better promotes his Japanese prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The pursuit of spiritual wisdom: the thought and art of Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin | author=Maurer, N | publisher=Associated University Presses | location=Cranbury | year=1999 | origyear=1998 | page=55 | isbn=0-8386-3749-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wf_PoXKhggkC&amp;pg=PA55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Café du Tambourin==
Van Gogh occasionally visited Café du Tambourin run by Agostina Segatori, the subject of this painting. Previously an artist's model&lt;ref name="VGM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crispino"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh | author=Crispino, E | publisher=Oliver Press, Inc. | location=Minneapolis, MN | origyear=1996 | year=2008 | page=32 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5gPqjJ9Ws4C&amp;pg=PT18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]] and others,&lt;ref name="Leaf"/&gt; the Naples-born Agostina saved the money she earned working as a model and opened the Italian-themed Café du Tambourin in 1885, which particularly catered to artists.&lt;ref name="Galbally"&gt;{{cite book | title=A remarkable friendship: Vincent van Gogh and John Peter Russell | author=Galbally, A | publisher=Melbourne University Publishing | location=Australia | year=2008 | page=153 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXpgapo52p8C&amp;pg=PA153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The café on the [[Boulevard de Clichy]] in Paris was just around the corner from the home that Vincent lived in with his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]]. Besides convenience, the restaurant was notable to Van Gogh as a venue for exhibition of his paintings, a practice initiated by artists such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Paul-Albert Besnard]] and others.&lt;ref name="Leaf"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Table: At the Auberge Ravoux | first1=A | last1=Leaf | first2=F | last2=Lebain | publisher=Artisan | location=New York | year=2001 | pages=40, 44 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBxJtWUz-CoC&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;f=false | isbn=1-57965-182-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887 van Gogh had several meals a week at the café which were paid in paintings to adorn the restaurant's walls.  He fell in love with Agostina who was twelve years older. Soon after, though, Agostina and the establishment fell on hard times.  She became ill and the business, in debt and likely involved in illegal prostitution, failed.  Although assured by Agostina that van Gogh could claim his paintings, according to Émile Bernard's recollection, debtors sold them&lt;ref name="Leaf"/&gt; "as waste canvas"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853-1890) | author=Wallace, R | publisher=Time-Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | page=70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in batches of 10, ranging in price from 50 [[centimes]] to one [[French franc|franc]] per bundle.&lt;ref name="Leaf"/&gt; Due to the bankruptcy of the cafe van Gogh lost not only the paintings, mostly [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)|still life works]] of flowers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Women: Vincent's Love Affairs and Journey Into Madness | author=Fell, D | publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers | location=New York | year=2004 | page=80 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqSjxGgvVMMC&amp;pg=PA80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also the frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Vincent van Gogh: A Biography   | author=Meier-Graefe, J | publisher=Dover Publications | location=Mineola, New York | year=1987 | page=60 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iw7R8k5GfgMC&amp;pg=PA60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''America 500 Years''''' is the title of a series of paintings created in 1988–91 by [[Nabil Kanso]] in commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America. The works in the series base their subjects on historical events in the Americas over the course of five centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''Nabil Kanso: The Split of Life Paintings'', pp. 103–120, NEV Editions, Atlanta, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''America 500 Years'' series of paintings comprise a wide range of works&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/media.html Approximately 30 works,''Visions from America'']&lt;/ref&gt; including 9 mural-scale paintings executed in oil applied in rhythmic succession of vigorous brushwork infusing patterns and textures of varying density with intense tones of predominantly blue-black figures set against a combination of orange, red, and yellow ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/text.html ''Kanso: America series of paintings'']&lt;/ref&gt;
The compositions divide the canvas space into distinct sections within a planar layout constituting the basis for constructing a scene of separate parts offering variations of viewpoints in their contrast between subject matter and technique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/media.html Visions from America]&lt;/ref&gt; The pictorial organization conveys a volumetric presence of highly condensed images in juxtaposed planes expanding their irregular shaped boundaries near the top of the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/text.html ''America series of paintings'']&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between them is important for an overall understanding of the picture and its meaning.

==Paintings in the series==
1 – '''''Discovery''''' measuring {{convert|3.65|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall and {{convert|4.50|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} wide&lt;ref&gt;''America 500 Years: Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 104–105, NEV Editions, Atlanta, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; depicts the first landing of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the [[New World]] in a scene divided in two parts corresponding to two worlds, one posed by the arrival of Columbus, the other inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/discovery.html ''Discovery: Between Space and Time'']&lt;/ref&gt; At the forefront of the right section stands a figure representing Columbus with a fierce look resting one hand on his sword, the other raising the cross. A silhouetted figure rises behind him with one arm raised and one stretched toward two sails above an assemblage of figures and objects that include a rearing [[horses in warfare|horse]], a figure in body [[armor]], a mariner's [[compass]], [[gunpowder]] and [[cannon]]s alluding to some of the equipments and instruments brought by Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/discovery.html ''Between Space and Time'']&lt;/ref&gt; The left part depicts an eagle and a group of figures that may represent the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] or [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] natives, referred by Columbus as  [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/discovery.html ''Discovery'']&lt;/ref&gt;

2 – '''''Encounter''''' 3.65 × 5.50 meters (12 × 18&amp;nbsp;ft) depicts a scene reflecting the encounter between [[Hernán Cortés]], the Spanish [[conquistador]] and [[Montezuma II|Montezuma]], ruler of the [[Aztec empire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; The scene entails two sections separated by a V-shaped space formed by the intersecting fall of a figure [[warrior]] and an eagle as a [[metaphor]] for the Aztec [[Cuauhtémoc|fallen eagle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/encounter.html ''Encounter: America Series of Paintings'']&lt;/ref&gt; The right plane shows a dominant figure personating Cortés with a steering look reaching for his sword drawn over two struggling figures. He leans backward upon a female figure representing his interpreter and mistress known as [[la Malinche]]. The upper area shows a screaming figure with wide-flung arms arching a wild-looking horse above the figures of a priest and a soldier.&lt;ref name="Encounter"&gt;[http://america500years.com/encounter.html ''Encounter'']&lt;/ref&gt; The left section depicts a figure representing Montezuma holding a flower necklace. His posture orients a triangular shaped plane fitted with a group of figures, a [[Plumed Serpent|Serpent]] and objects with symbolic forms.&lt;ref name="Encounter" /&gt;

3 – '''''Covenant''''' 3.65 × 5.50 meters (12 × 18&amp;nbsp;ft)&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt; depicts a scene based on the subject of the arrival in America of the early settlers known as the [[Pilgrims]] who wrote the governing  [[Mayflower Compact|Compact]] aboard the [[Mayflower]] ship that landed at [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]]. The painting's two sections are parted at the top center by a red-yellow sun amid a whirlwind of pendulous shaped forms extending themselves over the entire picture surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/covenant.html ''Covenant: America Series of Paintings'']&lt;/ref&gt; At the top right side, dripping lines around the sun seem to give shape to the sail of a ship and overlap three joined figures that may refer to the signatories of the Covenant. Below them are thrusting figures reflecting [[Native Americans in the United States|natives]] appear with offerings such as plants and staples. The lower forefront shows a clergyman above a female figure leaning backward and holding in her hand a torched broom in flame alluding to the [[Salem witch trials]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/covenant.html ''Covenant'']&lt;/ref&gt;

4 – '''''Birth 1776''''' (3.65 × 5.50 meters)&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; depicts a scene on the [[American Revolution]] and [[American Independence|Independence]] in a composition that divides the canvas in two parts linked at the center by a massive tree extending its branches in all directions scattering a wild assortment of shapes suggesting "organic cells that seem to subdivide and float around the figures."&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/birth.html ''Birth 1776: America Series'']&lt;/ref&gt; A fearless eagle sits at the top against a background of red and white stripes reflecting the [[American flag]] in a space dotted with stars and an image of the [[Liberty Bell]]. The area along the sides of the tree trunk shows the faces of [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref name="Birth 1776"&gt;[http://america500years.com/birth.html ''Birth 1776'']&lt;/ref&gt; The left and right sections are linked by the tree trunk in establishing a unified base line projecting forms of [[muskets]] and rifles.&lt; &lt;ref name="Birth 1776" /&gt;

5 – '''''Branching''''' (3.65 × 5.50 meters),&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; continues the motif of the tree in ''Birth 1776'' with a tripartite scene on the war of liberation and independence in Latin America depicting a "ponderous tree-trunk that builds a pathway"&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/branching.html ''Branching: America series'']&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the picture. The structured planes are surrounded by light bluish space containing forms reflecting the faces of [[Simón Bolívar]], [[José de San Martín]], [[Antonio Sucre]], [[Francisco de Miranda]], [[Miguel Hidalgo]], and  [[José María Morelos|José Morelos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/branching.html ''Branching'']&lt;/ref&gt;

6 – '''''Chains Under a Blinding Sun''''' (3 × 5.50 meters)&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the subject of  [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] depicting a three-part scene reflecting dark blue figures within a compressed space of deep yellow planes under a partial view of a hazy sun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/chains.html ''Chains Under a Blinding Sun: America Series'']&lt;/ref&gt; Long pendulous shapes with circumventing rings emerge from both sides and converge at the center with dripping lines over chained and struggling figures and symbols of [[enslavement]], [[hanging]], [[lynching]], and [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/chains.html ''Chains Under a Blinding Sun'']&lt;/ref&gt;

7 – '''''Bleeding Eagles''''' (3 × 5.50 meters)&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; bases its subject on [[Native American in the United States|Native Americans]] with a scene imparting various allusions, symbolism and contrasting elements. The composition sets intense dark blue figures inside two fire-red rectangular planes whose upper parts recede outward creating a wide V-shaped central section dominated by two fighting eagles. They span their wings in a crisscross formation scattering flying feathers over a grey-white space defined by bluish flowing forms outlining drawn faces of native chiefs [[Pontiac (person)|Pontiac]], [[Chief Joseph|Joseph]], [[Cochise]], [[Crazy Horse]], [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]], [[Red Cloud]], and [[Sitting Bull]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/eagles.html ''Bleeding Eagles: America Series of Paintings'']&lt;/ref&gt; Above the chiefs' heads and across the upper plane, sweeping shapes of red strips with black-blue contours fuse with flowing lines of varying densities. They appear dripping over the entire image highlighting the movement and tension of the scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/eagles.html ''Bleeding Eagles'']&lt;/ref&gt;

8 – '''''North-South Split''''' (3.65 × 5.50) meters&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt; deals with the subject of the [[American Civil War]] in a scene composed in three sections demarcated at the edges by a white-bluish space that seems to widen around the upper middle part with floating forms outlining on one side the face of [[Abraham Lincoln]], and on the other, the faces of [[Robert E Lee]] and [[Stonewall Jackson]]. Their heads are turned toward the central image showing a female figure diving over a child falling between two opposing figures that personify the fighting between the [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] and [[Union Army|Union]] armies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/split.html ''North-South Split: America Series'']&lt;/ref&gt; The right side plane is occupied by dark-blue figures surrounded by circular forms of chains breaking and loosening within the organism of a compressed space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/split.html ''North-South Split'']&lt;/ref&gt; The left side shows figures, elements, and symbols reflecting some events that may allude to the [[Mexican–American War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/split.html ''North-South'']&lt;/ref&gt;

9 – '''''Glimmering Dawn''''' (3.65 × 5.50 meters)&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 120&lt;/ref&gt; depicts a three-part composition with an atmospheric evocation of the twentieth century. It is suggested that "the attitudes and motions of the figures and forms appear defined by webs of fire-lit strings" &lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/dawn.html ''Glimmering Dawn: America Series'']&lt;/ref&gt; descending from different directions with a focus at the top of the central section occupied by an umbrella shaped sphere conjuring the threat of an atomic explosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/dawn.html ''Glimmering Dawn'']&lt;/ref&gt; White-blue strips flowing with figure forms surround the three sections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20855">The '''Architecture of Macau''' is the architecture that is found in [[Macau]]. Macau has diverse architecture from the casinos in its casino region to its tallest building, [[Grand Lisboa]] (which stands at 258 metres). Macau is influenced by both [[Cantonese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] cultures.

== Background ==
[[Macau]] is a large city located off the south coast of [[Mainland China]], with a population of approximately 630,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/macau-population/|title=Macau Population 2018 (Demographics, Maps, Graphs)|website=worldpopulationreview.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the official native languages being [[Cantonese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Macau is classified as a special administrative region (SAR), meaning it has separate executive, legislative and judicial systems to China. Macau was previously a Portuguese dependency, which ended in 1999 when it became autonomous&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/special-administrative-region.asp|title=Special Administrative Region - SAR|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2013-01-06|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[architecture]] of Macau encompasses a mixture of [[World Heritage site|world heritage]] listed and modern buildings, as well as multiple [[Bridge|bridges]] and [[Tunnel|tunnels]]. 

== Casinos in Macau ==
[[File:Casinos, Macao, 2013-08-08, DD 01.jpg|thumb|Cluster of casinos in Macau.]]
Within the region of Macau, there is a total of 50 [[Casino|Casinos]] spread across the cities of Macau, [[Cotai]] and [[Taipa]]. Being known as the ‘[[Las Vegas]] of China’, Macau has a substantial amount of casinos compared to other regions, with 30 in the city of Macau, 14 in Cotai and 6 in Taipa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcasinodirectory.com/macau/casino-list|title=Macau Casino List|website=www.worldcasinodirectory.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An example of a famous Casino in Macau is the ‘[[MGM Macau|MGM MACAU]]’, which stands at 154 metres tall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgm.mo/en/macau/about-us/property-overview|title=Property Overview {{!}} MGM MACAU|website=www.mgm.mo|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is located near the southern coast of the northern region of Macau&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/MGM+Macau/@22.1771959,113.5362327,12.75z/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x0:0x7bb2ff131ed87a29!5m1!1s2018-10-28!8m2!3d22.1860312!4d113.5478016|title=MGM Macau|website=MGM Macau|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other casinos in Macau include the [[Grand Lisboa]] Casino &amp; Hotel, [[Wynn Macau|Wynn Casino Macau]] and [[Sands Macao|Sands Macao Hotel]], all of which are clustered around each other and near the MGM MACAU. This architectural cluster centralises the casinos near the southern coast of Macau, creating a ‘hub’ for [[gambling]] and accommodation.

== Tall buildings in Macau ==
Within the [[region]] of Macau, there are 20 completed buildings and 2 under construction that are above 150 metres tall, which ranks Macau as #48 in the world by number of buildings over 150 metres&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/city/macau|title=Macau - The Skyscraper Center|website=www.skyscrapercenter.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Lotus-bridge-macau.jpg|thumb|256x256px|[[Lótus Bridge|Lotus Bridge]].]]

The smallest bridge in Macau, linking it across the border to [[Hengqin|Hengquin Island]] in Zhuhai, is the [[Lótus Bridge|Lotus Bridge]]. The bridge is approximately 900m long and its construction was completed in 1999&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://info.hktdc.com/shippers/vol23_3/vol23_3_fre03.html|title=New infrastructure enhances Macau, Zhuhai access (hktdc.com)|website=info.hktdc.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It specifically links the Cotai reclamation area of Macau to Hengquin Island with 3 lanes either side of the bridge. The bridge cost US$25 million to construct, which was shared between the Macau and Chinese governments&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The Lotus Bridge uses an ‘asymmetric partial cloverleaf’ design&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2013-04-15/lotus-bridge-macau-maphead-ken-jennings|title=What Happens When Left-Hand Roads Meet Right-Hand Roads|last=Jennings|first=Ken|work=Condé Nast Traveler|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is designed to re-direct traffic onto the correct side of the road when entering their respective countries, with China being the right and Macau being the left&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-on-the-border-of-a-country-that-drove-on-the-right-and-a-country-that-drove-on-the-left-How-would-you-be-able-to-drive-over-that-border|title=What would happen on the border of a country that drove on the right and a country that drove on the left?

== Historic architecture ==
Most of the historic architecture and [[Landmark|landmarks]] within Macau are situated in the [[Historic Centre of Macau]], which is listed as a [[World Heritage site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.china-macau.com/attractions/macau-historic-center.htm|title=Macau Historic Centre - UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Macau|work=china-macau.com|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As seen within the table below, there are over 20 buildings and landmarks within the Historic Centre, however in terms of historic architecture, there are a bit less than 20. Some of the architecture within the Historic Centre includes the [[Holy House of Mercy]], [[Mandarin's House|Mandarin's House]] and the [[A-Ma Temple]]. As the Historic Centre of Macau is host to both buildings and landmarks, below is a list of the historic architecture, in no particular order, with the name and year constructed included&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

'''Art in early modern Scotland''' includes all forms of artistic production within the modern borders of Scotland, between the adoption of the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]] in the early sixteenth century to the beginnings of the [[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in the mid-eighteenth century.

Devotional art before the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] included books and images commissioned in the [[Netherlands]]. Before the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century the interiors of Scottish churches were often elaborate and colourful, with [[sacrament house]]s and [[Funerary art|monumental effigies]]. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Reformation [[iconoclasm]], with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings.

In about 1500 the Scottish monarchy turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits. More impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century, but it flourished after the Reformation. [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] employed Flemish artists [[Arnold Bronckorst]] and [[Adrian Vanson]], who have left behind a visual record of the king and major figures at the court. The first significant native artist was [[George Jamesone]], who was succeeded by a series of portrait painters as the fashion moved down the social scale to [[laird]]s and [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es.

The loss of ecclesiastical patronage that resulted from the Reformation created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings]] and walls. Other forms of domestic decoration included tapestries and stone and wood carving. In the first half of the eighteenth century there was an increasing professionalisation and organisation of art. Large numbers of artists took the [[grand tour]] to Italy. The Academy of St. Luke was founded as a society for artists in 1729. It included among its members [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], who emerged as one of the most important British artists of the era.

==Devotional art==
[[File:Margaret Tudor praying.jpg|thumb|160px|upright|A page from the [[Hours of James IV of Scotland]]]]
{{See also|Christianity in Medieval Scotland|Scottish Reformation}}
Devotional art acquired from the [[Netherlands]] in the later fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries included the images of St Catherine and St John brought to [[Dunkeld]]; [[Hugo van Der Goes]]'s altarpiece for the [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity College Church in Edinburgh]], commissioned by [[James III of Scotland|James III]], and the work after which the Flemish [[Master of James IV of Scotland]] is named.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; There are also a relatively large number of elaborate devotional books from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, usually produced in the Netherlands and France for Scottish patrons. These include the prayer book commissioned by [[Robert Blackadder]], [[Bishop of Glasgow]], between 1484 and 1492&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; and the Flemish illustrated [[book of hours]], known as the [[Hours of James IV of Scotland]], given by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] to [[Margaret Tudor]] after 1503 and described by D. H. Caldwell as "perhaps the finest medieval manuscript to have been commissioned for Scottish use".&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Caldwell, ed., ''Angels, Nobles and Unicorns: Art and Patronage in Medieval Scotland'' (Edinburgh: National Museum of Scotland, 1982), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century the interiors of Scottish churches were often elaborate and colourful. Particularly in the north-east of the country there were highly decorated [[sacrament house]]s, like the ones surviving at Kinkell from 1524 and [[Deskford]] from 1541.&lt;ref name=Whyte&amp;Whyte1991p117&gt;I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, ''The Changing Scottish Landscape, 1500–1800'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1991), {{ISBN|0-415-02992-9}}, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Funerary art|Monumental effigies]] in churches were usually fully coloured and gilded and dedicated to members of the clergy, knights and their wives. In contrast to England, where the fashion for stone-carved monuments gave way to [[monumental brass]]es, in Scotland they continued to be produced until the end of the Medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brydall, ''The Monumental Effigies of Scotland: from the Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Century'' (Kessinger Publishing, 1895, rpt. 2010) {{ISBN|1-169-23232-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Stevenson, ''Chivalry and Knighthood in Scotland, 1424–1513'' (Boydell Press, 2006), {{ISBN|1-84383-192-9}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;125–8.&lt;/ref&gt; These include the very elaborate Douglas tombs in the town of [[Douglas, South Lanarkshire|Douglas]] and the tomb built for Alexander McLeod (d. 1528) at [[Rodel]] in Harris.&lt;ref name=Whyte&amp;Whyte1991p117/&gt; Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Reformation [[iconoclasm]], with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; The only significant surviving pre-Reformation stained glass in Scotland is a window of four roundels in the St. Magdalen Chapel of [[Cowgate]], [[Edinburgh]], completed in 1544.&lt;ref name="West1985p55"&gt;T. W. West, ''Discovering Scottish Architecture'' (Botley: Osprey, 1985), {{ISBN|0-85263-748-9}}, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Wood carving can be seen at [[King's College, Aberdeen]] and [[Dunblane Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=Scott1993p208/&gt; In the West Highlands, where there had been a hereditary caste of monumental sculptors, the uncertainty and loss of patronage caused by the rejection of monuments in the Reformation meant that they moved into another branches of the Gaelic learned orders or took up other occupations. The lack of transfer of carving skills is noticeable in the decline in quality when gravestones were next commissioned from the start of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=Dawson2007p131&gt;J. E. A. Dawson, ''Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7486-1455-9}}, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; According to N. Prior, the nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation of a culture of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.&lt;ref&gt;N. Prior, ''Museums and Modernity: Art Galleries and the Making of Modern Culture'' (Berg, 2002), {{ISBN|1-85973-508-8}}, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portraiture==

[[File:James Stewart Earl of Moray.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray]] by [[Hans Eworth]]]]
Around 1500, about the same time as in England, Scottish monarchs turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits, painted in oils on wood, perhaps as a form of political expression. In 1502 [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] paid for delivery of portraits of the Tudor household, probably by the "Inglishe payntour" named "Mynours," who stayed in Scotland to paint the king and his new bride [[Margaret Tudor]] the following year.&lt;ref name=Tittler2008p449&gt;R. Tittler, "Portrait, politics and society", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, ''A Companion to Tudor Britain'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008), {{ISBN|1-4051-3740-1}}, p.&amp;nbsp;449.&lt;/ref&gt; "Mynours" was Maynard Wewyck, a Flemish painter who usually worked for Henry VII in London.&lt;ref&gt;M. Belozerskaya, ''Rethinking the Renaissance, Burgundian Arts Across Europe'' (Cambridge 2002), {{ISBN|978-1-107-60544-2}}, p. 159: J. W. Clark, 'Notes on the tomb of Margaret Beaufort,' ''Proceedings Cambridge Antiquarian Society'', 45 (1883), pp. 267–8.&lt;/ref&gt; As in England, the monarchy may have had model portraits of royalty used for copies and reproductions, but the versions of native royal portraits that survive are generally crude by continental standards.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0276-3}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Much more impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands, generally considered the centre of painting in the Northern Renaissance.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; The products of these connections included a fine portrait of [[William Elphinstone]].&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9&gt;B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (St. Martin's Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0-333-56761-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;127–9.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the earliest representations of a Scottish subject to survive and was probably painted by a Scots artist using Flemish techniques.&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6&gt;J. E. A. Dawson, ''Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7486-1455-9}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;55–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century. In his majority [[James V of Scotland|James V]] was probably more concerned with architectural expressions of royal identity.&lt;ref name=Tittler2008p455-6/&gt; Mary Queen of Scots had been brought up in the French court, where she was drawn and painted by major European artists, but she did not commission any adult portraits, with the exception of the joint portrait with her second husband [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]]. This may have reflected an historic Scottish pattern, where [[heraldry|heraldic display]] or an elaborate tomb were considered more important than a portrait.&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6/&gt;

Portraiture began to flourish after the Reformation.&lt;ref name=Tittler2008p455-6&gt;R. Tittler, "Portrait, politics and society", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, ''A Companion to Tudor Britain'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008), {{ISBN|1-4051-3740-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;455–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There were anonymously painted portraits of important individuals, including one of [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]] (1556).&lt;ref name="Tittler2008p455-6"/&gt; Artists from the Low Countries remained important. [[Hans Eworth]], who had been court painter to [[Mary I of England]], painted a number of Scottish subjects in the 1560s. His 1561 wedding portraits were miniatures commemorating the brief marriage of the earl of Bothwell and [[Jean Gordon, Countess of Bothwell|Jean Gordon]].&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6/&gt; He also painted [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray]] in 1561 and two years later he painted a joint portrait of the young Darnley and his brother [[Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox|Charles Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain: 1530 to 1790'' (Yale University Press, 5th edn., 1994), {{ISBN|0-300-05833-0}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Seton, 7th Lord Seton|Lord Seton]], Master of the Royal Household commissioned two portraits in the Netherlands in the 1570s, one of himself and one a family portrait.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; A specific type of Scottish picture is the "vendetta portrait", designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity. Examples include the ''Darlney memorial portrait'', which shows the young James IV kneeling at his murdered father's tomb and the lifesize portrait of the corpse of ''The Bonnie Early of Moray'' vividly showing the wounds received by [[James Stewart, 2nd Earl of Moray]] when he was killed by [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]] in 1592.&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain: 1530 to 1790'' (Yale University Press, 5th edn., 1994), {{ISBN|0-300-05833-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Baptist Medina Self Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Self portrait by [[John Baptist Medina]]'' (c. 1698)]]
There was an attempt to produce a series of portraits of Scottish kings in panel portraits, probably for the [[royal entry]] of the fifteen-year-old [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] in 1579, which are Medieval in form. In James VI's personal reign, Renaissance forms of portraiture began to dominate.&lt;ref name=Tittler2008p455-6/&gt; He employed two Flemish artists, [[Arnold Bronckorst]] in the early 1580s and [[Adrian Vanson]] from around 1584 to 1602, who have left us a visual record of the king and major figures at the court.&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6/&gt; However, the [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London. The result has been seen as a shift "from crown to castle", as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p193"&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0276-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;193.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the seventeenth century the fashion for portraiture had spread down the social order to [[laird]]s such as [[Sir Colin Campbell, 2nd Baronet|Colin Campbell of Glenorchy]] and [[John Napier|John Napier of Merchiston]].&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6/&gt; The first significant native artist was [[George Jamesone]] of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who, having trained in the Netherlands, became one of the most successful portrait painters of the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. He trained the Baroque artist [[John Michael Wright]] (1617–94), who painted both Scottish and English subjects.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9&gt;A. Thomas, ''The Renaissance'', in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0-19-162433-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;198–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish-Spanish painter [[John Baptist Medina]] (1659–1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish portrait painter of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his best known works are a group of about 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in [[Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh]]. He trained his son, also John, and [[William Aikman (painter)|William Aikman]] (1682–1731), who became the leading portrait painter of the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790'' (London: Penguin, 4th Edn, 1978), pp.&amp;nbsp;150–1.&lt;/ref&gt; Aikman migrated to London in 1723, and from this point until the late eighteenth century, most Scottish painters of note followed him.&lt;ref name=Waterhouse1994p300/&gt;

[[File:Painted ceiling from Rossend Castle.JPG|thumb|left|Painted ceiling from [[Rossend Castle]], [[Burntisland]]]]
The loss of ecclesiastical patronage that resulted from the Reformation, created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings]] and walls, with large numbers of private houses of burgesses, lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured patterns and scenes, of which over a hundred examples survive.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; The earliest surviving example is at the Hamilton palace of [[Kinneil House|Kinneil]], West Lothian, decorated in the 1550s for the then regent the [[James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault|James Hamilton, Earl of Arran]].&lt;ref name=Dawson2007p290&gt;J. E. A. Dawson, ''Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7486-1455-9}}, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include the ceiling at [[Prestongrange House]], undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of [[Newbattle]], and the long gallery at [[Pinkie House]], painted for [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline|Alexander Seaton]], Earl of Dunfermline in 1621.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt;

Records also indicate that Scottish palaces were adorned by rich [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|tapestries]], like those that depicted scenes from the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' set up for James IV at [[Holyrood Palace|Holyrood]].&lt;ref name=Glendinningetal1996p14&gt;M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), {{ISBN|0-7486-0849-4}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this was undertaken by exclusive professional embroiders, but needlework was part of female education at all levels of society. Some of these tapestries were produced by noble ladies, such as  the bed [[Window valance|valance]]s made by Katherine Ruthven for her marriage in 1551 to Campbell of Glenorchy. These are the oldest surviving examples of Scottish produced embroidery.&lt;ref name=Dawson2007p178/&gt; They display the couple's initials, arms and the story of Adam and Eve. A carpet designed to cover a table may be connected to the marriage of Katherine Oliphant, which has her initials, arms, biblical verses and (perhaps as a pun on her name) an elephant. Much of the needle work of the sixteenth century has been attributed, probably erroneously, to Mary, Queen of Scots. It is thought that she did contribute to the [[Oxburgh Hangings]] while imprisoned in England.&lt;ref name=Dawson2007p178&gt;J. E. A. Dawson, ''Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7486-1455-9}}, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stirling Head King James V.jpg|thumb|right|King [[James V of Scotland|James V]] in one of the [[Stirling Heads]]]]
Although tradition of stone and wood carving in churches largely ended at the Reformation, it continued in royal palaces, the great houses of the nobility and even the humbler homes of lairds and burgesses.&lt;ref&gt;J. Warrack, ''Domestic Life in Scotland, 1488–1688: A Sketch of the Development of Furniture and Household Usage'' (1930, Forgotton books, reprint, 2012), pp.&amp;nbsp;76–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The intricate lid of the fourteenth-century [[Bute mazer]], carved from a single piece of whale bone, was probably created in the early sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;H. Fothringham, ''Scottish Gold and Silver Work'' (London: Pelican, 2nd edn., 1999), {{ISBN|1-4556-1170-0}}, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Stirling Castle]], stone carvings on the royal palace from the reign of [[James V of Scotland|James V]] are taken from German patterns,&lt;ref&gt;C. McKean, ''The Scottish Chateau'' (Sutton, 2nd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|0-7509-3527-8}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and, like the surviving carved oak portrait roundels from the King's Presence Chamber, known as the [[Stirling Heads]], they include contemporary, biblical and classical figures.&lt;ref&gt;J. Dunbar, ''The Stirling Heads'' (London: [[RCAHMS]]/[[HMSO]], 1975), {{ISBN|0-11-491310-2}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; These, and the elaborate Renaissance fountain at [[Linlithgow Palace]] (c. 1538.), suggest that there was a workshop with an established connected with the court in the early sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Scott1993p208/&gt; Some of the finest domestic wood carving is in the Beaton panels made for [[Arbroath Abbey]]&lt;ref name=Scott1993p208&gt;H. Scott, ed., ''Scotland: A Concise Cultural History'' (Mainstream, 1993), {{ISBN|1-85158-581-8}}, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Huntly Castle]], rebuilt for [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]] in the early seventeenth century, which focused on heraldic images. Their "[[Anti-popery|popish]]" overtones led to them being damaged by an occupying [[Covenanter]] army in 1640.&lt;ref name=Glendinningetal1996p46&gt;M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), {{ISBN|0-7486-0849-4}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; From the seventeenth century, as domestic architecture for the nobility was increasingly for comfort, rather than fortification, there was elaborate use of carving in carved pediments, fireplaces, heraldic arms and classical motifs. Plasterwork also began to be used, often depicting flowers and cherubs.&lt;ref name="West1985p68"&gt;T. W.

There is also the heraldic carving, such as the royal arms at [[Holyrood Palace]], designed by the Dutch painter [[Jacob de Wet]] in 1677. The tradition of carving also survived in work like the carved stone panels in the garden of [[Edzell Castle]] (c. 1600), the now lost carving done for Edinburgh and Glasgow universities in the seventeenth-century and in the many elaborate sundials of the seventeenth century, like those at Newbattle.&lt;ref name="Scott1993p208"/&gt;

The growing importance of royal art can be seen in the post of [[Painter and Limner]], created in 1702 for George Ogilvie. The duties included drawing pictures of the Monarch's person, his successors and members of the royal family, for the decoration of royal houses and palaces. However, from 1723 to 1823 the office was a [[sinecure]] held by members of the Abercrombie family, not necessarily connected with artistic ability.&lt;ref&gt;''The Laws of Scotland: Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia'', vol. 7 "The Crown", para 847.&lt;/ref&gt; Many painters of the early part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans, like the members of the Norie family, James (1684–1757) and his sons, Robert and the younger James, who painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were [[Capriccio (art)|capriccios]] or [[pastiche]]s of Italian and Dutch landscapes.&lt;ref name=Baudino2011p153&gt;I.

K. Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790'' (London: Penguin, 4th Edn, 1978), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy became an important point of reference for Scottish artists, with many taking the [[Grand Tour]] there to paint, sample the art and learn from Italian masters.&lt;ref&gt;J.

In 1729 there was an attempt to found a school of painting in Edinburgh as the Academy of St. Luke, named after the Renaissance [[Accademia di San Luca]] in Rome. Its president was George Marshall, a painter of [[still life|still lives]] and portraits, and its treasurer was the engraver Richard Cooper. Other members included Cooper's student Robert Strange, the two younger Nories, the portrait painters [[John Alexander (painter)|John Alexander]] (c. 1690-c. 1733) and [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] (1713–84).&lt;ref&gt;A.

He studied in Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh.

[[Image:Polygraphiae.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Johannes Trithemius]]' ''Polygraphiae (1518)'' is the first printed book on [[cryptology]].]]

'''Books on [[cryptography]]''' have been published sporadically and with highly variable quality for a long time. This is despite the tempting, though superficial, [[paradox]] that secrecy is of the essence in sending confidential messages — see [[Kerckhoffs' principle]].

In contrast, the revolutions in [[cryptography]] and secure [[information transfer|communications]] since the 1970s are well covered in the available literature.

==Early history==
An early example of a book about cryptography was a Roman work,{{Which|date=October 2012}} now lost and known only by references. Many early cryptographic works were esoteric, mystical, and/or reputation-promoting; cryptography being mysterious, there was much opportunity for such things. At least one work by [[Trithemius]] was banned by the Catholic Church and put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] as being about black magic or witchcraft. Many writers claimed to have invented unbreakable [[cipher]]s. None were, though it sometimes took a long while to establish this.

In the 19th century, the general standard improved somewhat (e.g., works by [[Auguste Kerckhoffs]], [[Friedrich Kasiski]], and [[Étienne Bazeries]]). Colonel [[Parker Hitt]] and [[William F. Friedman|William Friedman]] in the early 20th century also wrote books on cryptography. These authors, and others, mostly abandoned any mystical or magical tone.

==Open literature versus classified literature==
With the invention of radio, much of military communications went wireless, allowing the possibility of enemy interception much more readily than tapping into a landline.  This increased the need to protect communications. By the end of [[World War I]], cryptography and its literature began to be officially limited. One exception was [[The American Black Chamber]] by [[Herbert Yardley]], which gave some insight into American cryptologic success stories, including the [[Zimmermann telegram]] and the breaking of Japanese codes during the [[Washington Naval Conference]].

==''The Codebreakers''==
From the end of World War II until the early 1980s most aspects of modern cryptography were regarded as the special concern of governments and the military, and were protected by custom and, in some cases, by statute. The most significant work to be published on cryptography in this period is undoubtedly [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]]'s ''[[The Codebreakers]]'', which was published at a time (mid-1960s) when virtually no information on the modern practice of cryptography was available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol12i3/html/v12i3a09p_0001.htm The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing by David Kahn, internal CIA  book review by Roger Pineau], ca.1967, released to public 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Kahn has said that over ninety percent of its content was previously unpublished.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} 

The book caused serious concern at the [[NSA]] despite its lack of coverage of specific modern cryptographic practice, so much so that after failing to prevent the book being published, NSA staff were informed to not even acknowledge the existence of the book if asked. In the US military, mere possession of a copy by cryptographic personnel was grounds for some considerable suspicion. Perhaps the single greatest importance of the book was the impact it had on the next generation of cryptographers. [[Whitfield Diffie]] has made comments in interviews about the effect it had on him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://simonsingh.net/books/recommended-books/great-cryptography-books/the-codebreakers/ Review by Simon Singh]&lt;/ref&gt;

==List==
Significant books on cryptography include:

* [[Rosario Candela|Candela, Rosario]] (1938). ''The Military Cipher of [[Étienne Bazeries|Commandant Bazeries]]''. New York: Cardanus Press, This book detailed cracking of a famous code from 1898 created by Commandant Bazeries, a brilliant French Army Cryptanalyst.
* [[Helen Fouché Gaines|Gaines, Helen Fouché]] (1939). ''Cryptanalysis'', Dover, {{ISBN|0-486-20097-3}}. Considered one of the classic books on the subject, and includes many sample ciphertext for practice. It reflects public amateur practice as of the inter-War period. The book was compiled as one of the first projects of the [[American Cryptogram Association]].

The first is one of a very few books about the US Government's NSA. The second is also about NSA but concentrates more on its history. There is some very interesting material in ''Body of Secrets'' about US attempts (the [[TICOM]] mission) to investigate German cryptographic efforts immediately as WW II wound down.

The added chapter on more recent developments (in the most recent edition) is quite thin. Kahn has written other books and articles on cryptography, and on cryptographic history. They are very highly regarded.

The included cryptanalytic contest has been won and the prize awarded, but the cyphertexts are still worth attempting.
* Bauer, F L, ''Decrypted Secrets'', This book is unusual. It is both a history of cryptography, and a discussion of mathematical topics related to cryptography.

'''''Chalk Cliffs on Rügen''''' ({{lang-de|Kreidefelsen auf Rügen}}) is an [[oil painting]] of circa 1818 by [[German Romantic]] artist [[Caspar David Friedrich]].

==Development==
In January 1818, Caspar David Friedrich married Christiane Caroline Bommer, who was about 20 years his junior. On their honeymoon in July and August 1818, they visited relatives in [[Neubrandenburg]] and [[Greifswald]]. From there, the couple undertook an excursion to the island of [[Rügen]] with Friedrich's brother Christian. The painting appears as a celebration of the couple's union.

==Description==
The painting depicts the view from the chalk cliffs of the [[Stubbenkammer]], at that time one of the most famous lookout points on the island. It is frequently but incorrectly believed that the ''[[Wissower Klinken]]'' outcrops in particular were a model for the painting; however, these did not exist at the time of the painting's creation, but appeared later because of [[erosion]]. Friedrich often composed his landscapes from carefully chosen elements of different sketches, so that a specific location is not necessarily discernible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article495995/Am_Ende_bleibt_nur_die_Kunst.html Uta Baier: ''Am Ende bleibt nur die Kunst - Die Wissower Klinken und Caspar David Friedrich''], article in Die ''[[Die Welt|Welt]]'' of 26 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kreidefelsen 1010.jpg|thumb|left|A later variation on the theme; watercolor, 1824, 25 × 32 cm]]

Two trees, whose leaves cover the upper third of the painting, frame the scenery. Two men and a woman in town clothes gaze in wonder at the view. The thin figure in the middle is usually interpreted as Caspar David Friedrich himself.&lt;ref name="HBS"&gt;Helmut Börsch-Supan: ''Caspar David Friedrich.'' 4. erweiterte und überarbeitete Auflage, Prestel, Munich 1987, {{ISBN|3-7913-0835-1}}, p 118&lt;/ref&gt; His hat lies beside him as a sign of humility. He seeks for a foothold in the grass as a symbol of the transience of life and looks into the abyss opening before him—the abyss of death. On the right, the man with crossed arms leans against the trunk of a dying tree and looks far out to the sea. The two tiny sailboats stand as symbols for the soul which opens to eternal life and correspond to the figures of the two men.&lt;ref name="HBS"/&gt; On the left, the woman in a red dress (who is usually identified as Friedrich's wife Caroline)&lt;ref name="HBS"/&gt; sits beside an almost dried-up shrub: only the twigs around her face are leafing out. With her right hand she points either at the abyss or at the flowers bordering it. In contrast to the men, who gaze either at the abyss or into the distance, she communicates with the other figures—whether she feels threatened by the abyss or compelled by the natural beauty is unclear.

The colors of the figure's clothes are also symbolic. The middle figure is blue, the color of faith; the left figure is red, that of love; and the right figure is green, that of hope. Thus they can be interpreted as embodiments of the three Christian [[theological virtues]]: faith, hope and love.&lt;ref name="HBS"/&gt; The art historian Helmut Börsch-Supan sees in the picture a representation of Friedrich's relation to death, and the threat to life by death: "clear [...] as almost never before, but at the same time also in an unusually serene mood".&lt;ref name="HBS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"deutlich [...] wie kaum zuvor, zugleich aber auch in einer selten heiteren Stimmung"&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[comics]], a '''colorist''' is responsible for adding color to black-and-white line art.  For most of the 20th century this was done using brushes and dyes which were then used as guides to produce the printing plates.  Since the late 20th century it is most often done using digital media, with printing separations produced electronically.

Although most American colorists work directly for comics publishers (either as [[employee]]s or [[freelancer]]s), there are a few coloring studios which offer their services to publishers. [[American Color]], [[Olyoptics]], and [[Digital Chameleon]] were companies notable in this field.

== History ==
Originally, comics were colored by cutting out films of various densities in the appropriate shapes to be used in producing [[color separation|color-separated]] printing plates. The typical colorist worked from photocopies of the inked pages, which they colored with special dyes. [[Dr. Martin's Dyes]] was a brand notable in this field within the comic strip industry.&lt;ref name="color guides" /&gt; [[CMYK]] codes were written on the page to indicate the final printed colors, and these hand-colored pages were used as guides by the engraver.&lt;ref&gt;"Bullpen Bulletins," ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #52 (Marvel Comics, June 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tatjana Wood]] was the main colorist for [[DC Comics]]' covers from 1973 through the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Paul Levitz|last=Levitz|first= Paul|title= 75 Years of DC Comics The Art of Modern Mythmaking|publisher= [[Taschen|Taschen America]] |year=2010| ISBN= 978-3-8365-1981-6|page= 524 |quote= Virtually all DC covers from 1973 through the end of the Bronze Age were colored by Tatjana Wood.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, colorists have worked in transparent media such as watercolors or airbrush, which is then photographed, allowing more subtle and painterly effects.

==Digital color==
Colorist [[Steve Oliff]] and his company [[Olyoptics]] were one of the first to use computers to do color separations. Although other companies at the time were experimenting with computers, Oliff and his crew were the first to blend the color guide artist with the separator.&lt;ref name="Khoury"&gt;Khoury, George. ''Image Comics: The Road To Independence'' (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the Japanese [[manga]] ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'' was in preparation to be translated and published by [[Marvel Comics]]'s [[Epic Comics]] line. Oliff was chosen as the colorist, and he convinced Marvel that it was time to try computer color.&lt;ref&gt;Gravett, Paul. Manga: ''Sixty Years of Japanese Comics'' (Laurence King Publishing, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of ''Akira'' in 1988, computer coloring became increasingly prevalent in the comics industry.&lt;ref name="Khoury" /&gt;

By the early 1990s, even though the larger comics publishers were using computers, there were variations within the field. [[DC Comics]] allowed only a 64-color palette, while Marvel had expanded it to 125 colors. [[Dark Horse Comics]] allowed even more variations.&lt;ref name="color guides"&gt;Hollingsworth, Matt. [http://matthollingsworth.net/content/view/22/1/ "Color Guides," MattHollingsworth.net.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008024428/http://matthollingsworth.net/content/view/22/1/ |date=2008-10-08 }} Accessed Apr. 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant programs in use during that time were Color Prep and Tint Prep, both originally implemented by Olyoptics. This software was invented and written by "Pixel Craft", the first company to create software that used a personal computer that could output files for a digital image setter to make negatives for color printing. Pixel craft was a small company in Long Island, NY, created by Kenneth Giordano, and Khouri Giordano. The Father and son team went on to accomplish many first in the computerization of color print..&lt;ref name="color guides" /&gt; In 1993, [[Image Comics]]' use of computer color and more advanced color separation technology propelled DC and Marvel to further upgrade their coloring techniques. Finally, in the mid-1990s, Digital Chameleon's facility with [[Adobe Photoshop]] helped make that program the industry standard.&lt;ref name="color guides" /&gt;

The improvements in the technology used for coloring have had a great impact on the way comics are drawn. Before the use of computers, artists would often use the pen or brush to put in detailed [[shading]] effects; now the artist is more likely to leave the drawing open and leave it to the colorist to insert shading through variation in color tones or through adding a layer of [[translucent]] black. Most contemporary colorists work in [[digital media]] using tools.&lt;ref&gt;Sierra, Jerry A.

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2011}}
'''Consolidated''' was an [[United States|American]] radical activist music group, formed in 1988 and best known in the early 1990s as an alternative dance/[[industrial music|industrial]] music band. Between 1989 and 1994, their instrumental style evolved from industrial, to hip-hop, to hard rock and funk with mixtures of live instruments and electronic instruments. They were distinguished by left-leaning political activism and politically radical lyrics, as well as their innovative sonic collages which blended industrial and hip-hop styles. 

Their music often focused on [[vegetarianism]], [[women's rights]], [[animal rights]], fighting [[racism]] and [[homophobia]], the unity of oppression, [[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]], the dangers of [[capitalism]], and the evils of [[American Nationalism]]. Although often criticized as having strident and confrontational lyrics, Consolidated tempered the intensity of their songs with many instances of self-deprecating humor.  They admitted to their own struggles with addressing complex social issues within the constraining structures of [[pop music]], an artistic form they referred to as "a neutralized medium," but explained that they did so because they felt that it might be their only chance to reach a mass audience with progressive messages of social justice.

Their signature song, "Consolidated", contained the mission statement "Consolidated is not even a consumer product... yet.  This is no rock and roll band.  It is a unique creative vision of a small isolated group of individuals.  A team that's skilled and dedicated.  Searching for the knowledge that will enable them to improve the quality of their lives and the lives of those around them."

==Band members==
Consolidated's original line-up consisted of [[Adam Sherburne]] (guitar and vocals), [[Mark Pistel]] (samples, sequencers and keyboards/synths), and [[Philip Steir]] (drums).  Consolidated's subsequent line-ups have consisted of Adam Sherburne, [[Todd Bryerton]] (drums), Michael Dunn (bass), and Kevin Carnes (drums) with some mixing and engineering by Mark Pistel.

After 1994, the original line-up went their separate ways.  Since that time, the project has been mainly under the direction of Adam Sherburne, with peripheral involvement by Mark Pistel (primarily mixing and engineering the albums).  Following the split of the original line-up, Consolidated has continued to evolve musically through styles reminiscent of West Coast hip-hop, R&amp;B, rock, and jazz similar to [[Miles Davis]]'s early 1970s experimentation.  Initially known for their strident, lyric-heavy albums, their most recent recordings have been almost entirely instrumental improvisations.

Co-founders Mark Pistel (programming/vocals) and Philip Steir (programming/vocals) continued to do many remix projects after leaving the band.  Mark Pistel made one album under the name Pistel, and has also played with the live/touring incarnation of [[Meat Beat Manifesto]] as well as a group called [[Electronic Dub Collective]]. He is currently co-producing and touring with [[Hercules and Love Affair]].  Philip Steir co-owns a recording studio called Toast. Drummer [[Todd Bryerton]] of the band's later line-up performs with [[Kneel Cohn]] in the NYC post-glam band [[The Dead Stars On Hollywood]].

Adam Sherburne had previously been the lead singer of a band called [[Until December]].

==Live performances==
In each of their live performances, Consolidated included a period of time in which microphones were passed among audience members, who could then discuss, rebut, argue or elaborate upon the topics of Consolidated's songs.  Consolidated devised these interactions as a way to subvert the typically passive experience of watching a band perform, empowering the audience members to respond and articulate their own opinions on issues addressed in the song lyrics or even the nature of the performance itself. Consolidated recorded many of these interactions and sampled excerpts of them to be included on their albums.  In some cases, these samples were arranged and featured as short interludes between songs, while in other cases they were worked into the sonic collages of the songs themselves (e.g., "Crusading Rap Guys" on the 1991 LP ''[[Friendly Fa$cism]]''.)

Consolidated's live performances featured video montages that were either projected onto large screens, or featured on multiple television sets positioned along the perimeter of the stage.  The video footage included their promotional music video clips for their singles, as well as video art composed of found footage which corresponded to the lyrical topics of specific songs (e.g., myths of male sexuality, sexist depictions of women in mass media, and the inhumane treatment of animals in laboratories and slaughterhouses).

Local, regional and national activist groups were invited by Consolidated to set up tables and information kiosks at their shows while they were on tour.

An entry on  a previous version of Consolidated's official website noted that all their albums have combined to sell over 500,000 copies.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

'''Demonology''' is the study of [[demon]]s or beliefs about demons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demonology "Demonology"] at Dictionary.com Unabridged, (v 1.1) Random House, Inc.. Retrieved January 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the methods used to summon and control them. The original sense of "demon", from the time of [[Homer]] onward, was a benevolent being,&lt;ref name="DDD"&gt;van der Toorn, Becking, van der Horst (1999), ''Dictionary of Deities and Demons in The Bible'', Second Extensively Revised Edition, Entry: '''Demon''', pp. 235-240, William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0-8028-2491-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in English the name now holds connotations of malevolence. (To keep the distinction, when referring to the word in its original Greek meaning, English may use the spelling "[[Daemon (classical mythology)|Daemon]]" or "[[Daimonic|Daimon]]".)

Demons, when regarded as [[spirit]]s, may belong to either of the classes of spirits recognized by primitive [[animism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01526a.htm Animism] at [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/index.html The Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, they may be human, or non-human, separable souls, or discarnate spirits which have never inhabited a body. A sharp distinction is often drawn between these two classes, notably by the [[Melanesians]], several African groups, and others. The [[Islam]]ic [[jinn]], for example, are not reducible to modified human souls. At the same time these classes are frequently conceived as producing identical results, e.g. diseases.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=207375 "Demon"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016201216/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=207375 |date=2007-10-16 }} from Funk &amp; Wagnalls ''New Encyclopedia'', © 2006 World Almanac Education Group, retrieved from [http://www.history.com/ history.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt;

The word ''[[wiktionary:demonology|demonology]]'' is from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:δαίμων|δαίμων]]}}, ''daimōn'', "divinity, divine power, god";&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/Reference/Autenrieth.html Georg Autenrieth, A Homeric Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]''.

== Prevalence of demons ==
[[File:Nachtmahr (Abildgaard).jpg|thumb|right|250px|"[[The Nightmare|Nightmare]]", 1800, by [[Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard]].]]
According to some societies, all the affairs of life are supposed to be under the control of spirits, each ruling a certain "[[Classical element|element]]" or even object, and themselves in subjection to a greater spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig, Theodore M., ''The Sacred Paths: Understanding the Religions of the World'', Second Edition, pp. 48-51, © 1989 Prentice-Hall, Inc., {{ISBN|0-02-372175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Inuit]] are said to believe in spirits of the sea, earth and sky, the winds, the clouds and everything in nature. Every cove of the seashore, every point, every island and prominent rock has its guardian spirit. All are potentially of the malignant type, to be propitiated by an appeal to knowledge of the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;Rink, Henry (1875), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/inu/tte/tte1-4.htm "Chapter IV: Religion"] of ''Tales and Traditions of the Eskimo'', London, 1875, at [http://www.sacred-texts.com/index.htm sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional [[Korea]]n belief posits countless demons inhabit the natural world; they fill household objects and are present in all locations.  By the thousands they accompany travelers, seeking them out from their places in the elements.&lt;ref name="E1911"&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/DEM_DIO/DEMONOLOGY_L1alwv_demon_genius_.html Demonology] at the Online Encyclopedia, Originally appearing in Volume 8, Page 10 of the ''1911 Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient [[Babylon]], demonology had an influence on even the most mundane elements of life, from petty annoyances to the emotions of love and hatred.  The numerous demonic spirits were given charge over various parts of the human body, one for the head, one for the neck, and so on.

Greek philosophers such as [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], who claimed influence from [[Platonic realism|Platonism]],&lt;ref&gt;Cumont, Franz (1911), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/orrp/orrp19.htm ''The Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism''], Chapter VI: Persia, p. 267 at [http://www.sacred-texts.com sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church Fathers|fathers of the Christian Church]], held that the world was pervaded with spirits,&lt;ref name="E1911" /&gt; the latter of whom advanced the belief that demons received the worship directed at pagan gods.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, [http://ccel.org/fathers/NPNF1-02/c1.8.htm ''The City of God''], Book 8, Chapters 24-25, at the [http://ccel.org/ Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religions and cultures believe, or once believed, that what is now known as [[soothsaying]], was, or is, a form of physical contact with demons.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Character of the spiritual world==
The ascription of malevolence to the world of spirits is by no means universal. In [[Central Africa]], the [[Mpongwe]] believe in local spirits, just as do the Inuit; but they are regarded as inoffensive in the main.  Passers-by must make some trifling offering as they near the spirits' place of abode; but it is only occasionally mischievous acts, such as the throwing down of a tree on a passer-by, are, in the view of the natives, perpetuated by the class of spirits known as ''Ombuiri''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamill Nassau, Robert (Rev.) M.D., S.T.D., (1904), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/fiwa/fiwa07.htm ''Fetichism in West Africa''], Chapter V: Spiritual Beings in Africa - Their Classes and Functions, Charles Scribners Son&lt;/ref&gt;

So too many of the spirits, especially concerned with the operations of nature, are conceived as neutral or even benevolent; the European peasant fears the [[Vegetation deity|corn-spirit]] only when he irritates him by trenching on his domain and taking his property by cutting the corn;&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, Sir James George (1922), [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/f/frazer/james/golden/chapter46.html ''The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303101920/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/f/frazer/james/golden/chapter46.html |date=2007-03-03 }}, Chapter 46, "The Corn-Mother in Many Lands," at [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/ The University of Adelaide Library]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903005321/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/ |date=September 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, there is no reason why the more insignificant personages of the [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] should be conceived as malevolent, and we find that the Petara of the [[Dayak people|Dyaks]] are far from indiscriminate and malignant, being viewed as invisible guardians of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Greem, Eda (c. 1909), [http://anglicanhistory.org/asia/sarawak/green/04.html ''Borneo: The Land of River and Palm''] at the [http://anglicanhistory.org/ Project Canterbury] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{See also|Classification of demons}}
Demons are generally classified as spirits which are believed to enter into relations with the human race. As such the term includes:
# [[angel]]s in the [[Christian]] tradition that [[fallen angel|fell from grace]],&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt;
# malevolent [[Genie|genii]] or [[Familiar spirit|familiars]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demon Demon], entry in the  ''Online Etymology Dictionary'', © 2001 Douglas Harper, hosted at [http://dictionary.reference.com dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
# such as receive a [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] (e.g., [[ancestor worship]]),&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt;
# [[ghost]]s or other malevolent [[revenant (folklore)|revenants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ghost Ghost], entry in ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, Copyright © 2000, Houghton Mifflin Company, hosted at [http://dictionary.reference.com dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Excluded are souls conceived as inhabiting another world. Yet just as gods are not necessarily spiritual, demons may also be regarded as corporeal; [[vampire]]s for example are sometimes described as human heads with appended entrails, which issue from the tomb to attack the living during the night watches. The so-called Spectre Huntsman of the Malay Peninsula is said to be a man who scours the firmament with his dogs, vainly seeking for what he could not find on Earth: a buck mouse-deer pregnant with male offspring; but he seems to be a living man; there is no statement that he ever died, nor yet that he is a spirit. The [[incubus (demon)|incubi]] and [[succubus|succubi]] of the [[Middle Ages]] are sometimes regarded as spiritual beings; but they were held to give proof of their bodily existence, such as offspring (though often deformed).&lt;ref&gt;Masello, Robert, ''Fallen Angels and Spirits of The Dark'', pp. 64-68, 2004, The Berkley Publishing Group, 200 Madison Ave. New York, NY 10016, {{ISBN|0-399-51889-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in demons goes back many millennia. The [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] faith teaches that there are 3,333 Demons, some with specific dark  responsibilities such as war, starvation, sickness, etc.

===Ancient Near East===
{{main article|Mesopotamian demon}}
{{further information|Asag| Pazuzu}}
In [[Babylonian mythology]], the seven evil deities were known as ''[[shedu]]'', or "storm-demons". They were represented in [[Bull (mythology)|winged bull form]], derived from the colossal bulls used as protective genii of royal palaces, the name "shed" assumed also the meaning of a propitious genius in [[Babylon]]ian magic literature.&lt;ref&gt;See Delitzsch, ''Assyrisches Handwörterbuch''. pp. 60, 253, 261, 646; Jensen, ''Assyr.-Babyl. Mythen und Epen'', 1900, p. 453; [[Archibald Sayce]], l.c. pp. 441, 450, 463; [[François Lenormant|Lenormant]], l.c. pp. 48-51.&lt;/ref&gt; It was from Chaldea that the name "shedu" came to the Israelites, and so the  writers of the Tanach applied the word [[Shedim]]  to certain Canaanite deities. They also spoke of "the destroyer" (Exodus xii. 23) as a Lord who will "strike down the Egyptians." In II Samuel xxiv; 16 and II Chronicles xxi. 15 the pestilence-dealing angel, that is spirit, called  "the destroying angel" (compare "the angel of the Lord" in II Kings xix. 35; Isaiah xxxvii. 36).

===Buddhism===
Traditionally, [[Buddhism]] affirms the existence of [[Hell#Buddhism|hells]]&lt;ref&gt;Boeree, Dr. C. George (2000), [http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/buddhacosmo.html Chapter: "Buddhist Cosmology"], ''An Introduction to Buddhism'', Shippensburg University&lt;/ref&gt; peopled by demons who torment sinners and tempt mortals to sin, or who seek to thwart their [[Bodhi|enlightenment]], with a demon named [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] as chief tempter, "prince of darkness," or "Evil One" in Sanskrit sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kadampa.org/en/reference/glossary-of-buddhist-terms-a-e#Demon "Demon"] and [http://kadampa.org/en/reference/glossary-of-buddhist-terms-k-o#Mara "Mara"] in the ''Glossary of Buddhist Terms'' at [http://www.kadampa.org/ kadampa.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strickman"&gt;Strickmann, Michel. ''Chinese Magical Medicine'',(2002) Stanford: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-3449-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The followers of Mara were also called ''mara'', the devils, and are frequently cited as a cause of disease or representations of mental obstructions.&lt;ref name="strickman"/&gt;
The ''mara'' became fully assimilated into the Chinese worldview, and were called ''mo''.

The idea of the imminent decline and collapse of the Buddhist religion amid a "great cacophony of demonic influences" was already a significant component of Buddhism when it reached China in the first century A.D., according to Michel Strickmann.&lt;ref name="strickman"/&gt; Demonic forces had attained enormous power in the world. For some writers of the time this state of affairs had been ordained to serve the higher purpose of effecting a "preliminary cleansing" that would purge and purify humanity in preparation for an ultimate, messianic renewal.&lt;ref name="strickman"/&gt;

Medieval Chinese Buddhist demonology was heavily influenced by Indian Buddhism. Indian demonology is also fully and systematically described in written sources, though during Buddhism's millennium of direct influence in China, "Chinese demonology was whipped into respectable shape," with a number of Indian demons finding permanent niches even in [[Taoist]] ritual texts.&lt;ref name="strickman"/&gt;

Also, [[Śūraṅgama Sūtra]], a major Mahayana Buddhism text, describes fifty demonic states: the so-called fifty skandha maras, which are "negative" mirror-like reflections of or deviations from correct samādhi (meditative absorption) states. In this context demons are considered by Buddhists to be beings possessing some supernatural powers, who, in the past, might have practiced [[Dharma]], Buddha's teaching, but due to practicing it incorrectly failed to develop [[Prajñā (Buddhism)]], true wisdom and [[Karuṇā]], true compassion, which are inseparable attributes of an enlightened being such as a [[Buddha]] or a [[Bodhisattva]]. In his autobiography, The Blazing Splendor, [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]], a prominent Tibetan Buddhist master of the 20th century describes encounters with such beings. Therefore, depending on the context, in Buddhism demons may refer to both disturbed mind states and actual beings.

===Christianity===
{{Main article|Christian demonology}}
Christian demonology is the study of [[demon]]s from a [[Christianity|Christian]] point of view. It is primarily based on the [[Bible]] ([[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]]), the [[exegesis]] of these scriptures, the writings of early Christian [[philosopher]]s and [[hermit]]s, [[tradition]], and [[legend]]s incorporated from other beliefs.

Some scholars{{who|date=March 2016}} suggest the origins of early [[Greek Old Testament]] demonology can be traced to two distinctive and often competing mythologies of evil – Adamic and Enochic, one of which was tied to the [[fall of man]] caused by [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]] and the other to the fall of angels in the [[antediluvian]] period.&lt;ref&gt;A. Orlov, Dark Mirrors: Azazel and Satanael in Early Jewish Demonology (Albany, SUNY, 2011) 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Adamic story traces the source of evil to Satan’s transgression and the fall of man, a trend reflected in the Books of Adam and Eve which explains the reason for Satan’s demotion by his refusal to obey God’s command to venerate newly created Adam.

In contrast, the early Enochic tradition bases its understanding of the origin of demons on the story of the fallen [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]] led by Azazel. Scholars{{who|date=March 2016}} believe these two enigmatic figures - Azazel and Satan exercised formative influence on early Jewish demonology. While in the beginning of their conceptual journeys Azazel and Satan are posited as representatives of two distinctive and often rival trends tied to the distinctive etiologies of corruption, in later Jewish and Christian demonological lore both antagonists are able to enter each other’s respective stories in new conceptual capacities. In these later traditions Satanael is often depicted as the leader of the fallen angels while his conceptual rival Azazel is portrayed as a seducer of Adam and Eve.&lt;ref&gt;A. Orlov, Dark Mirrors: Azazel and Satanael in Early Jewish Demonology (Albany, SUNY, 2011) 7.&lt;/ref&gt; While historical [[Judaism]] never recognized any set of doctrines about demons,&lt;ref name="MM_1998"/&gt; scholars{{who|date=March 2016}} believe its [[Babylonian captivity|post-exilic]] concepts of [[eschatology]], angelology, and demonology were influenced by [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=Zoroastrianism '''Zoroastrianism'''], NET Bible Study Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jahanian, Daryoush, M.D., [http://www.meta-religion.com/World_Religions/Zoroastrim/zoroastrian-biblical_connections.htm "The Zoroastrian-Biblical Connections,"] at [http://www.meta-religion.com/ meta-religion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Some, however, believe these concepts were received as part of the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Franck, Adolphe (1843), translated by Sossnitz, I. (1926), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/rph/rph16.htm ''The Kabbalah'', or, ''The Religious Philosophy of the Hebrews''], Part Two, Chapter IV, "Continuation of The Analysis of The Zohar: The Kabbalists' View of The World," p. 184 at [http://www.sacred-texts.com sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt; While many people believe today [[Lucifer]] and Satan are different names for the same being, not all scholars subscribe to this view.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Gustav (1967), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ed7yHWuTEewC A Dictionary of Angels, Including The Fallen Angels]'', Free Press, p. 176, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 66-19757, {{ISBN|9780029070505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of authors throughout Christian history have written about demons for a variety of purposes.  Theologians like [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote concerning the behaviors of which Christians should be aware,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1114.htm Thomas Acquinas's Summa Theologica], Question 114, hosted on [[New Advent]]&lt;/ref&gt; while witchhunters like [[Heinrich Kramer]] wrote about how to find and what to do with [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|people they believed were involved with demons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/mm/index.htm Malleus Maleficarum], hosted on the Internet Sacred Text Archive&lt;/ref&gt;  Some texts such as the [[Lesser Key of Solomon]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/lks/lks17.htm Lesser Key of Solomon, The Conjuration To Call Forth Any of the Aforesaid Spirits], hosted on [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[The Grimoire of Pope Honorius]] (although these, the earliest manuscripts, were from well after these individuals had died) are written with [[grimoire|instructions on how to summon demons]] in the name of God and often were claimed to have been written by individuals respected within the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/bcm/bcm14.htm Arthur Edward Waite, Book of Ceremonial Magic, page 64] [http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/bcm/bcm23.htm#page_106 and page 106]&lt;/ref&gt;  These latter texts were usually more detailed, giving names, ranks, and descriptions of demons individually and categorically.&lt;ref name=sacred&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/bcm/bcm14.htm |title=Waite, page 64 |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most Christians commonly reject these texts as either diabolical or fictitious.&lt;ref name=sacred/&gt;

In modern times, some demonological texts have been written by Christians, usually in a similar vein of Thomas Aquinas, explaining their effects in the world and how faith may lessen or eliminate damage by them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SFmrx7s7OtIC&amp;dq=Jessie+Penn-Lewis+war+on+the+saints&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TCR4AVdC-L&amp;sig=N8TVdhBcTt1ev3YCFR-DvOwm9NY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QbnsSvbRCMqztgeM9fA6&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Jessie Penn-Lewis, War on the Saints on Google Books], introductory chapter&lt;/ref&gt;  A few Christian authors, such as [[Jack Chick]] and [[John Todd (occultist)|John Todd]], write with intentions similar to Kramer, proclaiming that demons and their human agents are active in the world.&lt;ref name="broken"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/catalog/comics/0102.asp |title=The Broken Cross - by Jack T. Chick |publisher=Chick.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These claims can stray from mainstream ideology, and may include such beliefs as that [[Christian rock]] is a means through which demons influence people.

Not all Christians believe that demons exist in the literal sense. There is the view that the language of exorcism in the New Testament is an example of what was once employed to describe the healings of what would be classified in modern days as epilepsy, mental illness etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realdevil.info/4-1.htm |title=The Devil, Satan And Demons |publisher=Realdevil.info |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{further information|Hindu demon}}
Vedic Scriptures include a range of spirits (Vetalas, [[Raksha (Vedic)|Rakshasa]]s, Bhutas and Pishachas) that might be classified as demons. These spirits are souls of beings that have committed certain specific sins. As a purging punishment, they are condemned to roam without a physical form for a length of time, until a rebirth. Beings that died with unfulfilled desires or anger are also said to "linger" until such issues are resolved. Hindu text [[Atharvaveda]] gives an account of nature and habitats of such spirits including how to persuade/control them. There are [[occult]] traditions in Hinduism that seeks to control such spirits to do their bidding. Hindu text [[Garuda Purana]] details other kinds of punishments and judgments given out in [[Hell]]; this also given an account of how the spirit travels to nether worlds.

===Islam===
Islam has no doctrinal hierarchy of demonology. Even though some Muslim scholars tried to classify jinn and demons, there is no established classification and terms on [[jinn]] may overlap or used interchangeable. Naming the Jinn also depends on cultural influences. [[Julius Wellhausen]] states, that Islamic ''demonology'' is also [[zoology]].&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} page 114 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Many demonic or demon-like entities are not purely spiritual, but also physical in nature and related to animals. One prominent classification is made by [[Jahiz]]&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} page 63 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Amir: A Jinni, who lives among humans
* [[Shaitan]]: malicious and rebellious Jinn
* [[Marid]]: A stronger type of Shaitan, trying to steal news from heaven
* [[Ifrit]]: the most powerful type of Shayateen

The German orientalist [[Almut Wieland-Karimi]] classified the Jinn in the ten most common categories mentioned in folklore literature &lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} page 67 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Jinn or [[Jann (legendary creature)|Jann]]: Ordinary Jinn, a class apart from other Jinn types, but also used as a collective to refer to invisible beings in general
* Shaitan: Malevolent Jinni, who causes illness and madness
* Ifrit: Delimitation to ordinary Jinn remains unclear. Can be either a powerful cunning Jinn or strong Shaitan. Ifrits are in general bad.
* Marid: A haughty and powerful Shaitan or very malevolent Ifrit.
* Bu'Bu: A Jinn frightening Children.
* [[Sila (mythology)|Si'lah]]: A female demon, seducing men.
* Amir: Spirits dwelling in houses.
* [[Ghul]]: Generally evil and living in the desert.
* Qarina: The name for a specific demon struggling children.
* [[Hatif]]: A mysterious phenomen, which can just be heard but never seen.

The Ghul and the Si'lah often challanged orientalists to hold them apart, because both are shapeshifter and also appear as females to seduce men. A Ghul in Arabic meaning, terms any shapeshifting spirit, including the Si'lah.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 140&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Marid and Ifrit may be hard to distinguish, since they are often used interchangeable, for example in "[[One Thousand and One Nights ]]". However both entities have properties apart from the other. The Ifrit is also related to the [[ghost]]s of the dead, seeking for revenge, unlike the Marid. On the other hand, the Marid  is related to assistans of truthsayers, striving to heaven to access informations from the angels, while the Ifrit does not.

Additionally the [[Peri]] and the [[Daeva]] are kinds of Jinn in [[Persian people|Persian]] lore. While the Daeva are akin to the Shayateen, subordinates of [[Satan]], the Peris are good Jinn fighting the Daeva. However the Peri may endanger people, if they become angered.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lebling ''Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar'' I.B.Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|185}}

[[Ahmad al-Buni]] relates four Ifrits to archdemons, diametral to the four archangels of Islam. They have their own Shayateen under command but are subordinate to [[Iblis]], who is thought to be the leader of Shayateen.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lebling ''Robert Lebling'' I.B.Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}} page 86-87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{see also|Jewish mythology}}
[[Judaism]] does not have a demonology or any set of doctrines about demons.&lt;ref name="MM_1998"&gt;Mack, Carol K., Mack, Dinah (1998), ''A Field Guide to Demons, Fairies, Fallen Angels and Other Subversive Spirits'', p. XXXIII, New York: Henry Holt and Co., {{ISBN|0-8050-6270-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Use of the name "Lucifer" stems from {{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3–20|NIV}}, a passage which does speak of the defeat of a particular [[Babylon]]ian King, to whom it gives a title which refers to what in English is called the Day Star or Morning Star (in Latin, ''lucifer'', meaning "light-bearer", from the words ''lucem ferre'').&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Gustav (1967), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ed7yHWuTEewC A Dictionary of Angels, Including The Fallen Angels]'', Free Press, p. 176, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 66-19757, {{ISBN|9780029070505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is more than one instance in Jewish medieval myth and lore where demons are said to have come to be, as seen by the Grigori angels, of [[Lilith]] leaving Adam, of demons such as [[vampire]]s, unrest spirits in [[Jewish mythology|Jewish folklore]] such as the [[dybbuk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=245&amp;letter=D&amp;search=demonology Demonology] at [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/ jewishencyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "wars"&gt;Josephus, Flavius, [http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/josephus.html ''Wars of The Jews''], Book VII, Chapter VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
In the [[Zoroastrian]] tradition, [[Ahura Mazda]], as the force of good [[Amesha Spenta|Spenta Mainyu]], will eventually be victorious in a cosmic battle with an evil force known as [[Angra Mainyu]] or Ahriman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/zor33.html "Who are the Zoroastrians,"] at [http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/ tenets.zoroastrianism.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EverGreene Architectural Arts''' (EverGreene), based in New York City, is a specialty contractor and design studio working with commercial, government, institutional, sacred and theater clients in the areas of interior [[Conservation-restoration|restoration, conservation]], decoration and new design. Established in 1978, EverGreene is a company of artists, conservators, [[Artisan|craftsmen]] and designers who work throughout the United States and several sites abroad.

The company operates as both an art studio and a contractor combining art, science and technology as designers and craftsmen work side-by-side.

== History ==
In 1976, with the advent of the Historic Preservation tax Incentives, interest in historic preservation grew in the United States. EverGreene, originally started as a firm that almost exclusively focused on decorative painting and murals, expanded in size and service offerings to assist clients and owners of historic structures including: [[courthouse]]s, [[State Capitol Building|state capitols]], [[Church building|churches]], [[synagogue]]s, [[theater]]s and [[commercial buildings]]. To execute large scale projects, EverGreene will often partner with [[Architectural firm|architecture firms]] during the design and planning phases and with [[general contractors]] as a specialty contractor.

Him was born '''Jerzy Himmelfarb''' in 1900 to  a Polish-Jewish family in [[Lodz]], which was then in the [[Russian Empire]] and is now in Poland.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buckman|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|year=1998|title=Artists in Britain Since 1945 Vol 1, A to L |ISBN=0 95326 095 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; After  schooling and further education  in [[Warsaw]] Him studied Roman Law in Moscow but left in 1917 when the [[Russian Revolution]] forced the closure of the university he was attending. He moved to [[Bonn]] and by 1924 had completed a PhD at the [[University of Bonn]] on the comparative history of religions before deciding to study graphic art in [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="Horne"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Horne|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1994|title=The Dictionary of 20th Century British Book Illustrators |ISBN=1 85149 1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Him studied at the Leipzig Academy of Graphic Art but even before he graduated in 1928 was already undertaking commercial commissions.&lt;ref name=UOBDAgh/&gt; Him returned to Poland where, in 1933, he changed his name and also established a design partnership with [[Jan Le Witt]].&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Slocombe|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2014|title=British Posters of the Second World War |ISBN=978-1-904897-92-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working as Lewitt-Him, the two established a distinctive design style which combined cubist and surrealist elements, often in a humorous context.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt; Their most notable work in Poland were illustrations for an experimental poetry group known as ''Skamander''.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt;
[[File:Think Ahead Art.IWMPST8414.jpg|thumb|''Think Ahead Telegraph and Telephone Less'' (Art.IWM PST 8414) (1944) by LeWitt-Him for the [[General Post Office|GPO]] ]]

Him and Le Witt worked together in Poland for several years before, in 1937, they relocated the Lewitt-Him design business to London, following an exhibition of their work there by the publishers Lund Humphries. The pair quickly gained commercial contracts with [[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]] and [[Imperial Airways]] as well as illustrating children's books, such as ''The Little Red Engine Gets a Name'' (1942) by [[Diana Ross (author)|Diana Ross]].&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt; In London during [[World War II]] the partnership received notable commissions for information and public safety posters from, among others, the [[General Post Office]], the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]] and the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt;

Him was naturalized as a British citizen in 1948 and the Lewitt-Him partnership enjoyed great success. Notable commissions included designing the giant umbrella tree for the Wet Weather section of the 1946 ''Britain Can Make It'' exhibition, the [[Guinness]] clock tower for [[Battersea Park]] Pleasure Gardens and murals for the Education Pavilion of the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref name=UOBDAgh&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/resources/rdis-at-britain-can-make-it,-1946/george-him |title=George Him|date= |accessdate=1 December 2017|work=University of Brighton Design Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lewitt-Him partnership was dissolved in 1954, when Le Witt decided to focus on developing his abstract paintings and artworks. Him continued to work as a commercial designer. Among the advertising campaigns he illustrated was the 1950s ''Schweppeshire'' campaign for the [[Schweppes]] drinks company.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt; Him's other clients numbered several airlines, including [[Pan-American Airways]], [[El Al]] and [[American Overseas Airlines]] plus the publishers of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' and [[Penguin Books]].&lt;ref name=UOBDAgh/&gt; He continued to illustrate books but also designed exhibition stands, such as the Australia stand at the 1960 [[Ideal Home Exhibition]] and large window displays, notably for the [[De Bijenkorf]] store in [[Rotterdam]] and the 1961 Christmas windows for the [[Design Centre]] in London.&lt;ref name=UOBDAgh/&gt;

From 1969 until 1977, Him taught graphic design at [[Leicester Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; Him was an active artist up until the very end of his life. Two retrospective exhibitions of his work have been held, one in 1976 at the [[London College of Printing]] and another in 1978 at the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; In 1977 Him was awarded the Francis Williams Book Illustration Award and in 1978 became a [[Royal Designer for Industry]].&lt;ref name="Horne"/&gt;

[[File:Magnetic Hill, New Brunswick.JPG|thumb|Water appearing to run uphill at [[Magnetic Hill (Moncton)|Magnetic Hill]] in [[New Brunswick]]]]
A '''gravity hill''', also known as a '''magnetic hill''', '''mystery hill''', '''mystery spot''', '''gravity road''', or '''anti-gravity hill''', is a place where the layout of the surrounding land produces an [[optical illusion]], making a slight downhill slope appear to be an uphill slope. Thus, a car left out of gear will appear to be rolling uphill against [[gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/roll-uphill.html University of California Riverside article on phenomenon]&lt;/ref&gt; There are hundreds of recognised gravity hills around the world. 

The slope of gravity hills is an optical illusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bressan|first=Paola|last2=Garlaschelli|first2=Luigi|last3=Barracano|first3=Monica|date=2003|title=Antigravity Hills are Visual Illusions|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.02451|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=441–449|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.02451|via=}} [https://zenodo.org/record/1006741#.Wdx33hhh1YI Free full text]&lt;/ref&gt; although sites are often accompanied by claims that [[magnetism|magnetic]] or [[supernatural]] forces are at work. The most important factor contributing to the illusion is a completely or mostly obstructed [[horizon]]. Without a horizon, it becomes difficult to judge the slope of a surface, as a reliable reference is missing. Objects one would normally assume to be more or less [[perpendicular]] to the ground (such as trees) may actually be leaning, offsetting the visual reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2006/0609-the_mysterious_gravity_hill.htm |publisher=Science Daily |website=ScienceDaily.com |title=The Mysterious Gravity Hill:Physicists Show "Antigravity" Mystery Spots Are Optical Illusions |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217004146/http://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2006/0609-the_mysterious_gravity_hill.htm |archivedate=2008-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illusion is similar to the [[Ames room]], in which objects can also appear to roll against gravity.
 
A similar phenomenon—an uphill road that appears flat—is known in [[bicycle racing]] as a "[[glossary of bicycling#F|false flat]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PCO8d0hhzK4C&amp;pg=PA114 |page= 114 |accessdate= July 20, 2013 |title= Cycling's Greatest Misadventures |editor1-first= Erich |editor1-last= Schweikher |editor2-first= Paul |editor2-last= Diamond |publisher= Casagrande Press LLC |year= 2007 |isbn= 978-0-9769516-2-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RerumNaturaFrescoVdEste.jpg|thumb|[[Mother Nature]] is surrounded by ''grottesche'' in this fresco detail from [[Villa d'Este]].]]
[[File:Renaissance Grotesques Composition.jpg|thumb|right|Renaissance grotesque motifs in assorted formats.]]
[[File:Italia del nord, maschere con ornati, 1590-1610 ca..JPG|thumb|200px|Decorative panel showing the two separable elements of ''Grotesque'': the elaborate acanthus leaf and candelabra type design and the hideous mask or face]]
Since at least the 18th century (in French, German and English), '''grotesque''' (or '''grottoesque''') has come to be used as a general adjective for the strange, mysterious, magnificent, fantastic, hideous, ugly, incongruous, unpleasant, or disgusting, and thus is often used to describe weird shapes and distorted forms such as [[Halloween]] masks. In art, performance, and literature, however, ''grotesque'' may also refer to something that simultaneously invokes in an audience a feeling of uncomfortable bizarreness as well as [[sympathy|sympathetic]] [[pity]]. More specifically, the grotesque forms on [[Gothic architecture|Gothic buildings]], when not used as drain-spouts, should not be called [[gargoyle]]s, but rather referred to simply as grotesques, or [[Chimera (architecture)|chimeras]].&lt;ref&gt;Bridaham, Lester Burbank, introduction by Ralph Adams Cram, “Gargoyles, Chimeres and the Grotesque in French Gothic Sculpture”, Architectural Book Publishing Co., Inc. New York, 1930 p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was originally a noun (1560s), from Italian grottesco (through Middle French), literally "of a cave", from Italian ''grotta'' (see [[grotto]]),&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=grotesque |title=OED-Grotesque etymology |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; an extravagant style of [[Ancient Roman art|Ancient Roman]] decorative art rediscovered and then copied in Rome at the end of the 15th century. The word first was used of paintings found on the walls of basements of Roman ruins that were called at that time ''Le Grotte'' (The Grottoes) due to their appearance. These "caves" were in fact rooms and corridors of the [[Domus Aurea]], the unfinished palace complex started by [[Nero]] after the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in CE 64, which had become overgrown and buried, until they were broken into again, mostly from above. Spreading from Italian to the other European languages, the term was long used largely interchangeably with [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]] and [[moresque]] for types of decorative patterns using curving foliage elements.

Rémi Astruc has argued that although there is an immense variety of motifs and figures, the three main tropes of the grotesque are doubleness, [[hybridity]] and metamorphosis.&lt;ref&gt;Astruc R. (2010), Le Renouveau du grotesque dans le roman du XXe siècle, Paris, Classiques Garnier.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the current understanding of the grotesque as an aesthetic category, he demonstrated how the grotesque functions as a fundamental existential experience. Moreover, Astruc identifies the grotesque as a crucial, and potentially universal, anthropological device that societies have used to conceptualize alterity and change.{{Citation needed (lead)|date=July 2012}} &lt;!--tags removed: for citations in this summary, see main treatment below--&gt;

==History==
[[File:Domus fresco.jpg|thumb|Roman frescos in Nero's [[Domus Aurea]]]]
===Early examples in Roman ornaments===
In art, '''grotesques''' are ornamental arrangements of [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]]s with interlaced garlands and small and fantastic human and animal figures, usually set out in a [[symmetrical]] pattern around some form of architectural framework, though this may be very flimsy. Such designs were fashionable in ancient [[Rome]], as fresco wall decoration, floor mosaics, etc., and were decried by [[Vitruvius]] (c. 30 BC), who in dismissing them as meaningless and illogical, offered the description: "reeds are substituted for columns, fluted appendages with curly leaves and volutes take the place of pediments, candelabra support representations of shrines, and on top of their roofs grow slender stalks and volutes with human figures senselessly seated upon them."

When Nero's palace in Rome, the [[Domus Aurea]], was inadvertently rediscovered in the late 15th century, buried in fifteen hundred years of fill, the first breakthrough was from above, so that those keen to see the rooms had to be lowered down into them on ropes, completing their resemblance to caves, or [[grotto]]es in Italian.  The Roman wall decorations in fresco and delicate [[stucco]] were a revelation.

===Etymology in Renaissance===
[[File:Biblioteca Duomo Siena-2 Apr 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ceiling of the [[Piccolomini Library]]]]
The first appearance of the word ''grottesche'' appears in a contract of 1502 for the [[Piccolomini Library]] attached to the [[duomo]] of [[Siena]]. They were introduced by [[Raphael Sanzio]] and his team of decorative painters, who developed ''grottesche'' into a complete system of ornament in the [[Loggias]] that are part of the series of [[Raphael's Rooms]] in the [[Vatican Palace]], Rome. "The decorations astonished and charmed a generation of artists that was familiar with the grammar of the [[classical orders]] but had not guessed till then that in their private houses the Romans had often disregarded those rules and had adopted instead a more fanciful and informal style that was all lightness, elegance and grace."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward-Jackson, "The Grotesque" in "Some main streams and tributaries in European ornament from 1500 to 1750: part 1" ''The Victoria and Albert Museum Bulletin'' (June 1967, pp 58-70) p 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In these grotesque decorations a tablet or candelabrum might provide a focus; frames were extended into scrolls that formed part of the surrounding designs as a kind of scaffold, as Peter Ward-Jackson noted. Light scrolling grotesques could be ordered by confining them within the framing of a pilaster to give them more structure. [[Giovanni da Udine]] took up the theme of grotesques in decorating the [[Villa Madama]], the most influential of the new Roman villas.
[[File:BLW Pilgrim Bottle, about 1560-1570.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Maiolica]] pilgrim bottle with ''grottesche'' decor, Fontana workshop, [[Urbino]], c 1560-70]]
In the 16th century, such artistic license and irrationality was controversial matter. [[Francisco de Holanda]] puts a defense in the mouth of [[Michelangelo]] in his third dialogue of ''Da Pintura Antiga'', 1548:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"this insatiable desire of man sometimes prefers to an ordinary building, with its pillars and doors, one falsely constructed in grotesque style, with pillars formed of children growing out of stalks of flowers, with [[architrave]]s and [[Cornice (architecture)|cornice]]s of branches of myrtle and doorways of reeds and other things, all seeming impossible and contrary to reason, yet it may be really great work if it is performed by a skillful artist."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in David Summers, "Michelangelo on Architecture", ''The Art Bulletin'' '''54'''.2 (June 1972:146-157) p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mannerism===
[[Image:Grotesqueengraving.jpg|thumb|250px|Grotesque engraving on paper, about 1500 - 1512, by [[Nicoletto da Modena]].]]
The delight of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists and their patrons in arcane iconographic programs available only to the erudite could be embodied in schemes of ''grottesche'',&lt;ref&gt;An example, the vaulted arcade in the Palazzo del Governatore, Assisi, which was frescoed with grotesques in 1556, has been examined in the monograph by Ezio Genovesi, ''Le grottesche della 'Volta Pinta' in Assisi'' (Assisi, 1995): Genovesi explores the role of the local Accademia del Monte.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Alciato]]'s ''[[Emblemata]]'' (1522) offered ready-made iconographic shorthand for vignettes. More familiar material for grotesques could be drawn from [[Metamorphoses|Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'']].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Kommerell, ''Metamorphosed Margins: The Case for a Visual Rhetoric of the Renaissance 'Grottesche' under the Influence of Ovid's Metamorphoses'' (Hildesheim, 2008)..&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vatican loggias]], a [[loggia]] corridor space in the [[Apostolic Palace]] open to the elements on one side, were decorated around 1519 by [[Raphael]]s's large team of artists, with [[Giovanni da Udine]] the main hand involved.  Because of the relative unimportance of the space, and a desire to copy the Domus Aurea style, no large paintings were used, and the surfaces were mostly covered with grotesque designs on a white background, with paintings imitating sculptures in niches, and small figurative subjects in a revival of Ancient Roman style. This large array provided a repertoire of elements that were the basis for later artists across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

In Michelangelo's [[Medici Chapel]] Giovanni da Udine composed during 1532-33 "most beautiful sprays of foliage, rosettes and other ornaments in stucco and gold" in the coffers and "sprays of foliage, birds, masks and figures", with a result that did not please [[Pope Clement VII|Pope Clement VII Medici]], however, nor [[Giorgio Vasari]], who whitewashed the grottesche decor in 1556.&lt;ref&gt;"''bellissimi fogliami, rosoni ed altri ornamenti di stuccho e d'oro''" and "''fogliami, uccelli, maschere e figure''", quoted by Summers 1972:151 and note 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Counter Reformation]] writers on the arts, notably Cardinal [[Gabriele Paleotti]], bishop of Bologna,&lt;ref&gt;Paleotti, ''Discorso intorno alle imagini sacre e profane'' (printed at Bologna, 1582)&lt;/ref&gt; turned upon ''grottesche'' with a righteous vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Summers 1972:152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasari, echoing Vitruvius, described the style as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Grotesques are a type of extremely licentious and absurd painting done by the ancients ... without any logic, so that a weight is attached to a thin thread which could not support it, a horse is given legs made of leaves, a man has crane's legs, with countless other impossible absurdities; and the bizarrer the painter's imagination, the higher he was rated".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vasari recorded that [[Francesco Bacchiacca|Francesco Ubertini, called "Bacchiacca"]], delighted in inventing ''grotteschi'', and (about 1545) painted for Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo de' Medici]] a ''[[studiolo]]'' in a mezzanine at the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] "full of animals and rare plants".&lt;ref&gt;"Dilettossi il Bacchiacca di far grottesche; onde al Sig. duca Cosimo fece uno studiolo pieno d'animali e d'erbe rare ritratte dalle naturali, che sono tenute bellissime": quoted in Francesco Vossilla, "Cosimo I, lo scrittoio del Bachiacca, una carcassa di capodoglio e la filosofia naturale", ''Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Institutes in Florenz'', '''37.'''.2/3 (1993:381-395) p. 383; only fragments survive of the decor.&lt;/ref&gt; Other 16th-century writers on ''grottesche'' included [[Daniele Barbaro]], [[Pirro Ligorio]] and [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]].&lt;ref&gt;All mentioned by Ezio Genovesi 1995, in providing explanation of the genre in the context of the painted vaulting at Assisi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engravings, woodwork, book illustration, decorations===
In the meantime, through the medium of [[engraving]]s the grotesque mode of surface ornament passed into the European artistic repertory of the 16th century, from Spain to Poland. A classic suite was that attributed to [[Enea Vico]], published in 1540-41 under an evocative explanatory title, ''Leviores et extemporaneae picturae quas grotteschas vulgo vocant'', "Light and extemporaneous pictures that are vulgarly called grotesques". Later [[Mannerist]] versions, especially in engraving, tended to lose that initial lightness and be much more densely filled than the airy well-spaced style used by the Romans and Raphael.

Soon ''grottesche'' appeared in [[marquetry]] (fine woodwork), in [[maiolica]] produced above all at [[Urbino]] from the late 1520s, then in book illustration and in other decorative uses. At [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] [[Rosso Fiorentino]] and his team enriched the vocabulary of grotesques by combining them with the decorative form of [[strapwork]], the portrayal of leather straps in plaster or wood moldings, which forms an element in grotesques.
[[File:Boudoir.jpg|thumb|left|French [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] painted decor in the Raphaelesque ''grotesque'' manner at [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], 1780s]]

===From Baroque to Victorian era===
[[File:Groteskmask i guldtråd på schabrak, 1600-1650 - Skoklosters slott - 102320.tif|thumb|Grotesque made of gold thread on saddle pad, dated from 1600-1650.]]
In the 17th and 18th centuries the grotesque encompasses a wide field of [[teratology]] (science of monsters) and artistic experimentation. The monstrous, for instance, often occurs as the notion of ''play''. The sportiveness of the grotesque category can be seen in the notion of the preternatural category of the ''lusus naturae'', in natural history writings and in cabinets of curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mauries|first=Patrick|title=Cabinets of Curiosities|year=2002|publisher=Thames and Hudson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorraine Daston and Katharine Park|title=Wonders and the Order of Nature|year=1998|publisher=Zone Books|location=USA: New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last vestiges of romance, such as the marvellous also provide opportunities for the presentation of the grotesque in, for instance, operatic spectacle. The mixed form of the novel was commonly described as grotesque - see for instance Fielding's "comic epic poem in prose". (''Joseph Andrews'' and ''Tom Jones'')

Grotesque ornament received a further impetus from new discoveries of original Roman frescoes and stucchi at [[Pompeii]] and the other buried sites round [[Mount Vesuvius]] from the middle of the century. It continued in use, becoming increasingly heavy, in the [[Empire Style]] and then in the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] period, when designs often became as densely packed as in 16th-century engravings, and the elegance and fancy of the style tended to be lost.

==Extensions of the term in art==
Artists began to give the tiny faces of the figures in grotesque decorations strange [[caricature]]d expressions, in a direct continuation of the medieval traditions of the [[drolleries]] in the border decorations or initials in [[illuminated manuscript]]s. From this the term began to be applied to larger caricatures, such as those of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and the modern sense began to develop. It is first recorded in English in 1646 from Sir [[Thomas Browne]]:"In nature there are no grotesques".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Grotesque"&lt;/ref&gt; By extension backwards in time, the term became also used for the medieval originals, and in modern terminology medieval drolleries, half-human thumbnail vignettes drawn in the margins, and carved figures on buildings (that are not also waterspouts, and so [[gargoyle]]s) are also called "grotesques".

A boom in the production of works of art in the grotesque genre characterized the period 1920–1933 of [[German art]]. In contemporary illustration art, the "grotesque" figures, in the ordinary conversational sense, commonly appear in the genre ''grotesque art'', also known as [[fantastic art]].

==In literature==
One of the first uses of the term grotesque to denote a literary genre is in [[Essays (Montaigne)|Montaigne's ''Essays'']].&lt;ref&gt;Kayser (1957) I.2 ''Ce discours est bien grotesue''&lt;/ref&gt; The Grotesque is often linked with [[satire]] and [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p20"&gt;Clark (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LOeLRDzui_wC&amp;pg=PR20 pp. 20–1]&lt;/ref&gt; It is an effective artistic means to convey grief and pain to the audience, and for this has been labeled by [[Thomas Mann]] as the "genuine antibourgeois style".&lt;ref name="Clark91p20"/&gt;

Some of the earliest written texts describe grotesque happenings and monstrous creatures. The literature of Myth has been a rich source of monsters; from the one-eyed Cyclops (to cite one example) from Hesiod's ''Theogony'' to Homer's Polyphemus in the ''Odyssey''. Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' is another rich source for grotesque transformations and hybrid creatures of myth. Horace's ''Art of Poetry'' also provides a formal introduction classical values and to the dangers of grotesque or mixed form. Indeed, the departure from classical models of order, reason, harmony, balance and form opens up the risk of entry into grotesque worlds. Accordingly, British literature abounds with native grotesquerie, from the strange worlds of Spenser's allegory in ''The Faerie Queene'', to the tragi-comic modes of 16th-century drama. (Grotesque comic elements can be found in major works such as ''King Lear''.)

Literary works of ''mixed'' genre are occasionally termed grotesque, as are "low" or non-literary genres such as pantomime and farce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harham|first=Geoffrey Galt|title=On the Grotesque|year=1982|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gothic writings often have grotesque components in terms of character, style and location. In other cases, the environment described may be grotesque - whether urban ([[Charles Dickens]]), or the literature of the American south which has sometimes been termed "Southern Gothic". Sometimes the grotesque in literature has been explored in terms of social and cultural formations such as the carnival(-esque) in [[François Rabelais]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]. Terry Castle has written on the relationship between metamorphosis, literary writings and masquerade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castle|first=Terry|title=Masquerade and Civilization|year=1986|publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major source of the grotesque is in satirical writings of the 18th century. [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' provides a variety of approaches to grotesque representation. In poetry, the works of [[Alexander Pope]] provide many examples of the grotesque.

In fiction, characters are usually considered '''grotesque''' if they induce both empathy and disgust. (A character who inspires disgust alone is simply a villain or a [[monster]].) Obvious examples would include the physically deformed and the mentally deficient, but people with cringe-worthy social traits are also included. The reader becomes piqued by the grotesque's positive side, and continues reading to see if the character can conquer their darker side. In Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'', the figure of [[Caliban (character)|Caliban]] has inspired more nuanced reactions than simple scorn and disgust. Also, in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the character of Gollum may be considered to have both disgusting and empathetic qualities, which fit him into the grotesque template.

[[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' is one of the most celebrated grotesques in literature. Dr. Frankenstein's monster can also be considered a grotesque, as well as the title character, [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik]] in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and the Beast in [[Beauty and the Beast]]. Other instances of the romantic grotesque are also to be found in [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], in ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' literature or in Sterne's ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''. The romantic grotesque is far more terrible and sombre than the medieval grotesque, which celebrated laughter and fertility. It is at this point that a grotesque creature such as Frankenstein's monster (in Mary Shelley's novel published in 1818) begins to be presented more sympathetically as the outsider who is the victim of society.&lt;ref&gt;See Jeanne M. Britton, 'Novelistic Sympathy in Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" ' ''Studies in Romanticism'' Vol. 48, No. 1 (Spring, 2009)3-22, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; But the novel also makes the issue of sympathy problematic in an unkind society. This means that society becomes the generator of the grotesque, by a process of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Hanis McLaren Caldwell, ''Literature and Medicine in Nineteenth-Century Britain: from Mary Shelley to George Eliot'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the grotesque monster in ''Frankenstein'' tends to be described as 'the creature.'

The grotesque received a new shape with ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]], when a girl meets fantastic grotesque figures in her fantasy world. Carroll manages to make the figures seem less frightful and fit for [[children's literature]], but still utterly strange. Another comic grotesque writer who played on the relationship between sense and nonsense was [[Edward Lear]]. Humorous, or festive nonsense of this kind has its roots in the seventeenth century traditions of fustian, bombastic and satirical writing.&lt;ref&gt;See Noel Malcolm, ''The Origins of English Nonsense'' (Fontana, 1997). {{ISBN|0006388442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the nineteenth-century category of grotesque body was increasingly displaced by the notion of congenital deformity or medical anomaly.&lt;ref&gt;See George M. Gould and Walter M. Pyle's ''Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine'' (1896).&lt;/ref&gt; Building on this context, the grotesque begins to be understood more in terms as deformity and disability, especially after the First World War, 1914-18. In these terms, the art historian Leah Dickerman has argued that 'The sight of horrendously shattered bodies of veterans returned to the home front became commonplace. The accompanying growth in the prosthetic industry struck contemporaries as creating a race of half-mechanical men and became an important theme in dadaist work.'&lt;ref&gt;Leah Dickerman, ''Dada'', National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2005, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The poetry of [[Wilfred Owen]] displays a poetic and realistic sense of the grotesque horror of war and the human cost of brutal conflict. Poems such as 'Spring Offensive' and 'Greater Love' combined images of beauty with shocking brutality and violence in order to produce a sense of the grotesque clash of opposites. In a similar fashion, Ernst Friedrich (1894–1967), founder of the Berlin Peace Museum, an anarchist and a pacifist, was the author of ''War Against War'' (1924) which used grotesque photographs of mutilated victims of the First World War in order to campaign for peace.

[[Southern Gothic]] is a genre frequently identified with grotesques and [[William Faulkner]] is often cited as the ringmaster. [[Flannery O'Connor]] wrote, "Whenever I'm asked why Southern writers particularly have a penchant for writing about freaks, I say it is because we are still able to recognize one" ("Some Aspects of the Grotesque in Southern Fiction", 1960). In O'Connor's often-anthologized [[short-story]] "[[A Good Man is Hard to Find (short story)|A Good Man Is Hard to Find]]", the Misfit, a serial killer, is clearly a maimed soul, utterly callous to human life but driven to seek the truth. The less obvious grotesque is the polite, doting grandmother who is unaware of her own astonishing selfishness. Another oft-cited example of the grotesque from O'Connor's work is her short-story entitled "A Temple Of The Holy Ghost". The American novelist, [[Raymond Kennedy]] is another author associated with the literary tradition of the grotesque.

==Contemporary writers==

Contemporary writers of literary grotesque fiction include [[Ian McEwan]], [[Katherine Dunn]], [[Alasdair Gray]], [[Angela Carter]], [[Jeanette Winterson]], [[Umberto Eco]], [[Patrick McGrath (novelist)|Patrick McGrath]], [[Natsuo Kirino]], [[Paul G. Tremblay|Paul Tremblay]], [[Matt Bell (author)|Matt Bell]], [[Chuck Palahniuk]], [[Brian Evenson]], [[Caleb J. Ross]] (who writes domestic grotesque fiction),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calebjross.com/study/what-is-domestic-grotesque-fiction-and-why-do-i-write-it/ |title=What is Domestic Grotesque Fiction and Why Do I Write It? |publisher=Calebjross.com |date=2012-01-21 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Thomas (author)|Richard Thomas]] and many authors who write in the [[bizarro fiction|bizarro genre of fiction]]. In 1929, G.L Van Roosbroeck wrote a book called "GROTESQUES" (illustrations by J. Matulka) published by The Williamsport Printing and Binding Co., Williamsport, PA. It is a collection of 6 stories and 3 fables for the children of tomorrow.

== Pop culture ==
Other contemporary writers who have explored the grotesque in pop-culture are [https://books.google.com/books?id=n8cmPNEJk98C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=grotesque+pop+culture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5qMTd7pDMAhXKbz4KHeZbDZIQ6AEIHzAB John Docker], in the context of postmodernism; [https://books.google.com/books?id=wgTYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=grotesque+pop+culture&amp;dq=grotesque+pop+culture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5qMTd7pDMAhXKbz4KHeZbDZIQ6AEILzAE Cintra Wilson], who analyzes celebrity; and [https://www.amazon.com/The-Infantile-Grotesque-Pathology-Sexuality/dp/1934542490 Francis Sanzaro], who discusses its relation to childbirth and obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;Sanzaro, Francis. The Infantile Grotesque: Pathology, Sexuality, and a Theory of Religion. Davies Group Publishers, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre of the Grotesque==
The term '''[[Theatre of the Grotesque]]''' refers to an anti-[[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] school of Italian dramatists, writing in the 1910s and 1920s, who are often seen as precursors of the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].
Characterized by ironic and macabre themes of daily life in the world war 1 era. Theatre of the grotesque was named after the play 'The Mask and the Face' by Luigi Chiarelli, which was described as ' a grotesque in three acts'.

[[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]] is a major author of contemporary grotesque comedy plays.

==In architecture==
{{seemain|chimera (architecture)}}
[[File:Greyfriars grotesques.JPG|thumb|Detail from the [[John Mylne (1611–1667)|John Mylne Monument]] in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]]. The text reads ...''Aetatis Suae 56'' because he died at age 56]]
In architecture the term "grotesque" means a carved stone figure.

Grotesques are often confused with [[gargoyle]]s, but the distinction is that gargoyles are figures that contain a water spout through the mouth, while grotesques do not. Without a water spout, this type of sculpture is also known as a chimera when it depicts fantastical creatures. In the Middle Ages, the term ''babewyn'' was used to refer to both gargoyles and grotesques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Janetta Rebold Benton|authorlink=|title=Holy Terrors: Gargoyles on Medieval Buildings|edition=|publisher=Abbeville Press|year=1997|location=New York|pages=8–10|url=|isbn=0-7892-0182-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''babbuino'', which means "[[baboon]]".

==In typography==
{{main|Grotesque (typeface classification)}}
The word "Grotesque", or "Grotesk" in German, is also frequently used as a synonym for [[sans-serif]] in [[typography]]. At other times, it is used (along with "Neo-Grotesque", "Humanist", "[[Lineal typeface#Lineal|Lineal]]", and "Geometric") to describe a particular style or subset of sans-serif typefaces. The origin of this association can be traced back to English typefounder [[William Thorowgood]], who first introduced the term "grotesque" and in 1835 produced ''7-line pica grotesque''—the first sans-serif typeface containing actual lowercase letters. An alternate etymology is possibly based on the original reaction of other typographers to such a strikingly featureless typeface.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite web|url=http://typenstuff.com/help/4_22%20status%20books.pdf |title=Linéale Grotesques |publisher=Rabbit Moon Press |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102201041/http://typenstuff.com/help/4_22%20status%20books.pdf |archivedate=January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular Grotesque typefaces include [[Franklin Gothic]], [[News Gothic]], [[Haettenschweiler]] and [[Lucida Sans]] (although the latter lacks the [[G#Typographic forms|spurred]] "G"), whereas popular Neo-Grotesque typefaces include [[Arial]], [[Helvetica]] and [[Verdana]].

'''Harriet Shaw Weaver''' (1 September 1876 – 14 October 1961) was a [[Activism|political activist]] and a [[magazine]] [[Editing|editor]]. She was a [[patronage|patron]] of Irish writer [[James Joyce]].

Harriet Shaw Weaver was born in [[Frodsham]], [[Cheshire]], the sixth of eight children of Frederic Poynton Weaver, a [[Physician|doctor]], and Mary (née Wright) Weaver, a wealthy heiress. She was educated privately by a governess, Miss Marion Spooner, until 1894, initially in Cheshire and later in [[Hampstead]]. Her parents denied her wish to go to university. She decided to become a social worker. After attending a course on the [[Economics|economic]] basis of social relations at the [[London School of Economics]] she became involved in [[women's suffrage]] and joined the [[Women's Social and Political Union]].&lt;ref name="spartacus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/WweaverH.htm |title=Harriet Shaw Weaver |publisher=[[Spartacus Educational]] |first=John |last=Simkin |date=August 2014 |access-date=30 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;
 
In 1911 she began subscribing to ''[[Freewoman|The Freewoman]]: A Weekly Feminist Review'', a radical periodical edited by [[Dora Marsden]] and [[Mary Gawthorpe]]. The following year its proprietors withdrew their support from it and Weaver stepped in to save it from financial ruin. In 1913 it was renamed ''[[The New Freewoman]]''. Later that year at the suggestion of the magazine's literary editor, [[Ezra Pound]], the name was changed again to ''[[The Egoist (periodical)|The Egoist]]''. During the following years Weaver made more financial donations to the periodical, becoming more involved with its organisation and also becoming its editor.&lt;ref name="spartacus"/&gt;

Ezra Pound was involved with finding new contributors and one of these was James Joyce. Weaver was convinced of his genius and started to support him, first by serialising ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' in ''The Egoist'' in 1914. When Joyce could not find anyone to publish it as a book, Weaver set up the Egoist Press for this purpose at her own expense. Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' was then serialised in The Egoist but because of its controversial content it was rejected by all the printers approached by Weaver and she arranged for it to be printed abroad. Weaver continued to give considerable support to Joyce and his family but following her reservations about his work that was to become ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', their relationship became strained and then virtually broken. However, on Joyce's death, Weaver paid for his funeral and acted as his executor.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|last=Cottam|first=Rachel|title=Weaver, Harriet Shaw (1876–1961)|id=57346|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Weaver joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] but then, having been influenced by reading [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] ''[[Das Kapital]]'' she joined the [[Communist Party]] in 1938. She was active in this organisation, taking part in demonstrations and selling copies of the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Daily Worker]]''. She also continued her allegiance to the memory of Joyce, acting as his literary executor and helping to compile ''The Letters of James Joyce''. She died at her home near [[Saffron Walden]] in 1961, aged 85, leaving her collection of literary material to the [[British Library]] and to the National Book League.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

'''Hermann Wilhelm Benjamin Eschke''' (6 May 1823, [[Berlin]] - 15 January 1900, Berlin) was a German painter who specialized in [[marine art]].

== Biography ==
In 1840, at the age of seventeen, he began his studies with Professor {{ill|Wilhelm Herbig|de}} and, upon his recommendation, attended the [[Prussian Academy of Art]] from 1841 to 1845. After graduating, he obtained a position in the studios of the marine painter, {{ill|Wilhelm Krause (Künstler)|de|lt=Wilhelm Krause}}, where he remained until 1848. Through Krause's recommendation, he obtained a similar position in the studios of  [[Eugène Lepoittevin]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.retrobibliothek.de/retrobib/seite.html?id=66865#Eschke ''Eschke, Wilhelm Benjamin Hermann''.] In: Hermann Alex. Müller: ''Biographisches Künstler-Lexikon''. Verlag des Bibliographischen Instituts, Leipzig 1882, pg.162&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, he took extensive study trips through Southern France and the [[Pyrenees]]. When he returned to Berlin, he became a freelance artist. Over the next thirty years, he continued to travel frequently; visiting the [[North Sea]], Norway, Wales, the [[Isle of Wight]], [[Jersey]] and [[Brittany]], among other places. All of these trips produced numerous sketches that were later turned into oil paintings, although he also did some work en [[plein aire]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt;

Among his most familiar works are those created together with his son, {{ill|Richard Eschke|de}}, for the "[[Kaiserpanorama]]": ''The German Fleet on Display at Zanzibar'', and ''The Seizure of New Guinea''. Eschke was later given the title "Königlicher Professor" and received a gold medal at an exhibition by the "{{ill|Verein Berliner Künstler|de}}" (Association of Berlin Artists).

He was also well known as a teacher. His students included {{ill|Louis Douzette|de}}, {{ill|Ernst Koerner|de}}, [[Walter Moras]], [[Carl Saltzmann]], [[Alexander Kircher]] and [[Elisabeth Reuter]]. Altogether, he and his wife Anna had ten children, of whom two, Richard and {{ill|Oscar Eschke|de|lt=Oscar}}, became painters.

'''''Interior of a Restaurant in Arles''''' is a colored oil painting executed by the Dutch artist [[Vincent van Gogh]] on an industrially primed canvas of size 25 ''(Toile de 25 figure)'' in [[Arles]], France, late August, 1888.

Accurately dating ''Interior of a Restaurant in Arles'' has been difficult, largely because van Gogh never mentioned the painting in any existing letter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vangoghletters.org See www.vangoghletters.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Leprohon placed it in late August, 1888, due in part to the blossoming sunflowers&lt;ref&gt;Leprohon, Pierre, ''Tel fut Van Gogh'', Editions du Sud, 1964, p 415&lt;/ref&gt; and this has been generally accepted, including by leading 20th century van Gogh scholar [[Jan Hulsker]].&lt;ref name= "Hulsker 356"&gt;Hulsker p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of two studies Vincent created of this restaurant, the other being ''Interior of the Restaurant Carrel in Arles''. Long supposed to be a view from inside the Hotel Carrel, [[Jacob Baart de la Faille | de la Faille]] remarks they were probably the interior of the restaurant next to the [[Yellow House (painting) | Yellow House]]''.&lt;ref&gt;De La Faille p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis==

While certainly a representation of diners in Arles (regardless of the cafe), in his article ''Van Gogh's Last Supper: Transforming "the guise of observable reality,"'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arths.org.uk/about/arthsa/issue41 See Art History Supplement, Vol. 4, Issue 1, January, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Baxter argues this is van Gogh's initial attempt in creating a [[Symbolist]] or [[Boats du Rhône|''sacred realism'']] &lt;ref&gt;See Silverman, Debora, Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Search for Sacred Art, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Last Supper]]'':{{quote|text=There are a number of similarities between this painting and [[Renaissance]] Last Suppers. In the center is a serving figure. Most of the diners are stretched along the far side of the table. Three wine carafes feature prominently in the foreground. Admittedly, not much, but it is a start ...}}

Although Hulsker argued that determining whether this or its sister painting came first would be speculation,&lt;ref group= "Notes"&gt;Hulsker did not believe JH1572 was a preliminary sketch for JH1573 and suggested that Vincent made two near identical copies because one was intended for the owner of the cafe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Hulsker 356"/&gt; Baxter offers the following argument: the second version is painted in a [[Cloisonnist]] style, giving it a stained glass window effect, a suitable medium for a ''Last Supper'' painting; and van Gogh has made a number of changes to the final version, most notably: adding bread and placing a new wine bottle before the central serving figure, giving it emphasis. Furthermore, van Gogh added more diners, including the figure hiding behind, what was once a vase of flowers, now appears to be a palm frond. Also, the flower arrangement on the left now resembles the top of a [[Pollaxe|poll axe]] and is at about the same position where [[Simon Peter]] wields a blade in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (da Vinci)|version]]. But most importantly, right next to it, van Gogh has replicated Leonardo’s leaning image of the [[apostle John]], van Gogh’s favorite.&lt;ref&gt;See Naifeh &amp; Smith, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, van Gogh has enframed a female serving figure within vases of flowers, a motif he would return to months later with his ''[[The Roulin Family (Van Gogh series)|Berceuse]]'' triptych.&lt;ref&gt;Van Uitert, Evert, ''Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin in competition: Vincent’s original contribution'', in ''Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', Vol. 11, No. 2 (1980), pp. 81-106&lt;/ref&gt; And lastly, all the empty chairs, which can be immediately recognizable from ''[[Vincent van Gogh's Décoration for the Yellow House|Vincent’s Chair]]'', also his ''[[Vincent van Gogh's Décoration for the Yellow House|Bedroom in Arles]]'', and he’d just bought twelve to furnish the [[Yellow House (painting)|Yellow House]] literally hours before beginning his final Symbolist's ''Last Supper'' ''[[Café Terrace at Night]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let677/letter.html#n-2 See www.vangoghletters.org Letter 677, note 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Christian Schetky, Loss of the Royal George (exhibited 1840).jpg|thumb|250px|''Loss of the [[HMS Royal George (1756)|Royal George]]'', 1840, [[Tate Britain]].]]

==Early life==
Schetky was descended from an old [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]]-[[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Transylvanian]] family, which, for political reasons, had emigrated to [[Leipzig]] at the beginning of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vibart 1894, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Johann Georg Christoff Schetky, a celebrated composer and [[Cello|cellist]], who had settled in [[Edinburgh]] in 1773, and had married Maria Anna Theresa Reinagle, also of Hungarian descent, in 1774. John Christian was the couple's fourth son. He was educated at the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh]], where he formed a lifelong friendship with his near-contemporary, [[Walter Scott]].

Mars]] and the French [[Seventy-four (ship)|'74]] [[HMS Hercule (1798)|Hercule]] off Brest on 21st April 1798'', private collection.]]

==Career==
Schetky studied art under [[Alexander Nasmyth]]. After travelling on the continent, he settled in [[Oxford]], where he taught for six years as a drawing-master. In 1808 he obtained a post in the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Royal Military College]] at [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Great Marlow]]; and three years later he was appointed professor of drawing in the [[Royal Naval Academy|Royal Naval College]], [[Portsmouth]], where he had ample opportunities for the study of his favourite marine subjects. Following the abolition of the Naval College, he held a similar professorship from 1836 to 1855 at the [[East India Company]]'s [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Military Seminary]] at [[Addiscombe]], Surrey, where the cadets nicknamed him "Sepia Jack".&lt;ref&gt;Vibart 1894, pp. 134–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1805 to 1872 he contributed periodically to the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]]s, and he was represented at the [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]] competition of 1847 by a large oil painting of the [[Battles of Barfleur and La Hougue|Battle of La Hogue]]. He was marine painter to [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] and [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

Among his published works were the illustrations to [[John Manners, 7th Duke of Rutland|Lord John Manners]]'s ''Sketches and Notes of a Cruise in Scotch Waters'' (1850); and a volume entitled ''Reminiscences of the Veterans of the Sea'' (1867), which containing photographs of twenty of his paintings and drawings of the great wooden fighting vessels of the Royal Navy.

One of his best-known works, the ''Loss of the [[HMS Royal George (1756)|Royal George]]'', painted in 1840, is now in [[Tate Britain]]. The [[United Service Club]] formerly possessed another important marine painting, showing [[HMS Endymion (1797)|HMS ''Endymion'']], under the command of Sir [[Charles Paget (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Paget]], rescuing a French [[man-of-war]] from extreme danger of shipwreck.

Schetky died in London on 28 January 1874.

==Personal life==
Schetky married Charlotte Trevenen in 1828. She died in 1867.

==Biography==
A memoir by his daughter, entitled ''Ninety Years of Work and Play'', was published in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Schetky 1877.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Van Gogh spent the last few months of his life in Auvers-sur-Oise, a small town just north of Paris, after he left an asylum at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]] in May 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Van Gogh: The Life|year=2011|publisher=[[Random House]]|first1=Steven|last1=Naifeh|first2=Gregory|last2= White Smith|isbn=0-375-50748-5|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/book/119583/van-gogh-by-steven-naifeh-and-gregory-white-smith|page=822 ''ff.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made the painting in the week following his portraits of [[Paul Gachet|Dr. Gachet]].&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker (1980) p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; The viewpoint from above was a favourite perspective of his since his days sketching in the dunes of [[Scheveningen]] at [[Vincent van gogh#Etten.2C Drenthe and The Hague|The Hague]] with the aid of a perspective frame.&lt;ref&gt;Naifeh and Smith (2011) pp. 290-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh described the painting in a letter to his sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]]:&lt;ref name= "Letter 886 group= Letters" &gt;{{cite web|title= Letter 886: To Willemien van Gogh.

A white road crosses the canvas. On the road a little carriage and white houses with stark red roofs beside this road. Fine rain streaks the whole with blue or grey lines}}

'''Leonard Alfred Schneider''' (October 13, 1925 – August 3, 1966), better known by his stage name '''Lenny Bruce''', was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, and satirist. He was renowned for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated satire, politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. His 1964 conviction in an [[obscenity]] trial was followed by a [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] pardon, the first in the history of New York state, by then-Governor [[George Pataki]] in 2003.

Bruce is renowned for paving the way for future outspoken [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture-era]] comedians, and his trial for obscenity is seen as a landmark for [[freedom of speech in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nndb.com/people/406/000022340/ |title=Lenny Bruce |website=nndb.com |year=2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/24/nyregion/no-joke-37-years-after-death-lenny-bruce-receives-pardon.html |title=No Joke! 37 Years After Death Lenny Bruce Receives Pardon - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=December 24, 2003 |accessdate=December 5, 2013 |first1=John |last1=Kifner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1013.html |title=Lenny Bruce, Uninhibited Comic, Found Dead in Hollywood Home |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=August 4, 1966 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/arts/24carlin.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Mel | last1=Watkins | first2=Bruce | last2=Weber | title=George Carlin, Comic Who Chafed at Society and Its Constraints, Dies at 71 | date=June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him third (behind disciples [[Richard Pryor]] and [[George Carlin]]) on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time].

==Early life==
Lenny Bruce was born Leonard Alfred Schneider to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Mineola, New York]], grew up in nearby [[Bellmore, New York|Bellmore]], and attended [[Wellington C. Mepham High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Ly8IAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=lenny+bruce+Wellington+C.+Mepham+High+School&amp;q=Wellington+C.+Mepham+#search_anchor |title=Ladies and Gentlemen: Lenny Bruce!! |page=107 |author1=Albert Goldman |author2=Lawrence Schiller |publisher=Penguin Books |year= 1991 |accessdate=March 31, 2012|isbn=9780140133622 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced before he turned 10 years old, and Lenny lived with various relatives over the next decade. His British-born father, Myron (Mickey) Schneider, was a shoe clerk and Lenny saw him very infrequently. Bruce's mother, [[Sally Marr]] (legal name Sadie Schneider, born Sadie Kitchenberg), was a stage performer and had an enormous influence on Bruce's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=i3ZcAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Lenny+Bruce%3A+the+making+of+a+prophet&amp;q=Sally+Marr#search_anchor |title=Lenny Bruce: the making of a prophet|page=47 |first=William Karl |last= Thomas |publisher=Archon Books |date= December 1, 1989 |accessdate=March 31, 2012|isbn=9780208022370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending time working on a farm, Bruce joined the [[United States Navy]] at the age of 16 in 1942, and saw active duty during [[World War II]] aboard the {{USS|Brooklyn|CL-40}} fighting in Northern Africa; [[Palermo]], Italy, in 1943; and [[Operation Shingle|Anzio]], Italy, in 1944. In May 1945, after a comedic performance for his shipmates in which he was dressed in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], his commanding officers became upset. He defiantly convinced his ship's medical officer that he was experiencing homosexual urges.&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Goldman. ''Ladies and Gentlemen: Lenny Bruce!!'' (New York: Random House, 1971), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to his undesirable discharge in July 1945. However, he had not admitted to or been found guilty of any breach of naval regulations and successfully applied to have his discharge changed to [[Military discharge|"Under Honorable Conditions ... by reason of unsuitability for the naval service"]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/lenny-bruce-navy-records?page=10 "Lenny Bruce's Gay Naval Ruse: Unearthed documents detail comedian's discharge"], [[TheSmokingGun.com]], August 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, while taping the first episode of [[Hugh Hefner]]'s ''[[Playboy's Penthouse]]'', Bruce talked about his Navy experience and showed a tattoo he received in [[Malta]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0675481/|title="Playboy's Penthouse" Episode #1.1 (TV Episode 1959)|publisher=|accessdate=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short stint in California spent living with his father, Bruce settled in New York City, hoping to establish himself as a comedian. However, he found it difficult to differentiate himself from the thousands of other show business hopefuls who populated the city. One locale where they congregated was Hanson's, the diner where Bruce first met the comedian Joe Ancis,&lt;ref name="Joe Acis: A Brief Biography"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Driven|first1=Joey|title=Joe Acis: A Brief Biography|url=http://www.reverbnation.com/page_object/page_object_blogs/artist_893835|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had a profound influence on his approach to comedy. Many of Bruce's later routines reflected his meticulous schooling at the hands of Ancis.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bruce's biographer [[Albert Goldman]], Ancis's humor involved stream-of-consciousness sexual fantasies and references to jazz.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 105-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenny took the stage as "Lenny Marsalle" one evening at the Victory Club, as a stand-in master of ceremonies for one of his mother's shows. His ad-libs earned him some laughs. Soon afterward, in 1947, just after changing his last name to Bruce, he earned $12 and a free spaghetti dinner for his first stand-up performance in [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.reference.com/browse/lenny+bruce|website=Reference.com|accessdate=February 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092400/http://www.reference.com/browse/lenny+bruce|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later a guest—and was introduced by his mother, who called herself "Sally Bruce"—on the ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' radio program. Lenny did a bit inspired by [[Sid Caesar]], "The [[Bavaria]]n Mimic", featuring impressions of American movie stars (e.g., [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[James Cagney]], and [[Edward G. Robinson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Ben|title=The Comedy Behind the Tragedy|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-comedy-behind-the-tragedy/Content?oid=917393|website=Chicago Reader|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bruce's early comedy career included writing the screenplays for ''[[Dance Hall Racket]]'' in 1953, which featured Bruce, his wife Honey Harlow, and mother Sally Marr in roles; ''[[Dream Follies]]'' in 1954, a low-budget [[American burlesque|burlesque]] romp; and a children's film, ''[[The Rocket Man (film)|The Rocket Man]]'', in 1954. In 1956 [[Frank Ray Perilli]], a fellow nightclub comedian who eventually became a screenwriter of two dozen successful films and plays, became a mentor and part-time manager of Lenny Bruce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamaestro.net/candybutcher.htm The Candy Butcher (2016)] p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Through Perilli, Bruce met and collaborated with photojournalist William Karl Thomas on three screenplays (''Leather Jacket'', ''Killer's Grave'' and ''The Degenerate''), none of which made it to the screen, and the comedy material on the first three albums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamaestro.net/prophet.htm Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet (1989)]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p. 54-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce was a roommate of [[Buddy Hackett]] in the 1950s, they appeared on the ''[[Patrice Munsel|Patrice Munsel Show]]'' (1957–1958), calling their comedy duo the "Not Ready for Prime Time Players,"&lt;ref name="WTF"&gt;{{cite web |title=Episode 966: Sandy Hackett |url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-966-sandy-hackett |website=[[WTF with Marc Maron]] |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20 years before the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live cast members|Saturday Night Live]]'' used the same name. In 1957 Thomas booked Bruce into The Slate Brothers nightclub, where Bruce was fired the first night for what ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' headlined as "blue material"; this led to the theme of Bruce's first solo album on [[Fantasy Records]], ''The Sick Humor of Lenny Bruce'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamaestro.net/prophet.htm Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet (1989)]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} p. 276-229.&lt;/ref&gt; for which Thomas shot the album cover. Thomas also shot other album covers, acted as cinematographer on abortive attempts to film their screenplays, and in 1989 authored a memoir of their ten-year collaboration titled ''Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediamaestro.net/lenny.htm|title=Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet|first=meta tags by William Karl Thomas; web design by William Karl|last=Thomas|website=www.mediamaestro.net|accessdate=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 biography of Frank Ray Perilli titled ''The Candy Butcher'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediamaestro.net/candybutcher.htm|title=The Candy Butcher (2016)|publisher=|accessdate=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; devotes a chapter to Perilli's ten-year collaboration with Bruce.

Bruce released a total of four albums of original material on Berkeley-based Fantasy Records, with rants, comic routines, and satirical interviews on the themes that made him famous: [[jazz]], [[Ethics|moral philosophy]], politics, patriotism, religion, law, [[Race (human categorization)|race]], abortion, [[psychoactive drug|drugs]], the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and [[Jewish peoplehood|Jewishness]]. These albums were later compiled and re-released as ''The Lenny Bruce Originals''. Two later records were produced and sold by Bruce himself, including a 10-inch album of the 1961 San Francisco performances that started his legal troubles. Starting in the late 1950s, other unissued Bruce material was released by [[Alan Douglas (record producer)|Alan Douglas]], [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Phil Spector]], as well as Fantasy. Bruce developed the complexity and tone of his material in [[Enrico Banducci]]'s [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] nightclub, the "[[hungry i]]", where [[Mort Sahl]] had earlier made a name for himself.

Branded a "sick comic"—though it was the perceived "sickness" of modern society that he was railing about—Bruce was essentially blacklisted from television, and when he did appear thanks to sympathetic fans like [[Steve Allen]] or Hugh Hefner, it was with great concessions to [[Broadcast Standards and Practices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Museum of Television &amp; Radio Presents Two Five-Letter Words: Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/pressrelease-2004-lenny-bruce|website=The Paley Center for Media|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes that might offend, like a bit on airplane [[inhalant|glue-sniffing]] teenagers that was done live for ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' in 1959, had to be typed out and pre-approved by network officials.

His growing fame led to appearances on the nationally televised ''Steve Allen Show'', where he made his debut with an unscripted comment on the recent marriage of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] to [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], wondering, "will Elizabeth Taylor become [[bar and bat mitzvah|bar mitzvahed]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=oCplnUga0hU?t=1m45s|title=Lenny Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--San Francisco columnist [[Herb Caen]], however, was an early and enthusiastic supporter, writing in 1959:
&lt;blockquote&gt;They call Lenny Bruce a [[sick comic]], and sick he is. Sick of all the pretentious phoniness of a generation that makes his vicious humor meaningful. He is a rebel, but not without a cause, for there are shirts that need un-stuffing, egos that need deflating. Sometimes you feel guilty laughing at some of Lenny's mordant jabs, but that disappears a second later when your inner voice tells you with pleased surprise, 'but that's true.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;
--&gt;
On February 3, 1961, in the midst of a severe blizzard, he gave a famous performance at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York. It was recorded and later released as a three-disc set, titled ''The Carnegie Hall Concert''.{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}} In the liner notes, Albert Goldman described it as follows:{{cite quote|date=June 2016}}

{{quote|This was the moment that an obscure yet rapidly rising young comedian named Lenny Bruce chose to give one of the greatest performances of his career. ... The performance contained in this album is that of a child of the jazz age. Lenny worshiped the gods of Spontaneity, Candor and [[Free association (psychology)|Free Association]]. He fancied himself an oral jazzman. His ideal was to walk out there like [[Charlie Parker]], take that mike in his hand like a horn and blow, blow, blow everything that came into his head just as it came into his head with nothing censored, nothing translated, nothing mediated, until he was pure mind, pure head sending out brainwaves like radio waves into the heads of every man and woman seated in that vast hall. Sending, sending, sending, he would finally reach a point of [[clairvoyance]] where he was no longer a performer but rather a medium transmitting messages that just came to him from out there—from recall, fantasy, prophecy.

A point at which, like the practitioners of [[automatic writing]], his tongue would outrun his mind and he would be saying things he didn't plan to say, things that surprised, delighted him, cracked him up—as if he were a spectator at his own performance!}}

==Personal life==
In 1951, Bruce met [[Honey Bruce|Honey Harlow]], a [[stripper]] from [[Manila, Arkansas]]. They were married that same year, and Bruce was determined she end her work as a stripper.&lt;ref&gt;Kottler, Jeffrey A., ''Divine Madness: Ten Stories of Creative Struggle'' (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2006), 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce and Harlow eventually left New York City in 1953 for the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where they got work as a double act at the Cup and Saucer in Los Angeles, California. Bruce then went on to join the bill at the club Strip City. Harlow found employment at the Colony Club, which was widely known to be the best burlesque club in Los Angeles at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce left Strip City in late 1954 and found work within the [[San Fernando Valley]] at a variety of strip clubs. As the master of ceremonies, he introduced the strippers while performing his own ever-evolving material. The clubs of the Valley provided the perfect environment for Bruce to create new routines: According to Bruce's primary biographer, Albert Goldman, it was "precisely at the moment when he sank to the bottom of the barrel and started working the places that were the lowest of the low" that he suddenly broke free of "all the restraints and inhibitions and disabilities that formerly had kept him just mediocre and began to blow with a spontaneous freedom and resourcefulness that resembled the style and inspiration of his new friends and admirers, the jazz musicians of the modernist school."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Honey and Lenny's daughter Kitty Bruce was born in 1955.&lt;ref name="Ofiicial Lenny Bruce site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology – The 50s|url=http://www.lennybruceofficial.com/the-life-of-lenny-bruce/chronology-the-50s/|website=The Official Lenny Bruce Site|publisher=Mystic Liquid|accessdate=November 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113122849/http://www.lennybruceofficial.com/the-life-of-lenny-bruce/chronology-the-50s/|archive-date=November 13, 2011|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an affair with the jazz singer [[Annie Ross]] in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/movies/pop-music-a-free-spirited-survivor-lands-on-her-feet.html|title=A Free-Spirited Survivor Lands on Her Feet|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 3, 1993|first=James|last=Gavin|accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Lenny's divorce from Honey was finalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/406/000022340/|website=NNDB|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal troubles==
[[File:Lenny Bruce arrest.jpg|thumb|upright|Bruce at his arrest in 1961]]
Bruce's desire to end his wife's stripper days led him to pursue schemes that were designed to make as much money as possible. The most notable was the Brother Mathias Foundation scam, which resulted in Bruce's arrest in Miami, Florida in 1951 for impersonating a priest. He had been soliciting donations for a [[leprosy|leper]] colony in [[British Guiana]] (now [[Guyana]]) under the auspices of the "Brother Mathias Foundation", which he had legally chartered—the name was his own invention, but possibly referred to the actual Brother Matthias who had befriended [[Babe Ruth]] at the Baltimore orphanage to which Ruth had been confined as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chatterfromthedugout.com/babe_and_brother_matthias.htm |title=Babe Ruth and Brother Matthias |publisher=Chatterfromthedugout.com |date= |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce had stolen several priests' clergy shirts and a clerical collar while posing as a laundry man. He was found not guilty because of the legality of the New York state-chartered foundation, the actual existence of the Guiana [[leper colony]], and the inability of the local clergy to expose him as an impostor. Later, in his semifictional autobiography ''[[How to Talk Dirty and Influence People]]'', Bruce said that he had made about $8,000 in three weeks, sending $2,500 to the leper colony and keeping the rest.

===Obscenity arrests===
On October 4, 1961, Bruce was arrested for obscenity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/lennybruce/chronology.htm#1961|title=Lenny Bruce – Chronology|access-date=June 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613155335/http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/lennybruce/chronology.htm#1961|archive-date=June 13, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Jazz Workshop]] in San Francisco; he had used the word ''[[wikt:cocksucker|cocksucker]]'' and riffed that "''to'' is a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]], ''come'' is a [[verb]]", that the sexual context of ''[[orgasm|come]]'' is so common that it bears no weight, and that if someone hearing it becomes upset, he "probably can't come".&lt;ref name=UMKC&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Lenny|title=To is a Preposition, Come is a Verb|website=The Trials of Lenny Bruce|publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the jury acquitted him, other law enforcement agencies began monitoring his appearances, resulting in frequent arrests under charges of obscenity.
[[File:Lenny Bruce Mugshot 4-27-63.jpg|thumb|left|Bruce in 1963, after having been arrested in San Francisco]]
Bruce was arrested again in 1961, in [[Philadelphia]], for [[drug possession]] and again in Los Angeles, two years later. The Los Angeles arrest took place in then-unincorporated [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], and the arresting officer was a young deputy named [[Sherman Block]], who later became County Sheriff. The specification this time was that the comedian had used the word ''[[Schmuck (pejorative)|schmuck]]'', an insulting [[Yiddish]] term that is an obscene term for penis. The Hollywood charges were later dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, David C. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ny1o6iXffDgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=yiddish+dictionary&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=shmuck English-Yiddish, Yiddish-English Dictionary: Romanized]'' Hippocrene Books, 1995. p.144. {{ISBN|0-7818-0439-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 1962, Bruce was arrested on stage at the legendary Gate of Horn folk club in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comedians in Courthouses Getting Cuffed: Lenny Bruce and George Carlin, December 1962|url=http://thecomicscomic.com/2014/03/25/comedians-in-courthouses-getting-cuffed-lenny-bruce-and-george-carlin-december-1962/|website=The Critic's Comic|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he played at [[Peter Cook]]'s [[The Establishment (club)|The Establishment]] club in London, and in April the next year he was barred from entering England by the [[Home Office]] as an "undesirable alien".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lennybruceofficial.com/the-life-of-lenny-bruce/chronology-the-60s/ |title=Chronology – The 60's &amp;#124; The Official Lenny Bruce Website |publisher=Lennybruceofficial.com |date= |accessdate=December 5, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108235828/http://www.lennybruceofficial.com/the-life-of-lenny-bruce/chronology-the-60s/ |archive-date=November 8, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1964, he appeared twice at the [[Cafe Au Go Go]] in [[Greenwich Village]], with undercover police detectives in the audience. He was arrested along with the club owners, Howard and Elly Solomon, who were arrested for allowing an obscene performance to take place. On both occasions, he was arrested after leaving the stage, the complaints again pertaining to his use of various obscenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linder|first1=Doug|title=The Trials of Lenny Bruce|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/bruce/bruceaccount.html|website=Famous Trials: The Lenny Bruce Trial 1964|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A three-judge panel presided over his widely publicized six-month trial, prosecuted by Manhattan Assistant D.A. [[Richard Kuh]], with [[Ephraim London]] and Martin Garbus as the defense attorneys. Bruce and club owner Howard Solomon were both found guilty of obscenity on November 4, 1964.

==Later years==
[[File:Lenny Bruce at the Fillmore.jpg|thumb|Poster for Bruce's last series of performances, which took place at [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco on June 24 and 25, 1966]]

Despite his prominence as a comedian, Bruce appeared on network television only six times in his life.&lt;ref name=paley&gt;{{cite web |title=The Museum of Television &amp; Radio Presents Two Five-Letter Words: Lenny Bruce |url=http://www.paleycenter.org/pressrelease-2004-lenny-bruce|website=[[The Paley Center for Media]] |accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later club performances, Bruce was known for relating the details of his encounters with the police directly in his comedy routine. These performances often included rants about his court battles over obscenity charges, tirades against fascism and complaints that he was being denied his right to [[freedom of speech]].

Bruce was banned outright from several U.S. cities, and in September 1962, his only visit to Australia caused a media storm—although, contrary to popular belief, he was not banned, nor was he forced to leave the country. Bruce was booked for a two-week engagement at Aaron's Exchange Hotel, a small pub in central Sydney by the American-born, Australian-based promoter [[Lee Gordon (promoter)|Lee Gordon]], who was by then deeply in debt, nearing the end of his formerly successful career, and desperate to save his business.

Bruce's first show at 9&amp;nbsp;p.m. on September&amp;nbsp;6 was uneventful, but his second show at 11&amp;nbsp;p.m. led to a major public controversy. Bruce was heckled by audience members during his performance, and when local actress, Barbara Wyndon, stood up and complained that Bruce was only talking about America, and asked him to talk about something different, a clearly annoyed Bruce responded, "Fuck you, madam. That's different, isn't it?" His remark shocked some members of the audience and several walked out. By the next day the local press had blown the incident up into a major controversy, with several Sydney papers denouncing Bruce as "sick" and one even illustrating their story with a retouched photograph appearing to show Bruce giving a fascist salute. The venue owners immediately cancelled the rest of Bruce's performances, and he retreated to his Kings Cross hotel room. Local university students (including future [[OZ (magazine)|''OZ'']] magazine editor [[Richard Neville (writer)|Richard Neville]]) who were fans of Bruce's humour tried to arrange a performance at the Roundhouse at the [[University of New South Wales]], but at the last minute the university's Vice-Chancellor rescinded permission to use the venue, with no reason given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Neville |title=Hippie Hippie Shake |publisher=William Heinemann |location=Australia |year=1995 |ISBN=085615230 |pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an interview he was scheduled to give on Australian television was cancelled in advance by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce remained largely confined to his hotel, but eight days later Bruce gave his third and last Australian concert at the [[Wintergarden Theatre]] in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Although the theatre had a capacity of 2,100, only 200 people attended, including a strong police presence, and in the event Bruce gave what was described as a "subdued" performance. It was long rumoured that a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC05aUlFXOE|tape recording] of Bruce's historic performance was made by police, but it was, in fact, recorded by a local jazz saxophonist, Sid Powell, who brought a portable tape recorder to the show. The tape was rediscovered in 2011 in the possession of Australian singer [[Sammy Gaha]], who had acted as Bruce's chauffeur during his visit, and it was subsequently donated to the Lenny Bruce audio collection at [[Brandeis University]]. Bruce left the country a few days later and spoke little about the experience afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revolve.com.au/pdfs/lennybruce.pdf |author=Derek Strahan |title=When I opened for Lenny Bruce in Australia |website=revolve.com |publisher= |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/lenny_bruces_visit_to_sydney_1962 |title=Lenny Bruce's visit to Sydney 1962 |website=dictionaryofsydney.org |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://michaeladamswrites.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/lenny-bruce.pdf |author=Michael Adams |title=When Lenny Met Sydney |website=michaeladamswrites wordpress site |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/lenny-bruce-and-his-ill-fated-sydney-tour/4636758 |title=Lenny Bruce and his ill-fated Sydney tour |date=April 18, 2013 |accessdate=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing drug use also affected his health. By 1966, he had been [[Blacklisting|blacklisted]] by nearly every nightclub in the United States, as owners feared prosecution for obscenity. Bruce gave a famous performance at the [[Berkeley Community Theatre]] in December 1965. It was recorded and became his last live album, titled ''The Berkeley Concert''; his performance here has been described as lucid, clear and calm, and one of his best. His last performance took place on June 25, 1966, at The Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, on a bill with [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]].&lt;ref name="graham"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=wnZ0qL3QdkgC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Lenny+Bruce+fillmore+%22whacked+out+on+amphetamines#v=onepage&amp;q=%22whacked%20out%20on%20amphetamines%22 | title=Bill Graham Presents: My Life Inside Rock and Out | publisher=Da Capo Press | date=2004 | accessdate=November 18, 2014 |author1=Graham, Bill | author1link = Bill Graham (promoter)|author2=Greenfield, Robert| author2link =Robert Greenfield| page=156 | isbn=978-0306813498}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was not remembered fondly by [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], whose memoir describes Bruce as "whacked out on [[amphetamines|amphetamine]]";&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Graham thought that Bruce finished his set emotionally disturbed. Zappa asked Bruce to sign his [[draft card]], but the suspicious Bruce refused.&lt;ref name="zappa"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=FB0O_HCpBy0C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Zappa+asked+lenny+bruce+to+sign+his+draft+card#v=onepage&amp;q=Zappa%20asked%20lenny%20bruce%20to%20sign%20his%20draft%20card | title=The Real Frank Zappa Book | publisher=Simon and Schuster |author1=Zappa, Frank |author2=Occhiogrosso, Peter | year=1989 | page=69 | isbn=9780671705725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of Hugh Hefner and with the aid of [[Paul Krassner]], Bruce wrote an autobiography. Serialized in ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1964 and 1965, this material was later published as the book ''How to Talk Dirty and Influence People''.&lt;ref name=watts&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watts |first1=Steven |title=Mr Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American dream |date=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780470501375 |page=190 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=m5b_eM3twmEC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=how+to+talk+dirty+and+influence+people+lenny+bruce+hefner+serialized+in+playboy#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20to%20talk%20dirty%20and%20influence%20people%20lenny%20bruce%20hefner%20serialized%20in%20playboy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hefner had long assisted Bruce's career, featuring him in the television debut of ''[[Playboy's Penthouse]]'' in October 1959.

During this time, Bruce also contributed a number of articles to Paul Krassner's satirical magazine ''[[The Realist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Realist Archive Project |url=http://www.ep.tc/realist/index.html |at=Issues 15, 41, 48, 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and posthumous pardon==
[[File:LennyBruce Grave.JPG|thumb|Bruce's grave at [[Eden Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Mission Hills, California]]]]
On August 3, 1966, a bearded Lenny Bruce was found dead in the bathroom of his [[Hollywood Hills]] home at 8825 W. Hollywood Blvd.&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite news|last=AP|title=Obituary|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1013.html|accessdate=November 28, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 4, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official photo, taken at the scene, showed Bruce lying naked on the floor, a syringe and burned bottle cap nearby, along with various other [[narcotic]]s paraphernalia. Record producer [[Phil Spector]], a friend of Bruce, bought the negatives of the photographs "to keep them from the press." The official cause of death was "acute [[morphine]] poisoning caused by an overdose."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Trials of Lenny Bruce: The Fall and Rise of an American Icon|last1=Collins|first1=Ronald|last2=Skover |first2=David|year=2002|publisher=Sourcebooks Mediafusion|isbn=978-1-57071-986-8|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His remains were interred in [[Eden Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Mission Hills, California]], but an unconventional memorial on August 21 was controversial enough to keep his name in the spotlight. The service saw over 500 people pay their respects, led by Spector. Cemetery officials had tried to block the ceremony after advertisements for the event encouraged attendees to bring box lunches and noisemakers. [[Dick Schaap]] eulogized Bruce in ''Playboy'', with the memorable last line: "One last four-letter word for Lenny: Dead. At forty. ''That's'' obscene."

His epitaph reads: "Beloved father – devoted son/Peace at last."

&lt;br&gt;

The documentary ''Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth'', directed by [[Robert B. Weide]] and narrated by [[Robert De Niro]], was released in 1998. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]]

In 2004, [[Comedy Central]] listed Bruce at number three on its list of the 100 greatest stand-ups of all time, placing above Woody Allen (4th) and below Richard Pryor (1st) and George Carlin (2nd).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listology.com/list/comedy-central-100-greatest-standups-all-time |title=List of Comedy Central's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time |publisher=listology.com |date= |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both comedians who ranked higher than Bruce considered him a major influence; Pryor said that hearing Bruce for the first time "changed my life,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/richard-pryor/news/pryor.-i-owe-it-all-to-lenny-bruce|title=Pryor: I Owe It All To Lenny Bruce|date=May 21, 2004|work=Contactmusic.com|access-date=April 22, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Carlin was arrested along with Bruce after refusing to provide identification when police raided a Bruce performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Profanity|series=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]|season=2|number=10|episodelink=List of Bullshit! episodes|serieslink=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|airdate=August 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7181">There have been 39 '''''[[FoxTrot]]'' books''' published so far, all by [[Andrews McMeel Publishing, LLC|Andrews McMeel Publishing]]. Of the 39 books, 27 are collections and 12 are anthologies. The anthologies are composed of the two or three previous collections, and include Sunday strips in color.

==Collections==
Beginning with ''Death by Field Trip'', the size and shape of the regular collections changed to accommodate a new Sunday strip layout. The books also became shorter (and much cheaper) to create a larger gap between [[anthology|anthologies]].

{{Jehovah's Witnesses}}
The [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society]] produces religious literature primarily for use by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

'''''Loving Natalee: A Mother's Testament of Hope and Faith''''' is an autobiography written by [[Beth Holloway]] about her missing daughter [[Natalee Holloway]], with portions contributed by Sunny Tillman.&lt;ref name="Library-of-Congress"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalog record: ''Loving Natalee: A Mother's Testament of Hope and Faith''|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/2008299428|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in October 2007 by HarperOne, an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[HarperCollins]], and has also been marketed under its alternate [[subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] ''The True Story of the Aruba Kidnapping and Its Aftermath''.&lt;ref name="HC-paperback"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Loving Natalee: The True Story of the Aruba Kidnapping and Its Aftermath'' (mass market paperback)|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/?isbn=9780061468797|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Holloway said that she vowed to share her story shortly following her daughter's disappearance, in the hope that other families would not suffer what she had to go through. After five months of unsuccessfully searching on [[Aruba]], her attorney John Q. Kelly took over the case and she spent the next two years traveling to various high schools and colleges to present messages about personal safety. When she thought about reaching more travelers with her story, Holloway said that her efforts evolved into writing a book.&lt;ref name="LMN-Holloway-interview"&gt;{{cite web

Dennis Lythgoe of ''[[Deseret News]]'', noting that the book was [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]], remarked that it was "not very well-written", but complimented it as "a compelling glimpse of this mother's electric personality."&lt;ref name="DeseretNews-20071007-heartbreaking" /&gt;

==Film adaptation==
{{main|Natalee Holloway (film)}}
In October 2008, the [[Lifetime Movie Network]] announced plans to create a television film title based on the book. The senior vice president of original movies, Tanya Lopez, stated in the announcement that the network was "pleased to be working closely with Natalee's mother" and that they intended to tell the story of Holloway's disappearance "sensitively and accurately."&lt;ref name="UPI-20081007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2008/10/07/Lifetime-planning-Natalee-Holloway-movie/UPI-71421223415829/|title=Lifetime planning Natalee Holloway movie|accessdate=June 15, 2009|date=October 7, 2008|agency=[[United Press International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]'' questioned whether it was too soon for such a film to be made.&lt;ref name="NYP-20090713"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/item_iiOLQ5Ety2IndyQHxWkyRP |title=Natalee Holloway Movie: Too Soon? |accessdate=August 20, 2010 |date=July 13, 2009 |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |first=Jarett |last=Wieselman |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001030911/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/item_iiOLQ5Ety2IndyQHxWkyRP |archivedate=October 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The April 19, 2009 broadcast of ''[[Natalee Holloway (film)|Natalee Holloway]]'' attracted 3.2 million viewers, garnering the highest [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] in the network's 11-year history.&lt;ref name=Variety-20090420-movie&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002635.html|title=Lifetime Movie scores with 'Holloway|accessdate=June 15, 2009|date=April 20, 2009|last=Kissel|first=Rick|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it set ratings records for Lifetime, the movie was not received well by critic Alec Harvey of ''[[The Birmingham News]]''. Harvey called the movie "sloppy and uneven, a forgettable look at the tragedy that consumed the nation's attention for months".&lt;ref name="HarveyReview-20090417"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/aharvey/2009/04/natalee_holloway_a_disappointi.html |title='Natalee Holloway' a disappointing TV movie |date=April 17, 2009|accessdate=June 15, 2009|last=Harvey |first=Alec |newspaper=The Birmingham News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jake Meaney of ''[[PopMatters]]'' found the film to be surprisingly "calm and levelheaded", and praised [[Tracy Pollan]]'s portrayal of Holloway's mother.&lt;ref name="PopMatters-review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Natalee Holloway|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/118543-natalee-holloway/|author=Jake Meaney|work=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=August 20, 2010|date=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joran van der Sloot himself watched the film one evening in 2010, according to his friend John Ludwick, and said that some parts were true while others were not.&lt;ref name="CNN-20100616"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nancygrace.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/16/friend-of-two-time-suspected-killer-joran-van-der-sloot-breaks-silence/|title=Friend of two-time suspected killer Joran van der Sloot breaks silence|date=June 16, 2010|accessdate=August 23, 2010|last=Nancy Grace|publisher=[[CNN]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622035151/http://nancygrace.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/16/friend-of-two-time-suspected-killer-joran-van-der-sloot-breaks-silence/|archivedate=June 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Model of Rome - Gismondi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Italo Gismondi's model of ancient Rome]]
The '''Museum of the Roman Civilization''' (Italian: ''Museo della Civiltà Romana'') is a [[museum]] in [[Rome]] ([[Esposizione Universale Roma]] district), devoted to aspects of the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] civilization.

==History and general introduction==
[[File:Museo Civiltà Romana2.JPG|250px|thumb|The museum from the outside]]
It was designed by the architects [[Pietro Ascheri]], [[D. Bernardini]] and [[Cesare Pascoletti]]&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;''The Buildings of Europe: Rome'', section 191, [[Christopher Woodward]], Manchester University Press, Manchester, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7190-4032-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1939–1941).
Its 59 sections illustrate the history of Roman civilization, from the origins to the 4th century, with models and reproductions, as well as original material. The premises are shared with a [[planetarium]].

It houses, among other things:
* a model of Archaic Rome (Room XVIII)
* a scale model of ancient Rome in the age of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] by [[Italo Gismondi]] (Room XXXVII-XXXVIII), derived from the [[Forma Urbis Romae]] map and integrated with archeological discoveries. This model is at a 1:250 scale and is made of [[plaster]]. The model was begun in 1935 and completed in 1971. This model is today the most important reference for any serious attempt of reconstruction of the Ancient Rome: it has been used for the "Rome Reborn 1.0" 3D Visualization Project (B. Frischer, Director, University of Virginia; D. Favro, Associate Director, UCLA; D. Abernathy, Director of 3D Modeling, University of Virginia; G. Guidi, Director of 3D Scanning, Politecnico di Milano). Gismondi's model can be seen also in a few shots of the film ''Gladiator'' by R. Scott.
* examples of [[Dominate|late imperial]] and [[early Christian art]]
* a complete sequence of casts of the spiral reliefs round [[Trajan's Column]], arranged in horizontal rows at ground level to facilitate reading.
* a reconstructed Roman library based on that in the [[Villa Adriana]] at [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museolibroantico.com/en.civilta_romana.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">[[File:Stone sculpture of celtic hero.jpg|thumb|The Celtic Hero from Bohemia]]

The '''Mšecké Žehrovice Head''' is a male sculpted head from c. 150-50 BC found at the double [[Viereckschanze]] site in [[Mšecké Žehrovice]], about 65&amp;nbsp;km north-west of [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]].  It is one of the best known works of [[Celtic art]] from [[Iron Age Europe]], and, along with the [[Glauberg]] "Prince" and the 
[[Warrior of Hirschlanden]], one of the few large representations of the human figure. Ever since its discovery in 1943, the sculpture became one of the most photographed, reproduced and published [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] (cc. 450-50 B.C.) objects ever.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Megaw|Megaw]] and [[Ruth Megaw|Megaw]]; Venclová, N., ed. "The Stone Head". In ''Mšecké Žehrovice in Bohemia. Archaeological Background to a Celtic Hero'' (Kronos B.Y. editions, 1998:281)&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is now in the Prague National Museum as inventory No. 111938.

With its iconic moustache, owl-like eyes, torc ornament and unique hairstyle, the marlstone head became an international mascot of 'barbarian' Europe, embellishing the covers of many scientific as well as populist publications concentrating on Iron Age Europe related issues.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Substance==
The stone head, sculpted from local Cretaceous [[limestone]] has a maximum height of 234mm and width of 174mm. The sculpture was broken into at least five pieces sometime in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Jansová, L. "Mšecké Žehrovice und die Frage der Viereckschanzen in Böhmen". (''Archaeologické Rozhledy'', 1968, 20:470-489)&lt;/ref&gt; Four pieces have been found in fairly good condition. However, the missing fragment or possibly fragments, a right-hand side of the head including upper part of the ear, have not yet been found. The heavily stylized facial features are projected on an almost flat surface surrounded by a braid-like  shaped hair. The most prominent are the bulging oval eyes, contoured by a curvilinear eyebrow matching a similarly imposing curvilinear moustache. The mouth is suggested by a mere downward bending line.&lt;ref&gt;Venclová, N., "The Venerable Bede, druidic tonsure and archaeology", (''Antiquity'', 2002, 76:458-71)&lt;/ref&gt; The ears are not naturalistic but rather represented as [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] buds, a stylistic form representative of La Tène art.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobstahl, P. ''Early Celtic Art'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1944)&lt;/ref&gt; The neck is formed in a shape of a [[torc]], a traditional Celtic necklace. A similar torc can be seen on the second-century B.C. sculpture of a ''[[Dying Gaul]]'' from Pergamon.

==Background==
The visual imagery of the La Tène period was characterized by an ubiquitous appearance of an anthropomorphic head symbol typical of Central and Western Celtic Europe &lt;ref&gt;Megaw and Megaw, ''Celtic Art. From its Beginning to the Book of Kells'', (New York, NY:  Thames and Hudson, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; These images were skillfully entwined in ornaments, handles, jewelry and reliefs fashioned mostly of metals. [[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphic]] sculpture itself was extraordinarily rare and few examples survive till today. The ''Celtic Hero'' was found during a course of 1943 excavation of [[oppidum]] Mšecké Žehrovice in central Bohemia, Czech Republic. The sculpture was buried in a pit on a southwest corner of a square enclosure located within the oppidum.  Other artifacts found in the pit include burned animal bones that date the feature to late La Tène period LT C2-D1 (approx. 150-50 BC.), pottery sherds,  pieces of [[saprolite]] and a piece of iron wire. The dating of the pit is further supported by the typology of the pottery sherds which also place the interment of the sculpture to approx. mid 2nd to mid 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Venclová, ''šecké Žehrovice in Bohemia. Archaeological Background to a Celtic Her'', (Kronos B.Y. Editions, 1998:31)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nja Mahdaoui''', (born in 1937) is a Tunisian artist known for his use of calligraphy as a graphic art form. He has often been described as a ‘choreographer of letters.'&lt;ref name=molka&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahdaoui|first1=Molka|title=Nja Mahdaoui|url=http://www.nja-mahdaoui.com/|website=Nja Mahdaoui|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Nja Mahdaoui was born in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]] in 1937.&lt;ref name=spring&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spring|first1=Christopher|title=Angaza Africa: African Art Now|date=28 November 2008|publisher=Laurence King|location=London|pages=178–181|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He initially studied painting and art history at [[Carthage National Museum]],&lt;ref name=vernoit&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vernoit|first1=S.J.|title=Mahdaoui, Nja|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T053180|website=Grove Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but was later, encouraged by the Director of the Italian Cultural Centre in Tunis, studied painting and philosophy at the Santa Andrea Academy in Rome (1966-68).&lt;ref name=spring /&gt; 
He later moved to Paris to go to Cité Internationale des Arts, where he attended courses at the [[École du Louvre]].&lt;ref name=vernoit /&gt;
Mahdaoui returned to Tunisia in 1977 and currently lives and works there.&lt;ref name=meem&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists Resource|url=http://www.meemartgallery.com/art_exhibiting.php?id=2|website=Meem Gallery|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Mahdaoui began his career as an abstract painter in the 1960s, then continued by experimenting with Arabic calligraphy.&lt;ref name=twair&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twair|first1=Pat McDonnell|title=World-Class Tunisian Artists Exhibited At Ne Sahara Gallery In L.A. Suburb|journal=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date=2011|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mahdaoui has tried various traditional and experimental media. He produced his first paintings on parchment in 1972, he became interested in weaving and carpet production in 1979 and he began to paint on animal skins and on the human body in 1980.&lt;ref name=vernoit /&gt;
Today he is known as the "inventor of abstract calligraphy," since his designs resemble Arabic letters, but have no literal meaning. When asked about his style Mahdaoui said, "I use fragmented and distorted letters to reject valuing each character." &lt;ref name= twair /&gt;
He started using his own personal '[[calligram]]s' on various mediums such as: canvas, papyrus, sculpture, aluminum, brass, drum, textile, embroidery, tapestry, ceramic, wood, jewelry, stained steel glass, planes, etc.&lt;ref name=molka /&gt; On account of his use of calligraphy in art, he is said to be part of the Hurufiyah art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahdaoui is of a generation of Arab artists who studied abroad but sought inspiration from their traditional roots.&lt;ref name=meem /&gt; Mahdaoui focused on the poetic quality of Arabic text, and invented a graphic style involving calligraphic works.&lt;ref name=richards&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Paul|title=Africa|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T000675pg26|website=Grover Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose Issa, a curator, has described his work saying, "Mahdaoui is careful not to emphasize the meaning of words but stresses instead the visual effect of compositions. His 'calligrams evoke infinite pleasures in rhythms, fast or slow, born from tension of the wrist, somewhat in the manner of a melodic flow, rising and fading away".&lt;ref name=geers&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geers|first1=Kendell|last2=Ross|first2=Doran H. Ross|title=africa95: Many Stories about the Art of a Continent|journal=African Arts|date=Summer 1996|volume=29|issue=3|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he was also selected by [[Gulf Air]] to design the external decoration of its fleet for the airline's fiftieth anniversary.&lt;ref name= meem /&gt; He has also created monumental stained-glass windows for public buildings in the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref name= twair /&gt; 
Mahdaoui followed his love of music, costume, and performance by using different media to apply his 'calligrams' to a wide range of objects such as large denim hangings, musicians' costumes, and a bass drum.&lt;ref name=spring2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spring|first1=Christopher|last2=Barley|first2=Nigel|last3=Hudson|first3=Julie|title=The Sainsbury African Galleries at the British Museum|journal=African Arts|date=Autumn 2001|volume=34|issue=3|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bass drum was created in 1998 with wood and given calligraphic embellishments by Mahdaoui.&lt;ref name=spring2 /&gt; When asked about this piece Mahdaoui said,"This drum, transformed into a silent sculpture, has temporarily ceased to be an instrument; it simply exists. Its cultural function - as a catalyst to the senses articulated through formal and improvised melody - has been interrupted. More importantly, it has renounced its particular voice as part of a collective artistic performance. Instead, with its multiplicity of resonances, it has become a dynamic symbol of cultural pluralism, a kind of 'total art' to which people throughout the world can respond in a myriad different ways."&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Mahdaoui has participated in both solo and group exhibitions worldwide. His work can be found in private and public international collections, including:

Museum of Modern Art, Tunis

Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad
 
[[British Museum]], London

[[Smithsonian Museum]], Washington, DC

[[Bibliothéque Nationale]] and [[Institut du Monde Arabe]], Paris

==Awards==

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on March 29, 2009. The episode was directed by Greg Colton and written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]]. In the episode, Quahog hosts its annual ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[convention (meeting)|convention]] and the cast members of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' are guests. After he was unable to ask the actors any questions at a Q&amp;A session, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] builds a [[transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] in his bedroom to beam the cast over and spend the day with them. Meanwhile, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] becomes a [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]] and tries to convert the [[atheism|atheist]] [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] to [[Christianity]].

The episode garnered mixed reviews from critics and received a 4.8/7 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]]. ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''{{'}}s [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Jonathan Frakes]], [[Brent Spiner]], [[LeVar Burton]], [[Gates McFadden]], [[Michael Dorn]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Denise Crosby]], and [[Marina Sirtis]] all guest starred as themselves, and [[Adam West]] and [[Rob Lowe]] appear at the end of the episode in a live-action scene.

==Plot==
[[Meg Griffin|Meg]] catches the [[mumps]] when the [[Griffin family|Griffins]] attend [[Quahog, Rhode Island|Quahog]]'s annual ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[science fiction convention|convention]], because [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] forced her to stand next to an irresponsible attendee with the mumps to take a picture, believing him to be [[List of Star Trek races|in costume]] as an alien. While recovering in bed, Meg becomes a [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]] after watching [[Kirk Cameron]] on television and begins irritating everyone with her beliefs. Meg is horrified to learn that [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] is an [[atheism|atheist]] and attempts to convince him to repent and convert to [[Christianity]], but he repeatedly refuses. Finally taking drastic measures, Meg spreads the word of Brian's atheism around Quahog, which generally [[discrimination against atheists|hates atheists]], making him a social outcast.

Upon being made an outcast, Brian is banned from every bar and convenience store in Quahog, making it impossible for him to drown his sorrows. Desperate, and suffering from [[delirium tremens]] (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to [[book burning|burn books]] that are "harmful to God" (including ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' by [[Charles Darwin]], ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' by [[Stephen Hawking]], and a book titled ''Logic for First Graders''). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] but have her to more physically resemble Peter, and that she would not be born into a family where everyone holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (not even caring enough to get her a [[mumps]] vaccine). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire ''Family Guy'' universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of [[Adam West]] and [[Rob Lowe]].

Meanwhile, furious that he did not get a chance to ask the cast of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' any questions at the convention, and the fact that the cast instead answered questions completely unrelated to ''Star Trek'', [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] builds an authentic ''Star Trek'' [[transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] and beams the cast over to interview them (in a nod to the TNG episode "[[Skin of Evil]]", [[Denise Crosby]] is killed in a show of force). Stewie decides to spend the whole day with the cast, which includes stealing [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]]'s van, having lunch at [[McDonald's]], going bowling, and going to a carnival. However, they complain about minor things and greatly annoy Stewie, who beams everyone back after stating that they have ruined ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' for him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23363">'''Post-expressionism''' is a term coined by the German [[art critic]] [[Franz Roh]] to describe a variety of movements in the post-war art world which were influenced by [[expressionism]] but defined themselves through rejecting its aesthetic. Roh first used the term in an essay in 1925, "Magic Realism: Post-Expressionism", to contrast to [[Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub]]'s "[[New Objectivity]]", which more narrowly characterized these developments within German art. Though Roh saw "post-expressionism" and "[[Magic Realism (painting)|magic realism]]" as synonymous, later critics characterized distinctions between magic realism and other artists initially identified by Hartlaub and have also pointed out other artists in Europe who had different stylistic tendencies but were working within the same trend.

==Background==

Leading up to [[World War I]], much of the art world was under the influence of [[Futurism]] and [[Expressionism]]. Both movements abandoned any sense of order or commitment to objectivity or tradition.

The sentiment of Futurists was most vocally expressed by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Filippo Marinetti]] in the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'', where he called for a rejection of the past, a rejection of all imitation &amp;mdash; of other artists or of the outside world &amp;mdash; and praised the virtue of originality and triumph of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Umbro Apollonio (ed.), ''Futurist Manifestos'', MFA Publications, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-87846-627-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, along these lines, said “After seeing electricity, I lost interest in nature.”&lt;ref&gt;Greaves, Zaller, and Roberts 1997, p.779&lt;/ref&gt; Marinetti and other Futurists glorified war and violence as a way to revolution &amp;ndash; bringing freedom, establishing new ideas, and rallying one to fight for one's own people &amp;ndash; and as war was shaping up in Europe, many saw it and encouraged a way to “purify” the culture and destroy old, obsolete elements of society.

Expressionists, likewise abandoning imitation nature, sought to express emotional experience, but often centered their art around [[angst]] &amp;mdash; inner turmoil; whether in reaction to the modern world, to alienation from society, or in the creation of personal identity. In concert with this evocation of angst, expressionists also echoed some of the same feelings of revolution as did Futurists. This is evidenced by a 1919 anthology of expressionist poetry titled ''[[Menschheitsdämmerung]]'', which translates to “Dawn of Humanity” &amp;mdash; meant to suggest that humanity was in a 'twilight'; that there was an imminent demise of some old way of being and beneath it the urgings of a new dawning.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Both futurism and expressionism were always met by opposition, but the destruction that occurred in the war had heightened the criticism against them. Following the war, in and throughout different artistic circles there was a call for a [[Return to Order|return to order]] and re-appreciation of tradition and of the natural world. In Italy, this was encouraged by the magazine ''[[Valori Plastici]]'' and came together in the [[Novecento Italiano|Novecento]], a group that exhibited in the Venice Biennale and was joined by many Futurists who had rejected their former work. [[Mario Sironi]], a member of this group, stated that they “would not imitate the world created by God but would be inspired by it.” The “New Objectivity” or ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', as coined by Hartlaub, described the developments in Germany and became the title of an exhibition that he staged in 1925. ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' was influenced not only by the “return to order” but also a call to arms among more left-leaning artists who wanted to use their art in a forward, political manner that expressionism didn't enable them to do. In Belgium, there was another vein in the common trend, which would later be referred to as a “retour à l’humain”.

==Movements==

When Hartlaub defined the idea of the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', he identified two groups: the ''verists'', who “[tore] the objective form of the world of contemporary facts and represent current experience in its tempo and fevered temperature,” and the ''classicists'', who “[searched] more for the object of timeless ability to embody the external laws of existence in the artistic sphere.”

Although Roh originally meant the term 'Magic Realism' to be more or less synonymous with ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', the artists identified by Hartlaub as 'classicists' later became associated with Roh's term. These 'Magic Realists' were all influenced by the classicism developed in Italy by the Novecento, and in turn by [[de Chirico]]'s concept of ''[[metaphysical art]]'', which had also branched into surrealism. Art critic [[Wieland Schmeid]] in 1977 posited that despite the fact that the terms were meant to refer to the same thing, the understanding of them as different groups derives from the fact that the movement had a right and left wing, with the Magic Realists on the right &amp;mdash; many later supporting fascism or accommodating to it&amp;mdash; and the ''verists'' we associate as the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' on the left &amp;mdash; fighting against fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Crockett 1998, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups in addition to having different political philosophies likewise had different artistic philosophies.

The third movement that is important to include in post-expressionism, and which Roh excluded, is the reaction to [[Flemish Expressionism]], as opposed to strains of German expressionism and Italian futurism. This is typically referred to as ''animism''.

===Magic Realism===

{{Main|Magic Realism (painting)}}
[[File:Donghi antonio-due canarini in gabbia-reduced size.jpg|thumb|275px|left|''Due canarini in gabbia'' by Antonio Donghi, 1932]]
[[File:Anton Raderscheidt, 1926, Tulpen auf der Fensterbank.jpg|thumb|275px|right|''Tulpen auf der Fensterbank'' by Anton Räderscheidt, 1926]]
'Magic Realism' for Roh, as a reaction to expressionism, meant to declare “[that] the autonomy of the objective world around us was once more to be enjoyed; the wonder of matter that could crystallize into objects was to be seen anew.”&lt;ref&gt;Zamora and Ferris 1995&lt;/ref&gt; With the term, he was emphasizing the “magic” of the normal world as it presents itself to us &amp;mdash; how, when we really look at everyday objects, they can appear strange and fantastic.

In Italy, the style that Roh identified was created by a confluence of a renewed focus on harmony and technique called for by the “return to order” and ''metaphysical art'', a style which had been developed by Carlo Carrà and Giorgio de Chirico, two members of the Novecento. Carrà described his purpose as to explore the imagined inner life of familiar objects when represented out of their explanatory contexts: their solidity, their separateness in the space allotted to them, the secret dialogue that may take place between them.

The leading painter in Italy associated with this style is perhaps [[Antonio Donghi]], who kept to traditional subject matter &amp;mdash; popular life, landscapes, and still life &amp;mdash; but presented it with strong composition and spatial clarity to give it gravity and stillness. His still lifes often consist of a small vase of flowers, depicted with the disarming symmetry of [[naive art]]. He also often painted birds carefully arranged for display in their cages, and dogs and other animals ready to perform for circus acts, to suggest an artificial arrangement placed on top of nature. In Germany, [[Anton Räderscheidt]] followed a style similar to Donghi, turning to magic realism after abandoning constructivism. [[Georg Schrimpf]] is somewhat like the two, working in a style influenced by [[primitivism]].

[[Filippo De Pisis]], who is often associated with ''metaphysical art'', can also be seen as a magic realist. Like Donghi, he often painted traditional subjects, but rather than developing a strict classical style, used a more painterly brush to bring out the intimacy of the objects, similar to the Belgian ''animists''. His association with ''metaphysical art'' comes from the fact that he would often contrapose objects in his still lifes, and set them in a scene that gave them context.

Another artist in Italy considered a [[magic realism|magic realist]] is [[Felice Casorati]], whose paintings are rendered with fine technique but often distinguished by unusual perspective effects and bold colorfulness. In 1925, Rafaello Giolli summarized the disconcerting aspects of Casorati's art — “The volumes have no weight in them, and the colors no body. Everything is fictitious: even the living lack all nervous vitality. The sun seems to be the moon ... nothing is fixed or definite.”

Other German artists who worked within this style are [[Alexander Kanoldt]] and [[Carl Grossberg]]. Kanoldt painted still lifes and portraits, while Grossberg painted urban landscapes and industrial sites rendered with chilly precision.

===New Objectivity and Verism===

The artists most associated with the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' today are those Hartlaub identified as 'verists'. These artists tended to oppose expressionism, but did not so much exemplify the “return to order” as much as they opposed what they saw as the political impotence of expressionist art. They sought to involve themselves into revolutionary politics and their form of realism distorted appearances to emphasize the ugly, as they wanted to expose what they considered the ugliness of reality. The art was raw, provocative, and harshly satirical.

[[Bertolt Brecht]], a German dramatist, was an early critic of Expressionism, referring to it as constrained and superficial. Just like in politics Germany had a new parliament but lacked parliamentarians, he argued, in literature there was an expression of delight in ideas, but no new ideas, and in theater a 'will to drama', but no real drama. His early plays, ''Baal'' and ''Trommeln in der Nacht'' (Drums in the Night) express repudiations of fashionable interest in Expressionism. Opposed to the focus on individual emotional experience in expressionist art, Brecht began a collaborative method to play production, starting with his ''[[Man Equals Man]]'' project.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the ''verist'' critique of expressionism was influenced by [[Dadaism]]. The early exponents of Dada had been drawn together in Switzerland, a neutral country in the war, and in common cause, they wanted to use their art as a form of moral and cultural protest &amp;mdash; shaking off not only the constraints of nationality, but also of artistic language, in order to express political outrage and encourage political action.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Expressionism, to Dadaists, expressed all of the angst and anxieties of society, but was helpless to do anything about it.

Out of this, Dada cultivated a “satirical hyperrealism”, as termed by [[Raoul Hausmann]], and of which the best known examples are the graphical works and photo-montages of [[John Heartfield]]. Use of collage in these works became a ''compositional'' principle to blend reality and art, as if to suggest that to record the facts of reality was to go beyond the most simple appearances of things.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; This later developed into portraits and scenes by artists such as [[George Grosz]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Rudolf Schlichter]]. Portraits would give emphasis to particular features or objects that were seen as distinctive aspects of the person depicted. Satirical scenes often depicted a madness behind what was happening, depicting the participants as cartoon-like.

Other ''verist'' artists, like Christian Schad, depicted reality with a clinical precision, which suggested both an empirical detachment and intimate knowledge of the subject. Schad's paintings are characterized "an artistic perception so sharp that it seems to cut beneath the skin", according to Schmied.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied 1978, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Often, psychological elements were introduced in his work, which suggested an underlying unconscious reality to life.

===Animism===

[[File:Wolvens, Bont strandzicht, reduced size.jpg|thumb|430px|left|''Bont strandzicht'' by Henri-Victor Wolvens, 1959. Wolvens began his style in the 1920s but worked until his death in 1977.]]
In Belgium, expressionism had been influenced by artists like [[James Ensor]] and [[Louis Pevernagie]] who had combined expressionism with [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]. Ensor, known for his paintings of people in masks, carnival outfits, and side-by-side with skeletons, also often painted realistic scenes, but imbued them with a fevered brush, garish colors, and strong contrasts to suggest a strange unreality present in them, as did Pevernagie. Expressionism was also exhibited in the [[Latemse School]], where adherents like [[Constant Permeke]] and [[Hubert Malfait]] used brushwork in painting and loose form in sculpture to show a mystic reality behind nature.

In what had been called a “retour à l’humain” (return to the human), many artists working in Belgium after the war had kept the expressive brush of their forebearers, but had rejected what they had seen as the anti-human, unreal distortions in their subject matter. The goal was to use the expressive brush to depict the soul or spirit of the objects, people, and places they were painting, rather than a hyperbolic, externalized, displaced angst of the artist. These artists were often characterized as 'introverts', as opposed to the 'extroverts' of expressionism.
[[File:Jespers, floris-still life with coffeepot.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Stillleben mit Kaffeekanne'' by Floris Jespers, 1932. Jespers was influenced by animism after the war.]]
Belgian art critic [[Paul Haesaerts]] later gave this movement the title ''animism'', which he took from anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]]'s book ''Primitive Culture'' (1871) describing '[[animism]]' as primitive religion that based itself on the idea a soul inhabited all objects. Later, Haesaerts, driven by criticism to do so, also used the terms ''réalisme poétique'' and ''intimism'', although ''animism'' is still most commonly used in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumhermandecuyper.be/evolutie_animisme_en.htm|title= ''Artistic evolution: animism'' |publisher = Museum Herman De Cuyper}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Intimism'' will more often refer to the art practiced by some members of the [[Les Nabis|Nabis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/291874/Intimism|title= ''Intimism'' |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recognized painter of these artists is [[Henri-Victor Wolvens]], who painted many scenes of the beach and ocean at [[Oostende]]. In his beach scenes, harsh waves are painted with a rough brush, clouds in patches &amp;mdash; rougher when in storm &amp;mdash; and the sand with a scraped quality. Figures are painted as simply as possible, often as stick figures, and given translucency and movement &amp;mdash; so his bathers show the activity of the beach and it the activity of the bathers blend in with the motion of the waves crashing ashore.

The work of [[Floris Jespers]] was strongly influenced by an animist spirit after the war. He uses form and color to give different degrees of vividness to the subjects in his paintings, each to the degree that one would associate them with in life.

Other painters associated with this movement are [[Anne Bonnet]], [[Albert Dasnoy]], [[Henri Evenepoel]], [[Mayou Iserentant]], [[Jacques Maes]], [[Marcel Stobbaerts]], [[Albert Van Dyck]], [[Louis Van Lint]], [[War Van Overstraeten]] and [[Jozef Vinck]].

Filippo De Pisis, referenced above, exhibited animist tendencies.

[[George Grard]] is the sculptor most associated with animism. Like expressionists, he went against both naturalism and classical tendencies, but used exaggerations from his models to heighten the feeling and sensuality of the form, and chose lyrical subjects. Grard was friends with [[Charles LePlae]], who had a similar style, but kept more in line with natural and classical forms.

[[Herman De Cuyper]] is also associated with animism, and abstracted to a more extreme degree than did Grard or LaPlae, and in some ways is more similar to [[Henry Moore]].

==Counter-movements==

An early revolt against the imposed classicism that was popular in the Novecento took place with the founding of the ''[[Scuola Romana]]''.

===Romantic Expressionism===

{{Main|Scuola Romana}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mafai, fantasia no 9 , 1942.jpg|thumb|400px|right|''Fantasia n.9 &amp;mdash; Fucilazione'' by Mario Mafai, 1942]] --&gt;
[[Corrado Cagli]] was a member of this group, and identified himself and others whom he met as members of the “New Roman School of Painting”, or ''nuovi pittori romani'' (new Roman painters).&lt;ref&gt;''Anticipi sulla Scuola di Roma (Anticipations on the School of Rome)'' on "Quadrante" (I, 1933 n.6)&lt;/ref&gt; Cagli spoke of a spreading sensitivity and an ''Astro di Roma'' (Roman Star) which guided them, affirming it as the poetic basis of their art:
{{quote|''In a primordial dawn all has to be reconsidered, and Imagination relives all wonders and trembles for all mysteries.''}}

Sometimes referred to as ''romantic expressionism'', art from this group exhibits a wild painting style, expressive and disorderly, violent and with warm ochre and maroon tones. Contrary to early expressionism, the focus isn't on angst and turmoil, but rather seeing the world anew, as Cagli described, through romantic imagination. Yet, the formal rigour of the Novecento was replaced by a distinctly expressionist visionariness.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Renato Barilli, ''L'arte contemporanea: da [[Cézanne]] alle ultime tendenze'', Feltrinelli, 2005, p.248: "... a savage and reductive raffiguration dominates, which recalls distant baroque trends, or even closer to the expressionist furores of artists such as [[Chagall]], made viable to them thanks to Antonietta Raphaël, who had known him in [[Paris]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scipione]] brought to life a sort of Roman baroque expressionism, where often decadent landscapes appear of Rome's historical baroque centre, populated by priests and cardinals, seen with a vigorously expressive and hallucinated eye.

[[Mario Mafai]] painted many scenes of Rome and its suburbs, and used warm chromatic colors to convey a sense of freshness and pictorial curiosity. This bent is particularly emphasised in his 1936-1939 work, in a series paintings entitled ''Demolitions'', where in order to make a political statement he painted urban restructuring being carried out by the fascist regime. During the Second World War he painted a series of ''Fantasies'' depicting horrors committed by the fascists.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. F. Negri Arnoldi, ''Storia dell'Arte Moderna'', [[Milan]] 1990, pp.613-616&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonietta Raphaël]], Mafai's wife and a sculptor, was also a member of this group.

Another member was [[Renatto Guttuso]], who like Mafai made paintings which denounced the fascist regime. Guttuso's works are generally bright, lively, and verging on abstraction.

[[Emanuele Cavalli]] and [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]] have associations both with the ''Scuola Romana'' and with Magic Realism.

'''Public Enemy''' is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group consisting of [[Chuck D]], [[Flavor Flav]], [[Professor Griff]], [[Khari Wynn]], [[DJ Lord]], Sammy Sam, and the S1W group. Formed in [[Long Island]], New York, in 1986, they are known for their politically charged music and criticism of the American media, with an active interest in the frustrations and concerns of the [[African American]] community. 

Their first four albums during the late 1980s and early 1990s were all certified either [[RIAA certification|gold or platinum]] and were, according to music critic [[Robert Hilburn]] in 1998, "the most acclaimed body of work ever by a hip hop act".&lt;ref name="Hilburn"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Hilburn|date=July 5, 1998|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/05/entertainment/ca-788|title=Is Anyone Out There Really Listening?|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called them "the most influential and radical band of their time."&lt;ref name="allm"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Public Enemy - Biography &amp; History|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/public-enemy-mn0000856785/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=March 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were inducted into [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2012/12/11/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-rush-public-enemy|title=Public Enemy, Rush, Heart, Donna Summer to be inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|work=EW.com|access-date=July 16, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Formation and early years (1986–1987)===
Carlton Ridenhour ([[Chuck D]]) and William Drayton ([[Flavor Flav]]) met at [[Long Island]]'s [[Adelphi University]] in the mid-1980s. Developing his talents as an [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] with Flav while delivering furniture for his father's business, Chuck D and Spectrum City, as the group was called, released the record "Check Out the Radio", backed by "Lies", a social commentary—both of which would influence RUSH Productions' [[Run–D.M.C.]] and [[Beastie Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;Chang 2005, pp. 239, 241-242.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chuck D]] put out a tape to promote [[WBAU]] (the radio station where he was working at the time) and to fend off a local MC who wanted to [[freestyle battle|battle]] him. He called the tape ''Public Enemy #1'' because he felt like he was being persecuted by people in the local [[Subculture|scene]]. This was the first reference to the notion of a [[public enemy]] in any of Chuck D's songs. The single was created by Chuck D with a contribution by [[Flavor Flav]], though this was before the group ''Public Enemy'' was officially assembled. Around 1986, Bill Stephney, the former Program Director at WBAU, was approached by Ali Hafezi and offered a position with the label. Stephney accepted, and his first assignment was to help fledgling producer [[Rick Rubin]] sign Chuck D, whose song "Public Enemy Number One" Rubin had heard from [[Doctor Dré|Andre "Doctor Dré" Brown]].
[[File:Flavor Flav - Public Enemy- konser-Slakthuset-Malmö-1991.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Flavor Flav performing in 1991.]]
According to the book ''The History of Rap Music'' by [[Cookie Lommel]], "Stephney thought it was time to mesh the hard-hitting style of Run DMC with politics that addressed black youth. Chuck recruited Spectrum City, which included Hank Shocklee, his brother Keith Shocklee, and Eric "Vietnam" Sadler, collectively known as [[the Bomb Squad]], to be his production team and added another Spectrum City partner, [[Professor Griff]], to become the group's Minister of Information. With the addition of Flavor Flav and another local mobile DJ named [[Terminator X (DJ)|Terminator X]], the group Public Enemy was born." According to Chuck, The S1W, which stands for Security of the First World, "represents that the black man can be just as intelligent as he is strong. It stands for the fact that we're not third-world people, we're first-world people; we're the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|original]] people."&lt;ref&gt;Chuck D. and Yusuf Jah, ''[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Hank Shocklee came up with the name Public Enemy based on "underdog love and their developing politics" and the idea from Def Jam staffer Bill Stephney following the [[Howard Beach racial incident]], [[Bernhard Goetz]], and the [[death of Michael Stewart]]: "The Black man is definitely the public enemy."&lt;ref&gt;Chang 2005, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public Enemy started out as opening act for the [[Beastie Boys]] during the latter's ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'' popularity, and in 1987 released their debut album ''[[Yo! Bum Rush The Show|Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]''.

===Mainstream success (1987–1994)===
Their debut album, ''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]'', was released in 1987 to critical acclaim. The album was the group's first step toward stardom. In October 1987, music critic [[Simon Reynolds]] dubbed Public Enemy "a superlative ''rock'' band".&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon. "Public Enemy", ''Melody Maker'', October 17, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; They released their second album ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]'' in 1988, which performed better in the charts than their previous release, and included the hit single "[[Don't Believe the Hype]]" in addition to "[[Bring The Noise|Bring the Noise]]". ''Nation of Millions...'' was the first hip hop album to be voted album of the year in ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s influential [[Pazz &amp; Jop]] critics' poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=Joseph|date=December 11, 2012|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/12/12/decking-the-hall-the-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fames-new-members/slide/public-enemy/|title=Decking the Hall: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's New Members – Public Enemy|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|location=New York|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the group returned to the studio to record ''[[Fear of a Black Planet]]'', which continued their politically charged themes. The album was supposed to be released in late 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK1uLUXpAzoC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=%22Fear+Of+A+Black+Planet%22+%22Public+Enemy%22+%22October+release%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aH72jFfX7A&amp;sig=bXOqlhdQ79rLGx01ksox4KMatOg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8zm7TKTPIcOAlAeI3cmWBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fear%20Of%20A%20Black%20Planet%22%20%22Public%20Enemy%22%20%22October%20release%22&amp;f=false |title=SPIN - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was pushed back to April 1990. It was the most successful of any of their albums and, in 2005, was selected for preservation in the [[Library of Congress]]. It included the singles "Welcome To The Terrordome", "[[911 Is a Joke]]", which criticized emergency response units for taking longer to arrive at emergencies in the black community than those in the white community, and "[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/vh1-crowns-public-enemys-fight-the-power-as-best-hip-hop-song/353728/ |title=Canadian Music - HuffPost Canada |publisher=Music.aol.ca |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fight the Power" is regarded as one of the most popular and influential songs in hip hop history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Spike Lee|Lee, Spike]].

Retrieved May 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It was the theme song of [[Spike Lee]]'s ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''.

[[File:Chuck D. Slakthuset i Malmö 1991.jpg|thumb|250px|Right|Chuck D. performing at [[Malmö]] in 1991.]]The group's next release, ''[[Apocalypse '91...The Enemy Strikes Black]]'', continued this trend, with songs like "Can't Truss It", which addressed the history of slavery and how the black community can fight back against oppression; "I Don't Wanna be Called Yo Nigga", a track that takes issue with the use of the word ''nigga'' outside of its original derogatory context. The album also included the controversial song and video "By the Time I Get to Arizona", which chronicled the black community's frustration that some US states did not recognize [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s birthday as a national holiday. The video featured members of Public Enemy taking out their frustrations on politicians in the states not recognizing the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Public Enemy Look Back at 20 Years of 'By the Time I Get to Arizona'| work = Spin Magazine| publisher = SpinMedia| url =http://www.spin.com/2011/11/public-enemy-look-back-20-years-time-i-get-arizona/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the group was one of the first rap acts to perform at the [[Reading Festival]], in England, headlining the second day of the three-day festival.

===Terminator X's exit and DJ Lord's entrance (1998–current)===
After a 1994 motorcycle accident shattered his left leg and kept him in the hospital for a full month, Terminator X relocated to his 15-acre farm in Vance County, North Carolina. By 1998, he was ready to retire from the group and focus full-time on raising African black ostriches on his farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My Ostrich Weighs a Ton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=terminator+x+ostrich+farm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pySeMzuKjc&amp;sig=Imzo11E2w6uvP8AFN1G1fs3yJRo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=x8cxTY3aIpC_gQfsuZGTCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=terminator%20x%20ostrich%20farm&amp;f=false|newspaper=Vibe|date=March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1998, the group started looking for Terminator X's permanent replacement. Following several months of searching for a DJ, Professor Griff saw [[DJ Lord]] at a Vestax Battle and approached him about becoming the DJ for Public Enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dj Lord of the battle|url=http://www.inthemix.com.au/features/5459/DJ_Lord_of_the_battle|publisher=In the Mix|date=June 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DJ Lord joined as the group's full-time DJ just in time for Public Enemy's 40th World Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DMC Kicks Back…Mr. Lord-Public Enemy Spinner &amp; Hip Hop King|url=http://www.dmcworld.net/features/entry/features/dmc-kicks-back-mrlord---public-enemy-spinner--hip-hop-king.html|publisher=DMC World Magazine|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1999, he has been the official DJ for Public Enemy on albums and world tours while winning numerous turntablist competitions, including multiple [[DMC World DJ Championships|DMC]] finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dj Lord Biography|url=http://www.rapartists.com/artists/djlord/biography|publisher=Rap Artists|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the group released an album entitled ''[[How You Sell Soul to a Soulless People Who Sold Their Soul?]]''. Public Enemy's single from the album was "[[Harder Than You Think]]". Four years after ''How You Sell Soul...'', in January 2011, Public Enemy released the album ''[[Public Enemy discography#Compilation albums|Beats and Places]]'', a compilation of remixes and "lost" tracks. On July 13, 2012, ''[[Most of My Heroes Still Don't Appear on No Stamp]]'' was released and was exclusively available on iTunes. In July 2012, on UK television an advert for the London [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] featured a short remix of the song "Harder Than You Think". The advert caused the song to reach No. 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] on September 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = UK Top 40 Singles Chart = Radio 1| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/singles|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 30, 2012, Public Enemy performed a free concert with [[Salt-N-Pepa]] and [[Kid 'n Play]] at [[Wingate Park]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]] as part of the [[Martin Luther King Jr. Concert Series]]. On August 26, 2012, Public Enemy performed at [[South West Four]] music festival in [[Clapham Common]] in London. On October 1, 2012 ''[[The Evil Empire of Everything]]'' was released. On June 29, 2013, they performed at [[Glastonbury Festival 2013]]. On September 14, 2013 they performed at [[Riot Fest]] &amp; Carnival 2013 in Chicago, Illinois. On September 20, 2013 they performed at Riot Fest &amp; Side Show in Byers, Colorado.

In 2014 Chuck D launched [[PE 2.0]] with Oakland rapper Jahi as a spiritual successor and "next generation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoshis.com/event/790673-pe-20-oakland/ |title=SUN 5.31 The Next Gen of Public Enemy PE 2.0 DOORS: 9:15 PM / SHOW: 9:30 PM |website=Yoshis.com|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Public Enemy.&lt;ref name="The Oak Q &amp; A: Jahi as PE2.0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arnold|first1=Eric K.|title=The Oak Q &amp; A: Jahi as PE2.0|url=https://oakulture.wordpress.com/2014/10/08/the-oak-q-a-jahi-of-pe-2-0/|website=Oakculture|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jahi met Chuck D backstage during a soundcheck at the 1999 Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame and later appeared as a support act on Public Enemy's 20th Anniversary Tour in 2007.

==Legacy==
[[File:Public Enemy.png|thumb|left|Public Enemy official logo.]]
Public Enemy made contributions to the hip-hop world with sonic experimentation as well as political and cultural consciousness, which infused itself into skilled and poetic [[rhymes]]. Critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote that "PE brought in elements of [[free jazz]], hard [[funk]], even [[musique concrète]], via [its] producing team the Bomb Squad, creating a dense, ferocious sound unlike anything that came before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/it-takes-a-nation-of-millions-to-hold-us-back-mw0000196315 |title=It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back - Public Enemy &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/fight-the-presets/Jun-06/20956 |title=Electric &amp; Acoustic Guitar Gear, Lessons, News, Blogs, Video, Tabs &amp; Chords |publisher=GuitarPlayer.com |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terminator X's innovative [[scratching]] tricks can be heard on the songs "Rebel Without a Pause", "Night of the Living Baseheads", and "Shut 'Em Down".

Public Enemy held a strong, pro-black, political stance. Before PE, politically motivated hip-hop was defined by a few tracks by [[Ice-T]], [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]], [[Kurtis Blow]] and [[KRS-One]]. Other politically motivated opinions were shared by prototypical artists [[Gil Scott-Heron]] and [[the Last Poets]]. PE was a revolutionary hip-hop act, basing an entire image around a specified political stance. With the successes of Public Enemy, many hip-hop artists began to celebrate [[Afrocentricity|Afrocentric]] themes, such as [[Kool Moe Dee]], [[Gang Starr]], [[X Clan]], [[Eric B. &amp; Rakim]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[the Jungle Brothers]], and [[A Tribe Called Quest]].

[[File:PE at Vegoose 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Public Enemy at Vegoose in 2007. From left: [[DJ Lord]], [[Chuck D]], and [[Flavor Flav]].]]Public Enemy was one of the first hip-hop groups to do well internationally. PE changed the Internet's music distribution capability by being one of the first groups to release [[MP3]]-only albums,&lt;ref&gt;Dubois, Keir. "https://web.archive.org/web/20030619220955/http://transcriptions.english.ucsb.edu/archive/topics/infoart/public-enemy/". ''Transcriptions Project'', December 1999. Retrieved on April 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; a format virtually unknown at the time.

Public Enemy helped to create and define "[[rap metal]]" by collaborating with [[Living Colour]] in 1988 ("[[Funny Vibe]]") and New York [[thrash metal]] outfit [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] in 1991. The single "[[Bring the Noise]]" was a mix of semi-militant [[black power]] lyrics, grinding guitars, and sporadic humor. The two bands, cemented by a mutual respect and the personal friendship between Chuck D and Anthrax's [[Scott Ian]], introduced a hitherto alien genre to rock fans, and the two seemingly disparate groups toured together. Flavor Flav's pronouncement on stage that "They said this tour would never happen" (as heard on Anthrax's ''[[Live: The Island Years]]'' CD) has become a legendary comment in both rock and hip-hop circles. Metal guitarist [[Vernon Reid]] (of [[Living Colour]]) contributed to Public Enemy's recordings, and PE sampled [[Slayer]]'s "Angel of Death" half-time riff on "She Watch Channel Zero?!"

Members of the Bomb Squad produced or remixed works for other acts, like [[Bell Biv DeVoe]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Blue Magic (band)|Blue Magic]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[L.L. Cool J]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Jasmine Guy]], [[Jody Watley]], [[Eric B &amp; Rakim]], [[Third Bass]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[EPMD]], and [[Chaka Khan]]. According to Chuck D, "We had tight dealings with [[MCA Records]] and were talking about taking three guys that were left over from [[New Edition]] and coming up with an album for them. The three happened to be [[Ricky Bell (singer)|Ricky Bell]], [[Michael Bivins]], and [[Ronnie DeVoe]], later to become [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]. [[Ralph Tresvant]] had been slated to do a solo album for years, [[Bobby Brown]] had left New Edition and experienced some solo success beginning in 1988, and [[Johnny Gill]] had just been recruited to come in, but [he] had come off a solo career and could always go back to that. At MCA, Hiram Hicks, who was their manager, and Louil Silas, who was running the show, were like, 'Yo, these kids were left out in the cold. Can y'all come up with something for them?' It was a task that Hank, Keith, Eric, and I took on to try to put some kind of hip-hop-flavored R&amp;B shit down for them. Subsequently, what happened in the four weeks of December [1989] was that the Bomb Squad knocked out a large piece of the production and arrangement on [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]'s three-million selling album ''Poison''. In January [1990], they knocked out ''Fear of a Black Planet'' in four weeks, and PE knocked out [[Ice Cube]]'s album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'' in four to five weeks in February."&lt;ref&gt;''Fight The Power'', pp. 236–237&lt;/ref&gt; They have also produced local talent such as [[Son of Bazerk]], [[Young Black Teenagers]], Kings of Pressure, and True Mathematics—and gave producer [[Kip Collins]] his start in the business.

Poet and [[hip-hop]] artist [[Saul Williams]] uses a sample from Public Enemy's "Welcome to the Terrordome" in his song "Tr[n]igger" on the ''Niggy Tardust'' album.  He also used a line from the song in his poem, ''amethyst rocks''.

Public Enemy's brand of politically and socially conscious hip hop has been a direct influence on new hip hop artists such as The Cornel West theory.

The [[Manic Street Preachers]] track "Repeat (Stars And Stripes)" is a remix of the band's own anti-monarchy tirade by Public Enemy production team [[The Bomb Squad]] of whom [[James Dean Bradfield]] and [[Richey Edwards]] were big fans. The song samples "Countdown to Armageddon" from [[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]. The band had previously sampled Public Enemy on their 1991 single [[Motown Junk]].

The revolutionary influence of the band is seen throughout hip-hop and is recognized in society and politics. The band "rewrote the rules of hip-hop", changing the image, sound and message forever.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allmusic.com/artist/public-enemy-mn0000856785/biography&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8463262/public-enemy-it-takes-a-nation-of-millions-to-hold-us-back&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-black lyrics brought political and social themes to hardcore hip hop, with stirring ideas of racial equality, and retribution against police brutality, aimed at disenfranchised blacks, but appealing to all the poor and underrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/ballad-boombox-what-public-enemy-tells-us-about-hip-hop-race-and-society-180962095/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dallasweekly.com/arts_and_entertainment/article_2f281b60-4b8f-11e2-8185-0019bb30f31a.html&lt;/ref&gt; Before Public Enemy, hip hop music was seen as "throwaway entertainment", with trite sexist and homophobic lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8945572/Public-Enemy-Prophets-of-Rage-how-the-hip-hop-group-rescued-rap.html&lt;/ref&gt; Public Enemy brought social relevance and strength to hip hop. They also brought black activist [[Louis Farrakhan]] to greater popularity, and they gave impetus to the [[Million Man March]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.30696/title.russell-simmons-says-public-enemy-changed-everything-about-black-america#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===[[Martin Luther King Day]]===
The 1991 song "By the Time I Get to Arizona" from ''[[Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black]]'' referenced the controversy a year earlier when Arizona cancelled a state holiday for [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and the NFL switched [[Super_Bowl_XXVII#Arizona's_Martin_Luther_King_Day_controversy|Super Bowl XXVII from Arizona to California]], costing the state an estimated loss of over $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-11-08/sports/9004040444_1_super-bowl-xxvii-phoenix-mayor-paul-johnson-dick-berthelsen|title=Vote Costs Phoenix Super Bowl|work=chicagotribune.com|date=November 8, 1990|author= Don Pierson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/arizona-super-bowl_n_4848871|work=huffingtonpost|title= This Wouldn't Be The First Time Bigots In Arizona Lost The State A Super Bowl|author=Amanda Terkel|date=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A video of "By the Time I Get to Arizona", which was shown only once on MTV,  depicted Chuck D killing Arizona officials with machine guns and a car bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2011/11/public-enemy-look-back-20-years-time-i-get-arizona/|work=Spin|title=Public Enemy Look Back at 20 Years of ‘By the Time I Get to Arizona’|author=Evan Serpick |date= November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This violent behaviour attracted negative media attention, and was seen as being the opposite of what Martin Luther King died for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-01-23/features/9201070348_1_king-holiday-nightline-public-enemy|title=Razing Arizona|date=January 23, 1992|author= Greg Kot|work=chicagotribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Semitism===
In 1989, in an interview with Public Enemy for the ''[[Washington Times]]'', the interviewing journalist, [[David Mills (writer)|David Mills]], lifted some quotations from a UK magazine in which the band were asked their opinion on the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. Professor Griff's comments apparently sympathized with the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] and he was accused of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]]. According to Rap Attack 2, he suggested that "Jews are responsible for the majority of the wickedness in the world" (p.&amp;nbsp;177). (In turn a quote from'' [[The International Jew]]'') Shortly after, Ridenhour expressed an apology on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Pareles, Jon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/11/arts/public-enemy-rap-group-reorganizes-after-anti-semitic-comments.html|title=Public Enemy Rap Group Reorganizes After Anti-Semitic Comments|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 11, 1989|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a June 21, 1989 press conference, Ridenhour announced Griff's dismissal from the group,&lt;ref name="Pareles1989"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pareles|first1=John|title=Public Enemy Rap Group Reorganizes after Anti-Semitic Comments|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times |date=August 11, 1989|location=New York:|page=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a June 28 statement by [[Russell Simmons]], president of [[Def Jam Recordings]] and Rush Artists Management, stated that Chuck D. had disbanded Public Enemy "for an indefinite period of time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pareles|first1=John|title=Rap Group Disbands Under Fire|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 29, 1989|page=C19}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 10, however, Ridenhour denied that he had disbanded the group, and stated that Griff had been re-hired as "Supreme Allied Chief of Community Relations" (in contrast to his previous position with the group as Minister of Information).&lt;ref name="Pareles1989"/&gt; Griff later denied holding anti-Semitic views and apologized for the remarks.&lt;ref name="Hilburn3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|date=April 10, 1990|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-10/entertainment/ca-938_1_public-enemy|title=POP MUSIC REVIEW: Public Enemy Keeps Up Attack|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|location=Los Angeles|accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several people who had worked with Public Enemy expressed concern about Ridenhour's leadership abilities and role as a social spokesman.&lt;ref name="Hilburn2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Hilburn|date=February 4, 1990|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-04/entertainment/ca-470_1_public-enemy|title=Rap—The Power and the Controversy: Success has validated pop's most volatile form, but its future impact could be shaped by the continuing Public Enemy uproar|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|location=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2009 book, entitled ''Analytixz'',&lt;ref&gt;Professor Griff. Analytixz: 20 Years of Conversations and Enter-views with Public Enemy's Minister of Information. Atlanta: RATHSI Publishing, 2009, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Griff criticized his 1989 statement: "to say the Jews are responsible for the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe I would have to know about the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe, which is impossible... I'm not the best knower. Then, not only knowing that, I would have to know who is at the crux of all of the problems in the world and then blame Jewish people, which is not correct." Griff also said that not only were his words taken out of context, but that the recording has never been released to the public for an unbiased listen.

The controversy and apologies on behalf of Griff spurred Chuck D to reference the negative press they were receiving. In 1990, Public Enemy issued the single "Welcome to the Terrordome", which contains the lyrics: "Crucifixion ain't no fiction / So-called chosen frozen / Apologies made to whoever pleases / Still they got me like Jesus". These lyrics have been cited by some in the media as anti-Semitic, making supposed references to [[Chosen people|the concept of the "chosen people"]] with the lyric "so-called chosen" and [[Jewish deicide]] with the last line.&lt;ref&gt;Christgau, Robert. [http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/pe-90.php Jesus, Jews, and the Jackass Theory: Public Enemy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the group released an album entitled ''[[There's a Poison Goin' On]]''. The title of the last song on the album is called "Swindler's Lust".  The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) claimed that the title of the song was a word play on the title of the Steven Spielberg movie ''[[Schindler's List]]'' about the genocide of Jews in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.villagevoice.com/music/profits-of-rage-6421304] at [[Village Voice]] July 13, 1999/''Profits of Rage''&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in 2000 a Public Enemy spin off group under the name [[Confrontation Camp]], a name according to the ADL, that is a pun on the term [[concentration camp]], released an album.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/news/515476/jewish-group-decries-public-enemys-swindlers-lust/] at [[MTV]]Jewish Group Decries Public Enemy's 'Swindler's Lust'&lt;/ref&gt; The group consisted of Kyle Jason, Chuck D (under the name Mistachuck) and Professor Griff.

===Homophobia===
In a letter to the editor, Leo Haber alludes to criticism by ''[[The New York Times]]'' writer Peter Watrous of the group's supposed [[homophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDC1431F930A25756C0A966958260 |title=Letter to the Editor: "PUBLIC ENEMY; Strong Adjectives"|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 13, 1990|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zoe Williams]] defended Public Enemy against charges of homophobia by stating that:

{{Quote|text=If you look at the seminal black artists at the start of hip-hop, Public Enemy and [[N.W.A|Niggaz Wit Attitudes]], you won't actually find much homophobia. The only recorded homophobic lyric in Public Enemy's canon was: 'Man to man/ I don't know if they can/ From what I know/ The parts don't fit' [a lyric from "Meet the G that Killed Me" on ''[[Fear of a Black Planet]]'']".|sign=Williams, Zoe|source=[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,945463,00.html "Hiphopophobia"], ''The Guardian'', 29 April 2003}}

[[File:Pyrography The White Horse.jpg|thumb|300px|The White Horse, pyrography on [[Populus|poplar]].]]
'''Pyrography''' or '''pyrogravure''' is the art of decorating wood or other materials with burn marks resulting from the controlled application of a heated object such as a [[Fireplace poker|poker]]. It is also known as '''pokerwork''' or '''wood burning'''.

The term means "writing with fire", from the Greek ''pur'' (fire) and ''graphos'' (writing).&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Podgorski; ''Before You Pick Up That Nib: Wood Burning 101'', p7 {{ISBN|978-0-557-05114-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be practiced using specialized modern pyrography tools, or using a metal implement heated in a fire, or even sunlight concentrated with a magnifying [[lens (optics)|lens]].  "Pyrography dates from the 17th century and reached its highest standard in the 19th century. In its crude form it is pokerwork." &lt;ref&gt;"Pyrography." Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. London: Chambers Harrap, 2012. Credo Reference. Web. 2 Mar 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large range of tones and shades can be achieved. Varying the type of tip used, the temperature, or the way the iron is applied to the material all create different effects. After the design is burned in, wooden objects are often coloured. Light-coloured [[hardwoods]] such as [[sycamore]], [[basswood]], [[beech]] and [[birch]] are most commonly used, as their fine [[grain]] is not obtrusive. However, other woods, such as maple, [[pine]] or [[oak]], are also used. Pyrography is also applied to leather items, using the same hot-iron technique. [[Leather]] lends itself to bold designs, and also allows very subtle shading to be achieved. Specialist vegetable-tanned leather must be used for pyrography (as modern [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] methods leave chemicals in the leather which are [[toxic]] when burned), typically in light colours for good contrast.

Pyrography is also popular among [[gourd]] crafters and artists, where designs are burned onto the exterior of a dried hard-shell gourd.

== History ==
[[File:The Tawny Eagle.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Tawny Eagle. Davide Della Noce pyrography.]]
The process has been practiced by a number of cultures including the [[Egypt]]ians and some [[Africa]]n tribes since the dawn of recorded history. Pyrographer Robert Boyer hypothesises that the art form dates back to prehistory, when early humans created designs using the charred remains of their fires.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, R; ''The Amazing Art of Pyrography'', Evanston 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-879260-12-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was known in China from the time of the [[Han dynasty]], where it was known as "Fire Needle Embroidery".&lt;ref&gt;[http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/16Traditions1930.html China Culture - pyrography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906032848/http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/16Traditions1930.html |date=6 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Victorian era]], the invention of pyrography machines sparked a widespread interest in the craft, and it was at this time that the term "pyrography" was coined (previously the name "pokerwork" had been most widely used)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkaboutcrafts.com/crafttopics/crafts/pyrography.htm Walkabout Crafts - pyrography]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, a [[Melbourne]] [[architect]] by the name of [[Alfred Smart]] discovered that water-based [[paint]] could be applied hot to wood by pumping [[benzoline]] fumes through a heated hollow [[platinum]] [[pencil]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Julie; ''With Mellow Shades and Character Made: The Richness of Australian Pokerwork'' in ''Carter's Antiques and Collectables Magazine'', Sept 2000&lt;/ref&gt; This improved the pokerwork process by allowing the addition of tinting and [[shading]] that were previously impossible. In the early 20th century, the development of the electric pyrographic hot wire wood etching machine further automated the pokerwork process, and [[Art Nouveau]] pyrographic gloveboxes and other works were popular in that era. Pyrography is a traditional folk art in many parts of Europe, including [[Romania]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], and [[Flanders]], as well as [[Argentina]] and other areas in [[South America]].

==Equipment==
Traditional pyrography can be performed using any heated metal implement. Modern pyrography machines exist, and can be divided into three main categories.

===Solid-point burners===
Solid-point burners are similar in design to a [[soldering iron]]. They have a solid brass tip which is heated by an electrical element, and operate at a fixed temperature.

===Wire-nib burners===
Wire-nib burners have variable temperature controls. The writing nib is heated by an electric current passing directly through it. Some models have interchangeable nibs to allow for different effects.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, S; ''Pyrography Workbook: A Complete Guide to the Art of Woodburning'' Fox Chapel 2005 p13-14 {{ISBN|978-1-56523-258-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laser cutters===
[[Laser cutter]]s can be set to scorch the material instead of cutting all the way through it.  Many laser cutters provide software facilities to import image files and transfer them onto a sheet of wood.  Some laser systems are sufficiently sensitive to perform pyrography on thin card or even paper.

=== Woods === 
Woods differ in hardness, grain, figure, texture, color, and other physical characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, Nanette. "Woodburning Project &amp; Pattern Treasury: Create Your Own Pyrography Art With 70 Mix-And-Match Designs." Library Journal 137.4 (2012): 96. Academic Search Complete. Web. 2 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Hardness:''' All woods can be classified into hard or soft. Usually softwoods are from coniferous (needle-leaved) trees. You may be aware of a little bit of resin oozing and also, a slight turpentine smell when you burn on softwood. 

Hardwoods are from broad-leaved trees. These hardwood trees can be classified into two distinct growing seasons each year (hot and cold season or a wet and dry season) such as:
* Earlywood: normally lighter in color and weight and only moderately strong
* Latewood: usually heavier, darker, and stronger. 

Softwood will burn faster than a hardwood does. It does not require as hot a pen to burn as do the hardwoods. 

'''Grain:''' Grain is the direction of the fibrous elements of the wood cells. This is important to sand with the grain. Also the grain can cause deviation from its intended path with use of woodturning pen unless you apply more pressure and burn slower on the grain.

'''Figure:''' This is the natural design, or pattern, that you can see on the cut surface of the wood. The figure present on the wood should always be taken into consideration when you are planning your woodburned design. 

'''Texture:''' There is a texture on the surface of that wood that feels either coarse of fine, even or uneven. 

As a beginning woodburner, avoid using very fine or intricate designs on uneven, coarse-textured wood. Softwoods are more apt to be fine or moderately coarse-textured. With some textures it may mean that you will have to compensate when burning it – going slower on the harder summerwood, faster and with a lighter touch on the softer springwood to create an even burn overall.

'''Color:''' Woodburning should be mainly used to enhance the natural beauty of a wooden project, so do not always hide a beautiful figure, grain, luster, or color if it is present.

== Safety ==
The main hazard to be wary of is the extremely fine wood dust when sanding the wood or in some cases the pitch/sap or resin that emits harmful fumes when burning. All wood dust is hazardous &amp; can cause respiratory problems if you do not wear a mask, some more than others &amp; should be avoided. You should always wear a quality dust mask/respirator while power carving, and use a good dust collection system to avoid a lifetime injury to your lungs. These recommendations really are not just for power carving or sanding, but they should be used for burning as well. Remember:
* '''DO NOT''' burn on pressure-treated wood. It is treated with chemicals that, although safely bound in the wood fibers for construction purposes, are inherently dangerous to woodworkers and woodburners.
* '''DO NOT''' burn on any type of treated wood: Chemically treated, stained, painted, sealed with a finish, etc.  If you  must use this type of wood be sure that you have thoroughly sanded it to remove all traces and are burning on '''bare''' wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pyrography Materials and Safety Precautions|url = http://www.sawdustconnection.com/Pyrography-101-Tutorial-Pyrography-Safety.htm|website = www.sawdustconnection.com|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prepared Wood, Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF), man made boards and plywood should never really ever be burned on for several reasons. Prepared wood usually has been chemically treated and burning on it will release toxins into the air. MDF is made out of toxic materials and may cause cancer and other health issues. Man-made boards and such also have layers of glue that releases toxins that may not cause immediate harm but impact one later on in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lesson 2: A word about safety in Pyrography|url = http://hippiescreations.com/a-word-about-safety-in-pyrography/|website = The Art of Handmade|accessdate = 2015-10-19|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8667">[[Image:Rochester_Poets_logo.jpg|right|thumbnail|129px]]'''Rochester Poets''' is the oldest ongoing literary organization in the [[upstate New York]] region. Founded in 1920 as the [[Rochester, New York]], chapter of the [[Poetry Society of America]], the group ceased its affiliation with the Society in the 1980s in order to accept a wider variety of members. At that time, the organization adopted its current name.
		
From June 2005 to May 2013, meeting/workshops were held monthly on the third (later fourth) Saturday at the Center at High Falls Gallery; the Gallery closed in June 2013, and subsequent meetings were held at various venues such as [[Panera Bread]] restaurants in the Rochester area.

From 2003 to 2005, the organization held monthly readings at Writers &amp; Books. In January 2006, the venue was changed to [[St. John Fisher College]] in [[Pittsford (town), New York|Pittsford, NY]], where it  held a reading on the third Sunday of each month in the Ross Art Gallery of the Skalny Welcome Center. In August, 2015, the group moved to the [[Clover Center for Arts &amp; Spirituality]] in [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton, NY]], and in March, 2017 moved to the [[Legacy at Clover Blossom]] complex, also in Brighton.   

A large portion of the Rochester Poetry Society and Rochester Poets correspondence, minutes and other documents from 1922 to 1973 are archived in the Rare Books and Special Collection Department of the [[Rush Rhees Library]] located at the [[University of Rochester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rochester Poetry Society|url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=1113|work=Department of Rare Books, Special Collections and Preservation|publisher=University of Rochester|accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Rochester Poets sends out regular email flyers of area literary events, publishes a monthly newsletter and ''The Pinnacle Hill Review''*, an annual anthology of selected member work. The group maintains a website, a mailing list (informing subscribers of area literary events) which can be joined via the website, and a [[blog]].

From 2004 to 2011, Rochester Poets sponsored an annual Poets Against the War event for the Rochester area. From April 2007 until September 2009, they co-sponsored a monthly series of readings at the Anti-War Storefront of the Peace, Action &amp; Education Committee of Rochester MetroJustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rochester MetroJustice Peace Action &amp; Education|url=http://www.metrojustice.org/pae_storefront.htm|accessdate=February 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212140750/http://metrojustice.org/pae_storefront.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, they began sponsoring annual [[World Poetry Day]] and [[National Poetry Month]] celebrations at St. John Fisher College in March and April of each year; the World Poetry Day event was merged with the April National Poetry Month event in 2009. The Celebration is open to poets, musicians and singers of all ages and levels from throughout the region.

From 2007 to 2011, the group sponsored an Emerging Poets event in December of each year at St. John Fisher College. The event was open to poets of all ages; the primary criterion for eligibility was that participants were not yet "established" with a published volume of poems or had a significant number of poems appear in literary journals. From 2007 to 2011, the group also hosted the weekly Free Speech Zone series each Tuesday at the Tango Cafe in Rochester; the series moved to Mondays in 2011 before it was suspended in December 2011 pending finding a new venue.

==Publications==
The group's anthology has had various titles over the years, among them ''The Oracle''&lt;ref name="FWP" /&gt;{{RP|128}}, ''Touchstone'', ''The Gleam'', ''In Between Seasons'', ''Images'', ''Daylight Burning Lanterns'', ''Disguised As Shapes You Love'', and, most recently, ''The Pinnacle Hill Review''. Many of the volumes are held by the Rochester Public Library, Central Branch Literature Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rochester Public Library, Central Branch Literature Collection|url=http://catalogplus.libraryweb.org/#section=search&amp;term=Rochester Poetry Society|accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable members==
The group was founded by [[Edith Willis Forbes]], who was also active in the [[Women's Education and Industrial Union]], the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], and the [[Door of Hope]];&lt;ref name="FWP"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rochester and Monroe County|year=1937|publisher=Scrantom's|location=Rochester, NY|url=https://archive.org/details/rochesterandmonr00federich|author=Federal Writer's Project|authorlink=Federal Writer's Project|accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|128}} its first president was [[Carl Lamson Carmer]].&lt;ref name="FWP" /&gt;{{RP|132}} Past and current members of note include [[Al Poulin, Jr.]] (1938–1996), [[Patricia Janus]] (1932–2006), [[Dale Davis (poet)|Dale Davis]], Leah Zazulyer, [[Cornelius Eady]], [[Dane Gordon]], Jordan Smith, [[James Lavilla-Havelin]], Etta Ruth Weigl, [[Israel Emiot]] (1909–1978), Gary Lehmann, John Roche, Vincent Golphin, Anne Coon, Carol Oliver, Gerald Clarke, Robert Koch, Wynne McClure, Ruth Kennedy, [[Francesca Gulì]] (ca 1921–2009), Paul Humphrey (1915–2001), Eleanor McQuilken (1908–2004), George Monagan (1925–2005), David Michael Nixon, [[W. E. Butts]] (1944–2013), [[Linda Allardt]], Patricia Roth Schwartz, John Cieslinski, Beatrice O'Brien, [[Judith Kitchen (1941-2014)]], [[Stanley Rubin]], and [[Frank Judge]], the organization's president since 2003.
	
Other Rochester area poets of note affiliated with the group include [[Adelaide Crapsey]] (1878–1914), who knew many of the founders of the group, [[William Heyen]] and [[Anthony Piccione]] (1939–2001), who were honored by the Society, and [[John Ashbery]] (1927–2017), who was raised in the area and knew and remained friends with many of the group's members and officers.

==Rochester Poets Walk==
In 2009, officials of the City of Rochester, in conjunction with the [[Art Walk Project]], which had created an area along University Avenue in Rochester in the "arts district", proposed an extension west along University and north and south along Goodman Street. The majority of the project would be along the sidewalks bordering two sides of Rochester's [[Memorial Art Gallery]]. The relationship between the City and Art Walk deteriorated, and eventually, a new entity, The Art Walk Extension Project, was created. Two of the proposed development for the Extension were a [[Poets Walk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rochester ''Democrat &amp; Chronicle'', Poets Walk|url=http://artdrop.democratandchronicle.com/poets-walk|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be constructed in 2012 as a redesigned front sidewalk of MAG on University, and a Fiction Writers Walk, still in development, on the east side of the Gallery along Goodman.

Many of those nominated for inclusion in Poets Walk were poets (several of them deceased) who were members of Rochester Poets or had been honored by or affiliated with the group in some way. And many of those nominees were among the first inductees honored in November 2011. They included: Sam Abrams, Linda Allardt, John Ashbery, Anne C. Coon, [[Adelaide Crapsey]], Finvola Drury, [[Cornelius Eady]], Israel Emiot, Vincent F. A. Golphin, Dane Gordon, [[Anthony Hecht]], [[William Heyen]], M. J. Iuppa, Patricia Janus, [[bobby johnson]], Kathryn Jospé, [[Frank Judge]], [[Galway Kinnell]], [[Judith Kitchen]], James LaVilla-Havelin, [[Li-Young Lee]].

'''''St. George and the Dragon''''' is a small [[cabinet painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]], painted between 1504 and 1506, and now in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. The saint wears the blue garter of the English [[Order of the Garter]], reflecting the award of this decoration in 1504 to Raphael's patron [[Guidobaldo da Montefeltro]], [[Duke of Urbino]], by King [[Henry VII of England]]. The first word of the order's motto, "HONI" can be made out.  The painting was presumably commissioned by the Duke, either to present to the English emissary who brought the regalia to Urbino, [[Gilbert Talbot (soldier)|Sir Gilbert Talbot]], or to Henry himself—recent scholarship suggests the latter. The honour paid to a minor Italian ruler reflected Henry's appreciation of the cultural prestige of Renaissance Italy as much as any diplomatic purpose.

The traditional subject, [[Saint George and the Dragon]], combining [[chivalry]] and Christianity, is appropriate for the occasion; like his father, Guidobaldo was a [[condottiero]], or proprietor of a band of [[mercenary]] soldiers. In the early stages of his career Raphael painted a number of tiny cabinet paintings, including another ''[[St. George (Raphael, Louvre)|St George]]'' in the [[Louvre]], and the ''[[Vision of a Knight (Raphael)|Vision of a Knight]]'' in the [[National Gallery]] in London.

==Provenance==
By 1627 the painting belonged to [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]] (1580-1630), and was at [[Wilton House]] in [[Wiltshire]]. Either the 3rd or 4th earl presented it to King [[Charles I of England]].  After the [[English Civil War]] it was sold in one of the sales of the [[Royal Collection]] at [[Somerset House]] in  London on 19 December 1651.  Soon after it was in France. The painting was later a highlight of the [[Pierre Crozat]] collection which was acquired through [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s mediation by [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772. For a century and a half, the panel hung in the Imperial [[Hermitage Museum]]. It was one of the most popular paintings in the entire collection of the Tsars. In March 1931 it was part of the [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings]], and bought by [[Andrew Mellon]], as part of his founding donation to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C. This and other foundational artworks, including paintings by [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], and [[Titian]], helped place the National Gallery among the most significant collections of Renaissance art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11334">'''Social sculpture''' is a phrase to describe an expanded concept of [[art]] that was invented by the artist and co-founder of the German Green Party, [[Joseph Beuys]]. Beuys created the term "social sculpture" to embody his understanding of art's potential to transform society. As a work of art, a social sculpture includes human activity that strives to structure and shape society or the environment. The central idea of a social sculptor is an artist who creates structures in society using language, thoughts, actions, and objects.

== Concept ==

[[Image:7thousand oaks.jpg|thumb|200px|Some of the [[7000 Oaks|7,000 Oaks]] planted between 1982 and 1987 for Documenta 7 (1982)]]
During the 1960s, Beuys formulated his central theoretical concepts concerning the social, cultural and political function and potential of art. Indebted to Romantic writers such as [[Novalis]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], Beuys was motivated by a utopian belief in the power of universal human creativity and was confident in the potential for art to bring about revolutionary change. These ideas were founded in the social ideas of [[anthroposophy]] and the work of [[Rudolf Steiner]], of which he was a vigorous and original proponent. This translated into Beuys' formulation of the concept of social sculpture, in which society as a whole was to be regarded as one great work of art (the Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk) to which each person can contribute creatively (perhaps Beuys' most famous phrase, borrowed from Novalis, is "Everyone is an artist"). In the video "Willoughby SHARP,'' Joseph Beuys, Public Dialogues'' (1974/120 min)", a record of Beuys' first major public discussion in the U.S., Beuys elaborates three principles: Freedom, Democracy, and Socialism, saying that each of them depends on the other two in order to be meaningful.  In 1973, Beuys wrote:

: ''"Only on condition of a radical widening of definitions will it be possible for art and activities related to art [to] provide evidence that art is now the only evolutionary-revolutionary power. Only art is capable of dismantling the repressive effects of a senile social system that continues to totter along the deathline: to dismantle in order to build ‘A SOCIAL ORGANISM AS A WORK OF ART’… EVERY HUMAN BEING IS AN ARTIST who – from his state of freedom – the position of freedom that he experiences at first-hand – learns to determine the other positions of the TOTAL ART WORK OF THE FUTURE SOCIAL ORDER."''&lt;ref&gt;Beuys statement dated 1973, first published in English in Caroline Tisdall: Art into Society, Society into Art (ICA, London, 1974), p.48. Capitals in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he was invited to create a work for [[Documenta]] 7. He delivered a large pile of basalt stones. From above, one could see that the pile of stones was a large arrow pointing to a single oak tree that he had planted. He announced that the stones should not be moved unless an oak tree was planted in the new location of the stone. [[7000 Oaks|7,000 oak trees]] were then planted in Kassel, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Reames, ''Arborsculpture: Solutions for a Small Planet'', 2005 p.42 {{ISBN|0-9647280-8-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project exemplified the idea that a social sculpture was defined as interdisciplinary and participatory.

In 1991, "[[The Thing (art project)|The Thing]]" took its inspiration from the concept of social sculpture.

In 2007, at [[Documenta|Documenta 12]], Kirill Preobrazhenskiy created work "Tram 4 Inner Voice Radio". His work was compared by critics with Beuys' oaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,488870,00.html Spiegel]:

Some of the art at this year's Documenta has escaped the confines of the exhibition halls and intervened in Kassel's public spaces -- like Kirill Preobrazhenskiy's "Tram 4 Inner Voice Radio," a sound installation played on a busy public transportation route.

This strategy has been tried before, though. From 1982 through 1987, Joseph Beuys came to Kassel and planted 7,000 trees alongside slabs of stone as part of an installation called "7,000 Oaks," for Documenta 7. Visitors still snap photos of the trees, which have become an internationally renowned work of art. Kassel residents rarely take a second glance.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization for direct democracy through plebiscite==
The "Organization for direct democracy through plebiscite" was founded by the artists Joseph Beuys, Johannes Stüttgen and Karl Fastabend on June 19, 1971 in Düsseldorf as a political organization. The goal was influencing social patterns with implementing Beuys' concept of the extended notion of art and the social sculpture via political means. Today,{{when|date=January 2016}} Johannes Stüttgen spread the idea for direct democracy with the project "Omnibus".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omnibus.org/fileadmin/omnibus.org/PDF/Sonstiges/4_Seiter_2008_engl_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==The individual ==
Beuys believed everybody was an artist. He once said "every sphere of human activity, even peeling a potato can be a work of art as long as it is a conscious act," the idea being that every decision you make should be thought out and attempt to make or contribute to a work of art which in the end is society.  Individuality and well-educated decisions are promoted in the person while the government is made of those decisions put into referendums.  This point of view invites followers to humble themselves by realizing that they are an important part of a whole not only an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, Danto, Mcevilley. Art On The Edge And Over, "Political Reformation: Joseph Beuys." 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The White Stag Group''' was a group of artists centred on the painters [[Basil Rakoczi]] and [[Kenneth Hall (artist)|Kenneth Hall]].

Founded in London in 1935, the group moved to Ireland in 1939 and stayed until after the [[Second World War]] where they gained Irish members like Thurloe Conolly, Paul Egestorff, Stephen Gilbert and Patrick Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antiquesandartireland.com/2011/10/art-ireland-white-stag/|title=WHITE STAG GROUP EXHIBITION AT ADAM’S, CLANDEBOYE «  antiquesandartireland.com|website=antiquesandartireland.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their group philosophy, which they called ''Subjectivist Art'', was not associated with any particular style or set belief. Instead, it encouraged an exploration of [[psychology]] and of [[modernism|modernist]] ideas. They also believed in aesthetic experimentation and [[aesthetics]] as an objective in art. Although formed in London and guided by two British born artists (Hall and Rakozci) the group has been described as "an Irish phenomenon" by the Irish art expert Dr. S.B. Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modernart.ie/en/downloads/whitestagbk.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629203750/http://www.modernart.ie/en/downloads/whitestagbk.doc |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was at the vanguard of modern artistic ideas in Ireland, were involved in the [[Irish Exhibition of Living Art]] and influenced [[Patrick Scott (artist)|Patrick Scott]], [[Gerald Dillon]] and [[Louis le Brocquy]]. The Irish composer [[Brian Boydell]], at that time a visual artist, was also a member of the group. The [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]] put on a White Stag retrospective during the summer of 2005.

The '''ancient Greek drama''' was a [[Theatre|theatrical]] [[culture]] that flourished in [[ancient Greece]] from 700 BC. The [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], which became a significant cultural, political, and military power during this period, was its center, where it was [[institution]]alised as part of a [[festival]] called the [[Dionysia]], which honored the god [[Dionysus]]. [[Greek tragedy|Tragedy]] (late 500 BC), [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] (490 BC), and the [[satyr play]] were the three [[drama]]tic [[genre]]s to emerge there. Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies.

==Etymology==
The word τραγῳδία ('tragodia'), from which the word "[[tragedy]]" is derived, is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of two [[Greek language|Greek]] words: τράγος (''tragos'') or "goat" and ᾠδή (''[[ode]]'') meaning "song", from ἀείδειν (''aeidein''), "to sing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://m-w.com/dictionary/tragedy Merriam-Webster definition of tragedy]&lt;/ref&gt;
This etymology indicates a link with the practices of the ancient [[Cult of Dionysus|Dionysian cults]]. It is impossible, however, to know with certainty how these [[Fertility rite|fertility rituals]] became the basis for tragedy and [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]].&lt;ref name="Redgeway"&gt;{{harvp|Ridgeway|1910|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{Main|Greek tragedy}}

[[File:2007-05-10 Epidauros, Greece 5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Panoramic view of [[Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus|the ancient theatre]] at [[Epidaurus]].]]

The classical Greek valued the power of spoken word, and it was their main method of communication and storytelling. Bahn and Bahn write, "To Greeks the spoken word was a living thing and infinitely preferable to the dead symbols of a written language." [[Socrates]] himself believed that once something has been written down, it lost its ability for change and growth. For these reasons, among many others, oral storytelling flourished in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Oral Interpretation|author1=Bahn, Eugene  |author2=Margaret L. Bahn |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = Burgess Publishing Company|year = 1970|location = Minneapolis, MN|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek tragedy as we know it was created in Athens around the time of 532 BC, when [[Thespis]] was the earliest recorded actor. Being a winner of the first theatrical contest held in Athens, he was the ''exarchon'', or leader,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, '[[Poetics]]'&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[dithyramb]]s performed in and around Attica, especially at the rural [[Dionysia]]. By Thespis' time, the dithyramb had evolved far away from its cult roots. Under the influence of heroic epic, Doric choral lyric and the innovations of the poet Arion, it had become a narrative, ballad-like genre. Because of these, Thespis is often called the "Father of Tragedy"; however, his importance is disputed, and Thespis is sometimes listed as late as 16th in the chronological order of Greek tragedians; the statesman [[Solon]], for example, is credited with creating poems in which characters speak with their own voice, and spoken performances of [[Homer]]'s epics by [[rhapsode]]s were popular in festivals prior to 534 BC.&lt;ref name="Brockett"&gt;{{harvp|Brockett|1999|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Thespis's true contribution to drama is unclear at best, but his name has been given a longer life, in English, as a common term for performer — i.e., a "thespian."

The dramatic performances were important to the Athenians – this is made clear by the creation of a tragedy competition and festival in the City Dionysia. This was organized possibly to foster loyalty among the tribes of Attica (recently created by [[Cleisthenes]]). The festival was created roughly around 508 BC. While no drama texts exist from the sixth century BC, we do know the names of three competitors besides Thespis: Choerilus, Pratinas, and [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynichus]]. Each is credited with different innovations in the field.

More is known about Phrynichus. He won his first competition between 511 BC and 508 BC. He produced tragedies on themes and subjects later exploited in the golden age such as the ''Danaids'', ''Phoenician Women'' and ''Alcestis''. He was the first poet we know of to use a historical subject – his ''Fall of Miletus'', produced in 493-2, chronicled the fate of the town of Miletus after it was conquered by the Persians. Herodotus reports that "the Athenians made clear their deep grief for the taking of Miletus in many ways, but especially in this: when Phrynichus wrote a play entitled "The Fall of Miletus" and produced it, the whole theatre fell to weeping; they fined Phrynichus a thousand drachmas for bringing to mind a calamity that affected them so personally and forbade the performance of that play forever."&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=6:chapter=21 Herodotus, ''Histories'', 6/21]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also thought to be the first to use female characters (though not female performers).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brockett|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]], all tragedies were unique pieces written in honour of Dionysus and played only once, so that today we primarily have the pieces that were still remembered well enough to have been repeated when the repetition of old tragedies became fashionable (the accidents of survival, as well as the subjective tastes of the Hellenistic librarians later in Greek history, also played a role in what survived from this period).

==New inventions during the classical period==

After the Great Destruction of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in 480 BCE, the town and acropolis were rebuilt, and theatre became formalized and an even greater part of Athenian culture and civic pride. This century is normally regarded as the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age]] of Greek drama. The centre-piece of the annual Dionysia, which took place once in winter and once in spring, was a competition between three tragic playwrights at the [[Theatre of Dionysus]]. Each submitted three tragedies, plus a satyr play (a comic, [[burlesque]] version of a mythological subject). Beginning in a first competition in 486 BC each playwright submitted a comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kuritz|1988|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] claimed that [[Aeschylus]] added the second actor ([[deuteragonist]]), and that [[Sophocles]] introduced the third ([[tritagonist]]). Apparently the Greek playwrights never used more than three actors based on what is known about Greek theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kuritz|1988|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greek Tragedy|Tragedy]] and [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] were viewed as completely separate genres, and no plays ever merged aspects of the two. [[Satyr play]]s dealt with the mythological subject matter of the tragedies, but in a purely comedic manner.

==Hellenistic period==

[[File:Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks - Princeton Art Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Roman, [[Roman Republic|Republican]] or [[Roman Empire|Early Imperial]], ''Relief of a seated poet ([[Menander]]) with masks of New Comedy'', 1st century B.C. – early 1st century A.D., [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]

The power of Athens declined following its defeat in the [[Peloponnesian War]] against the Spartans. From that time on, the theatre started performing old tragedies again. Although its theatrical traditions seem to have lost their vitality, Greek theatre continued into the [[Hellenistic]] period (the period following [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests in the fourth century BCE). However, the primary Hellenistic theatrical form was not tragedy but '[[Greek comedy#New Comedy|New Comedy]]', comic episodes about the lives of ordinary citizens. The only extant playwright from the period is [[Menander]]. One of New Comedy's most important contributions was its influence on Roman comedy, an influence that can be seen in the surviving works of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].

==Characteristics of the buildings==
[[File:Ancient Greek theatre in Delos 01.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek theatre in [[Delos]]]]
[[File:Delphi Composite.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Theatre of [[Delphi]].]]
The plays had a chorus from 12 to 15&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jansen|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; people, who performed the plays in verse accompanied by music, beginning in the morning and lasting until the evening. The performance space was a simple circular space, the ''orchestra'', where the chorus danced and sang. The orchestra, which had an average diameter of 78 feet, was situated on a flattened terrace at the foot of a hill, the slope of which produced a natural ''theatron'', literally "seeing place". Later, the term "theatre" came to be applied to the whole area of theatron, orchestra, and skené. The ''[[coryphaeus]]'' was the head chorus member who could enter the story as a character able to interact with the characters of a play.

[[File:GriechTheater2.PNG|thumb|right|A drawing of an ancient theatre. Terms are in [[Greek language]] and [[Latin letters]].]]
The theatres were originally built on a very large scale to accommodate the large number of people on stage, as well as the large number of people in the audience, up to fourteen thousand. Mathematics played a large role in the construction of these theatres, as their designers had to be able to create [[acoustics]] in them such that the actors' voices could be heard throughout the theatre, including the very top row of seats. The Greek's understanding of acoustics compares very favourably with the current state of the art. The first seats in Greek theatres (other than just sitting on the ground) were wooden, but around 499 BCE the practice of inlaying stone blocks into the side of the hill to create permanent, stable seating became more common. They were called the "prohedria" and reserved for priests and a few most respected citizens.

In 465 BCE, the playwrights began using a backdrop or scenic wall, which hung or stood behind the orchestra, which also served as an area where actors could change their costumes. It was known as the ''[[Skene (theatre)|skênê]]'' (from which the word "[[Scene (drama)|scene]]" derives). The death of a character was always heard behind the ''skênê'', for it was considered inappropriate to show a killing in view of the audience.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Conversely, there are scholarly arguments that death in Greek tragedy was portrayed off stage primarily because of dramatic considerations, and not prudishness or sensitivity of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pathmanathan|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 425 BC a stone scene wall, called a paraskenia, became a common supplement to ''skênê'' in the theatres. A paraskenia was a long wall with projecting sides, which may have had doorways for entrances and exits. Just behind the paraskenia was the proskenion. The proskenion ("in front of the scene") was beautiful, and was similar to the modern day [[proscenium]].

Greek theatres also had tall arched entrances called [[parodos|parodoi]] or [[eisodos|eisodoi]], through which actors and chorus members entered and exited the orchestra. By the end of the 5th century BC, around the time of the Peloponnesian War, the ''skênê'', the back wall, was two stories high. The upper story was called the episkenion. Some theatres also had a raised speaking place on the orchestra called the logeion.

===Scenic elements===
There were several scenic elements commonly used in Greek theatre:

* ''[[mechane]]'', a [[Crane (machine)|crane]] that gave the impression of a flying actor (thus, ''[[deus ex machina]]'')
* ''[[Ekkyklema|ekkyklêma]]'', a wheeled platform often used to bring dead characters into view for the audience
* ''[[Pinax|pinakes]]'', pictures hung to create scenery
* ''thyromata'', more complex pictures built into the second-level scene (3rd level from ground)
* [[phallic]] props were used for [[satyr plays]], symbolizing [[fertility]] in honour of [[Dionysus]].

==Masks==

===Masks===
[[File:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|Tragic Comic Masks [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic]]

The Ancient Greek term for a [[mask]] is ''prosopon'' (lit., "face"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.62:2:190.LSJ Liddell &amp; Scott via Perseus @ UChicago]&lt;/ref&gt; and was a significant element in the worship of [[Dionysus]] at [[Athens]], likely used in ceremonial rites and celebrations. Most of the evidence comes from only a few vase paintings of the 5th century BC, such as one showing a mask of the god suspended from a tree with decorated robe hanging below it and dancing and the ''Pronomos'' vase,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/image?lookup=1993.01.0669 Tufts.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts actors preparing for a [[Satyr play]].&lt;ref name="Vervain 2004. p.255"&gt;{{harvp|Vervain|Wiles|2004|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; No physical evidence remains available to us, as the masks were made of organic materials and not considered permanent objects, ultimately being dedicated at the altar of Dionysus after performances. Nevertheless, the mask is known to have been used since the time of [[Aeschylus]] and considered to be one of the iconic conventions of classical Greek theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Varakis|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masks were also made for members of the chorus, who play some part in the action and provide a commentary on the events in which they are caught up. Although there are twelve or fifteen members of the tragic chorus they all wear the same mask because they are considered to be representing one character.

===Mask details ===
[[File:3304 - Athens - Stoà of Attalus Museum - Theatre mask - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 9 2009.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mask dating from the 4th/3rd century BC, [[Stoa of Attalos]]]]

Illustrations of theatrical masks from 5th century display helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes for the eyes and a small aperture for the mouth, as well as an integrated wig. These paintings never show actual masks on the actors in performance; they are most often shown being handled by the actors before or after a performance, that liminal space between the audience and the stage, between myth and reality.&lt;ref name="Vervain vjdivimcl
way in which the mask was to 'melt' into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vervain|Wiles|2004|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, the mask transformed the actor as much as memorization of the text. Therefore, performance in ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character.

The mask-makers were called ''skeuopoios'' or "maker of the properties," thus suggesting that their role encompassed multiple duties and tasks. The masks were most likely made out of light weight, organic materials like stiffened linen, leather, wood, or cork, with the wig consisting of human or animal hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brooke|1962|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the visual restrictions imposed by these masks, it was imperative that the actors hear in order to orient and balance themselves. Thus, it is believed that the ears were covered by substantial amounts of hair and not the helmet-mask itself. The mouth opening was relatively small, preventing the mouth to be seen during performances. Vervain and Wiles posit that this small size discourages the idea that the mask functioned as a megaphone, as originally presented in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Vervain 2004. p.255"/&gt; Greek mask-maker, Thanos Vovolis, suggests that the mask serves as a resonator for the head, thus enhancing vocal acoustics and altering its quality. This leads to increased energy and presence, allowing for the more complete metamorphosis of the actor into his character.&lt;ref name="Vovolis"&gt;{{harvp|Vovolis|Zamboulakis|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mask functions===
[[File:Theatre mask mosaic MAN Napoli Inv9994.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic detail from the [[House of the Faun]]]]
In a large open-air theatre, like the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] in [[Athens]], the classical masks were able to create a sense of dread in the audience creating large scale panic, especially since they had intensely exaggerated facial features and expressions.&lt;ref name="Vovolis"/&gt; They enabled an actor to appear and reappear in several different roles, thus preventing the audience from identifying the actor to one specific character. Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex, age, and social status, in addition to revealing a change in a particular character's appearance, e.g. Oedipus after blinding himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brockett|Ball|2000|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play, such as [[The Furies]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia|Eumenides]]'' and [[Pentheus]] and [[Cadmus]] in [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]''. Worn by the chorus, the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity, while representing a multi-voiced persona or single organism and simultaneously encouraged interdependency and a heightened sensitivity between each individual of the group. Only 2-3 actors were allowed on the stage at one time, and masks permitted quick transitions from one character to another. There were only male actors, but masks allowed them to play female characters.

===Other costume details===
[[File:Comedy and tragedy masks.svg|thumb|Comedy and tragedy masks]]
{{see also|Sock and buskin}}
The actors in these plays that had tragic roles wore boots called ''cothurni'' that elevated them above the other actors. The actors with comedic roles only wore a thin soled shoe called a [[sock]]. For this reason, dramatic art is sometimes alluded to as "Sock and Buskin."

[[Melpomene]] is the [[muse]] of tragedy and is often depicted holding the tragic mask and wearing cothurni. [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] is the muse of comedy and is similarly associated with the mask of comedy and the comedic "socks".

Male actors playing female roles would wear a wooden structure on their chests (posterneda) to imitate the look of breasts and another structure on their stomachs (progastreda) to make them appear softer and more lady like. They would also wear white body stockings under their costumes to make their skin appear fairer.

Most costuming detail comes from pottery paintings from that time as costumes and masks were fabricated out of disposable material, so there are little to no remains of any costume from that time. The biggest source of information is the Pronomos Vase where actors are painted at a show's after party.

Costuming would give off a sense of character, as in gender, age, social status, and class. For example, characters of higher class would be dressed in nicer clothing, although everyone was dressed fairly nicely. Contrary to popular belief, they did not dress in only rags and sandals, as they wanted to impress. Some examples of Greek theatre costuming include long robes called the chiton that reached the floor for actors playing gods, heroes, and old men. Actors playing Goddesses and women characters that held a lot of power wore purples and golds. Actors playing Queens and Princesses wore long cloaks that dragged on the ground and were decorated with gold stars and other jewels, and warriors were dressed in a variety of armor and wore helmets adorned with plumes. Costumes were supposed to be colourful and obvious to be easily seen by every seat in the audience.

'''''Thread Routes''''' is a 16mm film series by artist [[Kimsooja]].

Divided into six chapters, ''Thread Routes'' takes place in six different cultural zones around the world. The artist considers her approach to this film as a 'visual poem' and a 'visual anthropology', in that it juxtaposes and presents structural similarities in performative elements of textile culture with the structures in nature, architecture, agriculture and gender relationships in different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heartmus.dk/kimsooja-3472.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226023659/http://www.heartmus.dk/kimsooja-3472.aspx |archivedate=26 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biaci.org/en/kim-sooja/&lt;/ref&gt; These non-descriptive and unnarrative documentary films were conceived after being inspired in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]], in 2002, by the performative elements of traditional [[Bobbin lace|lace making]], and the city's architectural structure.

The first chapter, completed in 2010, explores [[Peru]]vian weaving culture, and its tight alignment with its landscapes and historic archeological structures. This piece journeys throughout the country, from the Sacred Valley around [[Cusco]] and [[Machu Picchu]] to the Taquila Island villages, forming a non-linear timeline of the connection between people and their geographical environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://broadstrokes.org/2014/09/09/artist-spotlight-kimsoojas-threads-of-culture-and-landscape/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mello, Laeticia, "The Pilgrimage of Our Own existence"- Arte Al Limite, Published by Arte Al Limite ltd. March 2012, pp 30-38&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter II, which finished filming in the summer of 2011, focused on [[Europe]]an lace making actions such as bobbin lace-making from Bruges (Belgium), [[Lepoglava]] and [[Pag (town)|Pag]] ([[Croatia]]); industrial lace-making in [[Calais]] ([[France]]); needle point lace-making by nuns in a monastery in [[Hvar]] ([[Croatia]]) who use threads from dry [[aloe vera|aloe]] leaves; and traditional needlepoint on the small island of [[Burano]] ([[Italy]]). These scenes are set against representative European architecture such as the [[Duomo of Milan|Duomo in Milan]]; the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]]; and the [[Sedlec Ossuary]] in [[Kutna Hora]] ([[Czech Republic]]), which is decorated by human bones and skulls. Local vegetation and flowers overlap with scenes from [[Alhambra|La Alhambra]] in [[Granada]] ([[Spain]]) which, in its detailed and complex decorative Islamic architectural forms, conveys a spatial sensibility and a spiritual dimension that is mirrored in lace-making. The bold, masculine, and power-oriented monumental architectural forms are revealed as similar acts to the delicate, feminine, and ephemeral textile making.

The third chapter (2012) journeys to [[India]] and studies the traditions of dyeing, sewing, weaving, embroidery, tattoo and woodblock printing; juxtaposing them with the archeological structures and temporary housing structures of the nomadic communities in [[Gujara]], as well as the Step Well and the Sun Temple in [[Ahmedabad]].

Most recently, [[Kimsooja]] filmed Chapter IV in China, where she encountered the specific weaving, dyeing and garment culture of the [[Miao people|Miao minority]] in the [[Guizhou]], [[Hainan]] and [[Yunnan]] provinces. These are depicted alongside elaborate silver adornment and paper making, as well as the ancient local housing structures in [[Fujian]], the rice terraces of [[Yunnan]] and the landscapes of [[Guizhou]] and [[Hainan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://guggenheim-bilbao.es/en/exhibitions/kimsooja-thread-routes/&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently in preproduction phase, ''Thread Routes - Chapter V''  will explore [[Native Americans in the United States|native American]] textile culture.

The first three chapters were presented at [[Guggenheim Bilbao]] between March and July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://guggenheim-bilbao.es/en/exhibitions/kimsooja-thread-routes/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Book Day'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.worldbookday.com/about/| title = What is World Book Day?|publisher =Worldbookday.com| accessdate = 16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''World Book and Copyright Day''' (also known as '''International Day of the Book''' or '''World Book Days''') is a yearly event on April 23rd, organized by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), to promote [[reading (activity)|reading]], [[publishing]] and [[copyright]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], the day is recognized on the first Thursday in March. World Book Day was celebrated for the first time on 23 April 1995.

==Date selection==
The original idea was of the Valencian writer Vicente Clavel Andrés as a way to honour the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], first on 7 October, his birth date, then on 23 April, his death date. In 1995 UNESCO decided that the World Book and Copyright Day would be celebrated on 23 April, as the date is also the anniversary of the death of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]], as well as that of the birth or death of several other prominent authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/bookday/ |title=World Book and Copyright Day, 23 April |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In a historical coincidence, Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same ''date'' — 23 April 1616 — but not on the same ''day'', as at the time, Spain used the [[Gregorian calendar]] and England used the [[Julian calendar]]; Shakespeare actually died 10 days after Cervantes died, on 3 May of the Gregorian calendar.)

{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Book Day is 23 April, the anniversary of Cervantes death, ''[[Don Quixote]]'' is read during a two-day "readathon" and the [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] is presented by the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish king]] in [[Alcalá de Henares]]. 

In Catalonia, Spain, [[St. George's Day]] has been 'The Day of the Rose' since 1436, and involves the exchange of gifts between loved ones and respected people—it is analogous to [[Valentine's Day]].  Although World Book and Copyright Day has been celebrated since 1995 internationally, books were exchanged on 'The Day of the Rose' in Catalonia since 1929, in memory of Cervantes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La Sant Jordi et le jour du livre |url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/culturacatalana/menuitem.be2bc4cc4c5aec88f94a9710b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=bcdaef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=bcdaef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detall2&amp;contentid=a503ef7fb89d7210VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD |work=Generalitat de Catalunya |date=20 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220195057/http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/culturacatalana/menuitem.be2bc4cc4c5aec88f94a9710b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=bcdaef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=bcdaef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detall2&amp;contentid=a503ef7fb89d7210VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD |archive-date=20 December 2013|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1537">The '''Ypotryll''' is a Medieval European chimeric creature featured in [[heraldry]]. It has the tusked head of a wild [[boar]] or hog, the humped body of a [[camel]], the legs and hooves of an [[ox]] or [[goat]] and the long, scaly tail of a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]. Its name is thought to be derived from the greek “hippo” (horse) or in [[Middle English]], “ypotame” itself derived from the latin "ypotamus". Though there isn’t much known of the creature’s meanings or origins, it appears as the badge of [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester]], also known as the “Butcher of England”; a man known for his extreme cruelty in regards to the execution of Lancastrians during his rule as Lord High Constable in the early 1460s. The creature is known for its awesome ugliness, and is perhaps a reflection of those that wore it as their mark. Tiptoft was beheaded in 1470 by the Lancastrians during the War of the Roses (1455-1487). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rodney |last=Dennys |authorlink=Rodney Dennys |title=The Heraldic Imagination |place=London |publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins |year=1975 |page=166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
