In [[linguistics]], a '''binomial pair''' or '''binomial''' is a sequence of two or more words or phrases belonging to the same grammatical category, having some semantic relationship and joined by some syntactic device such as ''and'' or ''or''. Examples in English include ''through and through'', ''(without) let or hindrance'', and ''chalk and cheese''.

Several [[legal term]]s are binomial pairs, often (but not necessarily) consisting of one [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word and one [[Romance languages|Romance]] word, such as ''(last) will and testament'' or ''cease and desist''.

Binomials are often irreversible; that is, they occur only in one order. For example, one says ''bow and arrow'' but not ''*arrow and bow''; one says ''here and there'' and ''that's neither here nor there'', but not ''*there and here'' or ''*that's neither there nor here''.

Examples of biotic materials are [[wood]], [[straw]], [[humus]], [[manure]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[crude oil]], [[cotton]], [[spider silk]], [[chitin]], [[fibrin]], and [[bone]].

The use of biotic materials, and processed biotic materials ([[bio-based material]]) as [[alternative natural materials]], over synthetics is popular with those who are environmentally conscious because such materials are usually biodegradable, renewable, and the processing is commonly understood and has minimal environmental impact. However, not all biotic materials are used in an environmentally friendly way, such as those that require high levels of processing, are harvested unsustainably, or are used to produce [[greenhouse gasses|carbon emission]]s.

When the source of the recently living material has little importance to the product produced, such as in the production of [[biofuel]]s, biotic material is simply called [[biomass]]. Many fuel sources may have biological sources, and may be divided roughly into [[fossil fuels]], and [[biofuel]].

In [[soil science]], biotic material is often referred to as ''[[organic matter]]''. Biotic materials in [[soil]] include [[glomalin]], [[Dopplerite]] and [[humic acid]].  Some biotic material may not be considered to be organic matter if it is low in [[organic compounds]], such as a clam's shell, which is an essential component of the living organism, but contains little organic carbon.

Examples of the use of biotic materials include:

More than 3,000 [[prehistoric]] [[standing stone]]s were hewn from local [[Rock (geology)|rock]] and erected by the pre-[[Celts|Celtic]] people of [[Brittany]], and form the largest such collection in the world.&lt;ref name="Menhir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://menhirs.tripod.com/intro.html |title=Megaliths of Carnac: Introduction |publisher=menhirs.tripod.com |accessdate=2010-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the stones are within the Breton village of [[Carnac]], but some to the east are within [[La Trinité-sur-Mer]]. The stones were erected at some stage during the [[Neolithic]] period, probably around [[33rd century BCE|3300 BCE]], but some may date to as early as 4500&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/france/carnac-stones.htm| title=Carnac Stones, Brittany| publisher=Sacred Destinations Travel Guide| accessdate=2006-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the stones date from 4500 BCE, modern myths were formed which resulted from 1st century AD [[Roman Gaul|Roman]] and later Christian occupations. A Christian myth associated with the stones held that they were pagan soldiers in pursuit of [[Pope Cornelius]] when he turned them to stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.therecord.com/Life/Travel/article/320293 |title=TheRecord.com - Travel - Marvelling at Carnac's stones |publisher=News.therecord.com |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franceholidays.co.uk/france_holidays/brittany.php |title=France Holidays, Brittany |publisher=Franceholidays.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigsiteofamazingfacts.com/why-are-carnac-stones-called-megaliths |title=Why are Carnac Stones Called Megaliths? |publisher=Big Site of Amazing Facts  |accessdate=2010-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brittany has its own local versions of the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] cycle. Local tradition claims that the reason they stand in such perfectly straight lines is that they are a [[Roman legion]] turned to stone by [[Merlin]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In recent centuries, many of the sites have been neglected, with reports of [[dolmen]]s being used as sheep shelters, chicken sheds or even ovens.&lt;ref name="megalithic 9178"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=9178| publisher=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map| title=La Madeleine dolmen Burial Chamber (Dolmen)| author=TheCaptain| date=3 January 2005| accessdate=2006-05-17| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66aduXnp6?url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=9178| archivedate=1 April 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more commonly, stones have been removed to make way for roads, or as [[building material]]s.

==Alignments==
[[File:Menhirs carnac.jpg|center|795px|border|Menec alignment, at the western end]]

There are three major groups of [[stone row]]s&amp;nbsp;— ''Ménec'', ''Kermario'' and ''Kerlescan''&amp;nbsp;— which may have once formed a single group, but have been split up as stones were removed for other purposes.

There are what [[Alexander Thom]] considered to be the remains of [[stone circle]]s at either end. According to the tourist office there is a "[[Stone circles|cromlech]] containing 71 stone blocks" at the western end and a very ruined cromlech at the eastern end. The largest stones, around {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=off}} high, are at the wider, western end; the stones then become as small as {{convert|0.6|m|ftin|lk=out|abbr=off}} high along the length of the alignment before growing in height again toward the extreme eastern end.

===Tumuli===
There are several [[tumulus|tumuli]], mounds of earth built up over a grave. In this area, they generally feature a passage leading to a central chamber which once held neolithic artefacts.

[[File:tumulus carnac.jpg|thumbnail|''Tumulus of Saint-Michel'']]
;Saint-Michel:{{Main article|Saint-Michel tumulus}}The [[tumulus]] of Saint-Michel was constructed between 5000&amp;nbsp;BC and 3400&amp;nbsp;BC. At its base it is {{convert|125|by|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and is {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.  It required {{convert|35000|m3|cuyd}} of stone and earth.  Its function was the same as that of the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids of Egypt]]: a tomb for the members of the ruling class.  It contained various funerary objects, such as 15 stone chests, pottery, jewellery, most of which are currently held by the Museum of Prehistory of Carnac.&lt;ref name="ot-carnac historie alignment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ot-carnac.fr/version_anglaise/histoire_alignement.php  |title=Office de Tourisme de Carnac |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2006-07-03 |accessdate=2009-07-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060703063525/http://www.ot-carnac.fr/version_anglaise/histoire_alignement.php |archivedate = 2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was excavated in 1862 by [[René Galles]] with a series of vertical pits, digging down {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

:A chapel was built on top in 1663 but was rebuilt in 1813, before being destroyed in 1923.  The current building is an identical reconstruction of the 1663 chapel, built in 1926. &lt;!-- according to tourist office info, the chapel was built in 1664, also refers to this extra reconstruction "vers 1813" --&gt;

===Dolmens===
[[File:Dolmen Roch-Feutet.JPG|thumb|The dolmen Er-Roc'h-Feutet. An inscription next to every standing stone formation proclaims ownership by the state of France.]]
 
There are several [[dolmen]]s scattered around the area. These dolmens are generally considered to have been tombs; however, the acidic soil of Brittany has eroded away the bones. They were constructed with several large stones supporting a capstone, then buried under a mound of earth. In many cases, the mound is no longer present, sometimes due to archeological excavation, and only the large stones remain, in various states of ruin.
;''Er-Roc'h-Feutet'': North, near the Chapelle de La Madeleine. Has a completely covered roof.

[[File:Tumulus de Kercado 2005 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Dolmen of Kercado'''. Though smaller than St. Michel, older by many centuries before 4800 BC]]
;''Kercado'': A rare dolmen still covered by its original [[cairn]]. South of the Kermario alignments, it is {{convert|25|to(-)|30|m|ft}} wide, {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, and has a small menhir on top. Previously surrounded by a circle of small menhirs {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} out,&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt; the main passage is {{convert|6.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and leads to a large chamber where numerous artifacts were found, including axes, arrowheads, some animal and human teeth, some pearls and [[sherd]]s, and 26 beads of a unique bluish [[Nephrite]] gem. It has some [[Megalithic art]] carved on its inner surfaces in the form of serpentines and a human-sized double-axe symbol carved in the underside of its main roof slab. In ancient cultures, the axe and more precisely the [[Labrys|bi-pennis]] used to represent the lightning powers of divinity. It was constructed around 4600&amp;nbsp;BC and used for approximately 3,000 years.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;

;''Mané Brizil''
;''Kerlescan'':A roughly rectangular mound, with only one [[Caprock|capstone]] remaining. It is aligned east-to-west, with a passage entrance to the south.&lt;ref name="tiscali kerlescan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/kerlescan.htm |title=Kerlescan |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66adsjbqU?url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/kerlescan.htm |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;''Kermarquer'': On a small hill, has two separate chambers.

[[Alexander Thom]] suggested it measured forty by thirty of his [[megalithic yard]]s.&lt;ref name="ThomThom1978"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alexander Thom|author2=Archibald Stevenson Thom|title=Megalithic remains in Britain and Brittany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbTeKi00QH0C|accessdate=30 April 2011|year=1978|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-858156-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other formations===
[[File:QuadrilatereduManio.JPG|thumb|left|The Manio quadrilateral arrangement.]]
[[File:Carnac Geant du Manio.jpg|thumb|upright|The Manio "Giant".]]
There are some individual menhirs and at least one other formation which do not fit into the above categories.
;''Manio'' quadrilateral: An arrangement of stones to form the perimeter of a large rectangle. Originally a "tertre tumulus" with a central mound, it is {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and aligned to east of northeast.

==Excavation and analysis==
[[File:Menec Single.JPG|thumb|left|Large upright in the ''Ménec'' alignment]]
From the 1720s increasing interest was shown in these features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/megalithes/en/mega/megacarhis_en.htm Astonishing Heaps of Stones]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1796, for example, [[Théophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne|La Tour d'Auvergne]] attributed them to [[druid]]ic gatherings.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt; In 1805, A. Maudet de Penhoët claimed they represented stars in the sky.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;

Englishmen [[Francis Ronalds]] and [[Alexander Blair (writer)|Alexander Blair]] made a detailed survey of the stones in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ronalds created the first accurate drawings of many of them with his patented [[perspective machine|perspective tracing instrument]], which were printed in a book ''Sketches at Carnac (Brittany) in 1834''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sketches_at_Carnac_Brittany_in_1834.html?id=HuA-AAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Sketches at Carnac (Brittany) in 1834|last=Blair and Ronalds|first=|date=1836|website=Google Books|publisher=|access-date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miln and Le Rouzic===
The first extensive excavation was performed in the 1860s by Scottish antiquary [[James Miln]] (1819–1881), who reported that by then fewer than 700 of the 3,000 stones were still standing.&lt;ref name="ml"&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=2146410728 The Independent: Bretons fight for Carnac to stay in the Stone Age] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66adqwmsr?url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=2146410728 |date=2012-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards 1875, Miln engaged a local boy, {{Interlanguage link multi|Zacharie Le Rouzic|fr}} (1864–1939), as his assistant, and Zacharie learnt archaeology on the job. After Miln's death, he left the results of his excavations to the town of Carnac, and the ''James Miln Museum'' was established there by his brother Robert to house the artifacts. Zacharie became the director of the Museum and, although self-taught, became an internationally recognised expert on megaliths in the region. He too left the results of his work to the town, and the museum is now named ''Le Musée de Préhistoire James Miln&amp;nbsp;– Zacharie le Rouzic''.&lt;ref name=megalithia&gt;[http://www.megalithia.com/brittany/carnac/ Carnac&amp;nbsp;— Megalithic alignments of standing stones.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=museedecarnac&gt;[http://www.museedecarnac.com/musee_carnac.htm Musée de Préhistoire James Miln&amp;nbsp;– Zacharie le Rouzic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517075032/http://www.museedecarnac.com/musee_carnac.htm |date=2006-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories===
[[File:Carnac Ménec alignments.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The ''Ménec'' alignments of some 1,100 stones in 11 columns.]]
In 1887, H. de Cleuziou argued for a connection between the rows of stones and the directions of sunsets at the solstices.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;

Among more recent studies, [[Alexander Thom]] worked with his son Archie from 1970 to 1974 to carry out a detailed survey of the Carnac alignments, and produced a series of papers on the [[Archaeoastronomy|astronomical alignments]] of the stones as well as [[Statistics|statistical analysis]] supporting his concept of the [[Megalithic Yard|megalithic yard]].&lt;ref name=megalithia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John Edwin | last=Wood | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1978 | title= Sun, Moon and Standing Stones | edition=paperback 1980 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-285089-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thom's megalithic yard has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heggie|first=Douglas C.|title=Megalithic Science: Ancient Mathematics and Astronomy in North-west Europe|year=1981|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0-500-05036-8|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruggles|first=Clive|title=Astronomy in Prehistoric Britain and Ireland|year=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-07814-5|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also general theories on the use of the stones as astronomical observatories, as has been claimed for [[Stonehenge]]. According to one such theory, the [[Broken Menhir of Er Grah|massive menhir]] at nearby [[Locmariaquer]] was linked to the alignments for such a purpose.&lt;ref name="dino"&gt;{{fr icon}} http://www.dinosoria.com/dolmen_menhir.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
[[File:Carnac Kerlescan sheep.jpg|thumb|left|Sheep grazing around the Kerlescan alignment, part of a new management strategy.]]
The ''Musée de Préhistoire James Miln&amp;nbsp;– Zacharie le Rouzic'' is at the centre of conserving and displaying the artefacts from the area.&lt;ref name=museedecarnac/&gt;  It also contains the "world's largest collection [of] prehistoric[al] exhibits"&lt;ref name="ot-carnac historie alignment"/&gt; with over 6,600 prehistoric objects from 136 different sites.

The monuments themselves were listed and purchased by the State at the start of the 20th century to protect them against quarrymen, and while this was successful at the time, in the middle of the century, redevelopment, changes to [[Agriculture|agricultural practices]] and increasing tourism bringing visitors to the stones led to rapid deterioration. The ''Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication'' (Heritage Ministry) re-examined the issue starting in 1984, and subsequently set up the ‘Mission Carnac’ in 1991 with the aim of rehabilitating and developing the alignments. This involved restricting [[Public-access television|public access]], launching a series of scientific and technical studies, and producing a plan for conservation and development in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/megalithes/en/rea/reacar_en.htm The Carnac Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the megalithic structure of [[Stonehenge]] in [[England]], management of the stones can be controversial. Since 1991, the main groups of stone rows have been protected from the public by fences "to help vegetation growth",&lt;ref name="ot-carnac historie alignment"/&gt; preventing visits except by organised tours. They are open during winter, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/carnac.htm |title=Carnac |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68HCZwQLf?url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/carnac.htm |archivedate=2012-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
When [[James Miln]] studied the stones in the 1860s, he reported that fewer than 700 of the 3,000 stones were still standing, and subsequent work during the 1930s and 1980s (using bulldozers) rearranged the stones, re-erecting some, to make way for roads or other structures. In 2002, protesters invaded the site, opening the padlocks and allowing tourists free entry.&lt;ref name="ml"/&gt; In particular, the group ''Collectif Holl a gevred'' (French and Breton for "the everyone-together collective") occupied the visitor centre for the Kermario alignment, demanding an immediate stop to current management plans and local input into further plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web |url=http://nopasaran.samizdat.net/article.php3?id_article=662 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227231719/http://nopasaran.samizdat.net/article.php3?id_article=662 |archivedate=2008-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, management of the site has also experimented with allowing sheep to graze among the stones, in order to keep [[gorse]] and other weeds under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/menec_west.htm |title=Menec West |publisher=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68HCaWx6P?url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/celynog/Brittany/menec_west.htm |archivedate=2012-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the book by James McBride|The Color of Water}}
[[File:Strawberry splash.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=a glass of transparent water sitting on a wooden table|When water is in small quantities (e.g. in a glass) it appears [[wikt:colorless|colorless]] to the [[human eye]]]]
The '''color of water''' varies with the ambient conditions in which that water is present. While relatively small quantities of [[water]] appear to be [[Transparency and translucency|colorless]], pure water has a slight [[blue]] [[color]] that becomes a deeper blue as the thickness of the observed sample increases. The blue hue of water is an intrinsic property and is caused by selective [[Electromagnetic absorption by water|absorption]] and [[scattering]] of white light. Dissolved [[chemical elements|elements]] or suspended impurities may give water a different color.

==Intrinsic colour==
[[File:SwimmingPoolAndBucket.jpg|thumb|right|An indoor swimming pool appears blue from above. as light reflecting from the bottom of the pool travels through enough water that its red component is absorbed. The same water in a smaller bucket looks only slightly blue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Davis |first=Jim |last2=Milligan |first2=Mark |year=2011 |title=Why is Bear Lake So Blue? |series=Public Information Series |volume=96 |publisher=[[Utah Geological Survey]] |url=http://geology.utah.gov/whatsnew/news/new0411b.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123163847/http://www.geology.utah.gov/whatsnew/news/new0411b.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2011 |isbn=978-1-55791-842-0 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observing the water at close range makes it appear colourless to the human eye.]]
The intrinsic colour of liquid water may be demonstrated by looking at a white light source through a long pipe that is filled with purified water and closed at both ends with a transparent window. The light [[Turquoise (colour)|turquoise]] blue colour is caused by weak [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] in the red part of the [[visible spectrum]].&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;{{Citation |last=Braun |first=Charles L. |last2=Smirnov |first2=Sergei N. |year=1993 |title=Why is water blue? |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education]] |volume=70 |issue=8 |pages=612–614 |url=http://inside.mines.edu/fs_home/dwu/classes/CH353/study/Why%20is%20Water%20Blue.pdf |doi=10.1021/ed070p612|bibcode = 1993JChEd..70..612B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pope |author2=Fry |title=Absorption spectrum (380-700nm) of pure water. II. Integrating cavity measurements |journal=Applied Optics |volume=36 |issue=33 |pages=8710–23 |year=1996 |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-39-31-5843 |doi=10.1364/ao.36.008710 |pmid=18264420 |bibcode = 1997ApOpt..36.8710P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absorptions in the visible spectrum are usually attributed to excitations of [[Electron configuration|electronic]] energy states in matter. Water is a simple three-atom [[molecule]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and all its electronic absorptions occur in the [[ultraviolet]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and are therefore not responsible for the colour of water in the visible region of the spectrum. The water molecule has three fundamental modes of [[molecular vibrations|vibration]]. Two stretching vibrations of the O-H [[Chemical bond|bond]]s in the gaseous state of water occur at v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3650&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 3755&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Absorption due to these vibrations occurs in the [[infrared]] region of the spectrum. The absorption in the visible spectrum is due mainly to the [[harmonic]] v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 14,318&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is equivalent to a wavelength of 698&amp;nbsp;nm. In liquid state at 20°C these vibrations are red-shifted due to hydrogen bonding, resulting in red absorption at 740&amp;nbsp;nm, other harmonics such as v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; giving red absorption at 660&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Braun" /&gt; The absorption curve for heavy water (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is of a similar shape, but is shifted further towards the infrared end of the spectrum, because the vibrational transitions have a lower energy. For this reason, heavy water does not absorb red light and thus large bodies of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O would lack the characteristic blue colour of the more commonly-found light water (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref name="Webexhibits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolour/5B.html |title=Colours from Vibration |author=WebExhibits |work=Causes of Colour |publisher=[[WebExhibits]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223212434/http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolour/5B.html |archivedate=2017-02-23 |accessdate=2017-10-21 |quote=Heavy water is colourless because all of its corresponding vibrational transitions are shifted to lower energy (higher wavelength) by the increase in isotope mass. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absorption intensity decreases markedly with each successive overtone, resulting in very weak absorption for the third overtone. For this reason, the pipe needs to have a length of a meter or more and the water must be purified by [[microfiltration]] to remove any particles that could produce [[Mie scattering]].

==Color of lakes and oceans==
[[File:Ireland-AtlanticOceanwithAranIsland.jpg|thumb|left|Large bodies of water such as oceans manifest water's inherent blue color.]]
Lakes and oceans appear blue for several reasons.  One is that the surface of the water reflects the color of the sky. While this reflection contributes to the observed color, it is not the sole reason.{{sfn|Braun|Smirnov|1993|p=612|ps=:"...any simple answer is bound to mislead.  It turns out that contributions to the observed color are made both by reflected skylight and by the intrinsic absorption."}}

Some of the light hitting the surface of ocean is reflected but most of it penetrates the water surface, interacting with its molecules. The water molecule can vibrate in three different modes when irradiated by light. The red, orange, yellow, and green wavelengths of light are absorbed so the remaining light seen is composed of the shorter wavelength blues and violets. This is the main reason the [[ocean color|ocean's color]] is blue.

Some constituents of sea water can influence the shade of blue of the ocean. This is why it can look greener or bluer in different areas. Water in swimming pools (which may also contain various chemicals) with white-painted sides and bottom will appear as a turquoise blue.

Clean water appears blue in white-tiled swimming pools as well as in indoor pools where there is no blue sky to be reflected. The deeper the pool, the bluer the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  |last=Rossing |first=Thomas D. |last2=Chiaverina |first2=Christopher J. |date=1999 |title=Light science: physics and the visual arts |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |isbn=978-0-387-98827-6 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Scattering from suspended particles also plays an important role in the color of lakes and oceans.  A few tens of meters of water will absorb all light, so without scattering, all bodies of water would appear black. Because most lakes and oceans contain suspended living matter and mineral particles, known as [[colored dissolved organic matter]] (CDOM), light from above is reflected upwards. Scattering from suspended particles would normally give a white color, as with snow, but because the light first passes through many meters of blue-colored liquid, the scattered light appears blue. In extremely pure water—as is found in mountain lakes, where scattering from white-colored particles is missing—the scattering from water molecules themselves also contributes a blue color.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

[[File:Ocean color 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The hue of the reflected sky also contributes to the perceived color of water.]]
Another phenomenon that occurs is [[Rayleigh scattering]] in the [[atmosphere]] along one's line of sight: the [[horizon]] is typically 4–5&amp;nbsp;km distant and the air (being just above [[sea level]] in the case of the ocean) is at its [[Density of air|densest]].  This mechanism would add a blue tinge to any distant object (not just the sea) because blue light would be scattered into one's line of sight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The surfaces of seas and lakes often reflect blue skylight, making them appear bluer. The relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle.{{sfn|Braun|Smirnov|1993|p=613 |ps=:"...the relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle." }}

==Color of glaciers==
{{Main article|Blue ice (glacial)}}

[[Glacier]]s are large bodies of [[ice]] and [[snow]] formed in [[Ice age|cold climates]] by processes involving the compaction of fallen snow. While snowy glaciers appear white from a distance, up close and when shielded from direct ambient light, glaciers usually appear a deep blue due to the long path lengths of the internal reflected light.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Relatively small amounts of regular ice appear white because plenty of air bubbles are present, and also because small quantities of water appear to be colorless.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In glaciers, on the other hand, the pressure causes the air bubbles, trapped in the accumulated snow, to be squeezed out increasing the density of the created ice. Large quantities of water appear blue, therefore a large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, would also appear blue.

==Color of water samples==
[[File:Havasu Falls 2 md.jpg|thumb|right|High concentrations of dissolved [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] give the water of [[Havasu Falls]] a turquoise color.]]
Dissolved and particulate material in water can cause discoloration. Slight discoloration is measured in Hazen units (HU).&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization, ISO 2211:1973, ''Measurement of colour in Hazen units (platinum-cobalt scale) of Liquid Chemical Products''&lt;/ref&gt; Impurities can be deeply colored as well, for instance dissolved [[organic compound]]s called [[tannin-stained waters|tannin]]s can result in dark brown colors, or [[algae]] floating in the water (particles) can impart a green color.

The color of a water sample can be reported as:
* ''Apparent color'' is the color of the whole water sample, and consists of color from both [[Solution|dissolved]] and [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] components.
* ''True color'' is measured after filtering the water sample to remove all suspended material.

Testing for color can be a quick and easy test which often reflects the amount of organic material in the water, although certain inorganic components like iron or manganese can also impart color.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Water color can reveal physical, chemical and bacteriological conditions. In drinking water, green can indicate copper leaching from copper plumbing and can also represent algae growth. Blue can also indicate copper, or might be caused by syphoning of industrial cleaners in the tank of commodes, commonly known as backflowing. Reds can be signs of rust from iron pipes or airborne bacteria from lakes, etc. Black water can indicate growth of sulfur-reducing bacteria inside a hot water tank set to too low a temperature. This usually has a strong sulfur or rotten egg (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) odor and is easily corrected by draining the water heater and increasing the temperature to {{convert|49|C|F}} or higher.  The odor will always be in the hot water pipes if sulfate reducing bacteria are the cause and never in the cold water plumbing.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The color spectrum with water indicators{{clarify|date=July 2012}} is wide and, if learned, can make identifying and solving cosmetic, bacteriological and chemical problems easier.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Water quality and color==
[[File:Lake Pukaki and neighbours - STS088-721-15.jpg|thumb|left|Glacial [[rock flour]] makes New Zealand's [[Lake Pukaki]] a lighter turquoise than its neighbors.]]
The presence of color in water does not necessarily indicate that the water is not [[drinking water|drinkable]]. Color-causing substances such as [[tannin-stained waters|tannins]] may be harmless.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Color is not removed by typical [[water filter]]s; however, [[slow sand filter]]s can remove color, and the use of [[Coagulation (water treatment)|coagulants]] may also succeed in trapping the color-causing compounds within the resulting [[precipitate]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Other factors can affect the color seen:
*Particles and solutes can absorb light, as in tea or coffee. Green algae in rivers and streams often lend a blue-green color. The Red Sea has occasional blooms of red ''[[Trichodesmium|Trichodesmium erythraeum]]'' algae.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
*Particles in water can scatter light.  The Colorado River is often muddy red because of suspended reddish silt in the water. Some mountain lakes and streams with finely ground rock, such as [[rock flour|glacial flour]], are turquoise.  Light scattering by suspended matter is required in order that the blue light produced by water's absorption can return to the surface and be observed.  Such scattering can also shift the spectrum of the emerging photons toward the green, a color often seen when water laden with suspended particles is observed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Color names==
[[File:La-Jolla-Red-Tide.780.jpg|thumb|Red tide off the California coast]]
Various cultures divide the [[semantic field]] of colors differently from the English language usage and some do not [[blue-green across cultures|distinguish between blue and green]] in the same way. An example is Welsh where ''glas'' can mean blue or green.

Other color names assigned to bodies of water are [[sea green]] and [[ultramarine]] blue. Unusual oceanic colorings have given rise to the terms [[red tide]] and [[oil spill|black tide]].

The Ancient Greek poet [[Homer]] uses the [[epithet]] "wine-dark sea"; in addition, he also describes the sea as "grey". [[Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age|William Ewart Gladstone]] has suggested that this is due to the [[Ancient Greek]]s classifying colors primarily by luminosity rather than hue, while others believe Homer was color-blind.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}{{Portal|Water}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6930">'''Competitive altruism''' is a possible mechanism for the persistence of [[cooperation|cooperative behaviors]], specifically those that are performed unconditionally. The theory of [[reciprocal altruism]] can be used to explain behaviors that are performed by a donor who receives some sort of benefit in the future. When no such compensation is received, however, [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] fails to explain [[altruism|altruistic behavior]].

==Characteristics==

To explain competitive altruism, Roberts&lt;ref name="rob98"&gt;Roberts, G. 1998. Competitive altruism: from reciprocity to the handicap principle. Proc. R. Soc. Lond., B 265: 429-430.&lt;/ref&gt; uses the example of [[preening]] among birds. Because certain birds cannot reach [[parasite]]s on all parts of their bodies, particularly their necks, they benefit from preening one another. For any given bird, there is an entire [[Flock (birds)|flock]] of potential preeners, who compete in hopes of establishing a beneficial relationship. Cheaters, or those birds that try to be preened without preening others, do not compete and thus are excluded from these relationships. Their [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] is lowered because they are ostracized by members of the flock.

McNamara et al.&lt;ref name="McNamara08"&gt;McNamara, J., Z. Barta, L. Fromhage, and A. Houston. 2008. The coevolution of choosiness and cooperation. Nature 451: 189-192.&lt;/ref&gt; quantitatively analyzed this theory. Like [[Robert Axelrod]], they created a [[computer program]] to simulate repeated interactions among individuals. The program involved players with two genetically determined [[Trait (biology)|traits]], a ‘cooperative trait’ and a ‘choosiness trait.’ They found the following results:&lt;blockquote&gt;
‘Paradoxical’ trait combinations yield particularly low payoffs: individuals with low choosiness but high effort tend to get exploited by their co-players; individuals with high choosiness but low effort waste their time searching for better co-players, which are, however, unlikely to accept them. The positive correlation between choosiness and cooperativeness leads to a positive assortment between cooperative types – an essential feature of all mechanisms that promote cooperation.&lt;ref name="McNamara08" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The development of such cooperation requires variation in the degree of cooperation and choosiness, which the researchers attributed to [[mutation|genetic mutation]] and [[Genetic diversity|variation]]. McNamara et al. also determined that since a period of searching is required for ‘mutually acceptable’ players to find one another, competitive altruism is more likely to arise in animals with long life spans.&lt;ref name="McNamara08" /&gt;

==The prisoner's dilemma==
To relate this condition to the [[prisoner's dilemma]], an individual may benefit the most in a one-time interaction with another by defecting (i.e. receiving benefits without incurring any cost to itself). However, in an iterated prisoner's dilemma, where individuals interact more than once, if the act of defecting makes the individual less likely to attract a [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] mate in the future, then cooperative behavior will be selected for.&lt;ref name="rob98" /&gt;

This selection for cooperation is even stronger if an individual's action in an interaction is observed by third-party individuals, for the possibility of forming a [[reputation]] arises. [[Amotz Zahavi]], famous for his work with the altruistic [[Arabian babbler]], suggests that this level of "social prestige" will affect which individuals interact with one another and how they behave.&lt;ref&gt;Zahavi, A. 1995. Altruism as a handicap: the limitations of kin selection and reciprocity. J. Avian Biol. 26 (1): 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Competitive altruism has been demonstrated repeatedly in studies with humans. For instance, individuals are more generous when their behaviour is visible to others and altruistic individuals receive more social status and are selectively preferred as collaboration partners and group leaders...&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, C. &amp; Van Vugt, M. (2006). Nice guys finish first: The competitive altruism hypothesis. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 32,1402-1413&lt;/ref&gt; Adding insights from sexual selection theory research has also found that men behave more altruistically in the presence of an (attractive) female and altruistic males are selectively preferred as long-term sexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;Iredale, W., Van Vugt, M. &amp; Dunbar, R (2008). Showing off: Male generosity as mate signal. Evolutionary Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The handicap principle==
The theory of competitive altruism also helps one connect such behavior to the [[handicap principle]]. With competitive altruism, cooperation is considered a trait that provides a [[Signalling theory|signaling]] benefit, and thus is subject to [[sexual selection]]. Like a [[peacock|peacock's tail]], cooperation persists and is magnified, even though it carries a cost to the individual. Cooperation must be significantly costly to the individual, such that only a limited proportion of the population is fit enough to partake.&lt;ref&gt;Lotem, A., M. Fishman, and L. Stone. 2003. From reciprocity to unconditional altruism through signaling benefits. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 270: 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts&lt;ref name="rob98" /&gt; builds on the idea of altruism as a signaling benefit with his "free gift theory". Because the recipient gains some benefit from the interaction with the donor, there is an incentive to pay attention to the signal. For example, some male birds will offer food to a potential mate. Such behavior, called [[courtship feeding]], not only benefits the female, who receives a meal without expending any energy, but also conveys the ability of the male to forage. Consequently, the signal is kept true (i.e. it remains a correct reflection on the fitness of the mate).

However, the connection between competitive altruism and signaling is not without criticism. Wright&lt;ref&gt;Wright, J. 1999. Altruism as a signal - Zahavi's alternative to kin selection and reciprocity. Journal of Avian Biology 30: 109&lt;/ref&gt; raises the point that an altruistic signaling behavior like gift giving would cause a "flow of fitness from the higher quality individual to the lower quality one" and reduce the veracity of the signal. To account for this likely trend, Wright stipulates that the altruistic behavior must be directed at a mate or ally. In order for the theory to hold true, the signaling benefit would have to be shown to improve the individual's fitness beyond the benefit gained from the "investment" in the partner.

Conceptual combination is an important concept in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].

==Mechanism==

The mechanism by which conceptual combination occurs is debatable, both on cognitive and neurological levels. As such, multiple models have been developed or applied to better define how the process occurs.&lt;ref name ="lynott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Connell | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = The effect of prosody on conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1107–1123 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01119.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive===

Cognitive models attempt to functionally outline the mental computation involved in conceptual combination. 
  
====Constraint Theory====

Constraint theory stipulates that the concept that results from an attempt at conceptual combination is controlled by three constraints known as diagnosticity, plausibility and informativeness. ''Diagnosticity'' refers to the a complex concept's possession of the defining properties of its component simple concepts. Because such properties are diagnostic of the component concepts, at least some of them should be diagnostic of the higher-order representations constructed from those concepts. ''Plausibility'' refers to consistency with existing knowledge and prior experience. It is based on the assumption that a complex concept should be reasonably relevant to the context in which it is used. This assumption makes the most sense in a practical, linguistic context, particularly when a speaker is catering to the understanding of the listener. ''Informativeness'' is the property of having more meaning or properties than any individual component. If a complex concept were not distinguishable from any given component, it would be identical to that component. Because nothing can logically be both a component of something and the totality of something simultaneously, a complex concept must at least be the sum of its parts. Many argue that the interaction among component concepts should allow a complex concept to be greater than that sum.  If multiple possible ways to structure or interpret a complex concept exist, the one which best satisfies or most satisfies these constraints is the one which will be used. The paradigm upon which constraint theory is based is computational, and therefore views the mind as a processor which operates on the basis of standard problem-solving protocols (i.e. [[algorithms]] and [[heuristics]]).&lt;ref name = ck2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costello | first1 = F. J. | last2 = Keane | first2 = M. T. | year = 2000 | title = Efficient creativity: Constraint-guided conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 299–349 | doi = 10.1016/S0364-0213(00)00020-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spreading Activation====

The [[spreading activation]] model is a model in [[connectionism|connectionist]] theory sometimes designed to represent how concepts are activated in relation to one another. Though it is typically applied to information search processes like recognition, [[brainstorming]], and recall, it can be used to explain how concepts are combined as well as connected.&lt;ref name="bd1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balota | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Duchek | first2 = J. M. | year = 1988 | title = Age-related differences in lexical access, spreading activation, and simple pronunciation | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 84–93 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.3.1.84 | pmid = 3268246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spreading activation models represent memory and knowledge as a network of interlinked concepts. Every concept manifests as a node within this network, with related nodes/concepts linked to one another with connections. Concepts that are more strongly associated with one another either in terms of content or an individual's past experience are correspondingly more strongly linked.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;

When one concept is employed in [[working memory]], the corresponding node is also activated. This activation spreads through the node's links, making it easier to activate nodes to which the activated node is connected. This spreading activation stimulates the linked nodes, pressuring them to activate to an extent proportional to the strength of the connection between the stimulating node and the stimulated node. If sufficient net stimulation is accrued through a stimulated node's links, it will also activate. Thus, being connected to an activated node makes it easier for an inactive node to become active as well; concepts become more readily accessed when individuals are stimulated with related concepts first. This increase in ease of access is known as "priming.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;"

Spreading activation models tend to imply that processing concepts occurs in series; that is, each concept is processed one-at-a-time, one after the other. As such, individuals tend to combine concepts more readily, easily, and quickly if they are more closely linked within the network of concepts. This implication, however, has caused spreading activation to come under a great deal of criticism, particularly with respect to how the concept is employed in feature theories.

====Feature-Based Theories====

The features and properties of complex concepts are generally assumed to be derived from the simple concepts that compose them. One popularly discussed model involves a two-stage serial process. In the initial stage, features from each of the component simple concepts are retrieved from memory through spreading activation. This allows a complex concept to accrue features with existing relationships with its component simple concepts. During this stage, the basic definition of what the complex concept is and/or means is generates. In the second stage, knowledge and reasoning are employed upon the features accrued in the previous stage to generate further features.&lt;ref name="spring"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Springer | first1 = K. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. L. | year = 1992 | title = Feature availability in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 111–117 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1992.tb00008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might reason that the complex concept "white jacket," if worn in a blizzard, would make one difficult to see; it would follow that one should ascribe the property of "good for winter camouflage," despite the fact that this property is not closely attached to the component concepts "white" nor "jacket." This stage is especially useful when properties of complex concepts contradict those of their component concepts, such as the different colours of milk and chocolate milk.

This model, however, has come under criticism due to its inconsistency with empirical studies. If conceptual combination employed serial  spreading activation, for instance, it should take longer to verify the properties of complex concepts, as they necessarily possess more concepts than their component simple concepts. Research has nonetheless shown that it takes less time to confirm complex concepts' properties than their components and about equal time to reject false properties for both. This occurred even when the properties of the complex concept contradicted those of the simple concepts. Likewise, when experiment participants are exposed to a set of features first, and then asked to verify whether or not they correspond to simple or complex concepts, the participants tend to provide correct verification answers for the complex concepts more quickly.&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;

===Neurological===

The neurological basis of conceptual combination has received considerably less attention than its cognitive basis.&lt;ref name = "bo2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Osherson | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Evidence for conceptual combination in the left anterior temporal lobe | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1847–1852 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, research has revealed several specific brain regions that are intimately involved if not entirely responsible for neural processing involved in conceptual combination.&lt;ref name=bo2011 /&gt;

Of particular relevance is the left anterior [[temporal lobe]]. Studies have previously demonstrated an additive effect for stimulation in this subsection of neural cortex tissue. When experiment participants were verbally presented with certain simple concepts, the processing of the information causes electrical stimulation in the region. When the same participants were verbally presented with a single complex concept formed from the combination of the aforementioned simple concepts, the stimulation recorded was equivalent to the sum of the stimulation that resulted from each individual component simple concept. In other words, the stimulation caused by a complex concept is equivalent to the total stimulation caused by its component concepts. More recent data contradicts those results by indicating a multiplicative effect in which the activation caused by a complex concept is the product of the activation levels caused by its component concepts, rather than the sum.&lt;ref name = bo2011 /&gt;

Further support for the role of the left anterior temporal lobe has been previously established through neuropsychological studies. [[Semantic dementia]] is a disorder in which conceptual manipulation, including conceptual combination, is hindered. These indicate that the neural damage associated with semantic dementia occurs within this brain region. Unfortunately, neuropsychological studies that attempt to replicate this pattern have failed, leading uncertainty as to whether initial results were valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahon | first1 = B. Z. | last2 = Caramazza | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Concepts and categories: A cognitive neuropsychological perspective | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 27–51 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163532 | pmid=18767921 | pmc=2908258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

As [[language]] is the means by which concepts are communicated and expressed, the processed involved in linguistic expression and interpretation are heavily intertwined with combined concepts. Many theories of concept combination mechanisms, including constraint theory&lt;ref name=ck2000 /&gt; were developed within the context of language, and therefore make more sense when applied in a linguistic context. Study into the linguistic aspects of concept combination as has generally been focused on the interpretation mechanism.

===Lexical Concepts===

A concept that can be expressed using a single word is called a ''lexical concept.'' A lexical concept is usually treated as a basic concept, although it can just as easily be a complex concept.

Two lexical concepts are often used together as phrases to represent a combined concept of greater specificity. This is most readily seen in the use of [[adjective]]s to modify [[noun]]s and the use of [[adverb]]s to modify [[verb]]s and adjectives. Consider, for example, phrases such as "burnt toast," "eat roughly," and "readily loved." Multiple noun lexical concepts can also be used together in order to represent combined concepts.  Through this process, a limited pool of nouns can be used to produce an exponentially larger pool of phrases such as "sound wave," "video game," and "sleeping pill."&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, G. L. &amp; Myers, T. F. (1988). Concept combination and the characterization of lexical concepts. In W. Hüllen, &amp; R. Schulze (Eds.), (pp. 292-302) Niemeyer. {{DOI|10.1515/9783111355191.292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

In addition to constraint theory, there are two principal theories surrounding the mechanism by which noun-noun combinations are [[semantics|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Tagalakis | first2 = G. | last3 = Keane | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Conceptual Combination with PUNC | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence Review | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 353–374 | doi = 10.1007/s10462-004-5219-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these is ''dual-process theory.'' Dual-process theory proposed that there are two means by which people interpreted noun-noun phrases. ''Relational interpretation'' attempts to establish a relationship between the nouns and interprets the combined phrase in terms of that relationship. For example, one might relationally interpret the phrase "snake mouse" to refer to a mouse meant to be eaten by snakes, as the two concepts have a predatory relationship. ''Property interpretation'' identifies properties associated with the first noun and then applies them onto the second noun. In this case the phrase "snake mouse" might be interpreted as a mouse with poisonous fangs or an elongated body.&lt;ref name= wiz1998&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wisniewski | first1 = E. J. | year = 1998 | title = Property instantiation in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 1330–1347 | doi = 10.3758/BF03201205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second principal theory is known as the ''Competition in Relations among Nominals'' theory. It states that the assumed modification effect of a noun on its partner in a novel noun-noun combination is the one which it has been seen to employ most often in the past. For example, "chocolate cat" is usually interpreted as "a cat made of chocolate" rather than "a chocolate-eating cat" simply because the "made of" modifier is heavily conditioned to be associated with "chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;Gagne, C. L. (2002). The competition-among-relations-in-nominals theory of conceptual combination: Implications for stimulus class formation and class expansion. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 78 (3), 551-65. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/214835280&lt;/ref&gt;"

Explanations of linguistic expression of complex concepts have been linked to [[spreading activation]] models. When an individual identifies a lexical concept through vision or hearing, the corresponding node in that individual's cognitive network is said to activate. This makes it easier for lexical concepts linked to the activated concept to be comprehended, as they are primed. This is consistent with current empirical data, which shows that when individuals are interpreting sentences, they process the linguistic content more quickly when several related words follow one another. In turn, it becomes easier for people to combine these related concepts together and understand them as a relationship, rather than two distinct entities.&lt;ref name="ews2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elvevåg | first1 = B. | last2 = Wisniewski | first2 = E. | last3 = Storms | first3 = G. | year = 2010 | title = Conceptual combination and language in schizophrenia | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 120 | issue = 1–3| pages = 238–239 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2010.04.006 | pmid=20452747 | pmc=2900465}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the example, "John spread butter on a bagel." In this sentence, the lexical concepts "spread," "butter," and "bagel" are associated with one another and easy to combine into a mental representation of a breakfast scenario. Conversely, consider the example, "John baked a computer." Because "baked" and "computer" are not related lexical concepts, it takes more effort and time to build a mental representation of this unusual scenario.

However, spreading activation models of conceptual combination have been criticized in light of how humans have been observed to combined languages. Those who claim that the theory provides an insufficient account of linguistic conceptual combination refer to the ability of humans to readily understand lexical concept combinations with seemingly no apparent connection with one another. One example of this would be the sentence "John saw an elephant cloud." "Elephant" and "cloud" do not shared a close association, but it takes little effort to comprehend that the term "elephant cloud" refers to a cloud shaped like an elephant. This has led some to conclude that the combination of lexical concepts does not wholly rely on the simultaneous activation of linked lexical concepts alone. Rather, they claim that the process involves the use of existing nodes to generate entirely new concepts independent of their parent concepts.&lt;ref name="ews2010"/&gt;

====Social Context====

Although many theories of  novel noun-noun combination interpretation ignore the effect of social environment, some theorists have attempted to account for any contingencies social context may cause.

When lexical concept combinations are interpreted without the influence of social context, the interpretation carried out is termed ''sense generation.'' This includes all processes that would normally occur excepting those dependent on a conversation partner. The ''generation hypothesis'' accordingly states that the interpretation mechanism of a noun-noun combination is essentially the same regardless of context. This does not rule out the possibility that social context can affect sense generation in some way, but it does assert that the basic structure of the process is unaffected. As seen above, debate as to what sense generation entails and how many sub-processes into which it should be divided is a contentious matter in cognitive science.&lt;ref name="vlw"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Middleton | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Rawson | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Wisniewski | first3 = E. J. | year = 2011 | title = How do we process novel conceptual combinations in context? | url = | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 807–822 | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2010.520414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[anaphor]] resolution hypothesis'' instead asserts that before sense generation occurs, interpreters first search their memory of recent communication to see if the combination refers to something previously discussed. This process is termed ''anaphor resolution'.' If a referent is identified, interpretation occurs without sense generation in light of that referent. Even if an explicit referent does not exist, anaphor resolution can help facilitate sense generation by providing more information that might hint at the combination's intended meaning.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

The ''dual-process hypothesis'' not to be confused with dual-process theory, states that sense generation and anaphor resolution occur in parallel. Both processes begin to work once the noun-noun combination is presented. Proponents of this hypothesis disagree as to how the interpretation is eventually resolves. Some believe that whichever process reaches a conclusion first provides the answer. Others believe that both provide continuous input to a third, mediating process that eventually makes a decision based on input from both.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

==Creativity==

[[Creativity]] necessitates the employment of existing concepts in novel ways, and therefore requires conceptual combination. Surprisingly, this contribution seems to be limited. Conceptual combination is a significant contributor to [[convergent thinking]], but not [[divergent thinking]]. For example, practice with generating new concepts through combination does not improve brainstorming. It does, however, assist in devising creative problem solving methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohn | first1 = N. W. | last2 = Paulus | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Korde | first3 = R. M. | year = 2011 | title = Conceptual combinations and subsequent creativity | url = | journal = Creativity Research Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1080/10400419.2011.595659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational applications==

The psychological community's growing understanding of how concepts are manipulated has allowed educators to teach new concepts more effectively. Tools that are developed based on conceptual combination theory attempt to teach individual tasks, and then challenge students to exercise them together in order to promote both base subject skills and the critical thinking needed to apply them simultaneously to [[problem solving|solve new problems]]. Máder &amp; Vajda, for instance, developed a three-dimensional grid with cells of adjustable height which has been successfully used in numerous activities capable of improving the effectiveness of high school [[mathematics education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Máder | first1 = A. | last2 = Vajda | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Elementary approaches to the teaching of the combinatorial problem of rectangular islands | url = | journal = International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 267–281 | doi = 10.1007/s10758-010-9171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">The '''Dana/Spicer Model S110''' is an automotive axle manufactured by the [[Dana Holding Corporation]] and the [[Eaton Corporation]].  Eaton manufactures the carrier and Dana manufactures the rest of the axle.   The S110 model follows a newer nomenclature for Dana axles.   The "S" meaning: single rear axle.  The first "1" representing gear reduction type, the second representing the head assembly series and the last "0" representing the design level.

The Dana S110 is used in [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class 4]] and [[Truck classification#Class 5|Class 5]] applications.  [[Dodge]], [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]] use this axle as well as various other companies.  The Dana S110 is a [[axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|full floating]], drop-out axle.  Dana S110 axles are a step up in overall strength compared to the [[Dana 80]].  Ford started using this axle in 2005 model F-450 and F-550 trucks.  Replacing the Dana 80 in some class 4 trucks, and the [[Dana S 135]] in the rest of the trucks.  Dodge started using the Dana S110 in their 2008 model 4500 and 5500 trucks.   Although this axle is designed for medium-duty, commercial-trucks, Ford did put the S110 in 2008-2010 &amp; 2015-2016 F-450 Pick up trucks.  The Dana S110 has a [[Gross axle weight rating|GAWR]] up to 14,706 lbs  
but is frequently, de-rated by vehicle manufacturer for safety and tire reasons.  This axle is not used in 1 Ton trucks ([[Truck classification#Class 3|Class 3]]).

'''Dancing bans''' are legal or religious prohibitions against dancing, which have been applied at various times in various jurisdictions around the world. Even more controversial than recreational or artistic dancing have been sexually suggestive forms such as [[lap dancing]], [[topless dancing]], and [[rave]] dancing.

''Tanzverbot'' is the German term for "dancing ban". In Germany and Switzerland, dancing on some holidays is banned by most [[German states|state]] or [[Swiss cantons|canton]] governments. These occasions are certain [[Christianity|Christian]] and secular holidays aimed at mourning or contemplation, such as [[Good Friday]], [[All Saints' Day]] (from its association with [[All Souls' Day]] practices) or memorial days like [[Volkstrauertag]]. The German and Swiss dancing bans prohibit public parties, but not dancing in one's private residence.

Until 1999, an ordinance in [[Pound, Virginia]] required that dance hall permits not be granted "to anyone who is not a proper person, nor to a person who is not a person of good moral character". After community opposition to granting him a permit, a lawsuit by William Elam, owner of the Golden Pine restaurant, resulted in the ordinance being struck down as unconstitutionally vague and infringing on free expression protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. A replacement ordinance drafted more narrowly prompted a 2001 lawsuit from Elam, though the restaurant later went out of business after revocation of its alcohol license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/identity/dance_pound.htm|title=Pound, Virginia Bans Dancing?|accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/z/gpine.htm|title=Part 2: ABC revokes Golden Pine restaurant's license to sell alcohol|accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1926, the [[New York City Cabaret Law]] has prohibited dancing in all spaces open to the public that sell food and/or drink with the exception of those who obtain a cabaret license. This law was still enforced until it was repealed in 2017. 

Between 1985 and 2002, a [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] law called the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]] enacted strict legal requirements for those wishing to have dancing by youth under the age of 21, effectively banning events that would feature young people dancing.

===Historic bans===
From the 1830s to 1950s, [[play party (U.S. traditional)|play parties]] became popular as a means to circumvent restrictions on dancing.

The events of the [[Footloose (1984 film)|1984 film ''Footloose'']] were inspired by a dancing ban in the heavily [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] town of [[Elmore City, Oklahoma]], which lasted until 1980.
==Religious bans==
===Christianity===
Various Christian groups believe that dancing is either inherently sinful or that certain forms of dancing could lead to sinful thoughts or activities, and thus proscribe it either in general or during religious services. These include some adherents of [[Mennonite]], [[Hutterite]], [[Baptist]], [[Seventh-day Adventist]], and [[Holiness movement]] sects. [[Jehovah's Witness]]es disfavor events where there might be sexually suggestive dancing or excessive drinking of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defendingjehovahswitnesses.blogspot.com/2012/01/how-do-jehovahs-witnesses-view-dancing.html|title=How Do Jehovah's Witnesses View Dancing?|accessdate=2012-11-17|date=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Church of the Nazarene]] recommends against "All forms of dancing that detract from spiritual growth and break down proper moral inhibitions and reserve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf|title=Manual|page=51|year=2005–2009|author=Church of the Nazarene|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302214359/http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian churches determine doctrine locally and may be non-denominational, and these vary on their stances on social dancing.

In contrast, some strains of [[Charismatic Christianity]] practice rituals in which the [[Holy Spirit]] is believed to cause spontaneous dancing, among other behaviors. [[Mormonism]] has embraced social dancing to some degree since its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5654 |contribution= Dance |pages= 354-355 |last= Jacobson |first= Phyllis C. |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H |editor-link= Daniel H. Ludlow |year= 1992 |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |location= New York |publisher= [[Macmillan Publishing]] |isbn= 0-02-879602-0 |oclc= 24502140 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Islam===
In Islam, [[Salafists]] and [[Wahhabis]] consider dancing in general to be ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-08-31/news/33500441_1_music-and-dance-couples-dances-anti-dance|date=2012-08-31|title=Does Islam ban dancing and music?|agency=Slate|author=Brian Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Islamic and [[Orthodox Jewish]] traditions prohibit contact between men and women in public (especially those not married to each other), and thus in these societies men and women either dance separately or not at all.

In contrast, [[Sufism]] encourages dancing, for example [[Sufi whirling]] and dancing to celebrate [[Mela Chiraghan]]. This has resulted in conflict in areas influenced by the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/07/pakistani-festival-dancer_n_183960.html|accessdate=2012-11-17|date=2009-05-08|title=Pakistani Festival Dancers Banned By Religious Group|author=Stuart Whatley|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DataViva''' is an [[information visualization]] engine created by the Strategic Priorities Office of the government of [[Minas Gerais]]. DataViva makes official data about exports, industries, locations and occupations available for the entirety of [[Brazil]] through eight apps and more than 100&amp;nbsp;million possible visualizations.

The first set of datum – also available at [[ALICEWEB]] – is provided by MDIC (Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade) / SECEX (Secretariat of Foreign Trade), an official institution of the [[Government of Brazil]] and shows [[foreign trade]] statistics for all exporting municipalities in the country. The other database, provided by [[Ministério do Trabalho e Emprego]] (MTE – [[Ministry of Labor and Employment (Brazil)|Ministry of Labor and Employment]]), shows information about all of the industries and occupations in [[Brazil]] (RAIS – Annual Social Information Report).

The platform consists of eight core applications, each of which allows different ways of visualizing the data available. Some applications are descriptive, that is, showing data aggregated at various levels in a simple and comparative way, such as [[Treemapping]]. Others are prescriptive, using calculations that allow an analytic visualization of the data, based on theories such as [[the Product Space]]. All of the applications are generated using [[D3plus]], an open source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=d3plus source|url=https://github.com/alexandersimoes/d3plus/|accessdate=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[JavaScript]] library built on top of [[D3.js]] by [[Alexander Simoes]] and [[Dave Landry]].

Inspired by [[The Observatory of Economic Complexity]], DataViva is an [[open data]],&lt;ref name="dataviva"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dataviva.info/about/terms_of_use |title=DataViva : Terms of Use |publisher=dataviva.info |accessdate=July 7, 2014 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[open-source software|open-source]],&lt;ref name="githubusercontent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexandersimoes/dataviva/master/LICENSE|title=LICENSE|publisher=raw.githubusercontent.com|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and free to use tool.

It was developed in a partnership with [[MIT Media Lab]] Professor César Hidalgo and is maintained by the Government of [[Minas Gerais]].

'''Deception technology''' is an emerging category of [[cyber security]] defense.  Deception technology products can detect, analyze, and defend against [[zero-day attack|zero-day]] and advanced attacks, often in real time.  They are automated, accurate,&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Pingree quotes in article: {{cite web|url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3113055/security/deception-technology-grows-and-evolves.html|title=Deception technology grows and evolves|work=CSO Online|author=Maria Korolov|date=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provide insight into malicious activity within [[internal network]]s which may be unseen by other types of cyber defense. Deception technology enables a more proactive security posture by seeking to deceive the attackers, detect them and then defeat them, allowing the enterprise to return to normal operations.

Existing [[Defense in depth (computing)|defense-in-depth]] cyber technologies have struggled against the increasing wave of sophisticated and persistent human attackers.  These technologies seek primarily to defend a perimeter, but both [[firewall (computing)|firewalls]] and [[Endpoint security|end-point security]] cannot defend a perimeter with 100% certainty. [[Cyber-attack]]ers can penetrate these networks and move unimpeded for months, stealing data and [[intellectual property]]. [[Heuristics]] may find an attacker within the network, but often generate so many alerts that critical alerts are missed. Since 2014 attacks have accelerated and there is evidence that cyber-attackers are penetrating traditional defenses at a rapidly increasing rate.

Deception technology considers the human attacker's point of view and methodology for exploiting and navigating networks to identify and [[Data theft|exfiltrate]] data. It integrates with existing technologies to provide new visibility into the internal networks, share high probability alerts and threat intelligence with the existing infrastructure.

==Technology: high level view==

Deception technology automates the creation of traps (decoys) and/or lures which are mixed among and within existing [[IT]] resources to provide a layer of protection to stop attackers that have penetrated the [[Computer network|network]]. Traps (decoys) are IT [[Asset (computer security)|assets]] that either use real licensed [[operating system]] software, or are emulations of these devices.

Traps (decoys) which use emulations can also imitate [[medical device]]s, [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/paymentweek/docs/pq2016_2020_final2|title=Payments Week Issue - go to page 42|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; retail point of sale systems, switches, routers and much more. Lures are generally real information technology resources (files of varying kinds) which are placed on actual IT assets.

Upon penetrating the network, attackers seek to establish a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] and then use this to identify and exfiltrate data and intellectual property. They begin moving laterally through the internal [[VLAN]]s and almost immediately will "look at" one of the traps (decoys). Interacting with one of these "decoys" will trigger an alert.  These alerts are very high probability and almost always coincide to an ongoing attack.  The deception is designed to lure the attacker in – the attacker may consider this a worthy asset and continue by injecting [[malware]].  Deception technology generally allows for automated static and dynamic analysis of this injected malware and provides these reports through automation to the security operations personnel.  Deception technology may also identify, through indicators of compromise (IOC), suspect end-points that are part of the compromise cycle.  Automation also allows for an automated memory analysis of the suspect end-point, and then automatically isolating the suspect end-point.  Many partner integrations allow for a variety of implementation paths for existing enterprise and government customers.

==Specialized applications==

[[Internet of things|Internet of things (IoT)]] devices are not usually scanned by legacy defense in depth cyber defense and remain prime targets for attackers within the network.  Deception technology can identify attackers moving laterally into the network from within these devices.

Integrated [[turnkey]] devices that utilize [[embedded operating system]]s, but do not allow these operating systems to be scanned or closely protected by embedded end-point or intrusion detection software are also well protected by a deception technology deployment in the same network. Examples include [[SCADA|process control systems (SCADA)]] used in many manufacturing applications on a global basis. Deception technology has been associated with the discovery of [[Zombie Zero]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtmarko/2014/07/10/trojan-hardware-spreads-apts/|title=How a Scanner Infected Corporate Systems and Stole Data: Beware Trojan Peripherals|first=Kurt|last=Marko|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[attack vector]] wherein deception technology identified an attacker utilizing malware embedded in [[barcode reader]]s which were manufactured overseas.

[[Medical device]]s are particular vulnerable to cyber attacks within the healthcare networks.  As [[FDA]]-certified devices they are closed systems and not accessible to standard cyber defense software. Deception technology can surround and protect these devices and identify attackers using these for backdoor placement and data exfiltration. Recent documented cyber attacks on medical devices include [[x-ray machine]]s, [[CT scan]]ners, [[MRI]] scanners, [[blood gas]] analyzers, [[Picture Archiving and Communication System|PACS]] systems and many more. Networks utilizing these devices can be protected by deception technology. This attack vector, called [[MEDJACK|medical device hijack or medjack]], is estimated to have penetrated many hospitals worldwide.{{failed verification|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surgicalproductsmag.com/article/2016/07/dangerous-state-medical-cybersecurity|title=The Dangerous State of Medical Cybersecurity|date=13 July 2016|publisher=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized deception technology products are now capable of addressing the rise in [[ransomware]]. Select products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/trapx-launches-ransomware-deception-tool-cryptotrap|title=TrapX launches ransomware deception tool, CryptoTrap|date=25 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; can deceive ransomware into engaging in an attack on a decoy resource, while isolating the infection points and alerting the cyber defense software team.

==History==

[[Honeypot (computing)|Honeypots]] were perhaps the first very simple form of deception.  A honeypot appeared simply as an unprotected information technology resource and presented itself in an attractive way to a prospective attacker already within the network.  The notion of honeypots deceiving attackers, perhaps delaying and identifying them, and then ultimately supporting efforts to shut down the attack was a good one.  Potential benefits aside, most early honeypots exhibit challenges with functionality, integrity and overall efficacy in meeting these goals. Key was the lack of automation that enabled broad scale of deployment. A deployment strategy would seek to cover the enterprise where up to tens of thousands of VLANS must be protected won't be economically efficient using manual processes and manual configuration.

The gap between legacy honeypots and modern deception technology has diminished over time and will continue to do so. Modern honeypots constitute the low end of the deception technology space today.

==Differentiation from competitive/cooperative technologies==
{{see also|Alarm fatigue}}
Traditional cyber defense technologies, such as firewalls and end-point security, generate many alerts. In a large enterprise the alert volume may reach, in some cases, millions of alerts per day. Security operations personnel cannot process most of the activity easily, yet it only takes one successful penetration to compromise an entire network.

Deception technology produces alerts that are the end product of a [[Binary number|binary]] process. Probability is essentially reduced to two values:  0% and 100%.  Any party that seeks to identify, [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]], enter, view any trap (decoy) or utilizes a lure is immediately identified by this behavior. Anyone touching these traps or lures should not be doing so.  This is an advantage over heuristics and probability-based approaches and the many thousands of extraneous alerts these techniques generate.

Best practice shows that deception technology is not a stand-alone strategy.  Deception technology is an additional compatible layer to the existing defense-in-depth cyber defense.  Partner integrations make it most useful and the goal is to add protection for the most advanced and sophisticated human attackers that will successfully penetrate the perimeter.

==Market size and adoption==
The technical innovation of deception technology been received by the market.  An [[industry analyst]] identified ten top technologies for information security in 2016, one of which were deception technology. 

An industry analyst predicted in August 2016 that the deception technology market is currently (in 2016) approximately $50 to $100 million globally, and further predicted $100 million to $200 million in revenue by 2018.  This same analyst earlier noted that, "by 2018 ... 10 percent of enterprises will use deception tools and tactics, and actively participate in deception operations against attackers". [[Gartner]] also noted deception technology as a "far underutilized technology that can provide serious advantages over attackers (cyber attackers)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.gartner.com/lawrence-pingree/2016/09/28/deception-related-technology-its-not-just-a-nice-to-have-its-a-new-strategy-of-defense/|title=Deception related technology - its not just a "nice to have", it's a new strategy of defense - Lawrence Pingree|date=28 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other important analysts have recently predicted a market size exceeding $1 billion by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/3113444/security/deception-technology-grows-and-evolves.html|title=Deception technology grows and evolves|first=Maria|last=Korolov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption is being fueled, in part, by continued, highly visible targeted attacks on large enterprise and government institutions globally.

Market Research Media estimates the cumulative deception technology market value at $12 billion (2017–2022), growing at about 19% CAGR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marketanalysis.com/?p=398|title=Deception Cybersecurity Market Forecast 2017-2022|date=9 February 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These dispersal units can range from pollen to seeds to fungi to entire organisms. 

There are two types of dispersal vector, those that are active and those that are passive. Active dispersal involves organisms that are capable of movement under their own energy. In passive dispersal, the organisms have evolved dispersal units, or propagules, that use the kinetic energy of the environment for movement. In plants, some dispersal units have tissue that assists with dispersal and are called "[[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]]". Some dispersal is self-driven (autochory), such as using gravity (barochory), and does not rely on external vectors. Other types of dispersal are due to external vectors, which can be [[wiktionary:biotic|biotic]] vectors, such as animals (zoochory), or [[Abiotic component|abiotic vectors]], such as the wind (anemochory) or water (hydrochory).&lt;ref name="Schurr2" /&gt;

In many cases, organisms will be dispersed by more than one vector before reaching it's final destination. It is often a combination of two or more modes of dispersal that act together to maximize dispersal distance, such as wind blowing a seed into a nearby river, that will carry it farther down stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merritt|first=David M.|last2=Wohl|first2=Ellen E.|date=August 2002|title=PROCESSES GOVERNING HYDROCHORY ALONG RIVERS: HYDRAULICS, HYDROLOGY, AND DISPERSAL PHENOLOGY|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=1071–1087|doi=10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1071:pgharh]2.0.co;2|issn=1051-0761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self Generated Dispersal (Autochory) ==

''Main article:'' [[Seed dispersal]] 

Autochory is the dispersal of [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]], which are dispersal units consisting of seeds or spores, using only the energy provided by the diaspore or the parent plant&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;. The plant of origin is the dispersal vector itself, instead of an external vector&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://definedterm.com/a/definition/183431|title=DefinedTerm: Autochory|work=Defined Term|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are four main types of autochory that act on [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]]: ballochory, or violent ejection by the parent organism; blastochory, where a diaspore crawls along the ground using [[Stolon|stolons]]; barochory, the use of [[gravity]] for dispersal; and herpochory, crawling using hygroscopic hairs called [[Trichome|trichomes]] &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vegetation Ecology|last=|first=|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Van der Maarel|editor-first=Eddy|edition=2|location=UK|pages=168, 171, 173|editor-last2=Franklin|editor-first2=Janet}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In some cases, ballochory can be more effective when utilizing a [[Diplochory|secondary dispersal vector]]&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;: ejecting the seeds in order for them to use wind or water for longer distance dispersal.   

== Animals (Zoochory) ==
Animal-mediated dispersal is called zoochory&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Zoochory can be further described by which animal is acting as a dispersal vector. Animals are an important dispersal vector because they provide the ability to transfer dispersal units longer distances than their parent organism can. The main groups include dispersal by [[Bird|birds]] (Ornithochory), dispersal by [[Ant|ants]] ([[Myrmecochory|Myrmekochory]]), dispersal by [[Mammal|mammals]] (Mammaliochory), dispersal by [[Amphibian|amphibians]] or [[Reptile|reptiles]], and dispersal by [[Insect|insects]], such as [[Bee|bees]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.   

Animals are also a large contributor to [[pollination]] via [[Zoophily]]. Flowering plants overwhelmingly are pollinated by animals, and while [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]] are involved in the majority of that pollination, birds and mammals also play a role&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150514-extraordinary-pollinators|title=Animals you might not know pollinate flowers|last=Douglass|first=Michelle|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

=== Ornithochory ===
[[File:Owl_Pellet_-_Flickr_-_gailhampshire.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Owl_Pellet_-_Flickr_-_gailhampshire.jpg|alt=|thumb|Barn owl pellets containing pouched mouse remains have been found to contain germinating seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=W. R. J.|last2=Milton|first2=Suzanne J.|date=1988|title=Dispersal of seeds by raptors|journal=African Journal of Ecology|language=en|volume=26|issue=2|pages=173–176|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2028.1988.tb00967.x|issn=0141-6707}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Bird|Birds]] contribute to [[seed dispersal]] in several ways that are unique from general vectors. Birds often cache, or store, the seeds of trees and shrubs for later consumption; only some of these seeds are later recovered and eaten, so many of the seeds are able to utilize the behavior of seed caching to allow them to [[Germination|germinate]] away from the mother tree &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

Long-distance dispersal, which is rare for a parent plant to achieve alone, could be mediated by migratory movements of birds. Long-distance dispersal operates over spatial areas that span thousands of kilometers, which allow it to promote rapid range shifts and determine species distributions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(16)30113-6|title=Migratory Birds as Global Dispersal Vectors|last=Viana|first=Duarte S.|date=July 5, 2016|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=31|issue=10|pages=763–775|archive-url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(16)30113-6|archive-date=April 19, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2016.07.005|pmid=27507683|hdl=10261/138397}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In [[seed dispersal]], [[ingestion]] of seeds that are capable of resisting digestive juices allows the [[Seed|seeds]] to be scattered in [[feces]] and dispersed far from the parent organism&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. For these seeds, gut passage enhances [[germination]] ability when the seeds are ingested by [[Bird|birds]] and [[Mammal|mammals]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Finally, ingestion of [[Herbivore|herbivores]] by [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] animals may help disperse seeds by preying on primary seed dispersers such as herbivores or [[Omnivore|omnivores]] &lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;. When a bird is eaten by a cat or another carnivore, that animal will inadvertently consume the seeds that the prey species consumed. These seeds may then be later deposited in a process called [[diplochory]], where a seed is moved by more than one dispersal vector, which is important for seed dispersal outcomes as carnivores range widely and enhance the genetic connectivity of dispersed populations&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hämäläinen|first=Anni|last2=Broadley|first2=Kate|last3=Droghini|first3=Amanda|last4=Haines|first4=Jessica A.|last5=Lamb|first5=Clayton T.|last6=Boutin|first6=Stan|last7=Gilbert|first7=Sophie|date=2017-02|title=The ecological significance of secondary seed dispersal by carnivores|journal=Ecosphere|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e01685|doi=10.1002/ecs2.1685|issn=2150-8925}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Birds act as dispersal vectors for non-seed dispersal units as well.

=== [[Myrmecochory]] ===
''Main article:'' [[Myrmecochory]]

This includes all of the dispersal caused by [[Ant|ants]], including seed dispersal and the dispersal of leaf matter from trees.  

=== Mammaliochory ===
Similarly to birds, dispersal by [[Mammal|mammals]] allows for long distance dispersal, especially via carnivores. The act of carnivores eating primary dispersal vectors (herbivores) can lead to long distance dispersal and connection between different populations of the same species because of large predator ranges in comparison to smaller herbivore ranges&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Mammals have been shown to act as dispersal vectors for seeds, spores, and [[Parasitism|parasites]].

Just as in ornithocory, ingestion by herbivores acts as a dispersal vector for seeds, and gut passage increases the rate of [[germination]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anne Bråthen|first=Kari|last2=T.

Non-flying mammals have been identified as acting as pollinators in Australia, Africa, South and Central America. Some plants may have traits that coevolved to utilize mammals as dispersal vectors, such as being extremely pungent in odor, nocturnal nectar production, and robust flowers that can handle rough feeders &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;.

Mammals contribute to [[bryophyte]] and [[fern]] spore dispersal by carrying [[Spore|spores]] on their fur. Small mammals acting as dispersal vectors may have advantages for the dispersing organism compared to wind transport, as the mammals share similar [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] to the parent plant, while wind transport is random. Additionally, mammals can transport spores that have qualities such as low production and non-wind adapted morphology that wouldn't be conducive for wind transport&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;.

Once consumed, the eggs are spread to a new area via the defecation of small mounds of dung&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;. 

=== Dispersal by Amphibians or Reptiles ===
[[Frog|Frogs]] and [[Lizard|lizards]] have been found to be dispersal vectors for [[Crustacean|crustaceans]] and [[ring worms]], specifically [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliad]] [[Ostracod|ostracods]] (''Elpidium bromeliarum)'' and [[Annelid|annelids]] (''Dero superterrenus''). Annelids showed a strong chemical orientation towards moist frog skin that may have developed to diminish risk of dehydration during transport in the environment. The ostracods have frequently been found to be attached to frogs in order to colonize new areas&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;. Both ostracods and annelids will attach themselves to lizards as well, but they prefer to attach themselves to frogs.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopez|first=Luiz Carlos Serramo|last2=Filizola|first2=Bruno|last3=Deiss|first3=Isabela|last4=Rios|first4=Ricardo Iglesias|date=2005|title=Phoretic Behaviour of Bromeliad Annelids (Dero) and Ostracods (Elpidium) using Frogs and Lizards as Dispersal Vectors|journal=Hydrobiologia|language=en|volume=549|issue=1|pages=15–22|doi=10.1007/s10750-005-1701-4|issn=0018-8158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dispersal by Invertebrates ===
''Main article:'' [[Pollination]] and [[Pollinator|Pollinators]]

One of the most important examples of dispersal via [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]] are pollinators such as bees, flies, wasps, beetles, and butterflies&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

Invertebrates may also act as dispersal vectors for the spores of ferns and bryophytes via [[endozoochory]], or the ingestion of the plant&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;.

== Wind (Anemochory) ==
Anemochory is dispersal of units by wind. Wind is a major vector of long distance dispersal that is responsible for the spread and propagation of species to new habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soons|first=Merel B.|last2=Bullock|first2=James M.|date=2008|title=Non-random seed abscission, long-distance wind dispersal and plant migration rates|journal=Journal of Ecology|language=en|volume=96|issue=4|pages=581–590|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01370.x|issn=0022-0477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each species has its own "wind dispersal potential", which is the proportion of dispersal units that travel farther than a predefined reference distance travelled under normal [[weather]] conditions.&lt;ref name=":152"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tackenberg|first=Oliver|last2=Poschlod|first2=Peter|last3=Bonn|first3=Susanne|date=2003|title=ASSESSMENT OF WIND DISPERSAL POTENTIAL IN PLANT SPECIES|journal=Ecological Monographs|language=en|volume=73|issue=2|pages=191–205|doi=10.1890/0012-9615(2003)073[0191:aowdpi]2.0.co;2|issn=0012-9615}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of wind dispersal relies predominantly on the morphological traits and adaptations of the dispersal units and wind conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okubo|first=Akira|last2=Levin|first2=Simon A.|date=1989|title=A Theoretical Framework for Data Analysis of Wind Dispersal of Seeds and Pollen|journal=Ecology|volume=70|issue=2|pages=329–338|doi=10.2307/1937537|jstor=1937537}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main traits of plants that predict their wind dispersal potential are falling [[velocity]] and initial release height of the dispersal unit. Higher falling velocity is generally correlated with heavier seeds, which have a lower wind dispersal potential because it takes a stronger wind to carry them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okubo|first=Akira|last2=Levin|first2=Simon A.|date=1989|title=A Theoretical Framework for Data Analysis of Wind Dispersal of Seeds and Pollen|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1937537|journal=Ecology|volume=70|issue=2|pages=329–338|doi=10.2307/1937537}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taller the initial release height of the dispersal unit, the larger the wind dispersal potential because there is a larger window in which it can be picked up by the wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soons|first=Merel B.|last2=Nathan|first2=Ran|last3=Katul|first3=Gabriel G.|date=2004|title=HUMAN EFFECTS ON LONG-DISTANCE WIND DISPERSAL AND COLONIZATION BY GRASSLAND PLANTS|url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/03-0398|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=85|issue=11|pages=3069–3079|doi=10.1890/03-0398|issn=0012-9658|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adaptive Morphology ===
Many species have evolved morphological adaptations to maximize wind dispersal potential. Common examples include plumed, winged, and balloon-like [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores.]]&lt;ref name=":152" /&gt;
[[File:Waiting_For_The_Wind_(222218757).jpeg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Waiting%20For%20The%20Wind%20(222218757).jpeg|thumb|Plumed diaspores of the dandelion, ''Taraxacum officinale.'']]
Plumed diaspores have thin hair-like projections that allow easier wind uplift.&lt;ref name=":152" /&gt; One of the most common plumed species is the dandelion, ''Taraxacum officinale''. The wind dispersal potential of plumed species are directly correlated to the total mass and total surface area of the projected plume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casseau|first=Vincent|last2=De Croon|first2=Guido|last3=Izzo|first3=Dario|last4=Pandolfi|first4=Camilla|date=2015-05-04|title=Morphologic and Aerodynamic Considerations Regarding the Plumed Seeds of Tragopogon pratensis and Their Implications for Seed Dispersal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418730/|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=5|pages=e0125040|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0125040|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4418730|pmid=25938765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winged diaspores have fibrous tissue that develops on the wall of the seed and projects outward&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; . Seed wings are generally thought to co-evolve with the evolution of larger seeds, in order to increase dispersal and offset the weight of the larger seeds.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Telenius|first=Anders|last2=Torstensson|first2=Peter|date=1991|title=Seed Wings in Relation to Seed Size in the Genus Spergularia|journal=Oikos|volume=61|issue=2|pages=216–222|doi=10.2307/3545339|jstor=3545339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common examples include [[pine]] and [[Spruce|spruce trees]].

Balloon-like seeds are a phenomenon where the [[calyx]], a kind of protective pouch or covering the plant uses to guard the seeds, is light and swollen.&lt;ref name=":152" /&gt; This ballon-like structure allows the entire pouch of seeds to be dispersed by gusts of wind.&lt;ref name=":152" /&gt; A common example of the balloon-like diaspore is the ''Trifolium fragiferum,'' or strawberry clover.

=== Human Effects on Anemochory ===
Wind dispersal of a particular species can also be affected by human actions.&lt;ref name=":162"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soons|first=Merel B.|last2=Nathan|first2=Ran|last3=Katul|first3=Gabriel G.|date=2004|title=HUMAN EFFECTS ON LONG-DISTANCE WIND DISPERSAL AND COLONIZATION BY GRASSLAND PLANTS|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=85|issue=11|pages=3069–3079|doi=10.1890/03-0398|issn=0012-9658}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans can affect anemochory in three major ways: habitat fragmentation, chemical runoff, and climate change.&lt;ref name=":162" /&gt; 

Clearing land for development and building roads through forests can lead to [[habitat fragmentation]]. [[Habitat fragmentation]] reduces the number and size of the effected populations, which reduces the amount of seeds that are dispersed.&lt;ref name=":162" /&gt;This lowers the probability that dispersed seeds with germinate and take root.&lt;ref name=":162" /&gt;

Chemical runoff from fertilizer, leakages of sewage, and carbon emissions from [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] can also lead to [[eutrophication]], a build up of nutrients that often leads to excess algae and non-native plant growth.&lt;ref name=":162" /&gt; Eutrophication can lead to decreased long distance dispersal because the lack of nutrients to native plants causes a decrease in seed release height.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soons|first=Merel B.|last2=Nathan|first2=Ran|last3=Katul|first3=Gabriel G.|date=2004|title=HUMAN EFFECTS ON LONG-DISTANCE WIND DISPERSAL AND COLONIZATION BY GRASSLAND PLANTS|url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/03-0398|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=85|issue=11|pages=3069–3079|doi=10.1890/03-0398|issn=0012-9658|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the lowered release height, eutrophication can sometimes lead to an increase in short distance dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soons|first=Merel B.|last2=Nathan|first2=Ran|last3=Katul|first3=Gabriel G.|date=2004|title=HUMAN EFFECTS ON LONG-DISTANCE WIND DISPERSAL AND COLONIZATION BY GRASSLAND PLANTS|url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/03-0398|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=85|issue=11|pages=3069–3079|doi=10.1890/03-0398|issn=0012-9658|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change effects on wind patterns have the potential increase average wind velocity.&lt;ref name=":162" /&gt; However, it can also lead to lower levels of wind dispersal for each individual plant or organism because of the effects [[climate change]] has on the normal conditions needed for plant growth, such as temperature and rainfall.&lt;ref name=":162" /&gt;

== Water (Hydrochory) ==
Hydrochory is dispersal using water, including oceans, rivers, streams, and rain.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It affects many different dispersal units, such as seeds, [[Fern sports|fern spores]], [[zooplankton]], and [[plankton]].  

Terrestrial water sources tend to be more restricted in their ability to disperse units&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=L. M.|date=November 2011|title=Pushing the limits in marine species distribution modelling: lessons from the land present challenges and opportunities|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|volume=20|issue=6|pages=789–802|doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00636.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Barriers such as mountain ranges, farm land, and urban centers prevent the relatively free movement of dispersal units seen in open bodies of water&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. [[Oceanic dispersal]] can move individuals or reproductive propagules anywhere from a meter to hundreds of kilometers from the original point depending on the size of the individual&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.  

=== Marine Dispersal ===
''Related Article:'' [[Oceanic dispersal|Ocean dispersal]].

A majority of marine organisms utilize [[Ocean current|ocean currents]] and movement within the [[water column]] to reproduce&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaylord|first=Brian|date=May 2002|title=A physically based model of macroalgal spore dispersal in the wave and current-dominated nearshore|url=|journal=Ecology|volume=83|issue=5|pages=1239–1251|via=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Mark F.|date=2016|title=Multiple dispersal vectors drive range expansion in an invasive marine species|url=|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=25|issue=20|pages=5001–5014|via=|pmid=27552100|doi=10.1111/mec.13817}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The process of releasing reproductive propagules into the water is called broadcast [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. While broadcast spawning requires parents to be relatively close to each other for fertilization, the fertilized [[zygote]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s can be moved extreme distances&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobday|first=Alistair J.|date=2001|title=Over-exploitation of a broadcast spawning marine invertebrate: Decline of the white abalone|url=|journal=Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries|volume=10|pages=493–514|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A number of marine invertebrates require ocean currents to connect their gametes once broadcast spawning has occurred &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morita|first=Masaya|date=May 2009|title=Ocean acidification reduces sperm flagellar motility in broadcast spawning reef invertebrates|url=|journal=Zygote|volume=18|pages=103–107|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Kelp]], an important group of sea plants, primarily utilize ocean currents to distribute their spores and larvae&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=Daniel C.|last2=Amsler|first2=Charles D.|last3=Ebeling|first3=Alfred W.|date=October 1992|title=Dispersal in kelps: Factors affecting spore swimming and competency|url=|journal=Ecology|volume=73|issue=5|pages=1577–1585|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Many coral species reproduce by releasing gametes into the water column with hopes that other local corals will also release gametes before these units are dispersed by ocean currents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Negri|first=A.

Some non-submerged aquatic plant species, like palm trees and mangroves, have developed fruits that float in sea water in order to utilize ocean currents as a form of dispersal&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathan|first=Ran|date=2008|title=Mechanisms of long-distance seed dispersal|url=|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|volume=23|pages=638–647|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Coconuts have been found to travel up to thousands of miles away from their parent tree due to their [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] nature&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howe|first=Henry F.|last2=Smallwood|first2=Judith|date=1982|title=Ecology of Seed Dispersal|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=13|pages=201–228|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A variety of over 100 species of vascular plants utilize this dispersal method for their fruit&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.  

Many plants have evolved with specific adaptations to maximize the distance that seeds, fruits, or propagules are dispersed in the ocean. For an increased protection against sinking in the [[water column]], seeds have developed hair or slime on their outer [[Seed-coat|seed coats]]&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. Seeds with filled with air, cork, or oil are better prepared to float for farther distances&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. 

Another aspect of dispersal comes from wave and tidal action&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McMahon|first=Kathryn|date=November 2014|title=The movement ecology of seagrass|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|volume=281|pages=1–9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Organisms in shallower waters, such as seagrasses, become displaced and dispersed by waves crashing upon them and tides pulling them out into the open ocean&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kendrick|first=Gary A.|date=January 2012|title=The central role of dispersal in the maintenance and persistence of seagrass populations|url=|journal=BioScience|volume=62|pages=56–65|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  
[[File:Table iceberg west of Sjuøyane, Arctic ocean.jpg|thumb|An iceberg that may act as a raft for arctic invertebrates. ]]
Some smaller marine organisms maximize their own dispersal by attaching to a raft - a biotic or abiotic object that is being moved by the ocean’s currents&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winston|first=Judith E.|date=October 2012|title=Dispersal in marine organisms without a pelagic larval phase|url=|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=52|pages=447–457|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Biotic rafts can be floating seeds or fruits, leaves, or other propagules&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;. Abiotic rafts are usually floating woods or plastics, including buoys and discarded trash&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;.  

[[Sea ice]] is also an important dispersal vector. Some arctic species rely on sea ice to disperse their eggs, like ''Daphnia pulex''&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havel|first=John E.|last2=Shurin|first2=Jonathan B.|date=July 2004|title=Mechanisms, effects, and scales of dispersal in freshwater zooplankton|url=|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|volume=49|pages=1229–1238|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' Drifting, as discussed above, can be an effective dispersal vector for marine mammals. It has been shown that intertidal [[Benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrates will utilize sea ice as a raft to travel up to multiple kilometers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macfarlane|first=Colin B. A.|date=January 2013|title=Dispersal of marine benthic invertebrates through ice rafting|url=|journal=Ecology|volume=94|pages=250–256|via=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Freshwater Dispersal ===
Freshwater dispersal primarily occurs through flowing water transporting dispersal units&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. Permanent aquatic environments require outside forms of dispersal to retain biodiversity, so hydrochory via freshwater is vital for the success of terrestrial water sources&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vanschoenwinkel|first=Bram|date=2008|title=Relative importance of different dispersal vectors for small aquatic invertebrates in a rock pool metacommunity|url=|journal=Ecography|volume=31|pages=567–577|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Lakes remain genetically diverse thanks to rivers that connect lakes to new sources of biodiversity&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. In lakes that lack connecting rivers, some organisms have developed adaptations that utilize the wind, while in an aquatic environment, to disperse reproductive units&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Incagnone|first=Giulia|date=2015|title=How do freshwater organisms cross the "dry ocean"? A review on passive dispersal and colonization processes with a special focus on temporary ponds|url=|journal=Hydrobiologia|volume=750|pages=103–123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In these cases, the dispersal units are moved to new aquatic habitats by utilizing the wind instead of the water in their habitat. 
[[File:The Flowing River.jpg|thumb|Flowing rivers can act as dispersal vectors for plant matter and invertebrates. ]]
Running water is the only form of long distance dispersal present in freshwater sources, so rivers act as the main aquatic terrestrial dispersal vector&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battauz|first=Yamila S.|date=2017|title=Macrophytes as dispersal vectors of zooplankton resting stages in a subtropical riverine floodplain|url=|journal=Aquatic Ecology|volume=51|pages=191–201|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Like in marine ecosystems, organisms take advantage of flowing water via passive transport of drifting along on a raft&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bilton|first=David T.|date=2001|title=Dispersal in freshwater invertebrates|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=32|pages=159–181|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The distance traveled by floating or drifting organisms and propagules is determined primarily on the amount of time that organism or unit is able to retain [[buoyancy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnelly|first=Melinda J.|last2=Walters|first2=Linda J.|date=November 2008|title=Water and boating activity as dispersal vectors for Schinus terebinthifolius (Brazilian pepper) seeds in freshwater and estuarine habitats|url=|journal=Estuaries and Coasts|volume=31|pages=960–968|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. &amp;nbsp;

Freshwater is important for dispersal of non-aquatic terrestrial organisms as well. [[Bryophyte|Bryophytes]] require an external source of water in order to sexually reproduce. Some bryophytes also utilize falling rain drops to maximize their spore dispersal distances&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sundberg|first=Sebastian|date=January 2005|title=Larger capsules enhance short-range spore dispersal in Sphagnum, but what happens further away?|url=|journal=Oikos|volume=108|pages=115–124|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitt|first=B. D. L.|date=1987|title=Spore dispersal and plant disease gradients; a comparison between two empirical models|url=|journal=Journal of Phytopathology|volume=118|pages=227–242|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Extreme Weather ===
Extreme weather events ([[Tropical cyclone|tropical cyclones]], floods and heavy rains, hurricanes, and thunderstorms) are the most intense examples of water functioning as a vector&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. The high intensity and high volume of rain that comes with these events facilitate long distance dispersal&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. 

Overflow is traditionally a side effect of heavy rains impacting one specific area&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;. Overflows have been shown to be effective in transmitting [[biodiversity]] between temporary lakes and ponds&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;. The overflow of pool water acts as an important passive form of [[Seed dispersal|hydrochory]] in which water acts as a vector&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sciullo|first=L.|last2=Kolasa|first2=J.|date=2012|title=Linking local community structure to the dispersal of aquatic invertebrate species in a rock pool metacommunity|url=|journal=Community Ecology|volume=13|pages=203–212|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Floods displace plants and organisms, whether or not overflow occurs&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;. [[Macrophytes]] and organisms as small as [[zooplankton]] can be transported via flood pulses&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;.

Hurricanes can also act as dispersal vectors. After the 2004 [[Hurricane Charley]] struck Florida, there was a higher reported dispersal of the propagules of red mangrove trees&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Proffitt|first=C. Edward|date=December 2006|title=Red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) reproduction and seedling colonization after Hurricane Charley: Comparisons of Charlotte Harbor and Tampa Bay|url=|journal=Estuaries and Coasts|volume=29|pages=972–978|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If a hurricane strikes in the later summer months, there is an expected increase in the dispersal of propagules, while early storms can wash out immature propagules and decrease the dispersal of mature propagules for that season&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;.

When extreme weather events occur over an open body of water, they can create intense waves.&amp;nbsp; These waves can create large dispersal within the water column by changing local water movement, but tend to constrict the actual dispersal distance for smaller organisms&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. 

=== Human-Created Hydrochory ===
The [[fishing]] industry has introduced new forms in which water acts as a dispersal vector. The water in bait buckets transfers bait everywhere a fisherman takes it, and this can introduce non-native species into areas should this bait water be spilt&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. This idea is applied on a much larger scale to the ballast tanks of ships&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. A study done by James Carlton of Williams College reports that more than 3000 species are moving across the ocean in [[Ballast tank|ballast tanks]] on any given day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlton|first=James T.|date=1996|title=Pattern, process, and prediction in marine invasion ecology|url=|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=78|pages=97–106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Artificial waterways created by humans have also spurred new forms of hydrochory. [[Amphipoda|Amphipods]] were found to be able to cross previously uncrossable areas to enter into new drainage pipe thanks to the construction of a canal&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;.

Artificial waterways not only connect communities that are geographically close, but they also allow for the transmission of invasive species from distant communities&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;. The distribution of invasive species is, in part, regulated by local ocean conditions and currents&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. 

The introduction of human-generated waste, like wood planks and plastic bags, into water sources has increased the amount of viable rafts for dispersal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiessling|first=Tim|date=2015|title=Marine litter as habitat and dispersal vector|url=|journal=Marine Anthropogenic Litter|volume=|pages=141–181|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Human Mediated Dispersal ==
Humans have been acting as dispersal vectors since we began moving around the planet, bringing non-native plants and animals with us. As trends in [[urbanization]] have increased, urban environments can act as staging grounds for species dispersal and invasion. Many non-native species exist in urban environments and the high rate of movement in an out of urban areas leads to a high level of dispersal to neighboring environments. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von der Lippe|first=Moritz|date=Spring 2017|title=Do cities export biodiversity?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="843">An '''ecoprovince''' is a [[biogeography|biogeographic]] unit smaller than an [[ecozone]] that contains one or more [[ecoregion]]s. According to Demarchi (1996), an ecoprovince encompasses areas of uniform climate, geological history and physiography (i.e. mountain ranges, large valleys, plateaus). Their size and broad internal uniformity make them ideal units for the implementation of natural resource policies.

'''Edging''', '''peaking''', or '''surfing''',&lt;ref name=Bodansky&gt;''Extended Massive Orgasm'', Steve and Vera Bodansky, (2000), pp. 91, 92, 94–98, {{ISBN|0-89793-289-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a orgasm control sexual technique which may be practiced either alone or with a partner and involves the maintenance of a high level of [[sexual arousal]] for an extended period of time without reaching [[Orgasm|climax]].

When practiced by males, orgasm control allows the practitioner to enjoy direct sexual stimulation without waiting through the refractory period common after orgasm. When the decision is made to allow orgasm, the physical sensations may be much greater and more pleasurable than if the orgasm were experienced conventionally. Orgasm control is referenced as 'slow masturbation' in [[Alex Comfort]]'s ''The New Joy of Sex'' (1993)&lt;ref&gt;''The New Joy of Sex'', [[Alex Comfort]], (1993), {{ISBN|1-85732-097-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'extended massive orgasm' in Vera and Steve Bodansky's 2000 book of the same name,&lt;ref name=Bodansky/&gt; and is similar to the [[Venus Butterfly]] technique used in the volume ''The One Hour Orgasm'' (1988) by Leah and Bob Schwartz.

Since orgasm control prolongs the experience of powerful sexual sensations occurring during the final build-up to orgasm, the physical demands of being kept or keeping oneself in this highly excited state for an extended time can induce a pleasurable, almost euphoric state.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Orgasm control can involve either [[sex partner]] being in control of the other partner's orgasm, or a person delaying their own orgasm during [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with a partner or by [[masturbation]]. To experience orgasm control, any method of [[sexual stimulation]] can be used.

== In partnered sex ==
When shared in sexual activity between partners, one partner would stimulate the other, gradually bringing them up to the point high in the plateau phase where an orgasm is actually building, and will then reduce the level of stimulation to just below that needed to trigger the orgasm. If control of the orgasm is given to a partner and orgasm is not allowed for a time in order to develop an increased level of sexual tension, it is referred to as [[erotic sexual denial]]. By carefully varying the intensity and speed of stimulation, and by practicing with the same partner to learn his or her responses, a person can be held in the highly aroused state near orgasm. This process may be repeated as desired, but at some point repetition may cause the urge to orgasm to become overwhelming. When a partner eventually provides enough stimulation to achieve an orgasm, it may be stronger than usual due to the increased tension and [[Sexual arousal|arousal]] that builds up during the extended stimulation. If the partner whose orgasm is being controlled, sometimes referred to as the [[submissive]] partner, is [[Bondage (sexual)|tied up]], it may better control the orgasm (the activity is sometimes called [[Erotic sexual denial#Tie and tease|tie and tease]] and if orgasm is denied it is [[tease and denial]]). Another possibility is for one partner to help produce [[multiple orgasm]]s in the other.

== In masturbation ==
{{original research|date=November 2010}}
When practiced alone, orgasm control is beneficial for heightening sexual pleasure as well as a training tool which permits the practitioner to increase the duration of sex with a partner.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} For the female, because there is little or no post-orgasm refractory period, the practitioner can enjoy direct sexual stimulation for longer periods of time, as well as with increased frequency and intensity. For the male, the speed of the rubbing or stroking of the penis may vary to navigate right to the edge of ejaculation. With orgasm control, a male can experience a longer or more intense orgasm, as well as a larger volume of semen expelled during his ejaculation. Because solo masturbation allows for precise control over the feelings, the timing, and the speed of stimulation, many people practice orgasmic control by themselves. One technique, commonly referred to as 'edging', involves masturbating up until the moment before reaching the plateau phase just before orgasm occurs, and then stopping suddenly before experiencing a climax. Another technique, commonly referred to as 'surfing', involves reaching the plateau phase and slowing down the stimulation to maintain a heightened level of sensation for an extended time. Repeating either of these techniques many times during a single masturbation session may result in a stronger, more intense orgasm.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Many individuals{{who|date=January 2014}} assert that orgasm control is more often possible with [[masturbation]]. This is a direct result of the fact that one is then able to control the intensity and duration of stimulation without having to rely on the partner stopping or changing the type of stimulation in order to postpone the orgasm. Masturbation is then the easy way to learn one's limits and could also be seen as the starting point in the technique of orgasm control.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Orgasm control is most easily learned through solitary masturbation, although many individuals enjoy including elements of orgasm control in sex with a partner. Masturbation provides the individual with the opportunity of learning about their bodies and the amount of pleasure they can experience without reaching orgasm. Self-stimulation can help both men and women acknowledge the limits of their body and the techniques that may help them in controlling their orgasms.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

As it has been described by Steve Bodansky and Vera Bodansky in ''Extended Massive Orgasm: How You Can Give and Receive Intense Sexual Pleasure'', masturbation practiced with the aim of orgasm control must be carried on with the purpose of making every stroke feel exquisite and not to relieve tension, as 'simple' masturbation does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JqiXUjILAlQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=steve+and+orgasm+familiarity#v=onepage&amp;q=chapter%205&amp;f=false|title=Extended Massive Orgasm: How You Can Give and Receive Intense Sexual Pleasure|date=2000-11-01|accessdate= 2010-07-27|isbn=9780897932899|author1=Bodansky|first1=Steve|last2=Bodansky|first2=Vera}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to practice this other type of masturbation, the same authors suggest gradual stimulation of the [[genitals]] and then making connections between the primary area ([[Human penis|penis]] or [[clitoris]]) and the secondary area ([[lip]]s, [[nipple]] or other part of the body that is an [[erogenous zone]]). The connection between the two areas is established once the individual stimulates them with exactly the same moves of the same intensity.

'''Endogenous regeneration''' in the brain is the ability of cells to engage in the repair and [[Regeneration (biology)#Humans|regeneration]] process.  While the brain has a limited capacity for regeneration, [[Endogeny|endogenous]] neural [[stem cell]]s, as well as numerous pro-regenerative molecules, can participate in replacing and repairing damaged or diseased [[neuron]]s and [[Neuroglia|glial cells]].  Another benefit that can be achieved by using endogenous regeneration could be avoiding an [[Immune system|immune]] response from the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Odelberg S. J. |year=2002 |title=Indus regeneration in mammals|journal= Cell &amp; Developmental Biology |volume=13 |pages=335–343. |doi=10.1016/s1084-9521(02)00089-7 |pmid= 12324215 |issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neural stem cells in the adult brain==
During the early development of a human, [[Nervous system|neural]] stem cells lie in the [[Germ layer|germinal layer]] of the developing brain, [[Ventricular system|ventricular]] and [[subventricular zone]]s.  In brain development, [[Multipotent#Multipotency|multipotent]] stem cells (those that can generate different types of cells) are present in these regions, and all of these cells differentiate into neural cell forms, such as [[neurons]], [[oligodendrocytes]] and [[astrocytes]].  A long-held belief states that the multipotency of neural stem cells would be lost in the adult human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Doetsch F, Isabelle C, Lim DA |year=1999 |title=Subventricular Zone Astrocytes Are Neural Stem Cells in the Adult Mammalian Brain |journal=Cell |volume=97 |pages=703–716|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80783-7|pmid=10380923|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is only ''[[in vitro]]'', using [[neurosphere]] and adherent [[monolayer]] cultures, stem cells that can be found in the adult mammalian brain that have shown mutipotent capacity, while the ''[[in vivo]]'' study is not convincing.  Therefore, the term "neural progenitor" is used instead of "stem cell" to describe limited regeneration ability in the adult brain stem cell.&lt;ref name='zhao'&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhao, C. |author2=Deng, W. |author3=Gage, F. H. |year=2008 |title=Mechanisms and functional implications of adult neurogenesis |journal= Cell |volume=132 |pages=645–660 |doi= 10.1016/j.cell.2008.01.033 |pmid=18295581|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neural stem cells]] (NSC) reside in the [[subventricular zone]] (SVZ) of the adult human brain and the [[dentate gyrus]] of the adult mammalian [[hippocampus]].  Newly formed neurons from these regions participate in learning, memory, [[olfaction]] and mood modulation.&lt;ref name='zhao' /&gt;  It has not been definitively determined whether or not these stem cells are multipotents.  NSC from the hippocampus of rodents, which can differentiate into dentate [[granule cell]]s, have developed into many cell types when studied in culture.&lt;ref name='ming'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Guo-li Ming H. S. |year=2005 |title=Adult Neurogenesis in the Mammalian Central Nervous System |journal=Annu. Rev.

It is believed that the various spatial location niches regulate the differentiation of the neural stem cell.&lt;ref name='development'&gt;{{cite journal| author=Duan, X. |author2=Kang, E. |author3=Liu, C.

==Neurogenesis in the central nervous system==
{{main|neuroregeneration}}

[[Santiago Ramon y Cajal]], a neuroscience pioneer, concluded that the generation of neurons occurs only in the [[Prenatal development|prenatal]] phase of human development, not after birth.  This theory had long been the fundamental principle of [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref name='ming' /&gt;  However, in the mid-20th century, evidence of adult mammalian [[neurogenesis]] was found in rodent hippocampus and other region of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Altman J. |title=Autoradiographic and histological studies of postnatal neurogenesis. II. A longitudinal investigation of the kinetics, migration and transformation of cells incorporating tritiated thymidine in infant rats, with special reference to postnatal neurogenesis in some brain regions | year=1966 |journal=J. Comp. Neurol. |pages=431–74 |doi=10.1002/cne.901280404 |volume=128 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the intact adult mammalian brain, [[neuroregeneration]] maintains the function and structure of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS).  The most adult stem cells in the brain are found in the subventricular zone at the lateral walls of the lateral ventricle.  Another region where neurogenesis takes place in the adult brain is the [[subgranular zone]] (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus.  While the exact mechanism that maintains functional NSCs in these regions is still unknown, NSCs have shown an ability to restore neurons and glia in response to certain [[Pathology|pathological]] conditions.  However, so far, this regeneration by NSCs is insufficient to restore the full function and structure of an injured brain.  However, endogenous neuroregeneration, unlike using embryonic stem cell implantation, is anticipated to treat damaged CNS without immunogenesis or [[Carcinogenesis|tumorigenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ninette Amariglio A. H. |author2=Bernd W, Scheithauer |author3=Yoram Cohen |year=2009 |title=Donor-Derived Brain Tumor Following Neural Stem Cell Transplantation in an Ataxia Telangiectasia Patient|journal= PLOS Medicine |volume=6 | issue = 2 |pages= 221–231 |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000029 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurogenesis in subgranular zone==
[[Progenitor cells]] in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus migrate to the nearby location and differentiate into granule cells. As a part of the [[limbic system]], new neurons of the hippocampus maintain the function of controlling mood, learning and memory.  In the dentate gyrus, [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/putative putative] stem cells, called type 1 cells, proliferate into type 2 and type 3 cells, which are transiently amplifying, lineage-determined progenitor cells.  Type 1 cells in the hippocampus are multipotent ''in vitro''.  However, although there is evidence that both new neurons and glia are generated in the hippocampus ''in vivo'', no exact relationship of neurogenesis to type 1 cells is shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gerd Kempermann |author2=Sebastian Jessberger |author3=Barbara Steiner |author4=Golo Kronenberg |title=Milestones of neuronal development in the adult hippocampus |journal = Trends in Neurosciences |volume = 27 | issue = 8 | year = 2004|doi=10.1016/j.tins.2004.05.013|url=http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences//retrieve/pii/S0166223604001675_returnURL=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166223604001675?showall=true |pages=447–452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hippocampus, newly formed neurons contribute only a small portion to the entire neuron population.  These new neurons have different [[electrophysiology]] compared to the rest of the existing neurons.  This may be evidence that generating new neurons in the SGZ is part of learning and memorizing activity of mammals.  Several studies have been performed to explain the relationship between neruogenesis and learning.  In the case of learning, that related to the hippocampal function, a significantly increased number of neurons are generated in the SGZ and survival of the new neurons is increased if they are required for retention of memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bendetta Leuner |author2=Sabrina Mendolia-Loffredo |author3=Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy |author4=Deanna Samburg |author5=Elizabeth Gould |author6=Tracey J.

In addition to learning and memorizing, neurogenesis in the SGZ is also affected by mood and emotion.  With constant, inescapable stress, which usually results in emotional depression, there is a significant decrease in neurogensis, the effect of which can be reversed by treatment with [[fluoxetine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Fluoxetine Treatment | year = 2003 |journal = Neuropsychopharmacology |volume = 28 |pages = 1562–1571 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300234 |issue=9 |title = Cell Proliferation in Adult Hippocampus is Decreased by Inescapable Stress: Reversal by Fluoxetine Treatment |pmid = 12838272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurogenesis in subventricular zone==
The largest NSC population in the brain is found in the SVZ.  The SVZ is considered a micro-environment called a "stem cell niche" that retains the NSC's capacity of self-renewing and multipotency.  Basic [[fibroblast]] growth factor (FGF2), [[hepatocyte growth factor]] (HGF), [[Notch-1]], [[sonic hedgehog]] (SHH), [[Noggin (protein)|noggin]], [[ciliary neurotrophic factor]] (CNTF), and a soluble carbohydrate-binding protein, [[Galectin-1]], are reported as factors that maintain such properties of NSC in stem cell niche.  Like stem cells in SGZ, progenitor cells in SVZ also differentiate into neurons and form an intermediate cell called a transiently amplifying cell (TAC).  A recent study revealed that [[beta-catenin]] signaling, Wnt β-catenin, regulates the differentiation of TAC.&lt;ref name='gene'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Naoko Kaneko |author2=Eisuke Kako |author3=Kazunobu Sawamoto |title=Prospects and Limitations of Using Endogenous Neural Stem Cells for Brain Regeneration |year =2011 |journal = Genes |volume = 2 |pages = 107–130 |doi = 10.3390/genes2010107 | issue =4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSCs in the SVZ have a distinct capacity to migrate into the olfactory bulb in the anterior tip of the [[Cerebrum|telencephalon]]
by a pathway called the [[rostral migratory stream]] (RMS).  This migration is unique to new neurons in the SVZ that embryonic neurogenesis and nerogenesis at other region of the brain are not able to perform.  Another unique neurogensis in the SVZ is neurogenesis by astrocytes.  A study done by Doetsch (1999) showed that astrocytes in the SVZ can be dedifferentiate and differentiate into neurons in the olfactory bulb.  Among four types of cells in the SVZ (migrating neuroblasts, immature precursors, astrocytes, and [[ependyma]]l cells), migrating neuroblasts and immature precursors are silenced with the anti-[[Mitosis|mitotic]] agent and astrocytes are infected with a [[retrovirus]].  In the result, neurons that have the retrovirus are found in the olfactory bulb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Doetsch, F. |author2=Isabelle, C. |author3=Lim, D. A. |title=Subventricular Zone Astrocytes Are Neural Stem Cells in the Adult Mammalian Brain |year=1999 |journal = Cell |pages= 703–716 |volume=97 |doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80783-7 |pmid = 10380923 |issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting neurogenesis==
Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain is affected by various factors, including exercise, [[stroke]], brain [[Insult (medical)|insult]] and pharmacological treatments.  For example, [[kainic acid]]-induced seizures, antidepressant ([[fluoxetine]]), [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[GABA]] and growth factors ([[fibroblast growth factors]] (FGFs), [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF), [[neuregulins]] (NRGs), [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF), and [[pigment epithelium-derived factor]] (PEDF) induce formation of neuroblasts.  The final destination of NSCs is determined by "niche" signals.  [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt]] signaling drives NSCs to the formation of new neurons in the SGZ, whereas bone [[Morphogenesis|morphogenic]] proteins (BMPs) promote NSC differentiation into glia cells in the SVZ.&lt;ref name='development' /&gt;

However, in the case of brain injury, neurogenesis seems insufficient to repair damaged neurons.  Thus, Cajal's theory was accepted for a long time.  In actuality, in the intercranial physiological condition, many neurogenesis inhibitors are present (for example, [[axon]] growth-inhibitory [[ligand]]s expressed in [[oligodendrocytes]], [[myelin]], NG2-glia, and reactive astrocytes in the lesion and degenerating tracts, and fibroblasts in scar tissue).  The inhibitory ligands bind to [[growth cone]] receptors on a damaged neuron, which causes repulsion and collapse of the growth cone in the damaged regions.  Among inhibitory factors, oligodendrocyte and myelin-derived inhibitory ligands are membrane-bound, meaning that, in the case of injury, those factors are not upregulated or overexpressed, rather it is from direct contact between intact or degraded myelin (or oligodendrocytes) and newly forming neurons.

Nevertheless, with scar formation, many cell types in the brain release growth-inhibitory ligands such as [[basal lamina]] components, inhibitory axon guidance molecules and [[chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=AXEL SANDVIG |author2=MARTIN BERRY |author3=LEE B. BARRETT |author4=ARTHUR BUTT |author5=AND ANN LOGAN |title=Myelin-, Reactive Glia-, and Scar-Derived CNS Axon Growth Inhibitors:Expression, Receptor Signaling, and Correlation with Axon Regeneration |journal =GLIA |year=2004 |volume =46 |pages=225–251 | doi= 10.1002/glia.10315 | pmid= 15048847 | issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Inhibitory action of such factors may be a protection of the brain from inflammation.  Okano and Sawamoto used an astrocyte-selective conditional [[Stat3]]-deficient mice model to examine the role of reactive astrocytes.  The result was increased widespread [[CD11b]]-positive inflammatory cell invasion and [[Demyelinating disease|demyelination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hideyuki Okano |author2=Kazunobu Sawamoto |title=Neural stem cells: involvement in adult neurogenesis and CNS repair |year=2012 |journal = Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B |volume=363 |pages=2111–2122 |doi =10.1098/rstb.2008.2264 | issue =1500 | pmid =18339601 | pmc =2610183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Brain damage itself can induce endogenous regeneration.  Many studies have proven endogenous regeneration as a possible treatment of brain damage.  However, the inhibitory reaction of the surrounding tissue of damaged region must be overcome before the treatment produces significant improvement.

===Traumatic brain injury===
In the study of the endogenous regeneration of the brain done by Scharff and co-researchers, damaged neurons in a songbird brain are regenerated with the same neuronal types where regeneration occurs (in the case of the study, the hippocampus).  However, in places where normal regeneration of the neuron does not occur, there was no replacement of damaged neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scharff C, Kirn JR, Grossman M, Macklis JD, Nottebohm F |title =Targeted neuronal death affects neuronal replacement and vocal behavior in adult songbirds |journal=Neuron |year =2002|pages =481–492 |volume=25 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80910-1 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, recovering brain function after a brain injury was supposed to have limitations.  However, a current study revealed that neurons are repaired to some degree after damage, from the SVZ.

The migrating ability of progenitor cells in the SVZ form chain-like structures and laterally move progenitor cells towards the injured region. Along with progenitor cells, thin astrocytic processes and blood vessels also play an important role in the migration of neuroblasts, suggesting that the blood vessels may act as a scaffold.  Other factors that contribute of the migration are [[Slit (gene family)|slit proteins]] (produced at the [[choroid plexus]]) and their gradient (generated by the flow of [[cerebrospinal fluid]]).  However, only 0.2% of new neurons survived and functioned in this study.  Enhancing neurogenesis can be done by injecting growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF).  However, enhanced neurogenesis also have the possibility of [[epilepsy]] resulting in prolonged seizures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Okano H, Sakaguchi M, Ohki K, Suzuki N, Sawamoto K |title=Regeneration of the central nervous system using endogenous repair mechanisms |year=2007 |journal =J Neurochem |pages=1459–1465 |volume=102 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.04674.x |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parkinson's Disease===
Although endogenous regeneration methods are showing some promising evidence in treating [[brain ischemia]], the current body of knowledge regarding promoting and inhibiting endogenous regeneration is not sufficient to treat [[Parkinson's disease]].  Both extrinsic and intrinsic modulation of pathological and physiological stimulation prevent the progenitor cell from differentiating into [[dopamine]] cells.  Further research must be done to understand factors that affect progenitor cell differentiation in order to treat Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andreas Hermann |author2=Alexander Storch |title=Endogenous Regeneration in Parkinson's Disease: Do We Need Orthotopic Dopaminergic Neurogenesis? |year=2008 |journal=Stem Cells |volume=26 |pages=2749–2752 |doi=10.1634/stemcells.2008-0567 |issue=11 |pmid=18719222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the difficulties in replacing compromised dopamine neurons through endogenous sources, recent work suggests that pharmacological activation of endogenous [[neural stem cell]]s or neural precursor cells results in powerful neuronal rescue and motor skill improvements through a signal [[Transduction (biophysics)|transduction]] pathway that involves the [[phosphorylation]] of [[STAT3]] on the [[serine]] residue and subsequent Hes3 expression increase ([[Hes3 signaling axis|STAT3-Ser/Hes3 Signaling Axis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Androutsellis-Theotokis A, Rueger MA, Park DM |title=Targeting neural precursors in the adult brain rescues injured dopamine neurons |journal=Proc.

In molecular biology, the '''FAD dependent oxidoreductase family''' of proteins is a family of [[flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]] dependent [[oxidoreductases]]. Members of this family include [[Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase]] {{EC number|1.1.99.5}}, [[Sarcosine oxidase]] beta subunit {{EC number|1.5.3.1}}, [[D-amino-acid dehydrogenase]] {{EC number|1.4.99.1}}, [[D-aspartate oxidase]] {{EC number|1.4.3.1}}.

[[D-amino acid oxidase]] {{EC number|1.4.3.3}} (DAMOX or DAO) is an FAD flavoenzyme that [[Catalysis|catalyses]] the [[redox|oxidation]] of neutral and basic D-[[amino acids]] into their corresponding keto acids.

Saint John described the scene,
:before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal... round about... were four beasts full of eyes... The four and twenty elders fall down before him... and worship him that liveth for ever and ever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=1149&amp;tabview=work The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne: Description]. [[Tate]]. Retrieved on November 05, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TJ9FXO1bt8C&amp;pg=PA26|p=26|title=Bible Textionary on Revelation|isbn=9781572585164|author1=Vining|first1=Noble|date=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the centre of a huge hall is placed a throne: round about the Throne are four and twenty seats on which sit four and twenty Elders, robed in white and wearing crowns of gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ienvr_jFYAEC|p=2902|title=Complete Evangelical Parallel Bible-PR-KJV/NKJV/NIV/NLT|isbn=9781598569506|author1=Bibles|first1=Hendrickson|date=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Assembly is introduced the Lamb that is to be initiated. In front of the Throne are four remarkable beasts ([[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]]): one of them is like a lion, another resembles an eagle, the third has the appearance of a calf, and the fourth has the face of a man. These beasts have six wings each, and are full of eyes all over; and they rest not night and day, but keep on blessing the One on the Throne.

== Interpretation ==
The word "Elder" in the majority of places where it is used in the Scriptures means the representative head of a city, family, tribe or nation, so the "Four and Twenty Elders" are representative of the redeemed human race. But why 24 Elders? Twenty-four is the number of the Priestly Courses as given in 1. Chron. 24:1-19. When David distributed the Priests into "Courses" he found there were 24 Heads of the Priestly families, and these 24 Heads he made representative of the WHOLE PRIESTHOOD. As the "Elders" are representative of both the Old and New Testament Saints, and the Old Testament Saints are represented by the Twelve Tribes of Israel, and the New Testament Saints' by the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, they together make up 24 representative characters. This distinction is clearly brought out in the description of the New Jerusalem, where the 12 Foundation Stones are named after the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, and the 12 Gates after the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Rev. 21:10-14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/tbr/tbr022.htm|title=The Book of Revelation: III. The Things Which Shall Be Hereafter: 3. The Four and Twenty Elders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegorical interpretation ==
[[Champat Rai Jain]], a 20th-century Jain writer claimed that the "Four and Twenty Elders" mentioned in the [[Christian Bible]] are "Twenty-four Jain ''[[Tirthankara]]s''".{{sfn|Jain|1930|p=78}} In his book, Jainism Christianity and Science, he wrote:{{quote|Briefly, the beasts represent the different kinds of souls that are embodied in the four elements (of matter), namely, the earth-bodied (represented by the lion, since he walks on earth), the air-bodied (represented by the eagle who flies in the air), the water-bodied (represented by the calf, which here is the young of the sea-mammals), and the fire-bodied (represented by the sun which is painted as the face of a man). Wings are a symbol for time, since it flies; and the number six is descriptive of the six ''aras'' (spokes) or a half-cycle in which four and twenty ''Tirthamkaras'' appear and preach the Truth. Plainly put, the significance of the secret teaching is only this that Life is Divine, and its divinity is manifested most perfectly and fully in the case of four and twenty ''Tirihamkaras'', who appear in a half-cycle of time, consisting of six aras, and preach the Noble Truth to and for the benefit of the souls embodied in material bodies.{{sfn|Jain|1930|p=78-79}}}}

The concept of '''friction of distance''' is based on the notion that [[distance]] usually requires some amount of [[Work (physics)|effort]], [[energy]], time, and/or other [[resource]]s to overcome.  Because of this "[[friction]]", spatial [[interaction]]s, especially [[transport]] and the particular case of [[human migration]], will tend to take place more often over shorter distances; amount and intensity of interaction will [[distance decay|decay with distance]].  Regardless of physical friction, the various [[cost]]s are metaphorically assumed to correspond to forces that impede movements.

Friction, be it physical or metaphorical, may be a continuous, smooth function or may contain jumps; it may be constant, linear, or nonlinear or a combination of jumps and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] effects, as with [[Intermodal freight transport]] and [[Intermodal passenger transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch7en/conc7en/frictionspace.html

[[Image:GCN.PNG|300px|thumb|Diagram of the Gamma ray burst Coordinates Network. (NASA/GSFC)]]
The '''gamma-ray burst coordinates network''' ('''GCN''') is a system that distributes information about the location of a [[gamma-ray burst]] (GRB), called ''notices'', when a burst is detected by various spacecraft. The GCN also automatically receives and distributes messages, called ''circulars'', about follow-up observations to interested individuals and institutions. Follow-up observations may be made by ground-based and space-based optical, radio, and X-ray observatories.

GCN has its origins in the BATSE coordinates distribution network (BACODINE). The Burst And Transient Source Experiment ([[BATSE]]) was a scientific instrument on the ''[[Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory]]'' (CGRO), and BACODINE monitored the BATSE real-time telemetry from CGRO. The first function of BACODINE was calculating the [[right ascension]] (RA) and [[declination]] (dec) locations for GRBs that it detected, and distributing those locations to sites around the world in real-time. Since the de-orbiting of the CGRO, this function of BACODINE is no longer operational. The second function of BACODINE was collecting right ascension and declination locations of GRBs detected by spacecraft other than CGRO, and then distributing that information. With this functionality, the original BACODINE name was changed to the more general name GCN.

==GCN data flow==
The GCN data flow starts when gamma-rays from a GRB hit a detector on a spacecraft. The spacecraft sends the GRB location information down to a ground station, which in turn relays it to the GCN at the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. At GSFC the location information is processed by GCN with custom hardware and software, and then Notices are sent to users via [[Inter-process communication|socket connection]], [[e-mail]], and [[pager]]s. Those users may then schedule follow-up observations of the GRB, and send refined information about the GRB back to the GCN.

In the case of ''[[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]]'', the GRB location information follows the same path, except it is transmitted from ''Swift'' up to a [[TDRS]] satellite, and then down to the [[TDRSS#Ground segment|White Sands Complex]] (WSC). From WSC, the location information is sent to GSFC via a domestic communications satellite (DOMSAT).

==GCN notices==
The following spacecraft, and instruments where noted, are sources of real-time GCN information:

*''[[High Energy Transient Explorer]]'' (WMM and SXC)
*''INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory'' ([[INTEGRAL]])
*[[InterPlanetary Network]] (IPN) Position Notices from ''[[WIND (spacecraft)|WIND]]'' (Konus) and ''[[Ulysses probe|Ulysses]]''.
*''[[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]]'' (PCA and ASM)
*''[[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]]'' provides data products not previously available from prior missions, including [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Spectra of objects|spectra]], images, and [[lightcurve]]s.

Past spacecraft and instruments that participated in GCN include ''[[Array of Low Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors]]'' (''ALEXIS''), ''[[BeppoSAX]]'', the Imaging Compton Telescope (COMPTEL) on CGRO, and the X-Ray/Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (XGRS) on ''[[NEAR Shoemaker]]''.

==GCN circulars==
The GCN system has the capability to receive and distribute timely information on GRBs called GCN Circulars. Users e-mail their reports to a central location and then those reports will be automatically sent to an e-mail distribution list. This list of Circular recipients is completely separate from the list of Notice recipients. The GCN Observation Report Circulars allow the GRB follow-up community to make optimum use of limited resources, such as labor and telescope time, by communicating what has already been done or will soon be done.

==Future plans for GCN==
To maximize the utility of the GCN system, GCN will make whatever modifications are necessary to incorporate and distribute GRB location information from new spacecraft and instruments as they become active. GCN will also expand its operations to include information about any astrophysical transients, including non-GRBs such as the [[UV astronomy|extreme-ultraviolet]] transients detected by the ''ALEXIS'' spacecraft. Future spacecraft that will be distributing GRB locations via GCN include ''[[AGILE (spacecraft)|AGILE]]'' and ''[[Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope]]''.

'''Gotham Writers Workshop''' is the [[United States]]'s largest adult-education writing school.&lt;ref&gt;New York Press, April 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in New York City in 1993 by writers Jeff Fligelman and David Grae. It was one of the first schools to offer online education, launching its online creative writing classes in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Byles, Jeff. ''The Write Stuff'' The Village Voice, August 05, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The workshop offers courses in most of the major genres including fiction and novel writing, screenwriting and television, poetry, and several forms of creative nonfiction, including essay writing and memoir.&lt;ref name="writingclasses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writingclasses.com/|title=Gotham Writers' Workshop - Creative Writing Classes in NY and Online|publisher=writingclasses.com|accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also runs fiction and screenwriting classes in partnership with ''Zoetrope: All Story'', the literary magazine founded by Francis Ford Coppola and Adrienne Brodeur and edited by Michael Ray.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zoetrope: All-Story]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gotham Writers Workshop has produced three books, edited by school President Alexander Steele: ''Writing Fiction'', ''Fiction Gallery'', and ''Writing Movies''. They've also been translated and published in several languages.

The workshop also publishes a monthly newsletter with writing articles by its faculty and others.

[[File:hansard-1832.jpg|right|thumb|''Hansard'' title page from 1832]]
'''''Hansard''''' is the traditional name of the transcripts of Parliamentary Debates in Britain and many Commonwealth countries. It is named after [[Thomas Curson Hansard]] (1776–1833), a London printer and publisher, who was the first official printer to the parliament at Westminster.

==Origins==
Though the history of the ''Hansard'' began in the British parliament, each of Britain's colonies developed a separate and distinctive history. Before 1771, the British Parliament had long been a highly secretive body. The official record of the actions of the House was publicly available, but there was no record of the debates. The publication of remarks made in the House became a breach of Parliamentary privilege, punishable by the two Houses of Parliament. As the populace became interested in parliamentary debates, more independent newspapers began publishing unofficial accounts of them.

The many penalties implemented by the government, including fines, dismissal, imprisonment, and investigations, are reflective of "the difficulties faced by independent newspapermen who took an interest in the development of Upper Canada, and who, in varying degrees, attempted to educate the populace to the shortcomings of their rulers".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

Several editors used the device of veiling parliamentary debates as debates of fictitious societies or bodies. The names under which parliamentary debates were published include ''Proceedings of the Lower Room of the Robin Hood Society'' and ''Debates of the Senate of Magna Lilliputia''.&lt;ref name="C-H"&gt;[http://www.commonwealth-hansard.org/chea_story.asp Story of Hansard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223040314/http://www.commonwealth-hansard.org/chea_story.asp |date=2011-02-23 }} — Commonwealth Hansard Editors Association&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate of Magna Lilliputia was printed in [[Edward Cave]]'s ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', which was first published in 1732. The names of the speakers were carefully "[[Fillet (redaction)|filleted]]"; for example, Sir [[Robert Walpole]] was thinly disguised as "Sr. R―t W―le".&lt;ref name=Trewin&gt;{{cite book|last=Trewin|first=J.C|title=Printer to the House: The Story of Hansard|year=1952|publisher=The Chapel River Press|location=Andover, Hants, Great Britain|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1771 [[Brass Crosby]], who was [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]], had brought before him a printer by the name of John Miller who dared publish reports of Parliamentary proceedings. He released the man, but was subsequently ordered to appear before the House to explain his actions. Crosby was committed to the [[Tower of London]], but when he was brought to trial, several judges refused to hear the case and after protests from the public, Crosby was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dougsaunders.net/2010/12/brass-crosby-julian-assange-wikileaks/|title=Brass Crosby: The Julian Assange of 1771|author=|date=17 December 2010|website=dougsaunders.net|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318133153/http://dougsaunders.net/2010/12/brass-crosby-julian-assange-wikileaks/|archivedate=18 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament ceased to punish the publishing of its debates as harshly, partly due to the campaigns of [[John Wilkes]] on behalf of free speech. There then began several attempts to publish reports of debates. Among the early successes, the ''Parliamentary Register'' published by [[John Almon]] and [[John Debrett]] began in 1775 and ran until 1813.

[[William Cobbett]] (1763–1835), a noted radical and publisher, began publishing ''Parliamentary Debates'' as a supplement to his ''[[Political Register]]'' in 1802, eventually extending his reach back with the ''Parliamentary History''. Cobbett's avocation for the freedom of the press was severely punished by the British Government. On June 5, 1810 [[William Cobbett]] stood trial for seditious libel for an article he wrote against the British Government which was published by [[Thomas Curson Hansard]]. Cobbett was found "guilty, upon the fullest and most satisfactory evidence".&lt;ref name=Trewin /&gt; The court sentence read: "The court do adjudge that you, [[William Cobbett]] pay to our Lord the King a fine of £1000; that you be imprisoned in His Majesty's gaol of Newgate for the space of two years, and that at expiration of that time you enter into a recognizance to keep the peace for seven years—yourself in the sum of £3000, and two good and sufficient sureties in the sum of £1000; and further, that you be imprisoned till that recognizance be entered into, and that fine paid".&lt;ref name=Trewin /&gt; The sentence was described by J. C. Trewin as "vindictive".&lt;ref name=Trewin /&gt; The Court argued that [[Thomas Curson Hansard]], who had "seen the copy before it was printed, ought not to have suffered it to have been printed at all"&lt;ref name=Trewin /&gt; and was sentenced to three months imprisonment in the [[King's Bench Prison]].

Cobbett's reports were printed by [[Thomas Curson Hansard]] from 1809; in 1812, Cobbett's finances ran asunder and he divested himself of his proprietorship of both the ''Parliamentary Debates'' and ''Parliamentary History'', which then "passed into the hands of Hansard in 1812".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; ''Cobbett's Parliamentary Debates'' became ''Hansard Parliamentary Debates'', "abbreviated over time to the now familiar Hansard".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; From 1829 the name "Hansard" appeared on the title page of each issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hansard-westminster.co.uk/story.asp ::: Department of the Official Report (Hansard) – Story of Hansard :::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817171411/http://www.hansard-westminster.co.uk/story.asp |date=2009-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Cobbett nor Hansard ever employed anyone to take down notes of the debates, which were taken from a multiplicity of sources in the morning newspapers. For this reason, early editions of ''Hansard'' are not to be absolutely relied upon as a guide to everything discussed in Parliament.

Hansard outlasted competitors including Almon and Debrett, and the later ''Mirror of Parliament'' published by J. H. Barrow from 1828 to 1843; Barrow's work was more comprehensive but he checked each speech with the Member and allowed them to "correct" anything they wished they had not said. The last attempt at a commercial rival was ''[[The Times]]'' which published debates in the 1880s. In 1878 a subsidy was granted to the Hansard press and at that point reporters were employed.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; Despite hiring contract reporters there were still widespread complaints about the accuracy of the debate reports. In 1889 Henry Hansard, the son of Thomas Hansard, broke the family connection with the debates.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==

The ''Hansard'' of today, a comprehensive account of every speech, began in 1909 when [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] took over the publication and established its own staff of official ''Hansard'' reporters. At the same time the decision was made to publish debates of the two houses in separate volumes, and to change the front cover from orange-red to light blue. A larger page format was introduced with new technology in 1980.

''Hansard'' is not a word-for-word transcript of debates in Parliament. Its terms of reference are those set by a House of Commons Select Committee in 1893, as being a report

{{quote|which, though not strictly verbatim, is substantially the verbatim report with repetitions and redundancies omitted and with obvious mistakes (including grammatical mistakes) corrected, but which, on the other hand, leaves out nothing that adds to the meaning of the speech or illustrates the argument.&lt;ref name="Hansard terms of reference"&gt;Ian Church, "Official Report [HANSARD] Centenary Volume", 2009, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One instance of such an eliminated redundancy involves the calling of members in the House of Commons. In that House, the Speaker must call on a member by name before that member may speak, but ''Hansard'' makes no mention of the recognition accorded by the Speaker. Also, ''Hansard'' sometimes adds extraneous material to make the remarks less ambiguous. For example, though members refer to each other as "the hon. Member for ''Constituency Name''{{-"}} rather than by name, ''Hansard'' adds, in parentheses, the name of the member being referred to, the first time that Member is referred to in a speech or debate. When a Member simply points at another whose constituency he or she cannot remember, ''Hansard'' identifies him or her.

Any interruption to debate  will be marked with the word "(Interruption)". This understated phrase covers a variety of situations, ranging from members laughing uproariously to the physical invasion of the chamber. Interjections from seated members, such as heckling during [[Prime minister's questions|Prime Minister's Questions]], are generally only included if the member who is speaking responds to the interjection.

''Hansard'' also publishes written answers – known as [[written ministerial statement]]s – made by Government [[Minister (government)|ministers]] in response to questions formally posed by members. In 1839, Hansard, by order of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], printed and published a report stating that an [[obscenity|indecent]] book published by a Mr. Stockdale was circulating in [[Newgate Prison]]. Stockdale sued for [[defamation]] but Hansard's defence, that the statement was true, succeeded. On publication of a reprint, Stockdale sued again but Hansard was ordered by the House to plead that he had acted under order of the Commons and was protected by [[parliamentary privilege]]. In the resulting case of ''[[Stockdale v Hansard]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1839) 9 Ad &amp; El 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;State Trials (New Series) III, 723.&lt;/ref&gt; the court found that the House held no privilege to order publication of defamatory material. In consequence, Parliament passed the [[Parliamentary Papers Act 1840]] to establish privilege for publications under the House's authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bradley, A.W.  |author2=Ewing, K.D. | year=2003 | title=Constitutional and Administrative Law | publisher=Pearson | location=London | edition=13th | pages=219–220 | isbn=0-582-43807-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stockdale, E. [1990] ''Public Law'' 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ford, P. &amp; G. (eds) | title=Luke Graves Hansard's Diary 1814–1841 | year=1962 | location=Oxford | publisher=Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1909—and for important votes before then—''Hansard'' has listed how members have voted in [[Division (vote)|divisions]]. Furthermore, the proceedings and debates in committee are also published in separate volumes. For many years the House of Commons ''Hansard'' did not formally acknowledge the existence of parties in the House, except obliquely, with Members' references to other Members of the same party as "hon. Friends", but in 2003 this changed and members' party affiliations are now identified. The ''Hansard'' of the House of Lords operates entirely independently of its Commons counterpart, but with similar terms of reference. It covers parliamentary business in the House of Lords Chamber itself, as well as the debates in the Moses Room, known as Grand Committee. Parliamentary Written Answers and Statements are also printed. Emma Crewe notes that "Editors view reporters in general as a hive of revolution and anti-establishment attitudes, while they perceive themselves as calm and uncomplaining".&lt;ref name="Crewe2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crewe |first=Emma |title=Lords of parliament: manners, rituals and politics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VHpIwkpFOCkC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=lords+of+parliament+hansard+revolutionary#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 January 2011 |year=2005 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-7207-9 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet, with the help of volunteers, has made the UK ''Hansard'' more accessible. The UK ''Hansard'' is currently being digitised to a high-level format{{clarify|date=November 2014}} for on-line publication.{{citation needed|date=November 2016|reason=Some citation talking about these voluntary efforts, etc?}} It is possible to review and search the UK ''Hansard'' from 1803, with the exception of Standing Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/commons/|title=House of Commons Hansard archives|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518231458/http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/commons/|archivedate=2014-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/|title=Hansard Online - commencing May 2010|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113141245/https://hansard.parliament.uk/|archivedate=2016-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because ''Hansard'' is treated as accurate, there is a parliamentary convention whereby if a member of parliament makes an inaccurate statement in parliament, he/she must write a correction in the copy of ''Hansard'' kept in the House of Commons library.

==Canada==
[[File:Hansard, Canada, Dominion Parliament (July 17, 1895).jpg|thumb|Sample of ''Hansard'' from the Canadian House of Commons, 1895. Shows sample of several members speaking as described in the text.]]

===House of Commons===
As with the Westminster ''Hansard'', the Canadian version is not strictly verbatim, and is guided by the principle of avoiding "repetitions, redundancies and obvious errors". Unlike the UK House of Commons, members are referred to in the House only by the parliamentary ridings they represent ("The member for Halifax West", etc.) or by their cabinet post. ''Hansard'' supplies an affiliation the first time each member speaks in the House on a particular day—"'''Mr. Mathieu Ravignat (Pontiac, NDP''')" or "'''Hon. Lynne Yelich (Minister of State for Western Economic Diversification, CPC.)'''"—and by name only when they rise later to speak.

If interjections give rise to a call for order by the Speaker, they are reported as "'''Some hon. members: Oh, oh!'''" The details of the approval or negativing of motions and bills are reported in rather baroque detail:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=hansard&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=38&amp;Ses=1|title=Debates (Hansard) No. 159 - November 28, 2005 (38-1) - House of Commons of Canada|author=|date=|website=www2.parl.gc.ca|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309095935/http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=38&amp;Pub=hansard&amp;Ses=1|archivedate=9 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|'''The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marcel Proulx):''' The House has heard the terms of the motion. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?&lt;br&gt;

===Translation===
Given the [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] nature of the Canadian federal government, two equivalent Canadian ''Hansard''s are maintained, one in [[French language|French]] and one in [[English language|English]]. This makes it a natural [[Parallel text alignment|parallel text]], and it is often used to train French–English [[machine translation]] programs. In addition to being already translated and aligned, the size of the ''Hansard''s and the fact that new material is always being added makes it an attractive [[text corpus|corpus]]. However, its usefulness is hindered by the fact that the translations, although accurate in meaning, are not always literally exact.

The Canadian ''Hansard'' records make note of the language used by the members of parliament, so as not to misinterpret the words of the person who has the floor. If the member speaks in French, the English ''Hansard'' records would state that the member spoke in French and refer the reader to the French ''Hansard'' record.

In one instance, during a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[filibuster]] in the [[Senate of Canada]], Senator [[Philippe Gigantès]] was accused of reading one of his books only so that he could get the translation for free through the ''Hansard''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoy, Claire. ''Nice Work: The Continuing Scandal of Canada's Senate'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newfoundland===
In Newfoundland the struggle for the free press was much more violent. Henry Winton, editor of ''Saint John's Ledger'', "had his ears cut off and was left unconscious by thugs who had been lying in wait for him after dark".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; The fate of Winton was to be his printer's as well. 
The Authorities, who were not on friendly terms with the ''Ledger'', made little to no effort to apprehend the culprits.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; In another case, a "Gentleman by the name Parsons", of the ''Newfoundland Patriot'', "was sentenced to three months imprisonment in another incident".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

===Nova Scotia===
As was the case in many early Canadian regions, the newspapers were the first source of the Parliamentary debates. Canada's first newspaper, the ''[[Halifax Gazette]]'', was printed on Grafton street in Halifax in 1752. The two most prominent papers in Parliamentary reporting were the ''[[Acadian Recorder]]'', founded in 1813 by Anthony Henry Holland, and the ''Free Press'', established in 1816 by Edward Ward.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=John|title=The Hansard Chronicles|year=1980|publisher=Deneau and Greenberg Publishers Ltd|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=0-88879-023-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both newspapers reported the debates of the House of Assembly starting in 1817.

The [[Family Compact]] of Nova Scotia, nicknamed "the little compact", "viewed the admission of reporters to the Assembly with disdain" and "were not slow to react whenever they felt the slightest affront".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; There are many cases which exemplify the "struggle to obtain freedom of the press and parliamentary reportings in the Maritimes" as in the case of William Minns in 1823, who was forced to appear before the bar of the house, and William Milne, who was jailed for not being able to pay his debts.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

''The Novascotian'' newspaper would soon become Nova Scotia's most prominent paper after its launch in 1824, which was highly influenced by [[George Young (reporter)|George Young]] who was instrumental in its establishment.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; [[George Young (reporter)|George Young]] sought permission from the Assembly to report its debates. Permission was granted, yet he was not provided with very many privileges in the House. They didn't make it easy for him and didn't allow him a seat in the lower deck.

In 1827 [[Joseph Howe]] bought the ''Novascotian'' from Young. "There was no more powerful an advocate of parliamentary debates than Howe".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; In 1835 [[Joseph Howe]] was "prosecuted over a publication of a letter in the ''Novascotian''".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; He was charged with libel. This case was infamous and is considered to be a "cornerstone in the establishment of freedom of the press in Canada".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; Howe, who defended himself in court, was found to be Not Guilty. This is why his case is viewed as a milestone in the development of the free press.

===Ontario===
[[File:Ontario Hansard 1953.jpg|right|thumb|Cover page of ''Hansard'' for the Province of Ontario, February 12, 1953]]
No official record of the debates in the provincial Legislature was produced before 1944. The debates were reported in various newspapers; the provincial archives clipped and collected these reports in a series of scrapbooks until 1953.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/about/library_l21.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial website now posts ''Hansard'' online, with records from March 29, 1977 to current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/ |title=Legislative Debates Search Page |publisher=Hansardindex.ontla.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-09-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619023323/http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/ |archivedate=2016-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alberta===
[[Alberta]] adopted a ''Hansard'' in 1972.&lt;ref name="assembly.ab.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/pib/hansard_home.htm|title=ALL ABOUT HANSARD - Legislative Assembly of Alberta|author=|date=|website=www.assembly.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1905 to 1971, local newspapers reported on legislative proceedings, and from these articles the Legislature Library has compiled a Scrapbook ''Hansard'', which is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://librarysearch.assembly.ab.ca/client/en_CA/scrapbookhansard|title=Scrapbook Hansard|author=|date=|website=librarysearch.assembly.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; News reporters were allowed to take handwritten notes in the Chamber, but they could not to make sound recordings, and members of the public were not allowed to take notes.&lt;ref&gt;Standing Orders of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/standing/standing_orders.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 a recording system was installed in the Chamber. Initially the Clerk’s office provided transcription only for special events, such as throne speeches, but requests from MLAs for transcripts increased, and by 1971 all House proceedings were being recorded. On March 8, 1972, the government introduced a motion to create ''Alberta Hansard'', and the following day they brought forward a motion allowing audio and video recording in the Chamber and also permitting visitors to the galleries to take notes. Assembly standing orders 115 and 116 set out the rules for broadcast media in the Chamber and at committee meetings, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/pib/hansard_AB_history.htm|title=ALL ABOUT HANSARD - Legislative Assembly of Alberta|author=|date=|website=www.assembly.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hansard'' staff verifies the names of individuals and entities mentioned in the House. Like other ''Hansard''s, ''Alberta Hansard'' follows editorial guidelines established in the 19th century, and transcripts are substantially verbatim. Revisions are limited to “the correction of grammar, spelling and punctuation, ensuring that the correct parliamentary forms are observed, and minimizing superfluous repetition and redundancies, but no material alterations shall be made, nor any amendments that would in any way tend to change the sense of what has been spoken.”&lt;ref&gt;Standing Order 113, https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/standing/standing_orders.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Transcripts for [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] proceedings from 1972 onward are available online, and current issues are usually posted within 12 hours of the day’s sitting. A transcript for a regular afternoon Assembly sitting of 4.5 hours contains more than 30,000 words.&lt;ref name="assembly.ab.ca"/&gt; Also available online are transcripts for meetings of committees of the Legislative Assembly from the 1990s onward, earlier for some committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=adr_home|title=Assembly Documents and Records- Legislative Assembly of Alberta|author=|date=|website=www.assembly.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Columbia===
No complete official record of the debates in the British Columbia Legislature was produced until 1972; a partial record was issued beginning in 1970. Unlike the Ottawa ''Hansard'', opposition members and government backbenchers are identified only by initial and last name: "'''J. Horgan'''". Current cabinet ministers have their names prefaced with "Honourable": "'''Hon. S. Hagen'''". Interjections giving rise to a call for order by the Speaker are reported only as "Interjection". Other interjections are reported as spoken if they are clearly audible and if they are responded to in some way by the member who has the floor. While the details of approval or negativing of motions and bills closely parallel the House of Commons, the reporting is simplified to a style line ("Motion approved" or "Motion negatived").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.bc.ca/hansard/38th3rd/H70531p.htm Hansard, Thursday, May 31, 2007 p.m., Vol. 22, No. 3 (HTML)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926212412/http://www.leg.bc.ca/hansard/38th3rd/H70531p.htm |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parliament of Australia]] also keeps record of debates, using the term ''Hansard''.&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard | title=Hansard – Parliament of Australia | publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] | work=Parliament of Australia website | accessdate=22 November 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015021919/http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard | archivedate=15 October 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peo.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fact_sheets/records_parliament.html | title=Fact Sheets – Records of the Parliament | publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] | work=Parliamentary Education Office website | accessdate=22 November 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130164509/http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fact_sheets/records_parliament.html | archivedate=30 November 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The records are published by the [[State Law Publisher]].&lt;ref name="parliament.wa.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/webcms/webcms.nsf/content/hansard | title=Parliament of WA – Hansard | publisher=[[Parliament of Western Australia]] | work=Parliament of Western Australia website | accessdate=22 November 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204110751/http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/WebCMS/WebCMS.nsf/content/hansard | archivedate=4 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of South Australia]] was the first convict free state colony to use ''Hansard''; where it became a convention from 1857.

==New Zealand==
{{Main|Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)}}

On 9 July 1867 a team of five reporters, led by Chief Reporter [[C.C.N. Barron]], produced the first official report of debates of the [[Parliament of New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18920711.2.10|title=A Quarter of a Century.|author=|date=11 July 1892|publisher=|pages=2|accessdate=28 April 2018|via=Papers Past|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218154551/https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18920711.2.10|archivedate=18 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18880709.2.8|title=Evening Post.

Today ''Hansard'' is produced by a team of 17 [[Full-time equivalent|FTE]] Hansard Editors within the [[Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives]]. ''Hansard'' is published on the [[New Zealand Parliament]] website each day the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House]] sits, and later indexed bound volumes are produced.

Speeches are transcribed directly from digital recordings of the debate, with staff present in the [[debating chamber]] to monitor the debate by recording the sequence of speakers and any interjections. Interjections are reported only if the member speaking replies to them or remarks on them during the course of his or her speech. Hansard Editors follow strict rules on what changes they can make to the words [[MPs]] use in the [[debating chamber]]. ''Hansard'' is as close to [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] as possible, although Hansard Editors remove repetitions and redundancies and make minor grammatical corrections. [[MPs]] are provided draft copies of their speeches at the same time that the speeches are first published on the Parliament website. [[MPs]] can request correction of inadvertent factual inaccuracies but they are unable to significantly change what they said in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/what-is-hansard/|title=What is Hansard?|author=|date=|website=www.parliament.nz|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129044314/https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/what-is-hansard/|archivedate=29 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews270420091/650th-bound-edition-of-hansard-published|title=Features (pre 2016)|author=|date=|website=www.parliament.nz|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218130306/https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews270420091/650th-bound-edition-of-hansard-published|archivedate=18 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Parliament==
The [[European Parliament]] has its verbatim report of proceedings of the plenary sessions, often referred to by its name in French {{lang|fr|compte rendu in extenso}} (CRE). It is eventually available in nearly all of the [[languages of the European Union|Union's languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/plenary/cre.do|title=Home - Plenary - European Parliament|author=|date=|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830133034/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/plenary/cre.do|archivedate=30 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jon Allen Seger''' is an American evolutionary [[ecologist]], and Distinguished Professor of Biology at the [[University of Utah]].&lt;ref name="uprofile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology.utah.edu/faculty2.php?inum%3D2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609193500/http://www.biology.utah.edu/faculty2.php?inum=2 |archivedate=2010-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped develop the theory of [[Bet-hedging (biology)|bet-hedging]] in biology. His work has appeared in leading scientific journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', ''[[Nature Genetics]]'', ''[[Molecular Biology and Evolution]]'', ''[[Journal of Evolutionary Biology]]'', as well as popular magazines such as ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=experts-random-mutations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Dr. Seger attended [[UC Santa Barbara]] for his undergraduate studies, where he received a B.A. in English in 1969. Following college, he worked at the [[National Museum of Natural History]] on an assignment to help the museum establish public environmental education programs.&lt;ref name="uprofile"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution 1970|url=https://archive.org/stream/smithsonianyear7071smit/smithsonianyear7071smit_djvu.txt|website=archive.org|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|accessdate=19 May 2017|location=City of Washington|language=en|date=30 June 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then enrolled at [[Harvard University]], where he received his [[Master of Education|EdM]] in 1972 and his PhD in Biology in 1980. Much of his early work concerned models of sex ratio evolution and a variety of social insects (such as the Vespidae wasps). This work often took the form of mathematical models built from 'first principles' (such as his 1986 paper written with Robert Trivers). Following his PhD he held [[postdoctoral]] positions at the [[University of Sussex]] (1981-1982), the [[University of Michigan]] (1982-1983), and [[Princeton University]] (1983–86).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jon Seger|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/316/|website=MacArthur Foundation|language=en|date=1 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the faculty at the [[University of Utah]] in 1986.

==Career==
His latest work concerns applications of coalescent theory to population genetics, particularly the mtDNA of whale lice, although members of his lab work on a variety of applied and theoretical topics that range from evolutionary ecology and genetics to mathematical biology and coalescent theory. In addition, he recently received an NSF grant to continue his work on the so-called "missing heritability" problem. His whale lice work had already shown that a genome should have lots of weakly deleterious mutations of small effect taken on their own but potentially large effect when taken together. This implies that the "missing" genes sought by, for example, human geneticists aren't actually missing: there are simply a lot more genes have a very small effect on fitness by themselves but have can have a large effect when the effects are combined.

A '''material passport''' is a document consisting of all the materials that are included in a product or construction. It consist of a set of data describing defined characteristics of materials in products, which give them value for recovery, recycling and re-use.

The core idea behind the concept is that a material passport will contribute to a more "[[circular economy]]", in which materials are being recovered, recycled and/or re-used in an open traded material market. The concept of the 'material passport’ is currently being developed by multiple parties in mainly European countries. A possible second-hand material market or material-bank could become a reality in the future.

Similar concepts are being developed by several parties. Other names for the material passport are:
* Circularity passport &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circularity Passports|url=http://www.epea.nl/circularity-passports/|website=www.epea.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cradle-to-cradle passport &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cradle to cradle ship recycling|url=http://www.maersk.com/en/hardware/triple-e/the-hard-facts/cradle-to-cradle|website=www.maersk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Product passport &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Product passport for eco-innovation|url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/sustainable-dev/news/eu-group-says-a-product-passport-would-open-doors-to-eco-innovation/|website=EurActiv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Why is a material passport needed? ==
"According to United Nations estimates, construction accounts for some 50 percent of raw material consumption in Europe and 60 percent of waste" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU research project "Buildings as material banks" gets under way: The Cradle to Cradle Material Passport becomes BIM-compatible - Drees &amp; Sommer|url=http://www.dreso.com/en/press/press-releases/detail/aktuell/eu-forschungsprojekt-buildings-as-material-banks-startet-der-cradle-to-cradle-materialpass-wi/|website=www.dreso.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that the earth is a closed system, this situation is objectively untenable. There is an urgent need to go about raw materials in a more intelligent way. A shift in the building sector would greatly benefit a situation towards needing less material, and using material more effectively, e.g. by ensuring a much longer and more useful life cycle.
Proponents of the material passport argue that it is a step towards this direction.

The material passport gives material an identity. By acknowledging that it exists, in a given form in a specific building, it ensures that material receives and keeps a value, e.g. through a possible re-use after the deconstruction of for example a building.

Like a personal passport, the material passport allows the material to ‘travel’, or identifies the most useful future destination after it has served in a building. This could be in another building or in another product altogether. 

By recognizing the individual materials in buildings, new ownership structures could be facilitated, that would enable more functions to be offered as a service. As we now can have lighting as a service, we could have other functions, such as "shelter from elements" as a service, instead of owning a roof.

In general, material passports create incentives for suppliers to produce and developers / managers / renovators to choose healthy, sustainable and circular materials/building products. They fit into a broader and growing movement that aims at developing circular building business models.

== Applicability ==
The material passport can be applied to every product or construction. There are different levels in which a product/construct can be discomposed:
* Product level
* Component level 
* Material level

For a building, a material passport could be a complete description of all products (staircase, window, furnace, …), components (iron beam, glass panel, …), and raw materials (wood, steel, …),that are present in the building. Ideally, this database is created during construction and subsequently continuously kept up to date. In case an existing building does not yet have a material passport, it can be created through various methods (e.g. plan analysis, digital 3D scanning).

A material passport allows the owner of a product/construct to know exactly what it is made of. This is of importance at the end of its useful life, to enable the most effective re-use of the materials. It allows the owner to view a product/construct as a depot, inventory of valuable materials.

Furthermore, the process of creating a material passport also shapes the design of the building. The easier the materials can be extracted and re-used, the better. This will lead to an increase of ‘recoverable’ or ‘reversible’ buildings, buildings that can be dis-assembled as easily as they were assembled.

Another possibility is that a material passport enables the owner to get a better overview of value of the product/construct. Besides the value of the location and of the space, it can now also improve the valuation of the materials used. A higher, or more accurate, valuation of product/construct can be made possible.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
===Advantages===
* By having a material passport, one can anticipate on the deconstruction of the properties and ensure the highest possible usefulness of the materials used after having vacated premises. This is another way of being conscious about the footprint, and limiting our negative impact on the environment.
* A more granular understanding of the construction of a building, might enable novel forms of financing that will support suppliers to provide a service rather than sell a product.
* By reviewing how buildings are valued now, new financing products or financing policies (e.g. higher collateral value)can be developed that better reflect the (financial) value of buildings.
* The recovery of a collateral in case of default might improve through the sale of the parts instead of the building as a whole.

===Disadvantages===
* A passport needs to be kept up to date and maintained throughout a building's life. It is not known yet how work intensive this is, but for it to remain relevant, all changes to the building that happened after the passport was created, need to be logged. Potentially the value of this work will only be apparent at the end of the useful life of a building, which might be several decades away.
* The market for second hand materials is still in its infancy, and currently not able to support the optimal re-use of the materials in a building. Also, much more standardization, at least at the level of components, will be needed to increase the re-use the materials in a building.
* There is no standardization for material passports yet. Passports might therefore prove to have limited usefulness when ultimately needed, due to evolving requirements, or require additional investments during the life of the building to keep them up to market standard.
* Legislation needs to be put in place, to support more sustainable building, enable the development of services instead of ownership, … and support a broad deployment of material passports.
* The infrastructure, mainly IT, to support material passports still needs to be created.
The first scientific publication about a material passport (2012) was written by Maayke Damen and is called "[https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/257741 A resources passport for a circular economy]".  It provides a comprehensive overview of the advantages and disadvantages of a material passport for every actor in the supply chain. It includes an outline for the content of a material passport.

In computing, a '''memory model''' describes the interactions of [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] through [[memory (computing)|memory]] and their shared use of the [[data (computing)|data]].

==History and significance==
A memory model allows a compiler to perform many important optimizations. [[Compiler optimization]]s like [[loop fusion]] move statements in the program, which can influence the order of read and write operations of potentially shared [[variable (programming)|variables]]. Changes in the ordering of reads and writes can cause [[race condition]]s. Without a memory model, a compiler is not allowed to apply such optimizations to multi-threaded programs in general, or only in special cases.

Modern programming languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] therefore implement a memory model. The memory model specifies [[synchronization barrier]]s that are established via special, well-defined synchronization operations such as acquiring a lock by entering a synchronized block or method. The memory model stipulates that changes to the values of shared variables only need to be made visible to other threads when such a synchronization barrier is reached. Moreover, the entire notion of a [[race condition]] is  defined over the order of operations with respect to these memory barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| quote=''The Java Memory Model describes what behaviors are legal in multithreaded code, and how threads may interact through memory. It describes the relationship between variables in a program and the low-level details of storing and retrieving them to and from memory or registers in a real computer system. It does this in a way that can be implemented correctly using a wide variety of hardware and a wide variety of compiler optimizations.''

These semantics then give optimizing compilers a higher degree of freedom when applying optimizations: the compiler needs to make sure '''only''' that the values of (potentially shared) variables at synchronization barriers are guaranteed to be the same in both the optimized and unoptimized code. In particular, reordering statements in a block of code that contains no synchronization barrier is assumed to be safe by the compiler.

Most research in the area of memory models revolves around:

* Designing a memory model that allows a maximal degree of freedom for compiler optimizations while still giving sufficient guarantees about race-free and (perhaps more importantly) race-containing programs.
* Proving program optimizations that are correct with respect to such a memory model.

The [[Java memory model|Java Memory Model]] was the first attempt to provide a comprehensive threading memory model for a popular programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Abeille butinant une fleur 3.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Worker bees forage nectar not only for themselves, but for their whole hive community. Optimal foraging theory predicts that this bee will forage in a way that will maximize its hive's net yield of energy.]]
'''Optimal foraging theory''' ('''OFT''') is a [[behavioral ecology]] model that helps predict how an animal behaves when searching for food.  Although obtaining food provides the animal with energy, searching for and capturing the food require both energy and time.  To maximize fitness, an animal adopts a [[foraging]] strategy that provides the most benefit (energy) for the lowest cost, maximizing the net energy gained.  OFT helps predict the best strategy that an animal can use to achieve this goal.

OFT is an ecological application of the [[optimality model]]. This theory assumes that the most economically advantageous foraging pattern will be selected for in a species through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1940354| jstor = 1940354| title = Optimal Foraging and the Size Selection of Prey by the Bluegill Sunfish (''Lepomis macrochirus'')| journal = Ecology| volume = 55| issue = 5| pages = 1042| year = 1974| last1 = Werner | first1 = E. E. | last2 = Hall | first2 = D. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; When using OFT to model foraging behavior, organisms are said to be maximizing a variable known as the '''currency''', such as the most food per unit time. In addition, the '''constraints''' of the environment are other variables that must be considered. Constraints are defined as factors that can limit the forager's ability to maximize the currency. The '''optimal decision rule''', or the organism's best foraging strategy, is defined as the decision that maximizes the currency under the constraints of the environment.  Identifying the optimal decision rule is the primary goal of the OFT.&lt;ref name=Sinervo&gt;Sinervo, Barry (1997). [http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/~barrylab/classes/CHAPTER_PDFS/Chap_6_Optimal.pdf "Optimal Foraging Theory: Constraints and Cognitive Processes"], pp. 105–130 in ''Behavioral Ecology''. University of California, Santa Cruz.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building an optimal foraging model==
An optimal foraging model generates quantitative predictions of how animals maximize their fitness while they forage.  The model building process involves identifying the currency, constraints, and appropriate decision rule for the forager.&lt;ref name="Sinervo"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens&gt;Stephens, D. W. and Krebs, J. R. (1986) [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/2453.html "Foraging Theory"]. 1st ed. Monographs in Behavior and Ecology. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|9780691084428}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Currency''' is defined as the unit that is optimized by the animal.  It is also a hypothesis of the costs and benefits that are imposed on that animal.&lt;ref name=Krebs&gt;Krebs, J. R. and Davies, N. B. (1989) ''An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology''. 4th ed. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a certain forager gains energy from food, but incurs the cost of searching for the food: the time and energy spent searching could have been used instead on other endeavors, such as finding mates or protecting young.  It would be in the animal's best interest to maximize its benefits at the lowest cost.  Thus, the currency in this situation could be defined as net energy gain per unit time.&lt;ref name="Sinervo"/&gt;  However, for a different forager, the time it takes to digest the food after eating could be a more significant cost than the time and energy spent looking for food. In this case, the currency could be defined as net energy gain per digestive [[turnover time]] instead of net energy gain per unit time.&lt;ref name=Verlinden&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02270727| title = The constraints of digestive rate: An alternative model of diet selection| journal = Evolutionary Ecology| volume = 3| issue = 3| pages = 264| year = 1989| last1 = Verlinden | first1 = C. | last2 = Wiley | first2 = R. H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, benefits and costs can depend on a forager's community.  For example, a forager living in a hive would most likely forage in a manner that would maximize efficiency for its colony rather than itself.&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt; By identifying the currency, one can construct a hypothesis about which benefits and costs are important to the forager in question.

'''Constraints''' are hypotheses about the limitations that are placed on an animal.&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt; These limitations can be due to features of the environment or the physiology of the animal and could limit their foraging efficiency.  The time that it takes for the forager to travel from the nesting site to the foraging site is an example of a constraint.  The maximum number of food items a forager is able to carry back to its nesting site is another example of a constraint.  There could also be cognitive constraints on animals, such as limits to learning and memory.&lt;ref name="Sinervo"/&gt; The more constraints that one is able to identify in a given system, the more predictive power the model will have.&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt;  
[[File:SDY1.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 1. Energy gain per cost (E) for adopting foraging strategy x.  Adapted from Parker &amp; Smith.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/348027a0| title = Optimality theory in evolutionary biology| journal = Nature| volume = 348| issue = 6296| pages = 27| year = 1990| last1 = Parker | first1 = G. A.| last2 = Smith | first2 = J. M. | bibcode = 1990Natur.348...27P}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Given the hypotheses about the currency and the constraints, the '''optimal decision rule''' is the model's prediction of what the animal's best foraging strategy should be.&lt;ref name="Sinervo"/&gt; Possible examples of optimal decision rules could be the optimal number of food items that an animal should carry back to its nesting site or the optimal size of a food item that an animal should feed on.  Figure 1, shows an example of how an optimal decision rule could be determined from a graphical model.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; The curve represents the energy gain per cost (E) for adopting foraging strategy x.  Energy gain per cost is the currency being optimized.  The constraints of the system determine the shape of this curve. The optimal decision rule (x*) is the strategy for which the currency, energy gain per costs, is the greatest.  Optimal foraging models can look very different and become very complex, depending on the nature of the currency and the number of constraints considered.  However, the general principles of currency, constraints, and optimal decision rule remain the same for all models.

To test a model, one can compare the predicted strategy to the animal's actual foraging behavior.  If the model fits the observed data well, then the hypotheses about the currency and constraints are supported.  If the model doesn't fit the data well, then it is possible that either the currency or a particular constraint has been incorrectly identified.&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt;

==Different feeding systems and classes of predators==
Optimal foraging theory is widely applicable to feeding systems throughout the animal kingdom. Under the OFT, ''any'' organism of interest can be viewed as a predator that forages prey.  There are different classes of predators that organisms fall into and each class has distinct foraging and [[predation]] strategies.

* '''True predators''' attack large numbers of prey throughout their life. They kill their prey either immediately or shortly after the attack. They may eat all or only part of their prey. True predators include tigers, lions, whales, [[shark]]s, seed-eating birds, [[ant]]s, and [[humans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1445836| jstor = 1445836| title = Diet, Feeding Habits and Estimates of Daily Ration of Young Lemon Sharks, ''Negaprion brevirostris'' (Poey)| journal = Copeia| volume = 1990| pages = 204| year = 1990| last1 = Cortés | first1 = E. | last2 = Gruber | first2 = S. H. | last3 = Cortes | first3 = E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Grazing|Grazers]]''' eat only a portion of their prey. They harm the prey, but rarely kill it. Grazers include [[antelope]], cattle, and [[mosquitoe]]s.
* '''[[Parasitism|Parasites]]''', like grazers, eat only a part of their prey (host), but rarely the entire organism.  They spend all or large portions of their life cycle living in/on a single host. This intimate relationship is typical of [[tapeworm]]s, [[liver fluke]]s, and plant parasites, such as the [[potato blight]].
* '''[[Parasitoid]]s''' are mainly typical of [[Parasitoid wasp|wasps]] (order ''Hymenoptera''), and some flies (order ''Diptera''). Eggs are laid inside the larvae of other [[arthropod]]s which hatch and consume the host from the inside, killing it. This unusual predator–host relationship is typical of about 10% of all insects.&lt;ref&gt;Godfray, H. C. J. (1994) ''Parasitoids: Behavioral and Evolutionary Ecology''. Princeton University Press, Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt; Many viruses that attack single-celled organisms (such as [[bacteriophage]]s) are also parasitoids; they reproduce inside a single host that is inevitably killed by the association.

The optimization of these different foraging and predation strategies can be explained by the optimal foraging theory.  In each case, there are costs, benefits, and limitations that ultimately determine the optimal decision rule that the predator should follow.

==The optimal diet model==
One classical version of the optimal foraging theory is the '''optimal diet model''', which is also known as the prey choice model or the contingency model.  In this model, the predator encounters different prey items and decides whether to eat what it has or search for a more profitable prey item.  The model predicts that foragers should ignore low profitability prey items when more profitable items are present and abundant.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, D.W., Brown, J.S., and Ydenberg, R.C. (2007). ''Foraging: Behavior and Ecology''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The profitability of a prey item is dependent on several ecological variables.  '''E''' is the amount of energy (calories) that a prey item provides the predator. Handling time ('''h''') is the amount of time it takes the predator to handle the food, beginning from the time the predator finds the prey item to the time the prey item is eaten.  The profitability of a prey item is then defined as '''E/h'''.  Additionally, search time ('''S''') is the amount of time it takes the predator to find a prey item and is dependent on the abundance of the food and the ease of locating it.&lt;ref name="Sinervo"/&gt;  In this model, the currency is energy intake per unit time and the constraints include the actual values of '''E''', '''h''', and '''S''', as well as the fact that prey items are encountered sequentially.

===Model of choice between big and small prey===

Using these variables, the optimal diet model can predict how predators choose between two prey types: big '''prey&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' with energy value '''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and handling time '''h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', and small '''prey&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' with energy value '''E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' and handling time '''h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''. In order to maximize its overall rate of energy gain, a predator must consider the profitability of the two prey types. If it is assumed that big prey&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is more profitable than small prey&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then '''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''. Thus, if the predator encounters prey&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, it should always choose to eat it, because of its higher profitability. It should never bother to go searching for prey&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, if the animal encounters prey&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it should reject it to look for a more profitable prey&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''unless'' the time it would take to find prey&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is too long and costly for it to be worth it. Thus, the animal should only eat prey&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if '''E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/(h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''', where '''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the search time for prey&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Since it is always favorable to choose to eat prey&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the choice to eat prey&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is not dependent on the abundance of prey&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. But since the length of '''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' (i.e. how difficult it is to find prey1) is logically dependent on the density of prey&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the choice to eat prey&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''is'' dependent on the abundance of prey&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt;

===Generalist and specialist diets===

The optimal diet model also predicts that different types of animals should adopt different diets based on variations in search time.  This idea is an extension of the model of prey choice that was discussed above.  The equation, '''E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/(h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''', can be rearranged to give: '''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; [(E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] – h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''.  This rearranged form gives the threshold for how long '''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' must be for an animal to choose to eat both prey&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and prey&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt; Animals that have '''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''''s that reach the threshold are defined as [[Generalist and specialist species|generalists]].  In nature, generalists include a wide range of prey items in their diet.&lt;ref name=Pulliam&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2459736|author=Pulliam, H. Ronald|title=On the theory of optimal diets|journal= American Naturalist |year=1974|pages= 59–74|volume=108|issue=959|doi=10.1086/282885}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a generalist is a mouse, which consumes a large variety of seeds, grains, and nuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1939870| jstor = 1939870| title = Demography of a Habitat Generalist, the White-Footed Mouse, in a Heterogeneous Environment| journal = Ecology| volume = 68| issue = 6| pages = 1785| year = 1987| last1 = Adler | first1 = G. H. | last2 = Wilson | first2 = M. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, predators with relatively short '''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''''s are still better off choosing to only eat prey&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. These types of animals are defined as [[Generalist and specialist species|specialists]] and have very exclusive diets in nature.&lt;ref name="Pulliam"/&gt; An example of a specialist is the [[koala]], which solely consumes [[eucalyptus]] leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/icb/icp051| title = Revisiting the dietary niche: When is a mammalian herbivore a specialist?| journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology| volume = 49| issue = 3| pages = 274| year = 2009| last1 = Shipley | first1 = L. A.| last2 = Forbey | first2 = J. S.| last3 = Moore | first3 = B. D. | pmid=21665820}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, different animals across the four functional classes of predators exhibit strategies ranging across a continuum between being a generalist and a specialist. Additionally, since the choice to eat prey2 is dependent on the abundance of prey1 (as discussed earlier), if prey1 becomes so scarce that S1 reaches the threshold, then the animal should switch from exclusively eating prey1 to eating both prey1 and prey2.&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt; In other words, if the food within a specialist's diet becomes very scarce, a specialist can sometimes switch to being a generalist.

===Functional response curves===

As previously mentioned, the amount of time it takes to search for a prey item depends on the density of the prey.  [[Functional response|Functional response curves]] show the rate of prey capture as a function of food density and can be used in conjunction with the optimal diet theory to predict foraging behavior of predators.  There are three different types of functional response curves.&lt;ref name=Staddon&gt;Staddon, J.E.R. "Foraging and Behavioral Ecology." Adaptive Behavior and Learning. First Edition ed. Cambridge UP, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:SDY2.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Figure 2. Three types of functional response curves. Adapted from Staddon.&lt;ref name="Staddon"/&gt;]]
For a '''Type I''' functional response curve, the rate of prey capture increases linearly with food density. At low prey densities, the search time is long. Since the predator spends most of its time searching, it eats every prey item it finds.  As prey density increases, the predator is able to capture the prey faster and faster.  At a certain point, the rate of prey capture is so high, that the predator doesn't have to eat every prey item it encounters.  After this point, the predator should only choose the prey items with the highest E/h.&lt;ref name=Jeschke&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1890/0012-9615(2002)072[0095:PFRDBH]2.0.CO;2| title = Predator Functional Responses: Discriminating Between Handling and Digesting Prey| journal = Ecological Monographs| volume = 72| pages = 95| year = 2002| last1 = Jeschke | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Kopp | first2 = M. | last3 = Tollrian | first3 = R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a '''Type II''' functional response curve, the rate of prey capture negatively accelerates as it increases with food density.&lt;ref name="Staddon"/&gt; This is because it assumes that the predator is limited by its capacity to process food.  In other words, as the food density increases, handling time increases. At the beginning of the curve, rate of prey capture increases nearly linearly with prey density and there is almost no handling time.  As prey density increases, the predator spends less and less time searching for prey and more and more time handling the prey. The rate of prey capture increases less and less, until it finally plateaus.  The high number of prey basically "swamps" the predator.&lt;ref name="Jeschke"/&gt;

A '''Type III''' functional response curve is a [[sigmoid curve]].  The rate of prey capture increases at first with prey density at a positively accelerated rate, but then at high densities changes to the negatively accelerated form, similar to that of the Type II curve.&lt;ref name="Staddon"/&gt; At high prey densities (the top of the curve), each new prey item is caught almost immediately. The predator is able to be choosy and doesn't eat every item it finds.  So, assuming that there are two prey types with different profitabilities that are both at high abundance, the predator will choose the item with the higher '''E/h'''.  However, at low prey densities (the bottom of the curve) the rate of prey capture increases faster than linearly. This means that as the predator feeds and the prey type with the higher '''E/h''' becomes less abundant, the predator will start to switch its preference to the prey type with the lower '''E/h''', because that type will be relatively more abundant.  This phenomenon is known as [[prey switching]].&lt;ref name="Staddon"/&gt;

===Predator–prey interaction===

Predator–prey [[coevolution]] often makes it unfavorable for a predator to consume certain prey items, since many anti-predator defenses increase handling time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boulding | first1 = Elizabeth Grace | year = 1984 | title = Crab-resistant features of shells of burrowing bivalves: decreasing vulnerability by increasing handling time | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology | volume = 76 | issue = 3| pages = 201–223 | doi=10.1016/0022-0981(84)90189-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[porcupine]] quills, the palatability and digestibility of the [[poison dart frog]], [[crypsis]], and other predator avoidance behaviors.  In addition, because toxins may be present in many prey types, predators include a lot of variability in their diets to prevent any one toxin from reaching dangerous levels. Thus, it is possible that an approach focusing only on energy intake may not fully explain an animal's foraging behavior in these situations.

==The marginal value theorem and optimal foraging==
[[File:Marginalvaluetheorem.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Figure 3. Marginal value theorem shown graphically.]]
The '''[[marginal value theorem]]''' is a type of optimality model that is often applied to optimal foraging. This theorem is used to describe a situation in which an organism searching for food in a patch must decide when it is economically favorable to leave. While the animal is within a patch, it experiences the [[law of diminishing returns]], where it becomes harder and harder to find prey as time goes on. This may be because the prey is being depleted, the prey begins to take evasive action and becomes harder to catch, or the predator starts crossing its own path more as it searches.&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt; This law of diminishing returns can be shown as a curve of energy gain per time spent in a patch (Figure 3). The curve starts off with a steep slope and gradually levels off as prey becomes harder to find. Another important cost to consider is the traveling time between different patches and the nesting site. An animal loses foraging time while it travels and expends energy through its locomotion.&lt;ref name="Sinervo"/&gt;

In this model, the currency being optimized is usually net energy gain per unit time.  The constraints are the travel time and the shape of the curve of diminishing returns. Graphically, the currency (net energy gain per unit time) is given by the slope of a diagonal line that starts at the beginning of traveling time and intersects the curve of diminishing returns (Figure 3).  In order to maximize the currency, one wants the line with the greatest slope that still touches the curve (the tangent line). The place that this line touches the curve provides the optimal decision rule of the amount of time that the animal should spend in a patch before leaving.

==Examples of optimal foraging models in animals==

M. | last2 = Ervynck | first2 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Optimal foraging of oystercatchers===

[[Oystercatcher]] [[mussel]] feeding provides an example of how the optimal diet model can be utilized.  Oystercatchers forage on mussels and crack them open with their bills. The constraints on these birds are the characteristics of the different mussel sizes. While large mussels provide more energy than small mussels, large mussels are harder to crack open due to their thicker shells. This means that while large mussels have a higher energy content ('''E'''), they also have a longer handling time ('''h'''). The profitability of any mussel is calculated as '''E/h'''.  The oystercatchers must decide which mussel size will provide enough nutrition to outweigh the cost and energy required to open it.&lt;ref name="Sinervo"/&gt; In their study, Meire and Ervynck tried to model this decision by graphing the relative profitabilities of different sized mussels. They came up with a bell-shaped curve, indicating that moderately sized mussels were the most profitable. However, they observed that if an oystercatcher rejected too many small mussels, the time it took to search for the next suitable mussel greatly increased. This observation shifted their bell-curve to the right (Figure 4).  However, while this model predicted that oystercatchers should prefer mussels of 50–55&amp;nbsp;mm, the observed data showed that oystercatchers actually prefer mussels of 30–45&amp;nbsp;mm. Meire and Ervynk then realized the preference of mussel size did not only depend on the profitability of the prey, but also on the prey density. After this was accounted for, they found a good agreement between the model's prediction and the observed data.&lt;ref name="Meire"/&gt;

===Optimal foraging in starlings===

[[File:SDY3.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Figure 5. If starlings are maximizing net rate of energy gain, longer traveling time results in larger optimum load. Adapted from Krebs and Davies.&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt;]]
The foraging behavior of the [[European starling]], ''Sturnus vulgaris'', provides an example of how marginal value theorem is used to model optimal foraging.  Starlings leave their nests and travel to food patches in search for larval [[Crane fly|leatherjacket]]s to bring back to their young. The starlings must determine the optimal number of prey items to take back in one trip (i.e. the optimal load size). While the starlings forage within a patch, they experience diminishing returns: the starling is only able to hold so many leatherjackets in their bill, so the speed with which the parent picks up larvae decreases with the number of larvae that it already has in its bill. Thus, the constraints are the shape of the curve of diminishing returns and the travel time (the time it takes to make a round trip from the nest to a patch and back). In addition, the currency is hypothesized to be net energy gain per unit time.&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt; Using this currency and the constraints, the optimal load can be predicted by drawing a line tangent to the curve of diminishing returns, as discussed previously (Figure 3).

Kacelnik et al. wanted to determine if this species does indeed optimize net energy gain per unit time as hypothesized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/4357| jstor = 4357| title = Central Place Foraging in Starlings (''Sturnus vulgaris''). I. Patch Residence Time| journal = The Journal of Animal Ecology| volume = 53| pages = 283| year = 1984| last1 = Kacelnik | first1 = A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; They designed an experiment in which the starlings were trained to collect [[mealworm]]s from an artificial feeder at different distances from the nest. The researchers artificially generated a fixed curve of diminishing returns for the birds by dropping mealworms at successively longer and longer intervals. The birds continued to collect mealworms as they were presented, until they reached an "optimal" load and flew home. As Figure 5 shows, if the starlings were maximizing net energy gain per unit time, a short travel time would predict a small optimal load and a long travel time would predict a larger optimal load. In agreement with these predictions, Kacelnik found that the longer the distance between the nest and the artificial feeder, the larger the load size. In addition, the observed load sizes quantitatively corresponded very closely to the model's predictions. Other models based on different currencies, such as energy gained per energy spent (i.e. energy efficiency), failed to predict the observed load sizes as accurately.  Thus, Kacelnik concluded that starlings maximize net energy gain per unit time. This conclusion was not disproved in later experiments.&lt;ref name = Bautista1998&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/286189 | title=Optimal foraging and beyond: how starlings cope with changes in food availability | journal = The American Naturalist | volume=152 | pages=221–238 | year=1998 | last1 = Bautista  |first1 = L.M. | last2 = Tinbergen | first2 = J.M. | last3 = Wiersma | first3 = P. | last4 = Kacelnik | first4 = A. |jstor=10.1086/286189 |PMID=18811363| url=https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/45100/1/Bautista%20AmNat152%20p543%201998.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bautista2001&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.1089 |title=To walk or to fly?

===Optimal foraging in bees===

[[Worker bee]]s provide another example of the use of marginal value theorem in modeling optimal foraging behavior. Bees forage from flower to flower collecting nectar to carry back to the hive. While this situation is similar to that of the starlings, both the constraints and currency are actually different for the bees.

A bee does not experience diminishing returns because of nectar depletion or any other characteristic of the flowers themselves. The total amount of nectar foraged increases linearly with time spent in a patch. However, the weight of the nectar adds a significant cost to the bee's flight between flowers and its trip back to the hive. Wolf and Schmid-Hempel showed, by experimentally placing varying weights on the backs of bees, that the cost of heavy nectar is so great that it shortens the bees' lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/5134| jstor = 5134| title = Extra Loads and Foraging Life Span in Honeybee Workers| journal = The Journal of Animal Ecology| volume = 58| issue = 3| pages = 943| year = 1989| last1 = Wolf | first1 = T. J. | last2 = Schmid-Hempel | first2 = P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shorter the lifespan of a worker bee, the less overall time it has to contribute to its colony. Thus, there is a curve of diminishing returns for the net yield of energy that the hive receives as the bee gathers more nectar during one trip.&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt;

The cost of heavy nectar also impacts the currency used by the bees. Unlike the starlings in the previous example, bees maximize energy efficiency (energy gained per energy spent) rather than net rate of energy gain (net energy gained per time). This is because the optimal load predicted by maximizing net rate of energy gain is too heavy for the bees and shortens their lifespan, decreasing their overall productivity for the hive, as explained earlier. By maximizing energy efficiency, the bees are able to avoid expending too much energy per trip and are able to live long enough to maximize their lifetime productivity for their hive.&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt; In a different paper, Schmid-Hempel showed that the observed relationship between load size and flight time is well correlated with the predictions based on maximizing energy efficiency, but very poorly correlated with the predictions based on maximizing net rate of energy gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00299430| title = Honeybees maximize efficiency by not filling their crop| journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology| volume = 17| pages = 61| year = 1985| last1 = Schmid-Hempel | first1 = P. | last2 = Kacelnik | first2 = A. | last3 = Houston | first3 = A. I. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optimal foraging in Centrarchid Fishes===

The nature of prey selection by two centrarchids (white crappie and bluegill) has been presented as a model incorporating optimal foraging strategies by Manatunge &amp; Asaeda .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/a:1003519402917|last1=Manatunge|first1=Jagath|last2=Asaeda|first2=Takashi|title=Optimal foraging as the criteria of prey selection by two centrarchid fishes|journal=Hydrobiologia|date=1998|volume=391|issue=1|pages=221–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visual field of the foraging fish as represented by the reactive distance was  analysed in detail to estimate the number of prey encounters per search bout. The predicted reactive distances were compared with experimental data. The energetic cost associated with fish foraging behaviour was calculated based on the sequence of events that takes place for each prey consumed. Comparisons of the relative abundance of prey species and size categories in the stomach to the lake environment indicated that both white crappie and bluegill (length &lt; 100&amp;nbsp;mm) strongly select prey utilizing an energy optimization strategy. In most cases, the fish exclusively selected large Daphnia ignoring evasive prey types (Cyclops, Diaptomids) and small cladocera. This selectivity is the result of fish actively avoiding prey with high evasion capabilities even though they appear to be high in energetic content and having translated this into optimal selectivity through capture success rates. The energy consideration and visual system, apart from the forager's ability to capture prey, are the major determinants of prey selectivity for large-sized bluegill and white crappie still at planktivorous stages.

==Criticism and limitations of the optimal foraging theory==
Although many studies, such as the ones cited in the examples above, provide quantitative support for optimal foraging theory and demonstrate its usefulness, the model has received criticism regarding its validity and limitations.

First, optimal foraging theory relies on the assumption that natural selection will optimize foraging strategies of organisms. However, natural selection is not an all-powerful force that produces perfect designs, but rather a passive process of selection for genetically-based traits that increase organisms' [[reproductive success]]. Given that [[genetics]] involves interactions between [[Locus (genetics)|loci]], [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], and other complexities, there is no guarantee that natural selection can optimize a specific behavioral parameter.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;Gray, Russell D. "Faith and Foraging: A Critique of the "Paradigm Argument from Design"" p. 198 in ''Foraging Behavior''. Ed. Alan C. Kamil, John R. Krebs, and H. Robald Pulliam. New York, N.Y.: Plenum&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, OFT also assumes that foraging behaviors are able to be freely shaped by natural selection, because these behaviors are independent from other activities of the organism.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt; However, given that organisms are integrated systems, rather than mechanical aggregates of parts, this is not always the case. For example, the need to avoid predators may constrain foragers to feed less than the optimal rate. Thus, an organism's foraging behaviors may not be optimized as OFT would predict, because they are not independent from other behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pierce, G. J.|author2=Ollason, J. G. |title=Eight reasons why optimal foraging theory is a complete waste of time|journal= Oikos |year=1987|pages=111–118|volume=49|jstor=3565560|url=http://math.arizona.edu/~jwatkins/ollason.pdf|doi=10.2307/3565560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another limitation of OFT is that it lacks precision in practice. In theory, an optimal foraging model gives researchers specific, quantitative predictions about a predator's optimal decision rule based on the hypotheses about the currency and constraints of the system. However, in reality, it is difficult to define basic concepts like prey type, encounter rates, or even a patch as the forager perceives them.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt; Thus, while the variables of OFT can seem consistent theoretically, in practice, they can be arbitrary and difficult to measure.

Furthermore, although the premise of OFT is to maximize an organism's fitness, many studies only show correlations between observed and predicted foraging behavior and stop short of testing whether the animal's behavior actually increases its reproductive fitness. It is possible that in certain cases, there is no correlation between foraging returns and reproductive success at all.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt; Without accounting for this possibility, many studies using the OFT remain incomplete and fail to address and test the main point of the theory.  
 
One of the most imperative critiques of OFT is that it may not be truly testable. This issue arises whenever there is a discrepancy between the model's predictions and the actual observations. It is difficult to tell whether the model is fundamentally wrong or whether a specific variable has been inaccurately identified or left out. Because it is possible to add endless plausible modifications to the model, the model of optimality may never be rejected.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt; This creates the problem of researchers shaping their model to fit their observations, rather than rigorously testing their hypotheses about the animal's foraging behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18043">The exploration of [[politics]] in [[science fiction]] is arguably older than the identification of the [[genre]].  One of the earliest works of modern science fiction, [[H. G. Wells]]’ ''[[The Time Machine]]'', is an extrapolation of the class structure of the [[United Kingdom]] of his time, an extreme form of [[Social Darwinism]]; during tens of thousands of years, human beings have [[evolution|evolved]] into two different species based on their social class.

==Speculative societies==
Most story and novel-length works of science fiction include speculation (directly or indirectly) on modes of life and [[behaviour]]. They are sometimes [[Allegory|allegorical]] and often serious attempts to model possible future societies, political institutions and systems. Examples include [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison's]] novel ''[[Make Room! Make Room!]]'', ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]; and the [[Hostile Takeover Trilogy|''Hostile Takeover'' Trilogy]] by [[S. Andrew Swann]]. 
Imagined societies may be based on very different assumptions. Often the future is modeled on historic forms - feudalism,  or in the case of The Foundation series, the Roman Empire.  A common theme is the integration of humanity into some greater interstellar society. A popular modern example is the [[Uplift series|''Uplift'' series]] by David Brin where a species' status is defined based on the concept of [[biological uplift|biologically uplifting]] other species.

==Utopian societies==
{{main|Utopia}}
The term Utopia was invented by [[Thomas More]] as the title of his Latin book ''[[De Optimo Reipublicae Statu deque Nova Insula Utopia]]'' (circa 1516), known more commonly as Utopia. He created the word "utopia" to suggest two Greek neologisms simultaneously: outopia (no place) and eutopia (good place). More depicts a rationally organised society, through the narration of an explorer who discovers it—Raphael Hythlodaeus. Utopia is a republic where all property is held in common. In addition, it has few laws, no lawyers and rarely sends its citizens to war, but hires mercenaries from among its war-prone neighbours.

Generally speaking, utopias are generally societies whose author believes either perfect, or as perfect as can be attainable.  [[Ernest Callenbach]]'s ''[[Ecotopia]]'' is a contemporary example.  This can cause some confusion, in that some works generally recognized as “utopian”, such as [[Republic (Plato)|Plato’s ''Republic'']], can come across as much less than ideal to a modern reader.  They are one of the smaller subsets of political science fiction, possibly because it is difficult to create dramatic tension in a world the author believes is perfect.  Various authors get around this problem by postulating problems in the utopian society, such [[L. Neil Smith]] does.  Other ways of presenting a utopian society in science fiction, is to send characters outside it to explore beyond its confines (ala ''[[Star Trek]]''), or focus on an outsider character entering the society, as in [[Aldous Huxley]]’s ''[[Brave New World]]''.  This last method is often used to show that the utopian society shown is actually a [[dystopia]].  [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s approach in ''The [[Mars Trilogy]]'' involved exploring the creation of utopian and [[ecotopia]]n societies on Mars.

Another option for a Utopian society can be found in [[robotocracy]], or the rule of Robots or Computers, with the theory that a programmed machine can dispassionately provide for the welfare of all.  Examples of this include various works of [[Isaac Asimov]] and the planet of Sigma Draconis VI in the Star Trek episode "[[Spock's Brain (TOS episode)|Spock's Brain]]".  If the machine rule becomes harsh or oppressive, it may become a dystopia instead.

==Dystopian societies==
{{main|Dystopia}}
Dystopias are societies where the author illustrates the worst that can happen.  Usually this encompasses extrapolating trends the author sees as dangerous. During the 20th century many examples were written in reaction to the rise of [[Nazism]], [[Communism]] and [[Religious Fundamentalism]]:

*''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]] which illustrates the ultimate [[totalitarian]] state in which the government is in control of every aspect of human existence, using [[propaganda]], universal [[surveillance]], and [[torture]].
*''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]] was written after the war in response to [[Fascism]]. It is set in a world where the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] forces have won [[World War II]] and are rival [[superpower]]s. In it the main characters argue and are involved in politics and power.
*''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' by [[Margaret Atwood]] tells the tale of a woman caught up in a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] [[dictatorship]] where women are forced into a system of sexual [[slavery]] for the ruling [[patriarchy]].

It is important to keep in mind that scenarios which some would describe as dystopic, others would describe as utopian. [[Norman Spinrad|Norman Spinrad's]] novel'' [[The Iron Dream]]'' was generally recognised to be a dystopic novel, but lauded by neo-Nazis as a utopia.

==Politics==
Often the political focus of a science fiction novel is less on the social order, but how people maneuver and achieve their agendas within a given system. Many [[space opera]]s rely on vast interstellar bureaucracies to drive their plots ''(see: [[Galactic empire]])''. [[George Lucas]]'s famous ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga [[Star Wars#Themes|features political science]] modeled after historic events. The Retief stories by [[Keith Laumer]] and the [[The Chanur Novels|Chanur books]] by [[C. J. Cherryh]] have politics and political maneuverings as some of the main themes, and [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' books offer advanced explorations of human politics, including the dovetailing economics. Often this focus can descend into [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] and [[paranoia]] where the premise is that there are secret forces out to get the protagonists, the seminal example of which is the ''[[Illuminatus! Trilogy]]''. Most commonly, science fiction deals with the political fallout of its own premises.  A story will posit some new event or technology and explore its political dimensions; this includes most [[techno-thriller]]s but also encompasses a large body of traditional science fiction. An example is the [[Philip K. Dick]] story ''[[The Minority Report]]'' (upon which the [[Minority Report (film)|film]] starring [[Tom Cruise]] is based), which introduces the idea of perfectly predicting a crime of violence so the perpetrator can be arrested before the crime is committed, and the political and legal ramifications of actually using such a system.

[[File:Iron powder.JPG|thumb|[[Iron powder]] is commonly used for [[sintering]]]]
'''Powder metallurgy''' ('''PM''') is a term covering a wide range of ways in which materials or components are made from [[metal powders]]. PM processes can avoid, or greatly reduce, the need to use [[subtractive manufacturing|metal removal processes]], thereby drastically reducing yield losses in manufacture and often resulting in lower costs.

Powder metallurgy is also used to make unique materials impossible to get from melting or forming in other ways. A very important product of this type is [[tungsten carbide]] (WC). WC is used to cut and form other metals and is made from WC particles bonded with cobalt. It is very widely used in industry for tools of many types and globally ~50,000t/yr is made by PM. Other products include [[Sintering|sinter]]ed filters, porous oil-impregnated bearings, electrical contacts and diamond tools.

Since the advent of industrial production–scale metal powder–based [[additive manufacturing]] (AM) in the 2010s, [[selective laser sintering]] and other metal AM processes are a new category of commercially important powder metallurgy applications.

==Overview==
The powder metallurgy press and [[sintering|sinter]] process generally consists of three basic steps: powder blending (pulverisation), die compaction, and sintering. Compaction is generally performed at room temperature, and the elevated-temperature process of sintering is usually conducted at atmospheric pressure and under carefully controlled atmosphere composition. Optional secondary processing such as [[Coining (metalworking)|coining]] or [[heat treatment]] often follows to obtain special properties or enhanced precision.&lt;ref&gt;DeGarmo, p. 461&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the older such methods, and still one used to make around 1Mt/yr of structural components of iron-based alloys, is the process of blending fine (&lt;180 microns) metal (normally iron) powders with additives such as a lubricant wax, [[carbon]], [[copper]], and/or [[nickel]], pressing them into a die of the desired shape, and then heating the compressed material ("green part") in a controlled atmosphere to bond the material by sintering. This produces precise parts, normally very close to the die dimensions, but with 5-15% porosity, and thus sub-wrought steel properties.  There are several other PM processes which have been developed over the last fifty years. These include:
* Powder forging. A "preform" made by the conventional "press and sinter" method is heated and then [[forging|hot forged]] to full density, resulting in practically as-wrought properties.
* Hot isostatic pressing (HIP). Here the powder (normally gas atomized, spherical type) is filled into a mould, normally consisting of a metallic "can" of suitable shape. The can is vibrated, then evacuated and sealed.  It is then placed in a hot isostatic press, where it is heated to a [[homologous temperature]] of around 0.7, and subjected to an external gas pressure of ~100MPa (1000bar, 15,000psi) for 10-100minutes. This results in a shaped part of full density with as-wrought or better, properties. HIP was invented in the 1950-60s and entered tonnage production in the 1970-80s.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for physical properties of products |date=November 2016}} In 2015, it was used to produce ~25,000t/yr of stainless and tool steels, as well as important parts of superalloys for jet engines.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for tonnage produced in 2015 |date=November 2016}} 
* Metal injection moulding (MIM).  Here the powder, normally very fine (&lt;25microns) and spherical, is mixed with plastic or wax binder to near the maximum solid loading, typically around 65vol%, and injection moulded to form a "green" part of complex geometry. This part is then heated or otherwise treated to remove the binder (debinding) to give a "brown" part. This part is then sintered, and shrinks by ~18% to give a complex and 97-99% dense finished part. Invented in the 1970s, production has increased since 2000 with an estimated global volume in 2014 of 12,000t worth €1265millions.&lt;ref&gt;EPMA PM data 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* Electric current assisted sintering (ECAS) technologies rely on electric currents to densify powders, with the advantage of reducing production time dramatically (from 15 minutes of the slowest ECAS to a few microseconds of the fastest), not requiring a long furnace heat and allowing near theoretical densities but with the drawback of simple shapes. Powders employed in ECAS can avoid binders thanks to the possibility of direct sintering, without the need of pre-pressing and a green compact. Molds are designed for the final part shape since the powders densify while filling the cavity under an applied pressure thus avoiding the problem of shape variations caused by non isotropic sintering and distortions caused by gravity at high temperatures. The most common of these technologies is [[hot pressing]], which has been under use for the production of the [[diamond tool]]s employed in the construction industry. [[Spark plasma sintering]] and [[electro sinter forging]] are two modern, industrial commercial ECAS technologies.
* Additive manufacturing (AM) is a relatively novel family of techniques which use metal powders (among other materials, such as plastics) to make parts by laser sintering or melting. This is a process under rapid development {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, and whether to classify it as a PM process is perhaps uncertain at this stage. Processes include [[3D printing]], [[selective laser sintering]] (SLS), [[selective laser melting]] (SLM), and [[electron beam melting]] (EBM).

==History and capabilities==
The history of powder metallurgy and the art of metal and [[ceramic]] [[sintering]] are intimately related to each other. Sintering involves the production of a hard solid metal or ceramic piece from a starting powder. The ancient Incas made jewelry and other artifacts from precious metal powders, though mass manufacturing of PM products did not begin until the mid- or late- 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;DeGarmo, p. 460. Tweaked to make sense.&lt;/ref&gt; In these early manufacturing operations, iron was extracted by hand from metal sponge following reduction and was then reintroduced as a powder for final melting or sintering.

A much wider range of products can be obtained from powder processes than from direct [[alloy]]ing of fused materials. In melting operations the "[[Gibbs' phase rule|phase rule]]" applies to all pure and combined elements and strictly dictates the distribution of liquid and solid [[phase (matter)|phase]]s which can exist for specific compositions. In addition, whole body melting of starting materials is required for alloying, thus imposing unwelcome chemical, thermal, and containment constraints on manufacturing. Unfortunately, the handling of aluminium/iron powders poses major problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sheasby| first= J. S.| title= Powder Metallurgy of Iron-Aluminum| journal= Intern. J. Powder Metallurgy and Powder Tech.| volume= 15| issue= 4|date=Oct 1979| pages= 301–305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other substances that are especially reactive with atmospheric oxygen, such as [[titanium]], are sinterable in special atmospheres or with temporary coatings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=Makhlouf, M. M.; Mould, A. M.; and Merchant, H. D.| title= Sintering of Chemically Preconditioned Tin Powder| journal= Intern. J. Powder Metallurgy and Powder Tech.| volume=15| issue= 3|date=July 1979| pages= 231–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In powder metallurgy or ceramics it is possible to fabricate components which otherwise would decompose or disintegrate. All considerations of solid-liquid phase changes can be ignored, so powder processes are more flexible than [[casting]], [[extrusion]], or [[forging]] techniques. Controllable characteristics of products prepared using various powder technologies include mechanical, magnetic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Khan| first= M. K.| title= The Importance of Powder Particle Size and Flow Behavior in the Production of P/M Parts for Soft Magnetic Applications| journal= Intern. J. Powder Metallurgy and Powder Tech.| volume= 16| issue= 2|date=April 1980| pages= 123–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other unconventional properties of such materials as porous solids, aggregates, and intermetallic compounds. Competitive characteristics of manufacturing processing (e.g. tool wear, complexity, or vendor options) also may be closely controlled.

==Powder production techniques==
Any fusible material can be atomized. Several techniques have been developed which permit large production rates of powdered particles, often with considerable control over the size ranges of the final grain population. Powders may be prepared by crushing, grinding, chemical reactions, or electrolytic deposition.

Powders of the elements titanium, vanadium, thorium, niobium, tantalum, calcium, and uranium have been produced by high-temperature [[Redox|reduction]] of the corresponding [[nitride]]s and [[carbide]]s. Iron, nickel, uranium, and beryllium submicrometre powders are obtained by reducing metallic [[oxalate]]s and [[formate]]s. Exceedingly fine particles also have been prepared by directing a stream of molten metal through a high-temperature [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] jet or [[flame]],  atomizing the material. Various chemical and flame associated powdering processes are adopted in part to prevent serious degradation of particle surfaces by atmospheric oxygen.

In tonnage terms, the production of iron powders for PM structural part production dwarfs the production of all of the non-ferrous metal powders combined. Virtually all iron powders are produced by one of two processes: the sponge iron process or water atomization.

=== Sponge iron process ===
The longest established of these processes is the sponge iron process, the leading example of a family of processes involving solid state reduction of an oxide. In the process, selected magnetite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) ore is mixed with coke and lime and placed in a silicon carbide retort. The filled retort is then heated in a kiln, where the reduction process leaves an iron “cake” and a slag. In subsequent steps, the retort is emptied, the reduced iron sponge is separated from the slag and is crushed and annealed.

The resultant powder is highly irregular in particle shape, therefore ensuring good “green strength” so that die-pressed compacts can be readily handled prior to sintering, and each particle contains internal pores (hence the term “sponge”) so that the good green strength is available at low compacted density levels.

Sponge iron provides the
feedstock for all iron-based self-lubricating bearings, and still accounts for around 30% of iron powder usage in PM structural parts.

=== Atomization ===
Atomization is accomplished by forcing a molten metal stream through an orifice at moderate pressures. A gas is introduced into the metal stream just before it leaves the nozzle, serving to create turbulence as the entrained gas expands (due to heating) and exits into a large collection volume exterior to the orifice. The collection volume is filled with gas to promote further turbulence of the molten metal jet. Air and powder streams are segregated using gravity or [[cyclonic separation]]. Most atomized powders are annealed, which helps reduce the oxide and carbon content. The water atomized particles are smaller, cleaner, and nonporous and have a greater breadth of size, which allows better compacting. The particles produced through this method are normally of spherical or pear shape. Usually, they also carry a layer of oxide over them.

There are three types of atomization:
* Liquid atomization
* Gas atomization
* Centrifugal atomization

Simple atomization techniques are available in which liquid metal is forced through an orifice at a sufficiently high velocity to ensure turbulent flow. The usual performance index used is the [[Reynolds number]] R = fvd/n, where f = fluid density, v = velocity of the exit stream, d = diameter of the opening, and n = absolute viscosity. At low R the liquid jet oscillates, but at higher velocities the stream becomes turbulent and breaks into droplets. Pumping energy is applied to droplet formation with very low efficiency (on the order of 1%) and control over the size distribution of the metal particles produced is rather poor. Other techniques such as nozzle vibration, nozzle asymmetry, multiple impinging streams, or molten-metal injection into ambient gas are all available to increase atomization efficiency, produce finer grains, and to narrow the particle size distribution. Unfortunately, it is difficult to eject metals through orifices smaller than a few millimeters in diameter, which in practice limits the minimum size of powder grains to approximately 10 μm. Atomization also produces a wide spectrum of particle sizes, necessitating downstream classification by screening and remelting a significant fraction of the grain boundary.

=== Centrifugal disintegration ===
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}
Centrifugal disintegration of molten particles offers one way around these problems. Extensive experience is available with iron, steel, and aluminium. Metal to be powdered is formed into a rod which is introduced into a chamber through a rapidly rotating spindle. Opposite the spindle tip is an electrode from which an arc is established which heats the metal rod. As the tip material fuses, the rapid rod rotation throws off tiny melt droplets which solidify before hitting the chamber walls. A circulating gas sweeps particles from the chamber.  Similar techniques could be employed in space or on the Moon. The chamber wall could be rotated to force new powders into remote collection vessels,&lt;ref name=DeGarmo&gt;{{cite book| last=DeGarmo| first= E. P.| title=Materials and Processes in Manufacturing| edition=5th| publisher= Macmillan| location= New York| year= 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the electrode could be replaced by a solar mirror focused at the end of the rod.

An alternative approach capable of producing a very narrow distribution of grain sizes but with low throughput consists of a rapidly spinning bowl heated to well above the melting point of the material to be powdered. Liquid metal, introduced onto the surface of the basin near the center at flow rates adjusted to permit a thin metal film to skim evenly up the walls and over the edge, breaks into droplets, each approximately the thickness of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Jones| first= W. D.| title= Fundamental Principles of Powder Metallurgy| publisher= Edward Arnold Ltd.| location= London| year= 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other techniques===
Another powder-production technique involves a thin jet of liquid metal intersected by high-speed streams of atomized water which break the jet into drops and cool the powder before it reaches the bottom of the bin. In subsequent operations the powder is dried. This is called water atomization. The advantage of water atomization is that metal solidifies faster than by gas atomization since the heat capacity of water is some magnitudes higher than gases. Since the solidification rate is inversely proportional to the particle size, smaller particles can be made using water atomization. The smaller the particles, the more homogeneous the micro structure will be. Notice that particles will have a more irregular shape and the particle size distribution will be wider. In addition, some surface contamination can occur by oxidation skin formation. Powder can be reduced by some kind of pre-consolidation treatment, such as annealing used for the manufacture of ceramic tools.

==Powder compaction==
[[File:Rhodium powder pressed melted.jpg|thumb|[[Rhodium]] metal: powder, pressed pellet (3*10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; psi), remelted]]
[[Compaction of ceramic powders|Powder compaction]] is the process of compacting metal powder in a die through the application of high pressures. Typically the tools are held in the vertical orientation with the punch tool forming the bottom of the cavity. The powder is then compacted into a shape and then ejected from the die cavity.&lt;ref name="Todd, Robert H. 1994"/&gt; In a number of these applications the parts may require very little additional work for their intended use; making for very cost efficient manufacturing.

The density of the compacted powder increases with the amount of pressure applied. Typical pressures range from 80 psi to 1000 psi (0.5&amp;nbsp;MPa to 7&amp;nbsp;MPa), pressures from 1000 psi to 1,000,000 psi have been obtained. Pressure of 10 tons/in² to 50 tons/in² (150&amp;nbsp;MPa to 700&amp;nbsp;MPa) are commonly used for metal powder compaction. To attain the same compression ratio across a component with more than one level or height, it is necessary to work with multiple lower punches. A cylindrical workpiece is made by single-level tooling. A more complex shape can be made by the common multiple-level tooling.

Production rates of 15 to 30 parts per minute are common.

There are four major classes of tool styles: single-action compaction, used for thin, flat components; opposed double-action with two punch motions, which accommodates thicker components; double-action with floating die; and double action withdrawal die. Double action classes give much better density distribution than single action. Tooling must be designed so that it will withstand the extreme pressure without deforming or bending. Tools must be made from materials that are polished and wear-resistant.

Better workpiece materials can be obtained by repressing and re-sintering.  Here is a table of some of the obtainable properties.

===Die pressing===
The dominant technology for the forming of products from powder materials, in terms of both tonnage quantities and numbers of parts produced, is die pressing. There are mechanical, servo-electrical and hydraulic presses available in the market, whereby the biggest powder throughput is processed by hydraulic presses.
This forming technology involves a production cycle comprising:

# Filling a die cavity with a known volume of the powder feedstock, delivered from a fill shoe. 
# Compaction of the powder within the die with punches to form the compact. Generally, compaction pressure is applied through punches from both ends of the toolset in order to reduce the level of density gradient within the compact. 
# Ejection of the compact from the die, using the lower punch(es) withdrawal from the die.
# Removal of the compact from the upper face of the die using the fill shoe in the fill stage of the next cycle, or an automation system or robot.

This cycle offers a readily automated and high production rate process.

===Design considerations===
Probably the most basic consideration is being able to remove the part from the die after it is pressed, along with avoiding sharp corners in the design. Keeping the maximum surface area below {{convert|20|sqin|m²}} and the height-to-diameter ratio below 7-to-1 is recommended. Along with having walls thicker than {{convert|0.08|in|mm}} and keeping the adjacent wall thickness ratios below 2.5-to-1.

One of the major advantages of this process is its ability to produce complex geometries. Parts with undercuts and threads require a secondary machining operation. Typical part sizes range from {{convert|0.1|sqin|cm2}} to {{convert|20|sqin|cm2}}. in area and from {{convert|0.1|to|4|in|cm}} in length. However, it is possible to produce parts that are less than {{convert|0.1|sqin|cm2}} and larger than {{convert|25|sqin|cm2}}. in area and from a fraction of an inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm) to approximately {{convert|8|in|cm}} in length.

===Isostatic pressing===
In some pressing operations, such as [[hot isostatic pressing]] (HIP) compact formation and sintering occur simultaneously. This procedure, together with explosion-driven compressive techniques, is used extensively in the production of high-temperature and high-strength parts such as turbine disks for jet engines. In most applications of powder metallurgy the compact is hot-pressed, heated to a temperature above which the materials cannot remain work-hardened. Hot pressing lowers the pressures required to reduce porosity and speeds welding and grain deformation processes. It also permits better dimensional control of the product, lessens sensitivity to physical characteristics of starting materials, and allows powder to be compressed to higher densities than with cold pressing, resulting in higher strength. Negative aspects of hot pressing include shorter die life, slower throughput because of powder heating, and the frequent necessity for protective atmospheres during forming and cooling stages.

==Isostatic powder compacting==
Isostatic powder compacting is a mass-conserving shaping process. Fine metal particles are placed into a flexible mould and then high gas or fluid pressure is applied to the mould.  The resulting article is then sintered in a furnace which increases the strength of the part by bonding the metal particles. This manufacturing process produces very little scrap metal and can be used to make many different shapes. The tolerances that this process can achieve are very precise, ranging from +/- 0.008&amp;nbsp;inches (0.2&amp;nbsp;mm) for axial dimensions and +/- 0.020&amp;nbsp;inches (0.5&amp;nbsp;mm) for radial dimensions.  This is the most efficient type of powder compacting (the following subcategories are also from this reference).&lt;ref name="Todd, Robert H. 1994"&gt;Todd, Robert H., Allen, Dell K., Alting, Leo, "Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide", 1st Edition, Industrial Press Inc., New York 1994, {{ISBN|0-8311-3049-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This operation is generally applicable on small production quantities, as it is more costly to run due to its slow operating speed and the need for expendable tooling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pickpm.com/designcenter/isostatic.asp?locarr=2|1|2|2 PICKPM.COM: A Powder Metallurgy Information Resource&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712211507/http://www.pickpm.com/designcenter/isostatic.asp?locarr=2%7C1%7C2%7C2 |date=2016-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compacting pressures range from {{convert|15000|psi|abbr=on|lk=on}} to {{convert|40000|psi|abbr=on}} for most metals and approximately {{convert|2000|psi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10000|psi|abbr=on}} for non-metals.  The density of isostatic compacted parts is 5% to 10% higher than with other powder metallurgy processes.

===Equipment===
There are many types of equipment used in isostatic powder compacting.  There is the mold, which is flexible, a pressure mold that contains the mold, and the machine delivering the pressure.  There are also devices to control the amount of pressure and how long the pressure is held. The machines need to apply pressures from {{convert|15,000|to|40,000|psi|MPa}} for metals.

===Geometrical possibilities===
Typical workpiece sizes range from {{convert|0.25|in|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|0.75|in|2|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|0.5|in|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10|in|0|abbr=on}} long. It is possible to compact workpieces that are between {{convert|0.0625|in|2|abbr=on}} and {{convert|5|in|0|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|0.0625|in|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|40|in|0|abbr=on}} long.

===Tool style===
Isostatic tools are available in three styles, free mold (wet-bag), coarse mold (damp-bag) and fixed mold (dry-bag).  The free mold style is the traditional style of isostatic compaction and is not generally used for high production work. In free mold tooling the mold is removed and filled outside the canister. Damp bag is where the mold is located in the canister, yet filled outside. In fixed mold tooling, the mold is contained within the canister, which facilitates automation of the process.

===Hot isostatic pressing===
{{Main|Hot isostatic pressing}}

Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) compresses and sinters the part simultaneously by applying heat ranging from 900&amp;nbsp;°F (480&amp;nbsp;°C) to 2250&amp;nbsp;°F (1230&amp;nbsp;°C). [[Argon]] gas is the most common gas used in HIP because it is an inert gas, thus prevents chemical reactions during the operation.

===Cold isostatic pressing===
Cold isostatic pressing (CIP) uses fluid as a means of applying pressure to the mold at room temperature. After removal the part still needs to be sintered.
It is helpful in distributing pressure uniformly over the compaction material contained in a rubber bag.

===Design considerations===
Advantages over standard powder compaction are the possibility of thinner walls and larger workpieces. Height to diameter ratio has no limitation. No specific limitations exist in wall thickness variations, [[undercut (manufacturing)|undercuts]], reliefs, threads, and cross holes. No lubricants are need for isostatic powder compaction. The minimum wall thickness is 0.05&amp;nbsp;inches (1.27&amp;nbsp;mm) and the product can have a weight between 40 and 300 pounds (18 and 136&amp;nbsp;kg). There is 25 to 45% shrinkage of the powder after compacting.

==Sintering==
{{Contradicts other|date=February 2010|1=Sintering}}
{{Main|Sintering}}
Solid state sintering is the process of taking metal in the form of a powder and placing it into a mold or die.  Once compacted into the mold the material is placed under a high heat for a long period of time.  Under heat, bonding takes place between the porous aggregate particles and once cooled the powder has bonded to form a solid piece.

Sintering can be considered to proceed in three stages. During the first, neck growth proceeds rapidly but powder particles remain discrete. During the second, most densification occurs, the structure recrystallizes and particles diffuse into each other. During the third, isolated pores tend to become spheroidal and densification continues at a much lower rate. The words "solid state" in solid state sintering simply refer to the state the material is in when it bonds, solid meaning the material was not turned molten to bond together as alloys are formed.&lt;ref&gt;F. Thummler and W. Thomma, "The Sintering Process," Metallurgical Reviews No. 115, June (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

One recently developed technique for high-speed sintering involves passing high electric current through a powder to preferentially heat the [[Asperity (material science)|asperities]]. Most of the energy serves to melt that portion of the compact where migration is desirable for densification; comparatively little energy is absorbed by the bulk materials and forming machinery. Naturally, this technique is not applicable to electrically insulating powders.

To allow efficient stacking of product in the furnace during sintering and prevent parts sticking together, many manufacturers separate ware using [[ceramic powder separator sheet]]s.  These sheets are available in various materials such as alumina, zirconia, and magnesia.  They are also available in fine, medium, and coarse particle sizes. By matching the material and particle size to the wares being sintered, surface damage and contamination can be reduced, while maximizing furnace loading per batch.

==Continuous powder processing==
The phrase "continuous process" should be used only to describe modes of manufacturing which could be extended indefinitely in time. Normally, however, the term refers to processes whose products are much longer in one physical dimension than in the other two. Compression, rolling, and extrusion are the most common examples.

In a simple compression process, powder flows from a bin onto a two-walled channel and is repeatedly compressed vertically by a horizontally stationary punch. After stripping the compress from the conveyor, the compacted mass is introduced into a sintering furnace. An even easier approach is to spray powder onto a moving belt and sinter it without compression. However, good methods for stripping cold-pressed materials from moving belts are hard to find. One alternative that avoids the belt-stripping difficulty altogether is the manufacture of metal sheets using opposed [[hydraulic ram]]s, although weakness lines across the sheet may arise during successive press operations.{{elucidate|date=July 2015}}

Powders can also be rolled to produce sheets.  The powdered metal is fed into a two-high{{elucidate|date=July 2015}} rolling mill, and is compacted into strip form at up to {{convert|100|ft/min|m/s|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Manufacturing Engineering and Technology fifth edition&lt;/ref&gt;  The strip is then sintered and subjected to another rolling and further sintering.  Rolling is commonly used to produce sheet metal for electrical and electronic components, as well as [[coin]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Considerable work also has been done on rolling multiple layers of different materials simultaneously into sheets.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Extrusion processes are of two general types. In one type, the powder is mixed with a binder or [[plasticizer]] at room temperature; in the other, the powder is extruded at elevated temperatures without fortification.{{elucidate|date=July 2015}} Extrusions with binders are used extensively in the preparation of tungsten-carbide composites. Tubes, complex sections, and spiral drill shapes are manufactured in extended lengths and diameters varying from {{convert|0.5|–|300|mm}}. Hard metal wires of {{convert|0.1|mm}} diameter have been drawn from powder stock. At the opposite extreme, large extrusions on a tonnage basis may be feasible.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2018}}
For softer, easier to form metals such as aluminium and copper alloys continuous extrusion may also be performed using processes such as Conform or Continuous Rotary Extrusion. These processes use a rotating wheel with a groove around it's circumference to drive the loose powder through a forming die. Through a combination of high pressure and a complex strain path the powder particles deform, generate a large amount of frictional heat and bond together to form a bulk solid. Theoretically fully continuous operation is possible as long as the powder can be fed into the process.

There appears to be no limitation to the variety of metals and alloys that can be extruded, provided the temperatures and pressures involved are within the capabilities of die materials. Extrusion lengths may range from 3–30&amp;nbsp;m and diameters from 0.2–1&amp;nbsp;m. Modern presses are largely automatic and operate at high speeds (on the order of m/s).

==Shock (dynamic) consolidation==
Shock consolidation, or dynamic consolidation, is an experimental technique of consolidating powders using high pressure shock waves.&lt;ref&gt;T. Vreeland, Jr., P. Kasiraj, Thomas J. Ahrens, and R.B. Schwartz (1983). "Shock Consolidation of Poders--Theory and Experiment. Proc. 1983 Materials Research Society Meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Meyers and S.L. Wang (1988). "An Improved Method for Shock Consolidation of Powders." Acta Metall. Vol. 36 No. 4, pp 925-936.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are commonly produced by impacting the workpiece with an explosively accelerated plate.  Despite being researched for a long time, the technique still has some problems in controlability and uniformity. However, it offers some valuable potential advantages.  As an example, consolidation occurs so rapidly that metastable microstructures may be retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vassiliou | first1 = Marius | last2 = Rhodes | first2 = C. G. | last3 = Mitchell | first3 = M. R. | last4 = Graves | first4 = J. A. | year = 1989 | title = Metastable Microstructure in Dynamically Consolidated g Titanium Aluminide | url = | journal = Scripta Metallurgica | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 1791–1794 | doi=10.1016/0036-9748(89)90362-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electric current assisted sintering==
These techniques employ electric currents to drive or enhance sintering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927796X08000995 |title=Materials Science and Engineering: R: Reports : Consolidation/synthesis of materials by electric current activated/assisted sintering |publisher=ScienceDirect |accessdate=2011-09-30 |doi=10.1016/j.mser.2008.09.003 |volume=63 |issue=4–6 |journal=Materials Science and Engineering: R: Reports |pages=127–287 | last1 = Orrù | first1 = Roberto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a combination of electric currents and mechanical pressure powders sinter more rapidly thereby reducing the sintering time compared to conventional thermal solutions. The techniques can be divided into two main categories: resistance sintering, which incorporates [[spark plasma sintering]] and [[hot pressing]]; and electric discharge sintering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10853-013-7805-8 |title=Journal of Materials ScienceElectric pulse consolidation: an alternative to spark plasma sintering
 |publisher=Springer |accessdate=2014-10-23 |doi=10.1007/s10853-013-7805-8 |volume=49 |journal=Journal of Materials Science |pages=952–985 | last1 = Yurlova | first1 = M. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[capacitor discharge sintering]] or its derivative, [[electro sinter forging]]. Resistance sintering techniques are consolidation methods based on temperature, where heating of the mold and of the powders is accomplished through electric currents, usually with a characteristic processing time of 15 to 30 minutes.  On the other hand, electric discharge sintering methods rely on high-density currents (from 0.1 to 1 kA/mm^2) to directly sinter electrically conductive powders, with a characteristic time between tens of microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds.

==Special products==
Many special products are possible with powder metallurgy technology. A nonexhaustive list includes Al&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;O&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; whiskers coated with very thin oxide layers for improved refraction; iron compacts with Al&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;O&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; coatings for improved high-temperature creep strength; [[light bulb]] filaments made with powder technology; linings for friction brakes; metal glasses for high-strength films and ribbons; [[heat shield]]s for spacecraft reentry into Earth's atmosphere; electrical contacts for handling large current flows; [[magnet]]s; [[microwave]] [[Ferrite core#Ferrites|ferrites]]; filters for gases; and [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s which can be infiltrated with [[lubricant]]s.

Extremely thin films and tiny spheres exhibit high strength. One application of this observation is to coat brittle materials in whisker form with a submicrometre film of much softer metal (e.g. [[cobalt]]-coated tungsten). The surface strain of the thin layer places the harder metal under compression, so that when the entire composite is sintered the rupture strength increases markedly. With this method, strengths on the order of 2.8&amp;nbsp;GPa versus 550&amp;nbsp;MPa have been observed for, respectively, coated (25% cobalt) and uncoated [[tungsten carbide]]s.

==Hazards==
{{expand section|date=July 2015}}
The special materials and processes used in powder metallurgy can pose hazards to life and property. The high [[surface-area-to-volume ratio]] of the powders can increase their [[chemical reactivity]] in biological exposures (for example, inhalation or ingestion), and increases the risk of [[dust explosion]]s. Materials considered relatively benign in bulk can pose special toxicological risks when in a finely divided form.

'''Preferential looking''' is an experimental method in [[developmental psychology]] used to gain insight into the young [[mind]]/[[brain]].  The method as used today was developed by the developmental psychologist [[Robert L. Fantz]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | title = Infant perception and cognition
  | author= Leslie B. Cohen and Cara H. Cashon
  | journal= Handbook of psychology: Developmental psychology
  | volume=6
  | pages=65–89
  | year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General account==
In a preferential looking experiment, an infant is [[habituate]]d to some stimulus or other—a visual display of interacting objects, for example. Then the infant is shown a second stimulus that differs from the first in a specific manner. If the average infant looks longer at the second stimulus, this suggests that the infant can discriminate between the stimuli. This method has been used extensively in [[cognitive science]] and [[developmental psychology]] to assess the character of infant's perceptual systems, and, by extension, innate cognitive faculties.

==Summary of findings==
Conclusions have been drawn from preferential looking experiments about the [[knowledge]] that infants possess. For example, if infants discriminate between rule-following and rule-violating stimuli—say, by looking longer, on average, at the latter than the former—then it has sometimes been concluded that infants ''know'' the rule.

Here is an example: 100 infants are shown an object that appears to [[Teleportation|teleport]], violating the rule that objects move in continuous paths. Another 100 similar infants are shown an object that behaves in a nearly identical manner to the object from group 1, except that this object does not teleport. If the former stimulus induces longer looking times than the latter, then, so the argument goes, infants expect that objects obey the continuity rule, and are surprised when they violate this rule. Some researchers have suggested, of some such experiments, that infants have innate knowledge of those rules the violation of which they can perceptually discriminate.

Common criticisms of this innateness thesis include that the infant has already acquired enough experience of non-teleporting objects to justify its surprise,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} and that teleporting objects are attention-grabbing for reasons other than expectancy violation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Findings from preferential looking experiments have suggested that humans innately possess sets of beliefs about how objects interact ("[[folk physics]]" or "folk mechanics") and about how animate beings interact ("[[folk psychology]]").

Preferential looking experiments have been cited in support of hypotheses regarding a wide range of inborn cognitive capacities, including:

* [[Face perception]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14512">A '''Quantum Digital Signature (QDS)''' refers to the quantum mechanical equivalent of either a classical [[digital signature]] or, more generally, a handwritten signature on a paper document. Like a handwritten signature, a digital signature is used to protect a document, such as a digital contract, against forgery by another party or by one of the participating parties.

As e-commerce has become more important in society, the need to certify the origin of exchanged information has arisen. Modern digital signatures enhance security based on the difficulty of solving a mathematical problem, such as finding the factors of large numbers (as used in the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA algorithm]]). Unfortunately, the task of solving these problems becomes feasible when a quantum computer is available (see [[Shor's algorithm]]). To face this new problem, new quantum digital signature schemes are in development to provide protection against tampering, even from parties in possession of quantum computers and using powerful quantum cheating strategies.

== Classical public-key method ==
The [[Public-key cryptography|public-key method]] of cryptography allows a sender to sign a message (often only the [[Cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash]] of the message) with a sign key in such a way that any recipient can, using the corresponding public key, check the authenticity of the message.  To allow this, the public key is made broadly available to all potential recipients.  To make sure only the legal author of the message can validly sign the message, the public key is created from a random, private sign key, using a [[one-way function]].  This is a function that is designed such that computing the result given the input is very easy, but computing the input given the result is very difficult.  A classic example is the multiplication of two very large primes:  The multiplication is easy, but factoring the product without knowing the primes is normally considered infeasible.

:&lt;math&gt; x \mapsto f(x) &lt;/math&gt; ''easy''

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \mapsto x &lt;/math&gt; ''very difficult''

== Quantum Digital Signature ==
Like classical digital signatures, quantum digital signatures make use of asymmetric keys.  Thus, a person who wants to sign a message creates one or more pairs of sign and corresponding public keys.  In general we can divide quantum digital signature schemes into two groups:
# A scheme that creates a public quantum-bit key out of a private '''classical''' bit string:  &lt;math&gt; k \mapsto |f_k \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
# A scheme that creates a public quantum-bit key out of a private '''quantum''' bit string:  &lt;math&gt; |k \rangle \mapsto |f_k \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

In both cases f is a one-way quantum function that has the same properties as a classical one-way function.
That is, the result is easy to compute, but, in contrast to the classical scheme, the function is ''impossible'' to invert, even if one uses powerful quantum cheating strategies.

The most famous scheme for the first method above is provided by Gottesman and Chuang &lt;ref name="Chuang"&gt;Daniel Gottesman, Isaac L. Chuang. ''Quantum Digital Signatures'', 
[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105032v2 ''arXiv:quant-ph/0105032'' '''v2'''], (November 15, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Requirements for a good and usable signature scheme ===
Most of the requirements for a classical digital signature scheme also apply to the quantum digital signature scheme.

In detail
# The scheme has to provide security against tampering by
## The sender after the message was signed (see [[Commitment scheme|bit commitment]])
## The receiver
## A third party
# Creating a signed message has to be easy
# Every recipient has to get the same answer, when testing the message for validity (Valid, Non-Valid)
&lt;ref name="Chuang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feng"&gt;Xin Lü, Deng-Guo Feng. ''Quantum Digital Signature Based on Quantum One-way Functions'', [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403046 ''arxiv:quant-ph/04030462'' '''v2'''], (June 24, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences between classical and quantum one-way functions ===

==== Nature of the one-way function ====
A classical one-way function as said above is based on a classical infeasible mathematical task, whereas a quantum one-way function exploits the uncertainty principle which makes it impossible even for a quantum computer to compute the inverse.
This is done by providing a quantum output state, with whom one cannot learn enough about the input string to reproduce it.
In case of the first group of schemes this is shown by Holevo's theorem, which says, that from a given n-qubit quantum state one cannot extract more than n classical bits of information.&lt;ref name="Holevo"&gt;Michael A. Nielsen, Isaac L. Chuang. ''Quantum Computation and Quantum Information 1st Ed.'', Cambridge University Press, '''p.531-536'''&lt;/ref&gt;
One possibility to ensure that the scheme uses less qubits for a bit string of a certain length is by using nearly orthogonal states
: &lt;math&gt; | \langle f_k|f_k' \rangle | &lt; \delta \qquad \text{ for } k \neq k' \land 0 \le \delta \le 1 &lt;/math&gt;
That gives us the possibility to induce a basis with more than two states.&lt;ref name="Chuang" /&gt;
So to describe an information of &lt;math&gt; 2^n &lt;/math&gt; bits, we can use less than n qubits.
An example with a 3 qubit basis
:* &lt;math&gt; |0 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; |1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0 \rangle + |1 \rangle ) &lt;/math&gt;
Only m qubits are needed to describe n classical bits when &lt;math&gt; 3^m = 2^n &lt;/math&gt; holds.

Because of Holevo's theorem and the fact, that m can be much smaller than n, we can only get m bits out of the n bits message. More general, if one gets T copies of the public key he can extract at most Tm bits of the private key.
If &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is big &lt;math&gt; n-Tm &lt;/math&gt; becomes very large, which makes it impossible for a dishonest person to guess the sign key.

''Note: You cannot distinguish between non-orthogonal states, if you only have a small amount of identical states. That's how the quantum one-way functions works. ''&lt;br&gt;
''Nevertheless &lt;math&gt; |f_k \rangle &lt;/math&gt; leaks information about the private key, in contrast to the classical public key, which forces one to get nothing or all about the private key. ''

==== Copying the public key ====
In the classical case we create a classical public key out of a classical sign key, thus it is easy to provide every potential recipient with a copy of the public key. The public key can be freely distributed.
This becomes more difficult in the quantum case, because copying a quantum state is forbidden by the no cloning theorem, as long as the state itself is unknown.&lt;ref name="Cloning"&gt;Michael A. Nielsen, Isaac L. Chuang. ''Quantum Computation and Quantum Information 1st Ed.'', Cambridge University Press,  '''p.532'''&lt;/ref&gt;
So public keys can only be created and distributed by a person who knows the exact quantum state he wants to create, thus who knows the sign key (This can be the sender or in more general a trustful institution).
Nevertheless, in contrast to the classical public key there is an upper bound for the number of public quantum keys '''T''' which can be created, without enabling one to guess the sign key and thus endangering the security of the scheme (&lt;math&gt; n-Tm  &lt;/math&gt; has to be big)

==== Public Key should be the same for every recipient (Swap Test)====
To make sure that every recipient gets identical results when testing the authenticity of a message, public keys distributed have to be the same.
This is straightforward in the classical case, because one can easily compare two classical bit strings and see if those match.
Nevertheless, in the quantum state it is more complicated.
To test, if two public quantum states are the same one has to compare the following
:&lt;math&gt; |f_k' \rangle = |f_k \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:QDS Swap test.jpg|frame|Swap test for qubits]]
This is done with the following quantum circuit which uses one [[Fredkin gate]] ''F'', one [[Hadamard transform|Hadamard gate]] ''H''  and an ancilla qubit ''a''.
First of all the ancilla qubit is set to a symmetric state &lt;math&gt; |a \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0 \rangle + |1 \rangle) &lt;/math&gt;.

Right after the ancilla qubit is used as a control on the targets &lt;math&gt; |f_k \rangle \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \ |f_k' \rangle &lt;/math&gt; in a Fredkin Gate.

Furthermore, a Hadamard gate is applied on the ancilla qubit and finally the first qubit gets measured.
If both states are the same, the result &lt;math&gt; |0 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is measured.
If both states are nearly orthogonal, the result can be either &lt;math&gt; |0 \rangle \ &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \ |1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Chuang" /&gt;

The calculation of the swap test in more detail:

The overall state
: &lt;math&gt; | \psi_0 \rangle = |a \rangle |f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; | \psi_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg(|0 \rangle + |1 \rangle \bigg) |f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; | \psi_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg(|0 \rangle |f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle + |1 \rangle |f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle \bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

After the '''Fredkin''' gate is applied

&lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg(|0 \rangle |f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle + |1 \rangle \mathbf {|f_k' \rangle |f_k \rangle} \bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

After the '''Hadamard''' gate is applied on the first qubit

&lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}\bigg[\bigg(|0 \rangle + |1 \rangle \bigg) |f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle + \bigg(|0 \rangle - |1 \rangle \bigg)|f_k' \rangle |f_k \rangle \bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

After '''sorting''' for &lt;math&gt; |0 \rangle \text{ and } |1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow |\psi \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\bigg[|0 \rangle \bigg(|f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle + |f_k' \rangle |f_k \rangle \bigg) + |1 \rangle \bigg(|f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle - |f_k' \rangle |f_k \rangle \bigg)\bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

Now it is easy to see, if the states &lt;math&gt; |f_k \rangle = |f_k' \rangle \ &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; \ | \psi \rangle = |0 \rangle |f_k \rangle |f_k \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, which gives us a 0 whenever it is measured.

== An example of a signing-validation process using a simplified Gottesman-Chuang scheme ==

=== Signing Process ===
[[Image:QDS Singing.jpg|thumb|right|A signing process example for a message-bit b = 0 using Gottesman-Chuang scheme]]
Let Person A (Alice) want to send a message to Person B (Bob).
Hash algorithms won't be considered, so Alice has to sign every single bit of her message. Message-Bit '''b''' &lt;math&gt; \in \{ 0,1 \} &lt;/math&gt;.

Alice chooses '''M''' pairs of private keys &lt;math&gt; \{ k_0^i,k_1^i \} \quad 1 \le i \le M &lt;/math&gt;
* All the &lt;math&gt; k_0 &lt;/math&gt; keys will be used to sign the message-bit if b = 0.
* All the &lt;math&gt; k_1 &lt;/math&gt; keys will be used to sign the message-bit if b = 1.
The function which maps &lt;math&gt; k \mapsto |f_k \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is known to all parties.
Alice now computes the corresponding public keys &lt;math&gt; \{ |f_{k_0}^i \rangle, |f_{k_1}^i \rangle \} &lt;/math&gt; and gives all of them to the recipients. She can make as many copies as she needs, but has to take care, not to endanger the security &lt;math&gt; \left( n \gg Tm  \text{ has to hold } \right) &lt;/math&gt;.

''Her level of security limits the number of identical public keys she can create''

If
* message-bit '''b = 0''', she sends all her private keys '''&lt;math&gt; k_0 &lt;/math&gt;''' along with the message-bit '''b''' to Bob
* message-bit '''b = 1''', she sends all her private keys '''&lt;math&gt; k_1 &lt;/math&gt;''' along with the message-bit '''b''' to Bob

''Remember: In this example Alice picks only one bit '''b''' and signs it. She has to do that for every single bit in her message ''

=== Validation Process ===
[[Image:QDS Validation.jpg|thumb|right|A validation example using Gottesman-Chuang scheme. Only one threshold is considered]]
Bob now possesses
* The message-bit '''b'''
* The corresponding private keys &lt;math&gt; k_0 \text{ or } k_1 &lt;/math&gt;
* All public keys &lt;math&gt; \{ |f_{k_0} \rangle, |f_{k_1} \rangle \} &lt;/math&gt;

Now Bob calculates &lt;math&gt; |f_{k_b} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; for all received private keys (either &lt;math&gt; k_0 \text{ or } k_1 &lt;/math&gt;).

After he has done so he makes use of the swap test to compare the calculated states with the received public keys.
Since the swap test has some probability to give the wrong answer he has to do it for all the '''M''' keys and counts how many incorrect keys he gets '''r'''. It is obvious, that '''M''' is some kind of a security parameter. It is more unlikely to validate a bit wrong for bigger '''M'''.
* If he only gets a few incorrect keys, then the bit is most probably valid, because his calculated keys and the public keys seem to be the same.
* If he gets many incorrect keys, then somebody faked the message with high probability.

== Avoid a message to be validated differently ==
One problem which arises especially for small '''M''' is, that the number of incorrect keys different recipients measure differ with probability. So to define only one threshold is not enough, because it would cause a message to be validated differently, when the number of incorrect keys '''r''' is very close to the defined threshold.

This can be prevented by defining more than one threshold.
Because the number of errors increase proportional with M, the thresholds are defined like
: '''Acceptance''' &lt;math&gt; T_{a} = c_1 M &lt;/math&gt;

: '''Rejection''' &lt;math&gt; T_{r} = c_2 M &lt;/math&gt;

* If the number of incorrect keys '''r''' is below &lt;math&gt; T_{a} &lt;/math&gt;, then the bit is valid with high probability
* If the number of incorrect keys '''r''' is above &lt;math&gt; T_{r} &lt;/math&gt;, then the bit is faked with high probability
* If the number of incorrect keys '''r''' is in-between both thresholds, then the recipient cannot be sure, if another recipient gets the same outcome, when validating the bit. Furthermore, he can't be even sure, if he validated the message right.
&lt;ref name="Chuang" /&gt;

''If we assume perfect channels without noise, so the bit can't be changed due to the transfer, then the threshold &lt;math&gt; T_a &lt;/math&gt; can be set to zero, because the swap test passes always, when the compared states are the same''

'''''Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought''''' is a 2001 book by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Pascal Boyer]], in which the author discusses the [[evolutionary psychology of religion]] and [[evolutionary origin of religions]].

==Synopsis==
Boyer describes the genesis of religious concepts as a phenomenon of the mind's [[cognitive]] [[inference]] systems, comparable to [[pareidolia]] and [[perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena]] resulting from [[face perception]] processes within the [[human brain]]. Boyer supports this naturalistic origin of religion with evidence from many specialized disciplines including [[biological anthropology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[cognitive science]], [[linguistics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[information processing]].

''Religion Explained'' frames religious practices and beliefs in terms of recent [[cognitive neuroscience]] research in the [[modularity of mind]]. This theory involves cognitive "modules" ("devices" or "subroutines") underlying inference systems and intuitions. For instance, Boyer suggests culturally-widespread beliefs in "supernatural agents" (e.g., gods, ancestors, spirits, and witches) result from [[agent detection]]: the intuitive modular process of assuming intervention by conscious agents, regardless of whether they are present. "When we see branches moving in a tree or when we hear an unexpected sound behind us, we immediately infer that some agent is the cause of this salient event. We can do that without any specific description of what the agent actually is."&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 2001:144,&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer cites [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]]'s classic [[Zande people|Zande]] story about a termite-infested roof collapsing.
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the anthropologist, the house caved in because of the termites. For the Zande, it was quite clear that witchcraft was involved. However, the Zande were also aware that the termites were the proximate cause of the incident. But what they wanted to know was why it happened at that particular time, when particular people were gathered in the house.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, 2001:196, cf. 2001:12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within Boyer's hypothesis, religion is a "parasite" (or "[[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]") offshoot from cognitive modules, comparable to the way the [[Reading (process)|reading]] process is parasitic upon [[language module]]s.
&lt;blockquote&gt;As I have pointed out repeatedly the building of religious concepts requires mental systems and capacities that are there anyway, religious concepts or not. Religious morality uses moral intuitions, religious notions of supernatural agents recruit our intuitions about agency in general, and so on. This is why I said that religious concepts are parasitic upon other mental capacities. Our capacities to play music, paint pictures or even make sense of printed ink-patterns on a page are also parasitic in this sense. This means that we can explain how people play music, paint pictures and learn to read by examining how mental capacities are recruited by these activities. The same goes for religion. Because the concepts require all sorts of specific human capacities (an intuitive psychology, a tendency to attend to some counterintuitive concepts, as well as various social mind adaptations), we can explain religion by describing how these various capacities get recruited, how they contribute to the features of religion that we find in so many different cultures. We do not need to assume that there is a special way of functioning that occurs only when processing religious thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, 2001:311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Boyer admits his explanation of religion 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is ''not'' a quick, shoot-from-the-hip solution of the kind that many people, either religious or not, seem to favor. There cannot be a magic bullet to explain the existence and common features of religion, as the phenomenon is the result of ''aggregate relevance'' – that is, of successful activation of a whole variety of mental systems.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 2001:298, italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reviews and criticisms==
{{summarize section|date=January 2011}}
Critical reception of ''Religion Explained'' has been mixed.

[[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]], a professor of developmental psychology at the [[University of Haifa]], called the book "a milestone on the road to a new behavioral understanding of religion, basing itself on what has come to be known as cognitive anthropology, and pointedly ignoring much work done over the past one hundred years in the behavioral study of religion and in the psychological anthropology of religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/02/boyer.html Book Review: Religion Explained] ''Human Nature Review'' 2002 Volume 2: 308–309 (22 July)&lt;/ref&gt; 
He continues: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The clearest virtue of this book is that of dealing with the real thing. Even today, most scholarly work on religion consists of apologetics in one form or another, and we are deluged by offers of grants to study "spirituality" or teach "religion and science". This all serves to make us forget that religion is a collection of fantasies about spirits, and Boyer indeed aims to teach us about the world of the spirits in the grand tradition of the Enlightenment. Any general introduction to the world of the spirits must be ambitious because it hasn't been done and also because it has been done intuitively by all of us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Klinghoffer]], a journalist and [[intelligent design]] proponent, wrote in the ''[[National Review]]'' that "Boyer's talk of 'religion is suspiciously generic" and describes his work as "professorial noodlings" that attempt to raise the question whether "all religions are somehow the same". He further claims that "debunkers like Boyer ... have their own unconscious motivations (to undermine religious faith, after all, is to set oneself free of its many inconvenient strictures)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080421220616/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_19_53/ai_78692094/pg_2 Faith no more—Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought—Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]], founder of [[The Skeptics Society]], described Boyer's book as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a penetratingly insightful scientific analysis of religion because as an anthropologist he understands that any explanation must take into account the rich diversity of religious practices and beliefs around the world, and as a scientist he knows that any explanatory model must account for this diversity. Boyer is at his ethnographic best in describing the countless peculiar religious rituals he and his anthropological brethren have recorded, and especially in identifying the shortcomings of virtually every explanation for religion ever offered. … As a consequence, however, Boyer himself fails to provide a satisfactory explanation because he knows that religion is not a single entity resulting from a single cause.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael. 2001. ''How We Believe: Science, Skepticism, and the Search for God'', 2nd ed., Macmillan, p 256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brigitte Schön, a theology professor at the [[University of Bonn]], wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from being fascinating to read and containing many more highly original ideas than could be mentioned here, ''Religion explained'' is an important book for a number of reasons. First of all, Boyer is able to present a very dense network of theories which not only explains many religious phenomena but also sets them in relation to each other. The integration of cognitive science research leads to a very realistic model of how religious concepts are processed and communicated, something which has been conspicuously absent from most theories of religion so far. Boyer's account of the natural basis of religion explains very well the persistence and re-emergence of religion even in a secularized environment, as well as the tensions between official and folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Schön. [http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb03/ivk/mjr/pdfs/2002/reviews/rev_schoen_2002.pdf "''Religion Explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought''"], ''Marburg Journal of Religion'' 2002 7.1:1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Garry Runciman, 3rd Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Garry Runciman]], sociologist at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], asked "Are we hardwired for God?"
&lt;blockquote&gt;The diverse beliefs which Boyer cites extend from Apollo and Athena, to shamanism among the Panamanian Cuna, to aliens from remote galaxies allegedly landing in New Mexico. But his central agenda is the particular set of unobservable causal agencies cited in his subtitle, and his primary concern is with the question of how we are to account for beliefs that involve the attribution of conscious agency to beings other than humans and animals of the normal and familiar kind. Such beliefs are, as Boyer says, remarkably widespread, and for all their variant forms the variation is neither limitless nor random. His answer falls into two parts: first, these beliefs have in common a counterintuitive attribution of a certain range of properties to certain kinds of quasihuman being; second, the explanation of their diffusion and persistence is to be sought not in the extensive anthropological literature about the origins and functions of religion, but in recent advances in developmental, cognitive and evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Runciman. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/feb/07/londonreviewofbooks/print Are we hardwired for God?], ''London Review of Books'', July 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author and economist [[Zachary Karabell]] found stylistic faults. "Boyer's use of cognitive psychology, anthropology and other disciplines does generate a new template for examining old questions. But his method, however compelling, does not save the book from its considerable flaws. To begin with, the writing is frequently impenetrable." He concludes, "Of course, Boyer may be right. Human existence may simply be a story of living, breathing, eating and dying. But by not grappling with the possibility that a nonmaterial realm exists, Boyer has written a book about religion that is occasionally illuminating and utterly unconvincing."&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Karabell. [http://www.rivertwice.com/articles/pdfs/A_True_Believer_%20in_Science_Offers_a_Lopsided_Look_LAT.pdf A True Believer in Science Offers a Lopsided Look at Faith; ''RELIGION EXPLAINED: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought'', By Pascal Boyer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191026/http://www.rivertwice.com/articles/pdfs/A_True_Believer_%20in_Science_Offers_a_Lopsided_Look_LAT.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }}, ''Los Angeles Times'' June 16, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[comparative religion]] author [[Karen Armstrong]] reviewed Boyer's thesis.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion, he argues, is nothing more or less than a by-product of the human mind. It is a side effect of having a particular kind of brain. By far the most fascinating part of this highly accessible and informative book is Boyer's description of the way our minds work. We have an inbuilt set of ontological expectations and a tendency to dwell on intuitions which violate these, such as mountains that float or companions whom we do not see. From the dawn of modern consciousness, men and women have focused on certain imaginary personalities that transcend the norm, convinced that they can help them in strategic ways. These supernatural agents link with other mental systems, such as our moral intuitions and social categories, for which we can find no conceptual justification.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Armstrong, [http://www.asa3.org/archive/asa/200109/0070.html ''Religion Explained'' by Pascal Boyer], ''The Times'', August 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]], formerly [[Archbishop of York]], wrote.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a bold and far-reaching book. What its author lacks in modesty, he makes up for in cogency of argument and elegance of style. His "explanation" of religion is lucid, entertaining, full of valuable insights and almost, but not quite, convincing. The usual explanations of religion—as an attempt to explain what is otherwise puzzling, as a provider of comfort, as a good thing for society or as an escape from reason—are quickly dismissed. Pascal Boyer seeks to demonstrate that its origins and motivations are more deep seated in our mental structures than any of these, which is why religion is so universal, so powerful and so unlikely to disappear even though, as he also claims, it is in the end only a mental phenomenon. Recent experience of the dreadful consequences of religious fanaticism gives his analysis a frightening contemporary relevance, not least because of the minor role within religion that he assigns to rationality.&lt;ref&gt;John Habgood, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=166258&amp;sectioncode=40 "Parasite of airy nothings?"], ''Times Higher Education'', 14 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Screw theory''' is the algebra and calculus of pairs of vectors, such as forces and moments and angular and linear velocity, that arise in the kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Dimentberg, F. M. (1965) [http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0680993 ''The Screw Calculus and Its Applications in Mechanics''], Foreign Technology Division translation FTD-HT-23-1632-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yang, A.T. (1974) "Calculus of Screws" in ''Basic Questions of Design Theory'', William R. Spillers (ed.), Elsevier, pp. 266–281.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mathematical framework was developed by Sir [[Robert Stawell Ball]] in 1876 for application in [[kinematics]] and [[statics]] of [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]]s (rigid body mechanics).&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

Screw theory provides a [[mathematical]] [[formulation]] for the [[geometry]] of lines which is central to [[rigid body dynamics]], where lines form the screw axes of spatial movement and the lines of action of forces.  The pair of vectors that form the [[Plücker coordinates]] of a line define a unit screw, and general screws are obtained by multiplication by a pair of real numbers and addition of [[Euclidean vector|vectors]].&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book|title=The theory of screws: A study in the dynamics of a rigid body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qu9IAAAAMAAJ|author=Ball, R. S.|publisher=Hodges, Foster|year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important result of screw theory is that geometric calculations for points using vectors have parallel geometric calculations for lines obtained by replacing vectors with screws.  This is termed the ''transfer principle.''&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite book|author1=McCarthy, J. Michael |author2=Soh, Gim Song |title=Geometric Design of Linkages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jv9mQyjRIw4C|date=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-7892-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screw theory has become an important tool in robot mechanics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Featherstone, Roy |title=Robot Dynamics Algorithms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6yz7f_jpqsC|year=1987|publisher=Kluwer Academic Pub|isbn=978-0-89838-230-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Featherstone, Roy |title=Robot Dynamics Algorithms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UjWbvqWaf6gC|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-74315-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; mechanical design, [[computational geometry]] and [[multibody dynamics]]. 
This is in part because of the relationship between screws and [[dual quaternion]]s which have been used to interpolate [[rigid-body motion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Selig, J. M. (2011) "Rational Interpolation of Rigid Body Motions," Advances in the Theory of Control, Signals and Systems with Physical Modeling, Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences, Volume 407/2011  213–224, {{doi|10.1007/978-3-642-16135-3_18}} Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on screw theory, an efficient approach has also been developed for the type synthesis of parallel mechanisms (parallel manipulators or parallel robots).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kong, Xianwen |author2=Gosselin, Clément |title=Type Synthesis of Parallel Mechanisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=II9_FbbpkL0C|date=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-71990-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamental theorems include [[Poinsot's theorem]] ([[Louis Poinsot]], 1806) and [[Chasles' theorem (kinematics)|Chasles' theorem]] ([[Michel Chasles]], 1832). [[Felix Klein]] saw screw theory as an application of [[elliptic geometry]] and his [[Erlangen Program]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Klein]] (1902) (D.H. Delphenich translator)  [http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/klein_-_screws.pdf On Sir Robert Ball's Theory of Screws]&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked out elliptic geometry, and a fresh view of Euclidean geometry, with the [[Cayley-Klein metric]]. The use of a [[symmetric matrix]] for a [[von Staudt conic]] and metric, applied to screws, has been described by Harvey Lipkin.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Lipkin (1983) [http://helix.gatech.edu/Papers/1985/LipkinPhdChapter3.pdf Metrical Geometry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305154047/http://helix.gatech.edu/Papers/1985/LipkinPhdChapter3.pdf |date=2016-03-05 }} from [[Georgia Tech University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent contributors include [[Julius Plücker]], [[William Kingdon Clifford|W. K. Clifford]], [[Theodore Minas'yevich Dimetberg|F. M. Dimentberg]], [[Kenneth H. Hunt]], J. R. Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kingdon Clifford|Clifford, William Kingdon ]] (1873), "Preliminary Sketch of Biquaternions", Paper XX, ''Mathematical Papers'', p.&amp;nbsp;381.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--this is discussed under "screw axis"
[[Euler's rotation theorem]] states that any rotation can be described as a rotation about a single axis by a given angle. In general, this is a unique representation (with the exception of zero rotation having an undefined axis and rotation of 180° having an ambiguity in axis direction corresponding to [[gimbal lock]]). Screw theory extends this notion to include translation.
--&gt;

== Basic concepts ==
[[Image:pure screw.svg|thumb|The pitch of a pure screw relates rotation about an axis to translation along that axis.]]

A spatial displacement of a rigid body can be defined by a rotation about a line and a translation along the same line, called a screw displacement.  This is known as [[Chasles' theorem (kinematics)|Chasles' theorem]].  The six parameters that define a screw displacement are the four independent components of the Plücker vector that defines the screw axis, together with the rotation angle about and linear slide along this line, and form a pair of vectors called a '''screw'''.  For comparison, the six parameters that define a spatial displacement can also be given by three [[Euler Angles]] that define the rotation and the three components of the  translation vector.

=== Screw ===
A screw is a six-dimensional vector constructed from a pair of three-dimensional vectors, such as forces and torques and linear and angular velocity, that arise in the study of spatial rigid body movement.  The components of the screw define the Plücker coordinates of a line in space and the magnitudes of the vector along the line and moment about this line.

=== Wrench ===
The force and torque vectors that arise in applying Newton's laws to a rigid body can be assembled into a screw called a '''wrench'''.  A force has a point of application and a line of action, therefore it defines the [[Plücker coordinates]] of a line in space and has zero pitch.  A torque, on the other hand, is a pure moment that is not bound to a line in space and is an infinite pitch screw.  The ratio of these two magnitudes defines the pitch of the screw.

=== Twist ===
A '''twist''' represents the velocity of a rigid body as an angular velocity around an axis and a linear velocity along this axis.  All points in the body have the same component of the velocity along the axis, however the greater the distance from the axis the greater the velocity in the plane perpendicular to this axis.  Thus, the helicoidal field formed by the velocity vectors in a moving rigid body flattens out the further the points are radially from the twist axis.

The points in a body undergoing a constant screw motion trace helices in the fixed frame.   If this screw motion has zero pitch then the trajectories trace circles, and the movement is a pure rotation.  If the screw motion has infinite pitch then the trajectories are all straight lines in the same direction.

== Algebra of screws ==
Let a ''screw'' be an ordered pair 
:&lt;math&gt; \mathsf{S}=(\mathbf{S}, \mathbf{V}), &lt;/math&gt;
where '''S''' and '''V''' are three-dimensional real vectors.  The sum and difference of these ordered pairs are computed componentwise.  Screws are often called ''dual vectors''.

Now, introduce the ordered pair of real numbers â=(a, b) called ''dual scalars''.  Let the addition and subtraction of these numbers be componentwise, and define multiplication as 
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{a}\hat{c}=(a, b)(c, d) = (ac, ad+bc).  \!&lt;/math&gt;
The multiplication of a screw S=('''S''', '''V''') by the dual scalar â=(a, b) is computed componentwise to be,
: &lt;math&gt; \hat{a}\mathsf{S}  = (a, b)(\mathbf{S}, \mathbf{V}) = (a \mathbf{S}, a \mathbf{V} +b \mathbf{S}).\!&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, introduce the dot and cross products of screws by the formulas: 
: &lt;math&gt; \mathsf{S}\cdot \mathsf{T} = (\mathbf{S}, \mathbf{V})\cdot (\mathbf{T}, \mathbf{W})  = (\mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{T},\,\, \mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{W} +\mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{T}), &lt;/math&gt;
which is a dual scalar, and  
: &lt;math&gt; \mathsf{S}\times \mathsf{T} = (\mathbf{S}, \mathbf{V})\times (\mathbf{T}, \mathbf{W}) = (\mathbf{S}\times \mathbf{T},\,\, \mathbf{S}\times \mathbf{W} +\mathbf{V}\times \mathbf{T}).&lt;/math&gt;
which is a screw. The dot and cross products of screws satisfy the identities of vector algebra, and allow computations that directly parallel computations in the algebra of vectors.

Let the dual scalar ẑ=(φ, d) define a ''dual angle'', then the infinite series definitions of sine and cosine yield the relations
: &lt;math&gt; \sin \hat{z} = \sin\phi + d \cos\phi, \,\,\,  \cos\hat{z} = \cos\phi - d \sin\phi.\!&lt;/math&gt;
In general, the function of a dual variable is defined to be f(ẑ)=(f(φ), df′(φ)), where f′(φ) is the derivative of f(φ).

These definitions allow the following results:
*  Unit screws are Plücker coordinates of a line and satisfy the relation
:: &lt;math&gt; |\mathsf{S}|=\sqrt{\mathsf{S}\cdot \mathsf{S}} =1; &lt;/math&gt;
*   Let ẑ=(φ, d) be the dual angle, where φ is the angle between the axes of S and T around their common normal, and d is the distance between these axes along the common normal, then
:: &lt;math&gt; \mathsf{S}\cdot \mathsf{T}=|\mathsf{S}||\mathsf{T}|\cos\hat{z}; &lt;/math&gt;
*  Let N be the unit screw that defines the common normal to the axes of S and T, and ẑ=(φ, d) is the dual angle between these axes, then
:: &lt;math&gt; \mathsf{S}\times \mathsf{T} = |\mathsf{S}||\mathsf{T}| \sin\hat{z} \mathsf{N}. &lt;/math&gt;

== Wrench ==
A common example of a screw is the ''wrench'' associated with a force acting on a rigid body.  Let ''P'' be the point of application of the force '''F''' and let '''P''' be the vector locating this point in a fixed frame.  The wrench W=('''F''', '''P'''×'''F''') is a screw.  The resultant force and moment obtained from all the forces '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; i=1,...,n, acting on a rigid body is simply the sum of the individual wrenches W&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, that is
:&lt;math&gt; \mathsf{R} = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathsf{W}_i = \sum_{i=1}^n (\mathbf{F}_i, \mathbf{P}_i\times\mathbf{F}_i). &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the case of two equal but opposite forces '''F''' and '''-F''' acting at points '''A''' and '''B''' respectively, yields the resultant
:&lt;math&gt; \mathsf{R}=(\mathbf{F}-\mathbf{F},  \mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{F} - \mathbf{B}\times\mathbf{F}) = (0, (\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{B})\times\mathbf{F}).&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that screws of the form 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{M}=(0, \mathbf{M}),&lt;/math&gt;
can be interpreted as pure moments.

== Twist ==
In order to define the ''twist'' of a rigid body, we must consider its movement defined by the parameterized set of spatial displacements, D(t)=([A(t)],'''d'''(t)), where [A] is a rotation matrix and '''d''' is a translation vector.  This causes a point '''p''' that is fixed in moving body coordinates to trace a curve '''P'''(t) in the fixed frame given by,
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{P}(t) = [A(t)]\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{d}(t).
&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity of '''P''' is
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{V}_P(t) = \left[\frac{dA(t)}{dt}\right]\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{v}(t),
&lt;/math&gt;
where '''v''' is velocity of the origin of the moving frame, that is d'''d'''/dt.  Now substitute '''p'''= [A&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;]('''P'''-'''d''') into this equation to obtain,
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{V}_P(t) = [\Omega]\mathbf{P} + \mathbf{v} - [\Omega]\mathbf{d}\quad\mbox{or}\quad\mathbf{V}_P(t) = \mathbf{\omega}\times\mathbf{P} + \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{d}\times\mathbf{\omega},
&lt;/math&gt;
where [Ω]=[dA/dt][A&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;] is the angular velocity matrix and ω is the angular velocity vector.

The screw 
:&lt;math&gt; \mathsf{T}=(\vec{\omega}, \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{d}\times \vec{\omega}),\!&lt;/math&gt;
is the ''twist'' of the moving body.  The vector '''V'''='''v''' + '''d'''×ω is the velocity of the point in the body that corresponds with the origin of the fixed frame.

There are two important special cases: (i) when '''d''' is constant, that is '''v'''=0,  then the twist is a pure rotation about a line, then the twist is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{L}=(\omega, \mathbf{d}\times\omega),&lt;/math&gt; 
and (ii) when [Ω]=0, that is the body does not rotate but only slides in the direction '''v''', then the twist is a pure slide given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathsf{T}=(0, \mathbf{v}).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Revolute joints ===
For a [[revolute joint]], let the axis of rotation pass through the point '''q''' and be directed along the vector ω, then the twist for the joint is given by,
:&lt;math&gt; \xi =  \begin{Bmatrix} \omega \\ q \times \omega \end{Bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Prismatic joints ===
For a [[prismatic joint]], let the vector '''v''' pointing define the direction of the slide, then the twist for the joint is given by,
:&lt;math&gt; \xi =  \begin{Bmatrix} 0\\v \end{Bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Coordinate transformation of screws ==
The coordinate transformations for screws are easily understood by beginning with the coordinate transformations of the Plücker vector of  line, which in turn are obtained from the transformations of the coordinate of points on the line.

Let the displacement of a body be defined by D=([A], '''d'''), where [A] is the rotation matrix and '''d''' is the translation vector.  Consider the line in the body defined by the two points '''p''' and '''q''', which has the [[Plücker coordinates]],
:&lt;math&gt; \mathsf{q}=(\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{p}\times\mathbf{q}),&lt;/math&gt;
then in the fixed frame we have the transformed point coordinates '''P'''=[A]'''p'''+'''d''' and '''Q'''=[A]'''q'''+'''d''', which yield.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Q}=(\mathbf{Q}-\mathbf{P}, \mathbf{P}\times\mathbf{Q}) = ([A](\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p}), [A](\mathbf{p}\times\mathbf{q}) + \mathbf{d}\times[A](\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p}))&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a spatial displacement defines a transformation for Plücker coordinates of lines given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{Bmatrix} \mathbf{Q}-\mathbf{P} \\ \mathbf{P}\times\mathbf{Q} \end{Bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} A &amp; 0 \\ DA &amp; A \end{bmatrix}
\begin{Bmatrix} \mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p} \\ \mathbf{p}\times\mathbf{q} \end{Bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The matrix [D] is the skew symmetric matrix that performs the cross product operation, that is [D]'''y'''='''d'''×'''y'''.

The 6&amp;times;6 matrix constructed from obtained from the spatial displacement D=([A], '''d''') can be assembled into the dual matrix
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{A}] =([A], [DA]),&lt;/math&gt;
which operates on a screw s=('''s'''.'''v''') to obtain,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{S} = [\hat{A}]\mathsf{s}, \quad (\mathbf{S}, \mathbf{V}) = ([A], [DA])(\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{v})  = ([A]\mathbf{s}, [A]\mathbf{v}+[DA]\mathbf{s}).&lt;/math&gt;

The dual matrix [Â]=([A], [DA]) has determinant 1 and is called a ''dual orthogonal matrix''.
&lt;!--- problems with this section:  needs work
== Screw theory and robotics ==
The angular velocity and velocity of the end-effector of a robot are assembled into the pair of vectors called a twist.  The twists used in robotics are transposed versions of the twists used in screw theory.  This transposition facilitates the calculation of virtual work.  

=== Twists ===
[[Image:Velocity twist.jpg|thumb|A change in the reference point of the moving frame changes the twist.]]
The twist includes the velocity of the reference point of the moving frame.  To change the reference point in the moving from A to B, one must account for the rotation of the body.  Introduce the notation:
*&lt;math&gt;\vec v_A&lt;/math&gt; denotes the linear velocity at point A
*&lt;math&gt;\vec v_B&lt;/math&gt; denotes the linear velocity at point B
*&lt;math&gt;\vec \omega&lt;/math&gt; denotes the angular velocity of the rigid body
*&lt;math&gt;[\vec r_{AB}]_\times &lt;/math&gt; denotes the 3×3 [[Cross product#Conversion_to_matrix_multiplication|cross product matrix]]

In screw notation velocity twists transform with a 6x6 transformation matrix
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{v_A} = \begin{Bmatrix}  \vec v_A\\ \vec \omega \end{Bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; [\vec r_{AB}]_\times \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix} \vec v_B \\ \vec \omega \end{Bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
Notice that in this formulation the velocity of the reference point is identified as the first vector of the twist, while the angular velocity is the second vector.

=== Wrenches ===
[[Image:Force wrench.jpg|thumb|A change in the reference point of the moving frame changes the wrench.]]
Similarly the equipolent moments expressed at each location within a [[rigid body]] define a helical field called the force wrench. To move representation from point B to point A, introduce the notation:
*&lt;math&gt;\vec \tau_A&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[equipollent]] (link: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Statics/Resultants_of_Force_Systems_(contents) wikibooks.org] ) moment at point A
*&lt;math&gt;\vec \tau_B&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[equipollent]] (link: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Statics/Resultants_of_Force_Systems_(contents) wikibooks.org] ) moment at point B
*&lt;math&gt;\vec F&lt;/math&gt; denotes the total force applied to the rigid body
*&lt;math&gt;[\vec r_{AB}]_\times &lt;/math&gt; denotes the 3×3 [[Cross product#Conversion_to_matrix_multiplication|cross product matrix]]

In screw notation force wrenches transform with a 6x6 transformation matrix,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat {\tau}_A = \begin{Bmatrix} \vec F \\ \vec {\tau}_A \end{Bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}  1 &amp; 0 \\  [ \vec r_{AB} ]_\times  &amp;  1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} \vec F  \\ \vec {\tau}_B  \end{Bmatrix} . &lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;

== Twists as elements of a Lie algebra ==
Consider the movement of a rigid body defined by the parameterized 4x4 homogeneous transform,
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{P}(t)=[T(t)]\textbf{p} = 
\begin{Bmatrix} \textbf{P} \\ 1\end{Bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} A(t) &amp; \textbf{d}(t) \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}
\begin{Bmatrix} \textbf{p} \\ 1\end{Bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
This notation does not distinguish between '''P''' = (X, Y, Z, 1), and '''P''' = (X, Y, Z), which is hopefully clear in context.

The velocity of this movement is defined by computing the velocity of the trajectories of the points in the body,
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{V}_P = [\dot{T}(t)]\textbf{p} =
\begin{Bmatrix} \textbf{V}_P \\ 0\end{Bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \dot{A}(t) &amp; \dot{\textbf{d}}(t) \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{Bmatrix} \textbf{p} \\ 1\end{Bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
The dot denotes the derivative with respect to time, and because '''p''' is constant its derivative is zero.

Substitute the inverse transform for '''p''' into the velocity equation to obtain the velocity of ''P'' by operating on its trajectory '''P'''(t), that is
:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{V}_P=[\dot{T}(t)][T(t)]^{-1}\textbf{P}(t) = [S]\textbf{P},&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;[S] =  \begin{bmatrix} \Omega &amp; -\Omega\textbf{d} + \dot{\textbf{d}} \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \Omega &amp; \mathbf{d}\times\omega+ \mathbf{v} \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
Recall that [Ω] is the angular velocity matrix.  The matrix [S] is an element of the Lie algebra [[se(3)]] of the Lie group [[Euclidean_group|SE(3)]] of homogeneous transforms.  The components of [S] are the components of the twist screw, and for this reason [S] is also often called a twist.

From the definition of the matrix [S], we can formulate the ordinary differential equation,
:&lt;math&gt;[\dot{T}(t)] = [S][T(t)],&lt;/math&gt;
and ask for the movement [T(t)] that has a constant twist matrix [S].  The solution is the matrix exponential
:&lt;math&gt;[T(t)] = e^{[S]t}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formulation can be generalized such that given an initial configuration g(0) in SE(n), and a twist ξ in se(n), the homogeneous transformation to a new location and orientation can be computed with the formula,
:&lt;math&gt; g\left(\theta\right) = \exp(\xi\theta) g\left(0\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where θ represents the parameters of the transformation.

==Screws by reflection==
In [[transformation geometry]], the elemental concept of transformation is the [[reflection (mathematics)]]. In planar transformations a translation is obtained by reflection in parallel lines, and rotation is obtained by reflection in a pair of intersecting lines. To produce a screw transformation from similar concepts one must use planes in [[space]]: the parallel planes must be perpendicular to the [[screw axis]], which is the line of intersection of the intersecting planes that generate the rotation of the screw. Thus four reflections in planes effect a screw transformation. The tradition of [[inversive geometry]] borrows some of the ideas of [[projective geometry]] and provides a language of transformation that does not depend on [[analytic geometry]].

==Homography==
The combination of a translation with a rotation effected by a screw displacement can be illustrated with the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential mapping]]. This idea in transformation geometry was advanced by [[Sophus Lie]] more than a century ago. Even earlier, [[William Rowan Hamilton]] displayed the [[versor]] form of unit quaternions as exp(''a r'')= cos ''a'' + ''r'' sin ''a''. The idea is also in [[Euler's formula]] parametrizing the [[unit circle]] in the [[complex plane]].

Since &amp;epsilon;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 for [[dual numbers]], exp(''a'' &amp;epsilon;) = 1 + ''a'' &amp;epsilon;, all other terms of the exponential series vanishing.

Let ''F'' = {1 + &amp;epsilon;''r'' : ''r'' ∈ '''H'''},   &amp;epsilon;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.
Note that ''F'' is [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|stable]] under the [[quaternions and spatial rotation|rotation]] ''q'' → ''p'' &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''q p'' and under the translation
(1 + &amp;epsilon; ''r'')(1 + &amp;epsilon; ''s'') = 1 + &amp;epsilon; (''r'' + ''s'') for any vector quaternions ''r'' and ''s''.
''F'' is a [[flat (geometry)|3-flat]] in the eight-dimensional space of [[dual quaternion]]s. This 3-flat F represents [[space]], and the [[homography]] constructed, [[restriction of a function|restricted]] to ''F'', is a screw displacement of space.

Let ''a'' be half the angle of the desired turn about axis ''r'', and ''b r'' half the displacement on the [[screw axis]]. Then form ''z'' = exp((''a'' + ''b'' &amp;epsilon;) ''r'' ) and z* = exp((''a'' − ''b'' &amp;epsilon;) ''r'' ). Now the homography is
:&lt;math&gt;U(q,1)\begin{pmatrix}z &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; z^* \end{pmatrix} = U(q z , z^*) \thicksim U((z^*)^{-1} q z , 1).&lt;/math&gt;
The inverse for z* is &lt;math&gt;1/(\exp(ar - b \epsilon r)) = &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(e^{ar} e^{-br \epsilon} )^{-1} = &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; e^{br \epsilon} e^{-ar},&lt;/math&gt;
so, the homography sends ''q'' to
:&lt;math&gt;(e^{b \epsilon} e^{-ar}) q (e^{ar} e^{b \epsilon r}) = e^{b \epsilon r} (e^{-ar} q  e^{ar} )e^{b \epsilon r} = e^{2b \epsilon r} (e^{-ar} q e^{ar}).&lt;/math&gt;
Now for any quaternion vector ''p'', p* = −''p'', let ''q'' = 1 + ''p'' &amp;epsilon; ∈ ''F''  &amp;nbsp;where the required rotation and translation are effected.

[[William Kingdon Clifford]] initiated the use of dual quaternions for [[kinematics]], followed by [[Eduard Study]] in his ''Geometrie der Dynamen''. However, the point of view of Sophus Lie has recurred.&lt;ref&gt;Xiangke Wang, Dapeng Han, Changbin Yu, and Zhiqiang Zheng (2012) "The geometric structure of unit dual quaternions with application in kinematic control", ''Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications'' 389(2):1352 to 64&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1940, [[Julian Coolidge]] described the use of dual quaternions for screw displacements on page 261 of ''A History of Geometrical Methods''. He notes the 1885 contribution of [[Arthur Buchheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Buchheim, Arthur |year=1885|jstor=2369176|title=A Memoir on biquaternions|journal= [[American Journal of Mathematics]]|volume= 7|issue=4|pages=293–326|doi=10.2307/2369176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge based his description simply on the tools Hamilton had used for real quaternions.

Evidently the [[group of units]] of the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of dual quaternions is a [[Lie group]]. A subgroup has [[Lie algebra]] generated by the parameters ''a r'' and ''b s'', where ''a'', ''b'' ∈ '''R''', and ''r'', ''s'' ∈ '''H'''. These six parameters generate a subgroup of the units, the unit sphere. Of course it includes ''F'' and the [[3-sphere]] of [[versor]]s.

==Work of forces acting on a rigid body==
Consider the set of forces  '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; act on the points '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; in a rigid body. The trajectories of  '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, i=1,...,n  are defined by the movement of the rigid body with rotation [A(t)] and the translation '''d'''(t) of a reference point in the body, given by 
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X}_i(t)= [A(t)]\mathbf{x}_i + \mathbf{d}(t)\quad i=1,\ldots, n, &lt;/math&gt;
where '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are coordinates in the moving body.

The velocity of each point '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \vec{\omega}\times(\mathbf{X}_i-\mathbf{d}) + \mathbf{v},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''ω''' is the angular velocity vector and '''v''' is the derivative of '''d'''(t).

The work by the forces over the displacement δ'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;='''v'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;δt of each point is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = \mathbf{F}_1\cdot\mathbf{V}_1\delta t+\mathbf{F}_2\cdot\mathbf{V}_2\delta t + \ldots + \mathbf{F}_n\cdot\mathbf{V}_n\delta t.&lt;/math&gt;
Define the velocities of each point in terms of the twist of the moving body to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W =  \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{F}_i\cdot (\vec{\omega}\times(\mathbf{X}_i -\mathbf{d}) + \mathbf{v})\delta t. &lt;/math&gt;

Expand this equation and collect coefficients of ω and '''v''' to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W =  (\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{F}_i)\cdot\mathbf{d}\times \vec{\omega}\delta t+ (\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{F}_i)\cdot\mathbf{v}\delta t + (\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{X}_i \times\mathbf{F}_i)\cdot\vec{\omega}\delta t   =  (\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{F}_i)\cdot(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{d}\times \vec{\omega}) \delta t + (\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{X}_i \times\mathbf{F}_i)\cdot\vec{\omega}\delta t .&lt;/math&gt;
Introduce the twist of the moving body and the wrench acting on it given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathsf{T} = (\vec{\omega},\mathbf{d}\times \vec{\omega} +\mathbf{v})=(\mathbf{T},\mathbf{T}^\circ),\quad\mathsf{W} = (\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{F}_i, \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{X}_i \times\mathbf{F}_i)=(\mathbf{W},\mathbf{W}^\circ), &lt;/math&gt;
then work takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = (\mathbf{W}\cdot\mathbf{T}^\circ +  \mathbf{W}^\circ \cdot\mathbf{T})\delta t.&lt;/math&gt;

The 6x6 matrix [Π] is used to simplify the calculation of work using screws, so that
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = (\mathbf{W}\cdot\mathbf{T}^\circ +  \mathbf{W}^\circ \cdot\mathbf{T})\delta t = \mathsf{W}[\Pi]\mathsf{T}\delta t,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; [\Pi] =\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; I \\ I &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
and [I] is the 3x3 identity matrix.

===Reciprocal screws===
If the virtual work of a wrench on a twist is zero, then the forces and torque of the wrench are constraint forces relative to the twist.  The wrench and twist are said to be ''reciprocal,'' that is
if
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W =\mathsf{W}[\Pi]\mathsf{T}\delta t = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
then the screws W and T are reciprocal.

===Twists in robotics===
In the study of robotic systems the components of the twist are often transposed to eliminate the need for the 6x6 matrix [Π]  in the calculation of work.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"/&gt;  In this case the twist is defined to be
:&lt;math&gt;\check{\mathsf{T}} =  (\mathbf{d}\times \vec{\omega} +\mathbf{v},\vec{\omega}),&lt;/math&gt;
so the calculation of work takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W =\mathsf{W}\cdot\check{\mathsf{T}}\delta t.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, if
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W =\mathsf{W}\cdot\check{\mathsf{T}}\delta t= 0,&lt;/math&gt;
then the wrench W is reciprocal to the twist T.

'''''Shabda''''', or '''{{IAST|Śabda}}''', is the [[Sanskrit]] word for "speech sound". In [[Sanskrit grammar]], the term refers to an [[utterance]] in the sense of [[linguistic performance]].

==History==
In classical Indian [[philosophy of language]], the grammarian [[Katyayana]] stated that ''shabda'' ("speech") is eternal (''nitya''), as is ''[[artha]]'' "meaning", and that they share a mutual co-relation. According to [[Patanjali]], the permanent aspect of ''shabda'' is [[sphoṭa|{{IAST|sphoṭa}}]] ("meaning"), while ''dhvani'' ("sound, acoustics") is ephemeral to ''shabda''.

Om, or [[Om|Aum]], a sacred syllable of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]], is considered to be the first resonating vibrational sound within an individual being. It also denotes the non-dualistic universe as a whole. In Buddhism, Om corresponds to the [[crown chakra]] and white light.

[[Bhartrihari]], on the other hand, held a ''shabda-[[advaita]]'' position, identifying ''shabda'' as indivisible, and unifying the notions of cognition and linguistic performance, which is ultimately identical to [[Brahman]]. Bhartrhari recognised two entities, both of which may be referred to as ''shabda''. One entity is the underlying cause of the articulated sounds, while the other entity is the functionality that is used to express meaning. Bhartrhari thus rejected the difference posited between the ontological and the linguistic by [[Indian logic|logicians]]. His concept of ''shabda-brahman'' which identified linguistic performance and creation itself ran parallel to the Greek concept of ''[[logos]]''.

Language philosophy in Medieval India was dominated by the dispute of the "naturalists" to the [[Mimamsa]] school, notably defended by [[Kumarila]], who held that ''shabda'' designates the actual phonetic utterance, and the Sphota school, defended by [[Mandana Mishra]], which identifies ''[[sphota]]'' and ''shabda'' as a mystical "indivisible word-whole".

==In religion==

===Hinduism===
''Shabda'' is a [[Sanskrit]] word that was first used as a religio-philosophic term in the context of Hindu religion. It refers to the verbal testimony (of revealed scriptures: ''[[shruti]]'' that is indispensable to gaining knowledge of the ultimate reality, Brahman.

===Sikhism===
In [[Sikhism]] the term ''Shabad'' has two primary meanings. The first context of the term is to refer to a hymn or paragraph or sections of the [[Holy Text]] that appears in [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the main holy scripture of the Sikhs. The Guru Granth Sahib is organised by chapters of ''[[ragas]]'', with each chapter containing many ''shabads'' of that ''raga''. The first ''Shabad'' in Guru Granth Sahib is the [[Mool Mantar]]. The script used for the ''Shabad'' is [[Gurmukhi]]. ''Shabad'' is the term also used to refer to hymns within other Sikh scriptures, like [[Deh Siva Var Mohe]]. The second use of the term ''Shabad'' in Sikhism is for the holy name of God, [[Waheguru]].

===Other faiths and philosophies===
Esoterically, ''Shabd'' is the “Sound Current vibrating in all creation. It can be heard by the inner ears.”&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/gloss.htm Glossary of Oriental terms and important names of persons and places] ''&lt;/ref&gt; Variously referred to as the ''Audible Life Stream'', ''Inner Sound'', ''Sound Current'' or ''Word'' in English,{{source?|date=January 2018}} the ''Shabd'' is the [[Esotericism|esoteric]] essence of [[God]] which is available to all human beings, according to the Shabd path teachings of [[Sant Mat]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[Eckankar]], Vardankar (a split-off from Eckankar),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giamboi|first1=Heather|title=Thousands of Visits to Heaven and the Heart of God: "The Most Profound, Vividly Detailed Out of Body Discoveries Yet!"|publisher=Direct Path Publishing|isbn=978-0996907309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Twitchell|first1=Paul|title=The Shariyat-Ki-Huray Book Two|publisher=Direct Path Publishing|isbn=978-0996907378}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness]].

Adherents believe that a ''[[satguru]]'', [[Eck Master]], or VARDAN Master, who is a [[human]] being, has merged with the ''Shabd'' in such a manner that he or she is a living manifestation of it at its highest level (the “Word made flesh”). However, not only can the ''Satguru'' attain this, but all human beings are inherently privileged in this way. Indeed, in [[Sant Mat]] the ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d’être]]'' for the human form is to meditate on the Sound Current, and in so doing merge with it until one’s own divinity is ultimately realized.

''Naam'' ("Word") has been described through the use of several different terms. [[Sant Baljit Singh]], a contemporary Sant Mat Master, uses the term "Light and Sound Current". He describes it as the connecting link between human beings and God.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14225">The '''Smart Onboard Data Interface Module''' (SMODIM) is used by the [[United States Army]] and foreign militaries for live simulated weapons training on military platforms. The SMODIM is the primary component of the Longbow Apache Tactical Engagement Simulation System (LBA TESS) that provides weapons systems training and collective Force-on-Force live training participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/2013_PEOSTRI_DSRG.pdf |title=PEO STRI Desk-Side Reference Guide, LBA TESS (Page 88) |publisher=PEO STRI |date= 2013–2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TESS is an advanced weapons training system developed for the [[AH-64 Apache]] to support force-on-force and force-on-target live training at U.S. Army Combat Training Centers (CTCs), Aviation Home Stations, and deployed locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/LBA_TESS/ |title=PEO STRI LBA TESS |publisher=PEO STRI |date= |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; TESS integrates with aircraft and ground vehicles to provide collective [[opposing force]] participation in live training.

The Aerial Weapons Scoring System (AWSS) integration with LBA TESS provides the ability to conduct force-on-target engagements using live ammunition for 30 mm gun, rockets, and simulated Hellfire missiles. Gunnery scoring is supported by the SMODIM, which transmits aviation data from the LBA to the Exercise Control (EXCON). AWSS scores the pilot’s live-fire gunnery performance and provides constructive After Action Review (AAR) feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/AWSS-LBA-TESS/home.jsp |title=PEO STRI AWSS LBA TESS |publisher=PEO STRI |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320202151/http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/AWSS-LBA-TESS/home.jsp |archivedate=2014-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/2013_PEOSTRI_DSRG.pdf |title=PEO STRI Desk-Side Reference Guide, AWSS LBA TESS (Page 83) |publisher=PEO STRI |date= 2013–2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|citeseerx = 10.1.1.177.858 |title=PEO STRI Products and Services Catalog (Page 81) |publisher=PEO STRI |year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed and manufactured by Inter-Coastal Electronics, Inc (ICE), "The SMODIM is fully compatible with the [[Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System|multiple integrated laser engagement system (MILES)]] and laser-based direct fire weapons. Additionally, it eliminates the requirement for MILES-type lasers by providing the capability to geometrically pair weapon engagements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-coastal.net/smodim.html |title=SMODIM - Smart Onboard Data Interface Module |date= |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Smart Onboard Data Interface Module (SMODIM).png|thumb|right|SMODIM]]

== Background ==

In 1992, Inter-Coastal Electronics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-coastal.net |title=Inter-Coastal Electronics (ICE) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; was selected by U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cecom.army.mil |title= U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide the real-time casualty assessment (RTCA) interface for the AH-64 Apache Attack Helicopter. This component was called the onboard data interface module (ODIM). As the Army incorporated new technologies, the SMODIM added GPS and telemetry and became the core component of live helicopter training systems at all U.S. Army Combat Training Centers (CTCs) with a fielding of over 240 systems. In 1997, the SMODIM was modified to provide a proof of concept for the upgraded AH-64 (D model) Longbow Apache. In 1998 the "Modular" SMODIM and the longbow tactical engagement simulation system (TESS) training system was fielded to all three CTCs and Aviation Home Stations, and became the U.S. Army's first fully integrated live aviation training system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a359363.pdf |title=The Development of a Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) Plan for a Proposed Tactical Engagement Simulation System for the AH-64D Attack Helicopter |publisher=Robert A. Pupalaikis, Defense Technical Information Center |date= November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following 15&amp;nbsp;years, the SMODIM has deployed in multiple systems and platforms with over one thousand SMODIMs fielded in the U.S. and abroad. An "Advanced" SMODIM or "ASMODIM" is currently in development due to parts obsolescence and will provide an 80% increased processing performance. Security encryption is in accordance with [[FIPS 140-2]] level 2. Advanced weapon simulation is augmented by digital terrain elevation data ([[DTED]]) and geometric ranging. Data communication and data transmission upgrades utilize [[RS-422]] and [[RS-485]] full duplex channels, and [[ARINC 429]] technical standards.

== Overview ==

The SMODIM includes a built-in GPS receiver, [[telemetry]] radio, data recorder, and [[MIL-STD-1553]] mux bus processors. The SMODIM interfaces with the weapons systems and actively tracks, records and transmits data to the ground station or exercise control (EXCON). RTCA feedback is passed directly to the weapons processor and the ground station through the onboard telemetry radio. The SMODIM processes area weapons effects (AWE) data received from the EXCON and computes geometric pairing solutions for weapon engagements using the RF Hellfire, semi-automated laser (SAL) Hellfire, 30 mm chain gun, and rockets. It selects a target from its onboard player/position database in the appropriate weapons impact footprint, then uses the probability-of-hit (Ph) factor to determine the assessment (i.e., ‘hit’/‘miss’). Via the data link, it then informs the target it has been selected for assessment.

The SMODIM maintains a dynamic position database through player-to-player network communications. The onboard telemetry radio supports simultaneous distribution to multiple locations. The radio acts as a message repeater to overcome line of sight (LOS) interruptions. The SMODIM interfaces with [[distributed interactive simulation]] (DIS) networks using SMODIM tracking analysis and recording (SMOTAR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-coastal.net/smotar.html |title=SMODIM Tracking Analysis and Recording (SMOTAR) |publisher=Inter-Coastal Electronics (ICE) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; an advanced software suite that provides visual display and tracking of SMODIM instrumented players. GPS provides real-time position data as players are dynamically simulated, tracked and recorded over tactical maps and aerial photos for after-action review (AAR).

The TESS Aircraft System consists of an “A” kit that becomes part of the aircraft, and a “B” kit that is added to the aircraft for training exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/p350_9.pdfl |title=TESS Apache Longbow TESS B-Kit (Pages 88-89) |publisher=Headquarters Department of the Army |date= 12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “A” kit includes the SMODIM Tray Assembly, modified software in the weapons display and systems processors, with cable connection provisions. The “B” kit includes the SMODIM, Eye-Safe Laser Range Finder/Designator (ESLRF/D), TESS Gun Control Unit (TGCU), Aircraft Internal Boresight Subassembly (AIBS), TESS Training Missile (TTM) with Flash Weapon Effects Signature Simulator (FlashWESS), GPS and telemetry antennas.

In [[software engineering]], '''software durability''' means the solution ability of serviceability of software and to meet user's needs for a relatively long time. For a [[software security]] to be durable, it must allow an organization to adjust the software to business needs that are constantly evolving, often in impulsive ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.csi-india.org/digital_magazine/October/Oct.html#p=34|last1=Kumar|first1=Rajeev|last2=Khan|first2=Suhel Ahmad|last3=Khan|first3=Raees Ahmad|title=Durable Security in Software Development: Needs and Importance|work=CSI Communications|publisher=Computer Society of India|volume=99|issue=7|pp=34–36|date=October 2015|doi=|issn=0970-647X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durability of software depends on four characteristics mainly; i.e. [[software trustworthiness]], [[Human Trust for Serviceability]], software [[dependability]] and software [[usability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJHIT/vol8_no2_2015/29.pdf|last1=Kumar|first1=Rajeev|last2=Khan|first2=Suhel Ahmad|last3=Khan|first3=Raees Ahmad|title=Revisiting Software Security: Durability Perspective|work=International Journal of Hybrid Information Technology|publisher=Science &amp; Engineering Research Support Society|volume=8|issue=2|pp=311–322|date=July 2015|doi=10.14257/ijhit|issn=1738-9968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''stone ship''' or '''ship setting''' was an early burial custom in [[Scandinavia]], [[Northern Germany]] and the [[Baltic states]]. The grave or cremation burial was surrounded by slabs or stones in the shape of a ship. The ships vary in size and were erected from c. 1000 BC to 1000 AD.

== History ==
Stone ship were an early burial custom, characteristically Scandinavian but also found in Northern Germany and the Baltic states. The grave or cremation burial was surrounded by tightly or loosely fit slabs or stones in the outline of a ship. They are often found in [[grave field]]s, but are sometimes far from any other archaeological remains.

Ship settings are of varying sizes, some of monumental proportions. The largest known is the mostly destroyed [[Jelling stone ship]] in Denmark, which was at least {{convert|170|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. In Sweden, the size varies from {{convert|67|m|ft|abbr=on}} ([[Ale's Stones]]) to only a few metres. The orientation also varies. Inside, they can be cobbled or filled with stones, or have raised stones in the positions of masts. The illusion of being ships has often been reinforced by larger stones at the ends. Some have an oblique stern.

Scattered examples are found in Northern Germany and along the coast of the Baltic States. Excavations have shown that they are usually from the latter part of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], c. 1000 BC – 500 BC (e.g. [[Gotland]]) or from the [[Germanic Iron Age]], the [[Vendel Period]] and the [[Viking Age]] (e.g. [[Blekinge]] and [[Scania]]).

Scholars have suggested both that the stone ship developed out of the desire to equip the dead with everything he had in life, and alternatively that it was specifically associated with the journey to [[Hel (location)|Hel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilda Ellis Davidson|Hilda Roderick Ellis]], ''The Road to Hel: A Study of the Conception of the Dead in Old Norse Literature'', Cambridge University, 1943, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aLA8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 pp. 28–29].&lt;/ref&gt; One puzzling feature is that they sometimes occur at the base of a barrow, enclosing a flat area presumably intended for public ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aLA8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 p. 111].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper published in 2012, Joseph S. Hopkins and Haukur Þorgeirsson propose a connection between stone ships and the image of a 'ship in a field' that the goddess [[Freyja]]'s afterlife locations [[Fólkvangr]] and [[Sessrúmnir]] considered together produce. According to Hopkins and Haukur, "'A ship in the field' in the mythical realm may have been conceived as a reflection of actual burial customs and vice versa. It is possible that the symbolic ship was thought of as providing some sort of beneficial property to the land, such as good seasons and peace brought on by Freyr’s mound burial in ''Ynglinga saga''."&lt;ref name="SHIP-IN-THE-FIELD"&gt;Hopkins, Joseph S. and Haukur Þorgeirsson (2012).

Systems engineering uses a host of tools that include [[modeling and simulation]], requirements analysis and scheduling to manage complexity.]]

'''Systems engineering''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field of [[engineering]] and [[engineering management]] that focuses on how to design and manage [[complex system]]s over their [[enterprise life cycle|life cycle]]s. At its core, systems engineering utilizes [[systems thinking]] principles to organize this body of knowledge. Issues such as [[requirements engineering]], reliability, [[logistics]], coordination of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability and many other [[Discipline (academia)|disciplines]] necessary for successful system development, design, implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work-processes, optimization methods, and [[risk management]] tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as [[industrial engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[control engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[cybernetics]], [[organizational studies]], [[civil engineering]] and [[project management]]. Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered, and integrated into a whole.

The systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process. A manufacturing process is focused on repetitive activities that achieve high quality outputs with minimum cost and time. The systems engineering process must begin by discovering the real problems that need to be resolved, and identifying the most probable or highest impact failures that can occur –  systems engineering involves finding solutions to these problems.

==History==
[[Image:A1 House of Quality.png|left|thumb|QFD [[House of Quality]] for Enterprise Product Development Processes]]
The term ''systems engineering'' can be traced back to [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need to identify and manipulate the properties of a system as a whole, which in complex engineering projects may greatly differ from the sum of the parts' properties, motivated various industries, especially those developing systems for the U.S. Military, to apply the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

When it was no longer possible to rely on design evolution to improve upon a system and the existing tools were not sufficient to meet growing demands, new methods began to be developed that addressed the complexity directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Systems Engineering | author = Andrew Patrick Sage | publisher=Wiley IEEE | year = 1992 | isbn= 0-471-53639-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuing evolution of systems engineering comprises the development and identification of new methods and modeling techniques. These methods aid in a better comprehension of the design and developmental control of engineering systems as they grow more complex. Popular tools that are often used in the systems engineering context were developed during these times, including [[Universal Systems Language|USL]], [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[Quality function deployment|QFD]], and [[IDEF]]0.

In 1990, a professional society for systems engineering, the ''National Council on Systems Engineering'' (NCOSE), was founded by representatives from a number of U.S. corporations and organizations. NCOSE was created to address the need for improvements in systems engineering practices and education. As a result of growing involvement from systems engineers outside of the U.S., the name of the organization was changed to the [[International Council on Systems Engineering]] (INCOSE) in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[INCOSE]] Resp Group|url=http://www.incose.org/about/genesis.aspx|title=Genesis of INCOSE | accessdate = 2006-07-11 | date=11 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools in several countries offer graduate programs in systems engineering, and [[continuing education]] options are also available for practicing engineers.&lt;ref name="edu_dir"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[INCOSE]] Education &amp; Research Technical Committee|url=http://www.incose.org/educationcareers/academicprogramdirectory.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221040623/http://www.incose.org/educationcareers/academicprogramdirectory.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-02-21|title=Directory of Systems Engineering Academic Programs|accessdate=2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems engineering signifies only an approach and, more recently, a discipline in engineering. The aim of education in systems engineering is to formalize various approaches simply and in doing so, identify new methods and research opportunities similar to that which occurs in other fields of engineering. As an approach, systems engineering is holistic and interdisciplinary in flavour.

===Origins and traditional scope===
The traditional scope of engineering embraces the conception, design, development, production and operation of physical systems. Systems engineering, as originally conceived, falls within this scope. "Systems engineering", in this sense of the term, refers to the distinctive set of concepts, methodologies, organizational structures (and so on) that have been developed to meet the challenges of engineering effective functional systems of unprecedented size and complexity within time, budget, and other constraints. The [[Apollo program]] is a leading example of a systems engineering project.

===Evolution to broader scope===
The use of the term "systems engineer" has evolved over time to embrace a wider, more holistic concept of "systems" and of engineering processes. This evolution of the definition has been a subject of ongoing controversy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.86.7496&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=The Case for Evolving Systems Engineering as a Field within Engineering Systems|author1=Donna Rhodes |author2=Daniel Hastings|publisher=MIT Engineering Systems Symposium|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term continues to apply to both the narrower and broader scope.

Traditional systems engineering was seen as a branch of engineering in the classical sense, that is, as applied only to physical systems, such as spacecraft and aircraft. More recently, systems engineering has evolved to a take on a broader meaning especially when humans were seen as an essential component of a system. Checkland, for example, captures the broader meaning of systems engineering by stating that 'engineering' "can be read in its general sense; you can engineer a meeting or a political agreement."&lt;ref name=Checkland&gt;{{cite book|author=Checkland, Peter|title=Systems Thinking, Systems Practice|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

Consistent with the broader scope of systems engineering, the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Checkland, Peter|title=Systems Thinking, Systems Practice|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1999}} 
Pyster, Arthur, ed. 2012. Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge. 1.0 ed: Stephens Institute and the Naval Postgraduate School.&lt;/ref&gt; has defined three types of systems engineering: (1) Product Systems Engineering (PSE) is the traditional systems engineering focused on the design of physical systems consisting of hardware and software. (2) Enterprise Systems Engineering (ESE) pertains to the view of enterprises, that is, organizations or combinations of organizations, as systems. (3) Service Systems Engineering (SSE) has to do with the engineering of service systems. Checkland&lt;ref name=Checkland/&gt; defines a service system as a system which is conceived as serving another system. Most civil infrastructure systems are service systems.

===Holistic view===
Systems engineering focuses on analyzing and eliciting customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem, the [[system lifecycle]]. This includes fully understanding all of the [[Project stakeholders|stakeholders]] involved. Oliver et al. claim that the systems engineering process can be decomposed into
* a ''Systems Engineering Technical Process'', and
* a ''Systems Engineering Management Process''.
Within Oliver's model, the goal of the Management Process is to organize the technical effort in the lifecycle, while the Technical Process includes ''assessing available information'', ''defining effectiveness measures'', to ''create a behavior model'', ''create a structure model'', ''perform trade-off analysis'', and ''create sequential build &amp; test plan''.&lt;ref name="Okk"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Oliver | first = David W. | authorlink = | author2 = Timothy P.

Depending on their application, although there are several models that are used in the industry, all of them aim to identify the relation between the various stages mentioned above and incorporate feedback. Examples of such models include the [[Waterfall model]] and the [[VEE model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gmu.edu/departments/seor/insert/robot/robot2.html | title = The SE VEE | publisher = SEOR, George Mason University | accessdate = 2007-05-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018220159/http://www.gmu.edu/departments/seor/insert/robot/robot2.html | archivedate = 18 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interdisciplinary field===
System development often requires contribution from diverse technical disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Ramo|first = Simon|author2=Robin K. St.Clair |authorlink = Simon Ramo|title = The Systems Approach: Fresh Solutions to Complex Problems Through Combining Science and Practical Common Sense|year = 1998| location = Anaheim, CA | publisher = KNI, Inc.| url = http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/DOC/SystemsApproach.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing a systems ([[Holism|holistic]]) view of the development effort, systems engineering helps mold all the technical contributors into a unified team effort, forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation and, in some cases, to termination and disposal. In an acquisition, the holistic integrative discipline combines contributions and balances tradeoffs among cost, schedule, and performance while maintaining an acceptable level of risk covering the entire life cycle of the item.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

This perspective is often replicated in educational programs, in that systems engineering courses are taught by faculty from other engineering departments, which helps create an interdisciplinary environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://systemseng.cornell.edu/people.html | title = Systems Engineering Program at Cornell University | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://esd.mit.edu/people/faculty.html | title= ESD Faculty and Teaching Staff | publisher = Engineering Systems Division, MIT | accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Managing complexity===
The need for systems engineering arose with the increase in complexity of systems and projects,&lt;ref&gt;Yassine, A. and Braha, D. (2003). [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/CERA.pdf “Complex Concurrent Engineering and the Design Structure Matrix Approach.”] Concurrent Engineering: Research and Applications 11 (3): 165-177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braha, D. and Bar-Yam, Y. (July 2007). [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/MS_July_07_Braha_Bar-yam.pdf “The Statistical Mechanics of Complex Product Development: Empirical and Analytical Results.”] Management Science 53 (7): 1127-1145.&lt;/ref&gt; in turn exponentially increasing the possibility of component friction, and therefore the unreliability of the design. When speaking in this context, complexity incorporates not only engineering systems, but also the logical human organization of data. At the same time, a system can become more complex due to an increase in size as well as with an increase in the amount of data, variables, or the number of fields that are involved in the design. The [[International Space Station]] is an example of such a system.

[[File:STS-134 International Space Station after undocking.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[International Space Station]] is an example of a largely complex system requiring Systems Engineering.]]

The development of smarter control algorithms, microprocessor design, and analysis of environmental systems also come within the purview of systems engineering. Systems engineering encourages the use of tools and methods to better comprehend and manage complexity in systems. Some examples of these tools can be seen here:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://systemseng.cornell.edu/CourseList.html | title=Core Courses, Systems Analysis&amp;nbsp;– Architecture, Behavior and Optimization | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[System architecture]]'',
* ''[[System model]], [[Scientific modelling|Modeling]], and [[Simulation]]'',
* ''[[Mathematical optimization|Optimization]]'',
* ''[[System dynamics]]'',
* ''[[Systems analysis]]'',
* ''[[Statistical analysis]]'',
* ''[[Reliability engineering|Reliability analysis]]'', and
* ''[[Decision making]]''

Taking an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to engineering systems is inherently complex since the [[behavior]] of and interaction among system components is not always immediately [[well defined]] or understood. Defining and characterizing such [[system]]s and subsystems and the interactions among them is one of the goals of systems engineering. In doing so, the gap that exists between informal requirements from users, operators, marketing organizations, and technical specifications is successfully bridged.

===Scope===
[[Image:SE Activities.jpg|left|thumb|400px|The scope of systems engineering activities&lt;ref name="SEF01"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/publications/publicationsDocs/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131231503/http://www.dau.mil/publications/publicationsdocs/sefguide%2001-01.pdf |date=31 January 2017 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One way to understand the motivation behind systems engineering is to see it as a method, or practice, to identify and improve common rules that exist within a wide variety of systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC&amp;pg=PA492&amp;lpg=PA492&amp;dq=One+way+to+understand+the+motivation+behind+systems+engineering+is+to+see+it+as+a+method,+or+practice,+to+identify+and+improve+common+rules+that+exist+within+a+wide+variety+of+systems.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g-qkKHewbh&amp;sig=i52JJqPEkh5acuo_0CWhNGrYKBg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU0deQmLjSAhVH1CYKHZYnAGsQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%20%22understand%20the%20motivation%20behind%20systems%20engineering%20is%20to%20see%20it%20as%20a%20method,%20or%20practice,%20to%20identify%20and%20improve%20common%20rules%20that%20exist%20within%20a%20wide%20variety%20of%20systems.%22&amp;f=false|title=Complexity and Dynamics|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping this in mind, the principles of systems engineering&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; holism, emergent behavior, boundary, et al.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; can be applied to any system, complex or otherwise, provided [[systems thinking]] is employed at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://incose.org.uk/Downloads/AA01.1.4_Principles%20&amp;%20practices%20of%20SE.pdf | format = PDF | title = Principles and Practices of Systems Engineering | author = Rick Adcock | publisher = INCOSE, UK | accessdate = 2007-06-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://incose.org.uk/Downloads/AA01.1.4_Principles%20%26%20practices%20of%20SE.pdf | archivedate = 15 June 2007 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides defense and aerospace, many information and technology based companies, software development firms, and industries in the field of electronics &amp; communications require systems engineers as part of their team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/seor/insert/intro/introsal.html | title=Systems Engineering, Career Opportunities and Salary Information (1994) | publisher=George Mason University | accessdate=2007-06-07 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922213853/http://www.gmu.edu/departments/seor/insert/intro/introsal.html | archivedate=22 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis by the INCOSE Systems Engineering center of excellence (SECOE) indicates that optimal effort spent on systems engineering is about 15-20% of the total project effort.&lt;ref name="SEvalue"/&gt; At the same time, studies have shown that systems engineering essentially leads to reduction in costs among other benefits.&lt;ref name="SEvalue"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.incose.org/secoe/0103/ValueSE-INCOSE04.pdf |format=PDF| title=Understanding the Value of Systems Engineering | accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no quantitative survey at a larger scale encompassing a wide variety of industries has been conducted until recently. Such studies are underway to determine the effectiveness and quantify the benefits of systems engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.splc.net/programs/acquisition-support/presentations/surveying.pdf |format=PDF| title=Surveying Systems Engineering Effectiveness | accessdate=2007-06-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://www.splc.net/programs/acquisition-support/presentations/surveying.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.valerdi.com/cosysmo/rvalerdi.doc | title= Systems Engineering Cost Estimation by Consensus | accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems engineering encourages the use of [[modeling and simulation]] to validate assumptions or theories on systems and the interactions within them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/003754970107600207| author = [[Andrew P.

Use of methods that allow early detection of possible failures, in [[safety engineering]], are integrated into the design process. At the same time, decisions made at the beginning of a project whose consequences are not clearly understood can have enormous implications later in the life of a system, and it is the task of the modern systems engineer to explore these issues and make critical decisions. No method guarantees today's decisions will still be valid when a system goes into service years or decades after first conceived. However, there are techniques that support the process of systems engineering. Examples include soft systems methodology, [[Jay Wright Forrester]]'s [[System dynamics]] method, and the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML)—all currently being explored, evaluated, and developed to support the engineering decision process.

==Education==
{{Main article|List of systems engineering at universities}}
Education in systems engineering is often seen as an extension to the regular engineering courses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gaudisite.nl/DidacticRecommendationsSESlides.pdf |format=PDF| title=Didactic Recommendations for Education in Systems Engineering | accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the industry attitude that engineering students need a foundational background in one of the traditional engineering disciplines (e.g., [[aerospace engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[industrial engineering]])—plus practical, real-world experience to be effective as systems engineers. Undergraduate university programs in systems engineering are rare. Typically, systems engineering is offered at the graduate level in combination with interdisciplinary study.

[[INCOSE]] maintains a continuously updated Directory of Systems Engineering Academic Programs worldwide.&lt;ref name="edu_dir"/&gt; As of 2009, there are about 80 institutions in United States that offer 165 undergraduate and graduate programs in systems engineering. Education in systems engineering can be taken as ''Systems-centric'' or ''Domain-centric''.
* ''Systems-centric'' programs treat systems engineering as a separate discipline and most of the courses are taught focusing on systems engineering principles and practice.
* ''Domain-centric'' programs offer systems engineering as an option that can be exercised with another major field in engineering.
Both of these patterns strive to educate the systems engineer who is able to oversee interdisciplinary projects with the depth required of a core-engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://sistemas.unmsm.edu.pe/occa/material/INCOSE-ABET-SE-SF-21Mar06.pdf |format=PDF| title = Perspectives of Systems Engineering Accreditation | publisher= [[INCOSE]] | accessdate=2007-06-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://sistemas.unmsm.edu.pe/occa/material/INCOSE-ABET-SE-SF-21Mar06.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems engineering topics==
Systems engineering tools are [[strategy|strategies]], [[Procedure (term)|procedures]], and [[wikt:technique|techniques]] that aid in performing systems engineering on a [[project]] or [[Product (business)|product]]. The purpose of these tools vary from database management, graphical browsing, simulation, and reasoning, to document production, neutral import/export and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marc.gatech.edu/events/pde2005/presentations/0.2-jenkins.pdf|format=PDF|title=A Future for Systems Engineering Tools|author=Steven Jenkins|publisher=NASA|page=15|accessdate=2007-06-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926044858/http://www.marc.gatech.edu/events/pde2005/presentations/0.2-jenkins.pdf|archivedate=26 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===System===
There are many definitions of what a [[system]] is in the field of systems engineering. Below are a few authoritative definitions:

* [[ANSI]]/[[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]-632-1999: "An aggregation of end products and enabling products to achieve a given purpose."&lt;ref&gt;"Processes for Engineering a System", ANSI/EIA-632-1999, [[ANSI]]/[[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]], 1999 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100705203209/http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ANSI%2fEIA-632-1999]&lt;/ref&gt;
* DAU Systems Engineering Fundamentals: "an integrated composite of people, products, and processes that provide a capability to satisfy a stated need or objective."
* [[IEEE]] Std 1220-1998: "A set or arrangement of elements and processes that are related and whose behavior satisfies customer/operational needs and provides for life cycle sustainment of the products."&lt;ref&gt;"Standard for Application and Management of the Systems Engineering Process -Description", IEEE Std 1220-1998, [[IEEE]], 1998 [http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/1220-1998_desc.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]] Systems Engineering Handbook: "homogeneous entity that exhibits predefined behavior in the real world and is composed of heterogeneous parts that do not individually exhibit that behavior and an integrated configuration of components and/or subsystems."&lt;ref&gt;"Systems Engineering Handbook", v3.1, [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]], 2007 [http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/products/sehandbook.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]]: "A system is a construct or collection of different elements that together produce results not obtainable by the elements alone. The elements, or parts, can include people, hardware, software, facilities, policies, and documents; that is, all things required to produce systems-level results. The results include system level qualities, properties, characteristics, functions, behavior and performance. The value added by the system as a whole, beyond that contributed independently by the parts, is primarily created by the relationship among the parts; that is, how they are interconnected."&lt;ref&gt;"A Consensus of the INCOSE Fellows", [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]], 2006 [http://www.incose.org/practice/fellowsconsensus.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ISO/IEC]] 15288:2008: "A combination of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purposes."&lt;ref&gt;"Systems and software engineering&amp;nbsp;– System life cycle processes", ISO/IEC 15288:2008, [[ISO/IEC]], 2008 [http://www.15288.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[NASA]] Systems Engineering Handbook: "(1) The combination of elements that function together to produce the capability to meet a need. The elements include all hardware, software, equipment, facilities, personnel, processes, and procedures needed for this purpose. (2) The end product (which performs operational functions) and enabling products (which provide life-cycle support services to the operational end products) that make up a system."&lt;ref&gt;"NASA Systems Engineering Handbook", Revision 1, NASA/SP-2007-6105, [[NASA]], 2007 [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080008301_2008008500.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The systems engineering process===
The systems engineering process encompasses all creative, manual and technical activities necessary to define the product and which need to be carried out to convert a system definition to a sufficiently detailed system design specification for product manufacture and deployment. Design and development of a system can be divided into four stages, each with different definitions:&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-55840-0|pp=6-7|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* task definition (informative definition),
* conceptual stage (cardinal definition),
* design stage (formative definition), and
* implementation stage (manufacturing definition).

Depending on their application, tools are used for various stages of the systems engineering process:&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;
:[[Image:Systems Engineering Process.jpg|600px|center]]

===Using models===
[[Abstract model|Model]]s play important and diverse roles in systems engineering. A model can be defined in several
ways, including:&lt;ref name="NASA95"&gt;NASA (1995). "System Analysis and Modeling Issues". In: '' [http://human.space.edu/old/docs/Systems_Eng_Handbook.pdf NASA Systems Engineering Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217005338/http://human.space.edu/old/docs/Systems_Eng_Handbook.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}'' June 1995. p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An abstraction of reality designed to answer specific questions about the real world
* An imitation, analogue, or representation of a real world process or structure; or
* A conceptual, mathematical, or physical tool to assist a decision maker.
Together, these definitions are broad enough to encompass physical engineering models used in the verification of a system design, as well as schematic models like a [[functional flow block diagram]] and mathematical (i.e., quantitative) models used in the trade study process. This section focuses on the last.&lt;ref name="NASA95"/&gt;

The main reason for using [[mathematical model]]s and [[mathematical diagram|diagrams]] in trade studies is to provide estimates of system effectiveness, performance or technical attributes, and cost from a set of known or estimable quantities. Typically, a collection of separate models is needed to provide all of these outcome variables. The heart of any mathematical model is a set of meaningful quantitative relationships among its inputs and outputs. These relationships can be as simple as adding up constituent quantities to obtain a total, or as complex as a set of differential equations describing the trajectory of a spacecraft in a gravitational field. Ideally, the relationships express causality, not just correlation.&lt;ref name="NASA95"/&gt; Furthermore, key to successful systems engineering activities are also the methods with which these models are efficiently and effectively managed and used to simulate the systems. However, diverse domains often present recurring problems of modeling and simulation for systems engineering, and new advancements are aiming to crossfertilize methods among distinct scientific and engineering communities, under the title of 'Modeling &amp; Simulation-based Systems Engineering'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gianni|editor1-first=Daniele|editor2-last=D'Ambrogio|editor2-first=Andrea|editor3-last=Tolk|editor3-first=Andreas|title=Modeling and Simulation-Based Systems Engineering Handbook|date=4 December 2014|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781466571457|pages=513|edition=1st|url=http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781466571457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modeling formalisms and graphical representations===
Initially, when the primary purpose of a systems engineer is to comprehend a complex problem, graphic representations of a system are used to communicate a system's functional and data requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.vitechcorp.com/resources/technical_papers/200701031634430.CommonGraphicalRepresentations_2002.pdf |format=PDF| title = Relationships between Common Graphical Representations in System Engineering | last=Long | first=Jim| publisher=[[Vitech Corporation]] | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common graphical representations include:
* [[Functional flow block diagram]] (FFBD)
* [[Model-based design]]
* [[Data flow diagram]] (DFD)
* [[N2 chart]]
* [[IDEF0|IDEF0 diagram]]
* [[Use case|Use case diagram]]
* [[Sequence diagram]]
* [[Block diagram]]
* [[Signal-flow graph]]
* [[Universal Systems Language#Formalism for a theory of control|USL function maps and type maps]]
* [[Enterprise architecture framework]]s
* [[Model-based systems engineering]]

A graphical representation relates the various subsystems or parts of a system through functions, data, or interfaces. Any or each of the above methods are used in an industry based on its requirements. For instance, the N2 chart may be used where interfaces between systems is important. Part of the design phase is to create structural and behavioral models of the system.

Once the requirements are understood, it is now the responsibility of a systems engineer to refine them, and to determine, along with other engineers, the best technology for a job. At this point starting with a trade study, systems engineering encourages the use of weighted choices to determine the best option. A [[decision matrix]], or Pugh method, is one way ([[Quality function deployment|QFD]] is another) to make this choice while considering all criteria that are important. The trade study in turn informs the design, which again affects graphic representations of the system (without changing the requirements). In an SE process, this stage represents the iterative step that is carried out until a feasible solution is found. A decision matrix is often populated using techniques such as statistical analysis, reliability analysis, system dynamics (feedback control), and optimization methods.

===Other tools===
[[Systems Modeling Language]] (SysML), a modeling language used for systems engineering applications, supports the specification, analysis, design, verification and validation of a broad range of complex systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sysml.org/docs/specs/OMGSysML-FAS-06-05-04.pdf |format=PDF| title = OMG SysML Specification |page = 23 | publisher=SysML Open Source Specification Project | accessdate=2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lifecycle Modeling Language]] (LML), is an open-standard modeling language designed for systems engineering that supports the full lifecycle: conceptual, utilization, support and retirement stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lifecyclemodeling.org/spec/LML_Specification_1_0.pdf |format=PDF | title = LML Specification |page = 4 | publisher=LML Steering Committee | accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields and sub-fields==
Many related fields may be considered tightly coupled to systems engineering. The following areas have contributed to the development of systems engineering as a distinct entity:
;Cognitive systems engineering
:Cognitive systems engineering (CSE) is a specific approach to the description and analysis of human-machine systems or [[sociotechnical systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollnagel E. &amp; Woods D. D. (1983). Cognitive systems engineering: New wine in new bottles. International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 18, 583-600.&lt;/ref&gt; The three main themes of CSE are how humans cope with complexity, how work is accomplished by the use of artifacts, and how human-machine systems and socio-technical systems can be described as joint cognitive systems. CSE has since its beginning become a recognized scientific discipline, sometimes also referred to as [[cognitive engineering]]. The concept of a Joint Cognitive System (JCS) has in particular become widely used as a way of understanding how complex socio-technical systems can be described with varying degrees of resolution. The more than 20 years of experience with CSE has been described extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Hollnagel, E. &amp; Woods, D. D. (2005) Joint cognitive systems: The foundations of cognitive systems engineering. Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woods, D. D. &amp; Hollnagel, E. (2006). Joint cognitive systems: Patterns in cognitive systems engineering. Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Configuration management
:Like systems engineering, [[configuration management]] as practiced in the [[defence industry|defense]] and [[aerospace industry]] is a broad systems-level practice.  The field parallels the taskings of systems engineering; where systems engineering deals with requirements development, allocation to development items and verification, configuration management deals with requirements capture, traceability to the development item, and audit of development item to ensure that it has achieved the desired functionality that systems engineering and/or Test and Verification Engineering have proven out through objective testing.
;Control engineering
:[[Control engineering]] and its design and implementation of [[control systems]], used extensively in nearly every industry, is a large sub-field of systems engineering. The cruise control on an automobile and the guidance system for a ballistic missile are two examples. Control systems theory is an active field of applied mathematics involving the investigation of solution spaces and the development of new methods for the analysis of the control process.
;Industrial engineering
:[[Industrial engineering]] is a branch of [[engineering]] that concerns the development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, material and process. Industrial engineering draws upon the principles and methods of engineering analysis and synthesis, as well as mathematical, physical and social sciences together with the principles and methods of engineering analysis and design to specify, predict, and evaluate results obtained from such systems.
;Interface design
:[[Interface design]] and its specification are concerned with assuring that the pieces of a system connect and inter-operate with other parts of the system and with external systems as necessary. Interface design also includes assuring that system interfaces be able to accept new features, including mechanical, electrical and logical interfaces, including reserved wires, plug-space, command codes and bits in communication protocols.  This is known as [[extensibility]]. [[Human-Computer Interaction]] (HCI) or Human-Machine Interface (HMI) is another aspect of interface design, and is a critical aspect of modern systems engineering. Systems engineering principles are applied in the [[network protocol design principles|design of network protocols]] for [[local-area networks]] and [[wide-area networks]].
;Mechatronic engineering
:[[Mechatronic engineering]], like systems engineering, is a multidisciplinary field of engineering that uses dynamical systems modeling to express tangible constructs. In that regard it is almost indistinguishable from Systems Engineering, but what sets it apart is the focus on smaller details rather than larger generalizations and relationships. As such, both fields are distinguished by the scope of their projects rather than the methodology of their practice.
;Operations research
:[[Operations research]] supports systems engineering. The tools of operations research are used in systems analysis, decision making, and trade studies. Several [[List of systems engineering at universities|schools teach SE courses]] within the [[operations research]] or [[industrial engineering]] department,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; highlighting the role systems engineering plays in complex projects. [[Operations research]], briefly, is concerned with the optimization of a process under multiple constraints.&lt;ref&gt;(see articles for discussion: [http://www.boston.com/globe/search/stories/reprints/operationeverything062704.html] and {{cite web |url=http://www.sas.com/news/sascom/2004q4/feature_tech.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050920174512/http://www.sas.com/news/sascom/2004q4/feature_tech.html |archivedate=20 September 2005 |df=dmy-all }})&lt;/ref&gt;
;Performance engineering
:[[Performance engineering]] is the discipline of ensuring a system meets customer expectations for performance throughout its life. Performance is usually defined as the speed with which a certain operation is executed, or the capability of executing a number of such operations in a unit of time. Performance may be degraded when operations queued to execute is throttled by limited system capacity. For example, the performance of a [[packet-switched network]] is characterized by the end-to-end packet transit delay, or the number of packets switched in an hour. The design of high-performance systems uses analytical or simulation modeling, whereas the delivery of high-performance implementation involves thorough performance testing. Performance engineering relies heavily on [[statistics]], [[queueing theory]] and [[probability theory]] for its tools and processes.
;Program management and project management
:[[Program management]] (or programme management) has many similarities with systems engineering, but has broader-based origins than the engineering ones of systems engineering.  [[Project management]] is also closely related to both program management and systems engineering.
;Proposal engineering
:Proposal engineering is the application of scientific and mathematical principles to design, construct, and operate a cost-effective proposal development system. Basically, proposal engineering uses the "[[systems engineering process]]" to create a cost effective proposal and increase the odds of a successful proposal.
;Reliability engineering
:[[Reliability engineering]] is the discipline of ensuring a system meets customer expectations for reliability throughout its life; i.e., it does not fail more frequently than expected. Next to prediction of failure, it is just as much about prevention of failure. Reliability engineering applies to all aspects of the system. It is closely associated with [[maintainability]], [[availability]] ([[dependability]] or [[RAMS]] preferred by some), and [[logistic engineering|logistics engineering]]. Reliability engineering is always a critical component of safety engineering, as in [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure modes and effects analysis]] (FMEA) and [[fault tree|hazard fault tree]] analysis, and of [[security engineering]].
;Risk Management
:[[Risk Management]], the practice of assessing and dealing with [[risk]] is one of the interdisciplinary parts of Systems Engineering. In development, acquisition, or operational activities, the inclusion of risk in tradeoff with cost, schedule, and performance features, involves the iterative complex configuration management of traceability and evaluation to the scheduling and requirements management across domains and for the [[system lifecycle]] that requires the interdisciplinary technical approach of systems engineering. Systems Engineering has Risk Management define, tailor, implement, and monitor a structured process for risk management which is integrated to the overall effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

;Safety engineering
:The techniques of [[safety engineering]] may be applied by non-specialist engineers in designing complex systems to minimize the probability of safety-critical failures. The "System Safety Engineering" function helps to identify "safety hazards" in emerging designs, and may assist with techniques to "mitigate" the effects of (potentially) hazardous conditions that cannot be designed out of systems.
;Scheduling
: [[Schedule (project management)|Scheduling]] is one of the systems engineering support tools as a practice and item in assessing interdisciplinary concerns under configuration management.  In particular the direct relationship of resources, performance features, and risk to duration of a task or the dependency links among tasks and impacts across the [[system lifecycle]] are systems engineering concerns.
;Security engineering
: [[Security engineering]] can be viewed as an [[interdisciplinary]] field that integrates the [[community of practice]] for control systems design, reliability, safety and systems engineering.  It may involve such sub-specialties as [[authentication]] of system users, system targets and others: people, objects and processes.
;Software engineering
:From its beginnings, [[software engineering]] has helped shape modern systems engineering practice. The techniques used in the handling of the complexities of large software-intensive systems have had a major effect on the shaping and reshaping of the tools, methods and processes of Software Engineering.

The '''Thomas-Institut''' is a research Institute whose function it is to serve the study of medieval philosophy by preparing critical editions and historical and systematic studies of medieval authors.

==General information==
The Thomas-Institut was founded in 1950 by Josef Koch, then Professor for medieval philosophy at the [[University of Cologne]]. Forming part of the Faculty of Humanities and, more particularly, the [http://www.philosophie.uni-koeln.de Philosophy Department], the Thomas-Institut is a research Institute whose function it is to serve the study of medieval philosophy by preparing critical editions and historical and systematic studies of medieval authors. The director of the Institute is the professor holding the chair in [[medieval philosophy]] at the university.

Since communicating the results of this work is an essential part of the task of the Institute, the staff gives various courses in medieval philosophy at the University of Cologne. Jointly with twenty other departments - from History and Philology to Byzantine, Jewish and Islamic Studies - the Thomas-Institute organizes an extensive programme for medieval studies, the Zentrum für Mittelalterstudien ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070813081645/http://www.zfms.uni-koeln.de/ ZfMs]).

Since its beginnings the Thomas-Institut has attached importance to international cooperation and exchange, and many of the projects pursued at the Thomas-Institut are international collaborations. The Mediaevistentagung, taking place every two years, has become one of the foremost conferences on medieval studies in Europe, furthering international and interdisciplinary research. The proceedings are published in the Miscellanea Mediaevalia series, edited by the Institute and published by de Gruyter.

In addition to its own projects the Thomas-Institut sponsors several ongoing editions which are funded and organized by other institutions. The most important at present are the [[Averroes]] Latinus project of the International Union of Academies, funded by the Nordrhein-Westfäische Akademie der Wissenschaften, and the critical edition of the works of Nicolaus [[Cusanus]] with the Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften. The Thomas-Institut likewise participates in the [[Aristoteles]] Latinus project organized by the International Union of Academies, it hosts the [[Meister Eckhart]] Archiv and has recently started the critical edition of [[Durandus of St. Pourçain]].

Since its beginnings the Thomas-Institut has edited the Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters (STGMA) published by Brill, one of the most renowned series in medieval philosophy and medieval studies. In 1997, together with the [http://www.hiw.kuleuven.be De Wulf-Mansion Centre in Leuven], the Thomas-Institut took over the journal Recherches de Théologie et Philosophie médiévales.

== Research ==

=== Main areas of expertise ===
* Conditions of Scientific Discourse in Medieval Arabic, Hebrew, Byzantine and Latin Culture

Scientific discourse in the Middle Ages has its common ground in the reception of Greek learning from late Antiquity. It is diversified, however, according to the sociological and institutional as well as religious and theological framework in which Greek science is integrated. Besides that, the processes of rationalisation taking place in various fields of knowledge exercise a considerable influence. Key-words like "Reception of [[Dionysus|Dionysius]]", "Reception of [[Aristotle]]", and "[[Averroism]]" refer us to a complex structure of medieval bodies of knowledge. This structure has to be understood as the result of far-reaching processes of reception and transformation, transmission and translation. Inquiries in this area demand a combination of philosophical, philological, and historiographical competences. Research at the Thomas-Institut focuses on the contexts of transmission, on the attempts to define the meaning of "philosophy" (for example in the relationship of "Philosophy and Wisdom"), and on the formation of [[epistemology|epistemological]] and institutional canons.

* Intellect, Mind and Soul: Concepts, Stratifications and Boundaries. A Critical Evaluation of the Medieval Debates

The debate on intellect, mind and soul is currently one of those philosophical topics generating the most innovative questions. Medieval philosophy is of central importance in this respect, since it furnishes a rich tradition of investigation in this area. The problem was dealt with in all the medieval philosophical and theological cultures and languages. While differences abounded in every milieu, some solutions were adopted across boundaries. The medieval contribution is interesting from the point of view of the history of ideas, but the reception of traditions from Antiquity also engendered new theories. The confrontation of these theories in epistemological debates from the 13th century to the Renaissance lead to the development of new models. One may think for instance of "augustinisme avicennisant", the Averroistic theory of intellect, and the combination of Aristotelian and [[pseudo-Dionysian]] noetics. When one examines the modern debate on the background just sketched, it becomes clear that medieval philosophy provides models and perspectives both richer in arguments and truly interdisciplinary. This topic has already been made the object of research by an international network of institutions working on medieval philosophy (the [http://www.egsamp.uni-koeln.de EGSAMP] members Leuven, Amsterdam, Pisa, Lecce, Bari, Sofia) in which the Thomas-Institut participates.

=== Ongoing Research Projects ===
* The Relationship between Philosophy and Wisdom
** Philosophy and Wisdom in the Middle Ages
A Contribution to the Development of the Western Concept of Philosophy
Behind the terminological opposition of philosophy and wisdom, into whose reasons this project enquires, emerges another problem: the origin of philosophy. Thus the medieval debate is representative of a basic discourse, which always anew attempts to determine the essence of philosophy. The Middle Ages, and especially the 13th century are of prime importance for the reconstruction of the affaire de cœur of philosophy and wisdom. In the second half of this century the reception of an Aristotelian idea of philosophical wisdom sparks a major controversy about the identity of philosophy, a controversy that presages many of the questions asked in the modern era. The results which have been reached in a number of case-studies will be assembled and assessed in context.

** "Rhizomatics": the Art of Living and Wisdom as Bridges for a Transcultural Philosophy 
In this project "rhizomatics" and nomadism as developed by the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari are employed to address transcultural issues. At the heart of this project are the concept of philosophy, its relation to wisdom, methodology and ethics and possible forms and constructions of philosophy. Besides the French and German Literature on Deleuze the project will take into account the reception and resonance of his ideas in Spanish-American thought.

** New Perspectives in the Historiography of Medieval Philosophy 
What is medieval philosophy? This question has been answered in a variety of ways even before Gilson's influential attempts to give a definitive reply. Such answers are always bound up with a certain idea of philosophy and its resulting mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion. But if one takes into account the dynamics proper to different cultural frameworks which transferred the philosophical inheritance from late Antiquity into modernity, one must try to describe its interactions more closely, disregarding the classical narratives of medieval philosophy. In order to realise this, new methodological approaches will be attempted. This project forms part of the InterLink-project (Bari-Köln-Sofia-Leuven-Paris) "Soggetto e statuto della filosofia nel Medioevo. Nuove prospettive di ricerca nell'edizione critica dei testi e nelle metodologie di indagine storiografica".

* Thomas Aquinas in Philosophical Context
** Thomas Aquinas, In librum Beati Dionysii De divinis nominibus expositione, Book IV, Lectiones 1-10 
Thomas Aquinas's commentary on Dionysius is an exemplary case for the study of the encounter of the Latin and the Byzantine Middle Ages. Of special interest are Thomas's first ten "Lectiones" on the fourth book of his model. Here, central themes of [[Neoplatonism]] are treated: the Good, light, beauty, and love. A translation and commentary on the basis of a revised Latin text is in preparation.

** Edith Stein's Translations of Aquinas's Works De veritate and De ente et essentia 
Edith Stein's translations of Aquinas are not only an important document for the intellectual development of Husserl's former assistant but also show in an exemplary case the encounter of Neoscholasticism and modern philosophy at the beginning of the 20th century. In the framework of the new edition of the works of Edith Stein her translation of the Quaestiones disputatae de veritate and her yet unpublished translation of De ente et essential will be edited alongside a number of further "Thomistica" ([http://www.herder.de/theologie/programm/edith_stein/index_html?par_onl_struktur=704728&amp;onl_struktur=704736 ESGA 24]). 
** Thomas Aquinas, Quaestio disputata "De libero arbitrio" (De malo VI) 
This text is a key to understanding Aquinas's teaching on free choice as foundation of truly human, that is to say responsible and autonomous action. A German translation of this text on the basis of the Editio Leonina is currently in preparation and will be published, together with an extensive introduction, by Reclam.

* The Medieval Theory of Transcendentals 
The project is dedicated to the historical development of the theory of transcendentals from its formation in the thirteenth century (Philip the Chancellor) up to its treatment in the Disputationes metaphysicae by Francesco Suárez. It likewise deals with the significance of the theory of transcendentals for medieval philosophy in general.

* The "Super"-Transcendental and the Splitting of Metaphysics 
In search of the origins and motives of the splitting of metaphysics in the 17th and 18th century into a ''metaphysica generalis'' and ''metaphysica specialis'', conceived for the first time by [[Francis of Marchia]] at the beginning of the 14th century, this project enquires into the relationship between the first object of the human intellect and the proper object of metaphysics as they present themselves in conceptions of metaphysics after the time of Duns Scotus. Especially the attempt to define the primum obiectum intellectus as "super-transcendental" has a constitutive function for the legitimating of a twofold metaphysics.

* Radicalisation in lieu of Abolition of the Science of Being. On the Development of First Philosophy from the Late Middle Ages to the 18th Century 
According to the account of the development of first philosophy predominant today, this discipline underwent a transformation since the late Middle Ages, in the course of which the Aristotelian theory of being was dissolved and reformed as an onto-logic of that which can be thought, thus immediately preparing Kant's transcendental philosophy. This interpretation needs to be revised in order to show that the said transformation did not exceed the boundaries of the traditional concept of science. On the contrary, in the teachings of the main representatives of the discipline up to Wolff and Baumgarten one finds a new concept of the theory of being as a theory of the universal and necessary structure of reality which is common to God and every possible world. Thus we do not encounter abolition but rather a radicalisation of tendencies which have shaped the development of first philosophy since the medieval reception of Aristotle and his Arabic interpreters. These tendencies are: the turn from a theological to an ontological concept of first philosophy, from its conception as practical wisdom to the idea of a universal theoretical science, from transcendent being as the starting point of thought to the transcategorical and thus transcendental content of being as such.

* Master Eckhart: Historical and Systematical Perspectives 
As part of the research on the medieval theory of transcendentia, this project examines the peculiar form which the theory of transcendentals takes in Meister Eckhart. The project attempts at the same time to reconstruct Eckhart's Opus propositionum, especially the 9th tractate: "De natura superioris, et inferioris eius oppositi".

* A Mystical Treatise between Convention and Provocation - Possibilities and Limits of Expression in the "Theologia deutsch" ("The Francfurt") 
The treatise written in the 14th century which became popular in the 16th under the title Theologia deutsch, has been considered in scholarship mainly from two perspectives: on the one hand as a key text of the Reformation - it was first edited by Martin Luther - on the other hand as a document of timeless Christian spirituality that can inspire and direct even the life of modern readers. Both approaches have invested the Theologia deutsch with an aura which obfuscates its specific theologico-philosophical profile. Originally it was an anonymous treatise from the context of the so-called "German Mysticism" of the 14th century, transmitted in only a few manuscripts. This is where the planned investigation begins: Disregarding its reception during the Reformation, the Theologia deutsch is examined it its original formative context and thus as a mystical treatise of a special type, which does not at all transmit a timeless spirituality but rather - like other Latin and colloquial texts - sounds out possibilities of expression. The study centres on the Christology and the doctrine of God of the Theologia deutsch. Besides that it discusses - since according to the prologue the author was an anonymous Knight of the German Order from Francfurt - the problems of authorship, authority, and authenticity.

* [[William of Auxerre]], Summa de officiis ecclesiasticis, *[http://ti-intern.uni-koeln.de/sdoe/ First Critical Edition in Digital Format]
In the beginnings of the University of Paris around the year 1200 the Magister William of Auxerre wrote his explanation of liturgy which attempts to elucidate all the cultic-ritual actions and objects of Christian liturgy and to suggest their hidden meaning. The edition of the yet unpublished Summa de officiis ecclesiasticis makes use of the possibilities of digital data processing and further develops in this medium the methodological standards and formats of presentation established for printed editions. The edition is accompanied by a study on the concept of time which forms the basis of William's interpretation of the liturgy and according to which several levels of time and meaning become intertwined during the ritual.

* Ibn Bâjja's Kitâb al-nafs: The First Western Commentary on the De anima 
Ibn Bâjja (ob. 1139), known to the Latin scholastics as "Avempace", was - as the predecessor of Averroes - the first Spanish-Arabic philosopher to comment in a systematical manner upon the writings of Aristotle. Thus he prepared the work of "the Commentator" with respect to both method and content. This is true especially in the field of psychology and the doctrine of intellect where Ibn Bâjja, as a follower of Alexander of Aphrodisias and Alfarabi, formed an Aristotelian counterbalance to the psychology of Avicenna, which was more strongly influenced by Neoplatonism and by the medical tradition. With the preparation of the critical edition and German translation of the Kitâb al-nafs Ibn Bâjja's most central writing on psychology shall be rendered accessible in a reliable form supplemented with guides to its sources. The edition will be accompanied by a study which - for the first time - examines in detail the philosophical questions and solutions of this early period of the reception of De anima. It enquires into the conceptual and historical background of problems like the concept of intention (ma'nâ) or the so-called "conjunction with the Active Intellect" - ideas which came to exercise a longstanding and varied influence.

* "The Birth of a World". Investigations into Themes in the Thought of Michel Foucault 
Starting from an analysis of the opposition of truth and fiction dictated by the traditional idea of philosophy and science, and an examination of the concomitant confrontation of philosophy and science on the one hand and literature on the other hand this study investigates the peculiar status which Michel Foucault gives to the concept of knowledge. This concept of knowledge corresponds in Foucault's writings to a specific concept of fiction in a way that has yet to be clearly defined. To this end Foucault's early texts (apparently dismissed by him later), the long Binswanger-introduction (1954), and the Archéologie du savoir are all searched for a motif which can be called - employing an expression by Foucault himself - the "Birth of a World". The investigation into this theme renders visible elements of "structure" and "history". In the course of this reading the evolution of the foundational thought-structures leading to Foucault's specific concept of knowledge will be examined.

=== Edition Projects ===
* The Commentary on the Sentences by Durandus of St. Pourçain (a S. Porciano) 
As J. Koch has shown, the commentary on the Sentences by Durandus of St. Pourçain (1275–1334) is preserved in three recensions. While the last redaction was printed in the 16th century, the first two versions remain unpublished. Of particular interest is the first, because it contains the sharpest polemic against Thomas Aquinas and because it engendered the most critical response by his contemporaries (such as Petrus de Palude and Petrus Aureoli). In the first place a computerised copy of the third version will be made, which can serve as an effective research instrument. The project centres, nevertheless, on the critical edition of the first version which will be made on the basis of a complete collation of all manuscripts.

* Critical Edition of the Commentaries on Book V and VI of the Nicomachean Ethics in the Latin Translation by Robert Grosseteste 
The project consists in the study of the Latin reception of the commentaries on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics composed and assembled in twelfth century Constantinople at the initiative of Princess Anna Comnena. The critical edition of the texts of the commentaries on book V (Anonymous and [[Michael of Ephesus]]) and book VI ([[Eustratius of Nicaea]]) will complete Mercken's edition of the commentaries on books I-IV (CLCAG 6.1) and VII-X (CLCAG 6.3). The edition of the text will be introduced by a study of the sources of the Greek original text and its Latin reception in the thirteenth and fourteenth century.

* Averroes: Collected Works 
The Latin translation of three of the most important works of Averroes, the Long Commentaries on De caelo, Physica, and Metaphysica, will be edited and published in the series "Bibliotheca" affiliated with the Recherches de Théologie et Philosophie médiévales. This "editio minor" is based on the early printings and some few manuscripts. It is further intended to make these commentaries eventually available on CD-Rom. The edition of the Long Commentary on De caelo on the basis of F. Carmody's edition, revised by R. Arnzen, has already been published. At the moment the edition of the Long Commentary on the Metaphysica (by Dag N. Hasse, Würzburg) and of the Long Commentary on the Physica are in preparation.

=== Collaborations ===
* Historical-Critical Edition of the Arabic-Latin Translations of Averroes's (Ibn Rushd's) Commentaries on Aristotle 
This project forms part of the edition of the Opera omnia, supervised by the International Union of Academies (Director: Gerhard Endress; responsible for the Averroes Latinus: Andreas Speer). It is funded by the Nordrhein-Westfälische Akademie der Wissenschaften.

** Middle Commentary on the Categoriae 
This Middle Commentary on the Categoriae forms part of the group of Middle Commentaries which Averroes devoted to the Organon and whose Latin translation is attributed to William of Luna. Prepared by a large number of publications, the work currently in progress continues the edition of the Middle Commentary on Peri Hermeneias which has already been published. At the moment the text is prepared for printing, the apparatus and the Latin-Arabic glossary are being adapted to the definite text. At the same time some parts of the introduction are developed further; for example, the question whether there were any double translations is examined, as is the Hebrew-Latin translation from the Renaissance. Did its author, Jacob Mantino, make use of the medieval Arabic-Latin translation or its editio princeps?

** Long Commentary on the Physica 
Averroes completed his Long Commentary on the Physics around the year 1186. Like a number of other works by Averroes, it was translated from Arabic to Latin at the beginning of the 13th century, most probably by Michael Scot. More than sixty medieval manuscripts, complete and fragmentary, preserve the versio vulgata of the text. The detailed documentation of its textual history evolves continually. With the exception of a few manuscripts the dependences and interrelations in the manuscript tradition have been established on the basis of a comparison of approximately 1100 positions. The results concerning the filiation of the manuscripts can thus be established.

** Long Commentary on the Physica, Book VII, according to Ms. Vienna, Austrian National Library, Lat. 2334 
In the manuscript of the Austrian National Library, Vienna lat. 2334, the seventh and part of the eight book of the Long Commentary are preserved in a translation which differs considerably from the one by Michel Scot, both in vocabulary and in syntax. This text will be edited separately. In order to prove that the translator was not Michel Scot, but probably Hermannus Alemannus, this edition will be accompanied by a detailed comparison of technical terms and of important portions of the text. The study has been approved by the Nordrhein-Westfälische Akademie and will be published by F. Schöningh, Paderborn ({{ISBN|978-3-506-76316-7}})

** Arabic Concepts of Metaphysics, Considering in particular Averroes's Epitome on Aristotle's Metaphysics 
The project comprises two parts: First, a historical-critical edition of the Arabic text of Averroes's Epitome on the Metaphysics which is based on all available Arabic manuscripts and which takes into account the Hebrew translation from the 13th century, as well as the Latin translation from the 16th based on the latter. The edition will be introduced by a philological study and accompanied by an English translation, in order to render the text available for a larger group of scholars in medieval philosophy. The second part consists in a historical and philosophical analysis of Arabic concepts of metaphysics, its foundations, objects, parts, and methods. Averroes's concept of metaphysics will be investigated in the historical and philosophical context of competing ideas. Of special interest is the question whether in the post-Avicennian tradition metaphysics was conceived as ontology and/or universal science in contradistinction from theology.

** Averroes-Database 
The bibliography of secondary literature on Averroes published since 1980 contains at present 1043 titles. It is constantly updated and accessible via internet. The bibliography of Averroes's works provides information on the relevant manuscripts, editions, and translations. It is still in preparation, but the sections on Logic, Philosophy of Nature, Psychology and the Doctrine of Intellect are already [online http://www.thomasinst.uni-koeln.de/averroes].

* Historical-Critical Edition of Aristotle's Meteorology in the Latin Translation by William of Moerbeke 
This project is part of the Aristoteles Latinus, edited by the International Union of Academies and directed by Carlos Steel. The Latin text of the Meteorology has already been published on the CD-ROM version of the Aristoteles Latinus (Édition CD-ROM des traductions gréco-latines d'Aristote) in 2003.

* Historical-Critical Edition of Book I and II of the Commentary on the Physics by Aegidius Romanus 
The Augustinian monk Aegidius Romanus (ca. 1243/7-1316) was a prominent figure at the University of Paris in the late 13th century. His philosophical works consist mainly in commentaries on Aristotle. In the late 13th and during the 14th century Aegidius's commentaries were well known; their impact can be compared with the paraphrases by Albert the Great and the commentaries by Thomas Aquinas. This project centres on the edition of book I and II of his commentary on the Physics (ca. 1274/75). They are devoted to some central issues in Aristotle's philosophy of nature, namely the problems of the principles of change, the concept of nature, and the concepts of necessity and chance. Aegidius's commentary is extant in thirty manuscripts. The manuscript tradition is complex because it is partly a University tradition, dependent on one exemplar from the university milieu, and partly independent. The text of books I and II has been established on the basis of eight manuscripts, and the sources have been traced. At present the historical and philological introduction is in preparation. The edition will be part of Aegidii Romani Opera omnia, edited by the Unione Accademica Nazionale, directed by Francesco Del Punta.

== History ==
The foundation of the Thomas-Institut on October 10, 1950, grew out of efforts to reinstall a centre for the study of medieval philosophy in Germany after World War II, one that would be able to inspire research into a philosophical tradition representing positive ideas and humanistic values. It was hoped that the discussion of the problems of our time would benefit from the results of such studies. Nevertheless, the Thomas-Institut was not conceived as part of the movement of [[Neo-Scholasticism]], but rather as an institution which would conduct research in medieval philosophy much in the same way that elsewhere research in ancient and modern philosophy was done - never as a narrowly historical enterprise, but always in touch with contemporary questions and perspectives.

Josef Koch (1885–1967), then one of the rare German scholars internationally renowned in the field of medieval philosophy, had been chosen in 1948 to become a professor at the University of Cologne with a view to the Institute's founding. In close connection with the founding of the Institute stood the creation of the Mediaevistentagung, and the series Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters, both of which were devised by Koch and are still carried on today.

The development of the Institute was boosted by a grant from the American High Commissioner for Germany, arranged by Professor John O. Riedl of the Educational and Cultural Relation Division, and later of Marquette University in Milwaukee - a personal friend of founder Josef Koch. The Institute was able to move into three rooms in Universitätsstraße 22, where later it was allowed to expand considerably, and where it is still housed today. Since 1952 the Thomas-Institut has been maintained by the University of Cologne and has become an integral part of the Philosophy Department.

The first tasks of the newly created Institute consisted in building up a research library and in procuring the necessary microfilm copies of medieval manuscripts in order to render critical editions possible. The collection concentrated at first on [[Meister Eckhart]] and Nicolaus [[Cusanus]], who were then studied by Koch and editions of whose works were prepared at the Institute in continuation of projects begun before the war. The fund of manuscript copies grew steadily and was enriched by every new project. The library was designed to include not only primary texts from the Middle Ages and bibliographical material but a historical section spanning from Antiquity to contemporary philosophy that permits the systematic studies intended by the aims described in 1950.

In 1954 Koch was succeeded in the director's office by Paul Wilpert (1906–1967), an expert in [[Aristotle]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] and already affiliated with the [[Cusanus]] edition since the 1940s. It was Wilpert who created the Miscellanea Mediaevalia series in 1962, thus providing an organ for the publications of the Institute, first and foremost the proceedings of the Mediaevistentagungen. In 1961 Wilpert organized in Cologne the 2nd International Congress of Medieval Philosophy of the Société internationale pour l'Étude de la Philosophie Médiévale ([[S.I.E.P.M]]), whose vice chairman he had become in the founding year of the organization, 1958. With the activities of Wilpert's collaborator, Gudrun Vuillemin-Diem, the Thomas-Institut took part in the Aristoteles Latinus project of the International Union of Academies. Ms. Vuillemin-Diem has continued working with the Thomas-Institut under its subsequent directors, and has published to date the four medieval recensions of the Metaphysics.

After Wilpert's sudden death, Albert Zimmermann (1928–2017), a pupil of Josef Koch's, became the third director of the Thomas-Institut. His fields of research are especially the Aristotelian philosophy of nature in the Middle Ages and Latin Averroism. When the International Union of Academies took over the Averrois Opera project from the Medieval Academy of America, Zimmermann became its general editor in 1974 (until 1996) and the Thomas-Institut took the responsibility for the edition of the Latin translations of Averroes's commentaries. The project currently employs two editors, Roland Hissette and Horst Schmieja, and is funded by the Nordrhein-Westfälische Akademie der Wissenschaften. In 1992 Zimmermann was elected president of the [[S.I.E.P.M]].

Zimmermann retired in 1993 and was followed in office in 1994 by Jan Adrianus Aertsen, formerly a professor at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (since 1984).  His main area of research is the history of the Doctrine of Transcendentals.  In 1997 Aertsen was elected vice chairman of the [[S.I.E.P.M]]. The 4th Symposium Averroicum, combined with the sixth conference of the editors of Averroes's works, was held in Cologne in 1996 in collaboration with Gerhard Endreß (Bochum). In 1997 the Thomas-Institut under the lead of Jan A. Aertsen and Andreas Speer organized the 10th International Congress of Medieval Philosophy in Erfurt. Following a suggestion by Jan A. Aertsen and a conference in Cologne co-organized by the Thomas-Institut, a Gesellschaft für Philosophie des Mittelalters und der Renaissance ([http://www.gpmr.uni-koeln.de GPMR]) was set up in 2003, for which the Thomas-Institut currently provides the office.

The present director of the Thomas-Institut, [http://www.thomasinstitut.uni-koeln.de/mitarbeiter/speer/ Andreas Speer], formerly professor at Würzburg (2000), was appointed in 2004.

== Activities ==

=== Mediaevistentagung ===
Already on October 11, 1950, one day after the foundation of the Thomas-Institut, the first [http://www.kmt.uni-koeln.de Mediaevistentagung] took place. Josef Koch had invited scholars from Germany and from the Institut supérieur de philosophie of Louvain with the declared aim to assemble - not for a "congress" but in "friendly discussion" - all those interested in medieval studies: philosophers, theologians, historians, philologists, art- and music-historians. This interdisciplinary approach has since determined the programmes of the Mediaevistentagungen, which until 1960 were held every year. Since 1960 the Thomas-Institut organizes those conferences every two years in the second week of September.
Beginning with the second conference in 1951, which was devoted to medieval symbolism, every Mediaevistentagung has been centred on a global topic that stood in relation with the work done at the Institute or with current interests in the field of medieval studies. Since 1952, the results have been documented; the first proceedings were published in the series Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters (vols. 3 and 5), since 1956 they are published in the Miscellanea Mediaevalia series created especially for that purpose.
While remaining true to its original concept, the Mediaevistentagung has become more fully international, bigger - the record was set with circa 300 participants in 1994 - and, not to mention, longer - it now lasts a week. In 2004 a workshop was introduced to precede the main conference. It provides a forum for younger scholars to present their works in progress or, alternatively, presents an opportunity to share different approaches and projects in open discussion.

=== Forschungskolloquium ===

The "Forschungskolloquium" is a series of loosely connected lectures by our collaborators, guests, or invitees. It affords an opportunity to present a particular field of research to the colleagues and at the same time to the wider public.

=== Köln-Bonner Philosophisches Kolloquium ===
The "Köln-Bonner Philosophisches Kolloquium", organized together with the Philosophy Department of [[Bonn University]], is a semester long reading course for graduate and older undergraduate students (taking place every two weeks). The course examines a systematic topic (e.g. Aristotelian psychology, concepts of metaphysics) throughout ancient and medieval philosophy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5019">'''The U.S.-Vietnam Dialogue Group on [[Agent Orange]]/Dioxin''' was formally established in February 2007 as an initiative of prominent private citizens, scientists and policy-makers on both the Vietnamese and US sides, working on issues that the two countries’ governments have found difficult to address. It is not an implementing agency nor a fundraising organization. Its role has been to call attention to the need for five key actions to be undertaken in a humanitarian spirit: to establish treatment and education centers for Vietnamese with disabilities; cooperate with the U.S. and Vietnamese governments to contain and clean up dioxin, beginning at three priority airport "hot spots"; set up a modern dioxin testing laboratory in Vietnam; foster programs for training of trainers in restoration and management of damaged landscapes; and educate the U.S. public on the issues. Leading the Vietnamese side is Ambassador Ngo Quang Xuan, vice chair of the Vietnamese National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee, and leading the U.S. side is [[Walter Isaacson]], president and CEO of the [[Aspen Institute]]. The convener of the group is [[Susan Berresford]], former President of the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://host.madison.com/ct/news/opinion/column/article_c2e8fcd6-0477-59d8-8cdf-8c01613b153c.html Susan V.

On June 16, 2010, members of the U.S.-Vietnam Dialogue Group on Agent Orange/Dioxin unveiled a comprehensive 10-year Declaration and Plan of Action to address the toxic legacy of Agent Orange and other herbicides in Vietnam. The Plan of Action was released as an Aspen Institute publication and calls upon the U.S. and Vietnamese governments to join with other governments, foundations, businesses, and nonprofits in a partnership to clean up dioxin "hot spots" in Vietnam, and to expand humanitarian services for people with disabilities in that country.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37735860/ Plan addresses Agent Orange legacy in Vietnam - World news - World environment | NBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2010/1001.spc-rep.html Special Report: Agent Orange] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901175643/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2010/1001.spc-rep.html |date=2012-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 16, 2010, Senator Patrick Leahy (D- VT) acknowledged the work of the Dialogue Group by releasing a statement on the floor of the United States Senate. The statement urges the U.S. government to take the Plan of Action's recommendations into account in developing a multi-year plan of activities to address the Agent Orange/dioxin legacy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-09-16/pdf/CREC-2010-09-16-pt1-PgS7168-3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12165">The use of '''[[urban planning]] in [[ancient Egypt]]''' is a matter of continuous debate. Because ancient sites usually survive only in fragments, and many ancient Egyptian cities have been continuously inhabited since their original forms, relatively little is actually understood about the general designs of Egyptian towns for any given period.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, "el-Amarna" 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptians referred to most cities as either ''nwt'' or ''dmi''.&lt;ref&gt;Uphill&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nwt'' usually refers to unplanned cities that grew naturally, such as [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], while ''dmi'' can be translated as "settlement" and usually refers to towns that were laid out along a plan. The archaeological evidence of such cities is best preserved, and has been most thoroughly delved, at [[el-Lahun]], [[Deir el-Medina]], and [[Amarna]], though some averment of urban planning exists at other sites as well.

== Predynastic period ==
{{main|Predynastic Egypt}}

Almost no traces of Egyptian settlements exist before the development of [[neolithic]] culture around 6000 BC, as settlements were certainly very small, and buildings were made of perishable materials such as reeds and were not meant to be permanent structures.&lt;ref&gt;Uphill&lt;/ref&gt; Sites that do survive do not show much evidence of urban planning. The earliest known predynastic settlement is at [[Merimda-Beni Salame]] at the southwest desert edge of the [[Nile Delta]] and covers about {{convert|44|acre|m2}}, a very large area for the predynastic period. The city was rebuilt three times during its inhabited life, and in at least one of its incarnations, its houses were placed very regularly along a main street. Almost all the houses follow a plan which faces their doorways to the northwest, to avoid the prevailing northerly wind.

Other known pre-dynastic settlements, such as those of the [[Badarian]] and [[Naqada]] cultures, are laid out arbitrarily and lack a defining plan. These villages mostly consisting of small huts situated around circular [[storage pit (archaeology)|storage pits]].

== Tell el-Dab'a ==
At Tell el-Dab'a were excavated remains of a settlement, dating to the early Middle Kingdom (about 2000 BC). The ancient name of the town is not known. An area of about 100 to 100 meters were uncovered, therefore, only parts of the settlements are known. The settlements consisted of at least ten rows of houses divided by straight streets. There is evidence that the town was surrounded by a wall. Remains were found in the North. Here there was also a bigger building. The East side of the settlements had an open space. The rows of houses on the east side (west of the open space) consisted of blocks with 12 houses. The single houses were small, just about 5 by 5 meters large and all built on the same plan. The rows of houses on the west side consisted of blocks of at least 20 houses, but perhaps even more. The settlement was inhabited only for about 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp: ''Ancient Egypt'', p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

== el-Lahun ==
{{main|el-Lahun}}

The workmen's village at el-Lahun was built and inhabited during the reign of [[Senusret II]] of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Uphill&lt;/ref&gt; Located near the entrance to the channel of the [[Nile]] that leads to the [[Faiyum Oasis]], it housed the workers who constructed Senusret's pyramid as well as the priests who maintained the royal funerary cult, and possibly even the king himself. The village was apparently only fully inhabited during the king's reign.

The village was organized according to a regular plan. It was centered on the temple of the Senusret's pyramid, which visually dominated the village, and it consisted of two unequal quarters enclosed by [[mudbrick]] walls on at least three sides. The smaller western quarter contained the relatively humble dwellings of the workers that were laid out on a rectangular grid pattern. [[Flinders Petrie]], who first excavated the site, noted how the layout of the neighborhood would allow a single nightwatchman to easily guard the area. The houses all followed the same basic pattern and dimensions, and they were evenly spaced along the parallel streets. The streets were paved, and stone drainage channels built into them, leading to a central drain, allowed the disposal of dirty water from the houses. The much larger eastern quarter contained considerably larger buildings, including mansions, an "acropolis" with an attached guard building, storerooms, a few more workers' dwellings, and some buildings at the far east side whose purposes are unknown.

== Deir el-Medina ==
{{main|Deir el-Medina}}

The workmen's village at Deir el-Medina, located in a valley on the west bank of the Nile across from Thebes, was first constructed under Thutmose I of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] to house the workers who worked on the tombs in the nearby [[Valley of the Kings]] during the [[New Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Uphill&lt;/ref&gt; The village is surrounded by a thin mudbrick wall and built around a central street. Houses were connected at the sides, sharing walls for building and space efficiency. It is possible that entire blocks of houses were covered by a single roof.

The original village had 20 houses, probably supporting a population of about 100 people. The village was expanded once under [[Thutmose III]], and when the workers returned to Deir el-Medina after the reign of [[Akhenaten]], during which they were transferred to Amarna, the village was expanded again and formed nine distinct quarters. At its largest point, Deir el-Medina contained 120 houses and probably about 600 inhabitants.

== Amarna ==
{{main|Amarna}}

&lt;!-- [[Image:Amarna Map.png|350px|thumb|Map of Amarna]] --&gt;
{{Amarna Image Map|width=425}}
[[Akhenaten]] of the eighteenth Dynasty built Akhetaten as the new capital city of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, "el-Amarna" 123&lt;/ref&gt; For the location, he chose Amarna, a fresh site on the eastern bank of the Nile, about 275 kilometers northwest of the old capital city of Thebes. After his death, the city was virtually abandoned. The degree of planning involved in the construction of Amarna involved for the most part the administrative and religious buildings of the Central City.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, ''Ancient Egypt'' 284&lt;/ref&gt; Even the planned part of the city was somewhat hastily designed and assembled.&lt;ref&gt;Redford 144&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the city was built along an eight kilometer north-south main street, referred to today as the “Royal Road,” which connected the Central City with the North City, an outlying satellite and the probable residence of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, ''Ancient Egypt'' 284&lt;/ref&gt; The king probably lived in the North Riverside Palace in the North City, a large building on the east side of the Royal Road and separate from the rest of the city, protected by a fortified wall which enclosed a complex of royal service buildings. On the opposite side of the road from the palace lay a group of some of the largest houses in the city, probably belonging to nobles who were very close to the king. An administrative building containing an enormous warehouse formed the northern limit of the North City. At the southern end of the Royal Road lay the Central City, a group of temples, palaces, and administrative buildings forming the executive hub of the city. The planned buildings of the Central City can be found in an inscription on one of the [[Boundary Stelae of Akhenaten|Amarna Boundary Stelae]] which marked the boundaries of the city at its founding.&lt;ref&gt;Fairman&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Akhenaten describes the main buildings he will construct in his new capital:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
…I am making a House of the [[Aten]] for the Aten my father in Akhetaten in this place. I am making the Mansion of the Aten for the Aten my father in Akhetaten in this place. I am making the “Sunshade of Re” of the [great] royal wife…for the Aten my father in Akhetaten in this place. I am making a House of Rejoicing for the Aten my father in the island of “Aten distinguished in jubilees” in Akhetaten in this place. I have made a house of Re-[joicing of the Aten] for the Aten my father in the island of “Aten distinguished in jubilees” in Akhetaten in this place. &lt;ref&gt;Fairman 136&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of these buildings can be identified easily by their inscriptions, but we know the names of others only through this speech. On the entire western side of the road and probably reaching down to the riverside was the Great Palace, consisting of several stone courts and halls, and housing at its center a huge courtyard surrounded by statues of Akhenaten.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, ''Ancient Egypt'' 184&lt;/ref&gt; Across the road and connected by a brick bridge lay the King’s House, a small palace and residence of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, ''Ancient Egypt'' 287&lt;/ref&gt; South of the palace (on the west side of the road) was the Mansion of the Sun-disc, a religious building whose purpose is not completely understood but was likely the king’s mortuary temple.&lt;ref&gt;Redford 146&lt;/ref&gt; In the northernmost position on the east side of the road in the Central City was the largest temple of all, the House of the Sun-disc, or the [[Great Temple of the Aten]], which lay on an east-west axis and consisted of a rectangular walled area measuring 760 by 290 meters, enclosing several individual temples. Near the temples were long storehouses and priests’ housing.&lt;ref&gt;Redford 148&lt;/ref&gt; Due east of the king’s house were offices, the archives (in which the Amarna Letters were found), and police and military barracks. On the eastern outskirts of the Central City was a walled workmen’s village housing the workers during the city's construction. Villas of the king’s vizier’s and priests sprawled along both sides of the Royal Road to the south. At the far south of the city was an unusual complex called the [[Maru-Aten]], a walled complex of gardens, pools, an artificial island, and open-air kiosks.&lt;ref&gt;Redford 149&lt;/ref&gt; While it was originally mistaken by excavators as a sort of pleasure resort, it is understood now to be a religious building.

Most of Amarna’s housing was in two large areas north and south of the Central City.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, ''Ancient Egypt'' 327&lt;/ref&gt; These sprawling suburbs housed the large population needed to maintain the court and run the administration of the Central City. Residing in the suburbs was a very mixed collection of social groups, the priests, soldiers, builders, sculptors and scribes having the most prominent houses. As far as the residential sections of Amarna are concerned, there is almost a complete absence of an imposed layout. Outside the corridor of the Royal Road, there were a few broad, far from straight streets running more or less north and south and joining the suburbs to the center, crossed by perpendicular, smaller streets. The houses themselves are arranged in arbitrary clusters which create distinct neighborhoods. There does not seem to be any concept of “prime location,” except to be located on one of the main north-south streets, and rich and poor seemed to live side by side. Proximity to the Central City or the Royal Road seems to have been unimportant, and there is at least one example of a royal vizier who seems to have chosen to live as far away from the king as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14717">'''World Inequality Report''' is a report by the World Inequality Lab at the [[Paris School of Economics]] that provides estimates of global income and wealth inequality based on the most recent findings compiled by the World Wealth and Income Database (WID). WID, also referred to as WID.world, is an open source database, that is part of an international collaborative effort of over a hundred researchers in five continents. The World Inequality Report includes discussions on potential future academic research as well as content useful for public debates and policy related to economic inequality. The first report, entitled World Inequality Report 2018, which was released on December 14, 2017 at the [[Paris School of Economics]] during the first WID.world Conference, was compiled by [[Facundo Alvaredo]], [[Lucas Chancel]], [[Thomas Piketty]],  [[Emmanuel Saez]], and [[Gabriel Zucman]] based on WID data. The 300-page report cautions that since 1980, around the globe, there has been an increase in the gap between rich and poor. In Europe, the increase in inequality increased more moderately while in North America and Asia, the increase was rapid. In the Middle East, Africa, and Brazil, income inequality did not increase but remained at very high levels.

In an interview with ''Quartz'', Piketty predicted that if the "world follows the trajectory of the US" inequality would get much worse.

==World Inequality Lab==
The  report by the World Inequality Lab at the [[Paris School of Economics]], is "based on the latest evidence collected for the World Wealth and Income Database, a massive project maintained by more than 100 researchers in more than 70 countries."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt;

Researchers worked on an international collaborative effort to extend the existing database, the World Top Incomes Database (WTID) to the World Wealth and Income Database (WID) which provides data on both distribution of income and wealth, "as well as the distribution of different forms of capital assets, in the analyzed countries".&lt;ref name="review_WID"/&gt; The WTID "generally focused on the concentration of wealth among the top decile in a given population."&lt;ref name="review_WID"&gt;{{cite journal |series=Reviews of Datasets |title=The World Wealth and Income Database (WID) |journal=Journal of World-Historical Information (JWHI)|volume= 2-3 |number=2 |year=2014-2015  |  ISSN=2169-0812 |doi=10.5195/jwhi.2015.33  |url=http://jwhi.pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WID is an "information hub" informing academic research&lt;ref&gt;Anthony B.

By 2015, the WID provided data series on the distribution of income and wealth in thirty-three countries mainly from the Americas and Europe. At that time there the intention was to "include data series for an additional forty countries." The first WID in 2013, which was placed in an open source repository in September 2013, was compiled by [[Facundo Alvaredo]], [[Anthony B. Atkinson]], [[Thomas Piketty]],  [[Emmanuel Saez]], and [[Gabriel Zucman]].&lt;ref name="review_WID"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WID"&gt;{{citation |title=The World Wealth and Income Database (WID) |editor-first1=Facundo |editor-last1=Alvaredo |editor-first2=Anthony B.  |editor-last2=Atkinson |editor-first3=Thomas |editor-last3=Piketty |editor-first4=Emmanuel |editor-last4=Saez |editor-first5=Gabriel |editor-last5=Zucman  |date=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2016 to 2017, through a 2015 Centers for Equitable Growth (CEG), Piketty, Saez, and Zucman studied Distributional National Accounts (DINA) for the United States.

==World Inequality Report 2018==
In 2018 Facundo Alvaredo, Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty,  Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucmanon compiled the first report, the "World Inequality Report 2018"&lt;ref name="WIR_2018"&gt;{{cite report |title=World Inequality Report (2018) |editor-first1=Facundo |editor-last1=Alvaredo |editor-first2=Lucas   |editor-last2=Chancel|editor-first3=Thomas |editor-last3=Piketty |editor-first4=Emmanuel |editor-last4=Saez |editor-first5=Gabriel |editor-last5=Zucman  |url=http://wir2018.wid.world/files/download/wir2018-full-report-english.pdf |format=PDF |date=December 14, 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017 |pages=300}} "This report emphasizes recent research articles written by: Facundo Alvaredo Lydia Assouad Anthony B.

==Highlights of the World Inequality Report 2018==
The five part 300-page report discusses "the WID.world project and the measurement of economic inequality in Part I, trends in global income inequality in Part II, public versus private capital dynamics in Part III, trends in global wealth inequality in Part IV , tackling Economic Inequality in [http://wir2018.wid.world/files/download/wir2018-full-report-english.pdf#250 Part V]. Methodological "details on how estimations were constructed are available at the report's website".&lt;ref&gt;[wir2018.wid.world Dedicated website for World Inequality Report 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', "Policy, it turns out, matters. More aggressive redistribution through taxes and transfers has spared Europe from the acute disparities that Americans have grown used to. Unequal access to education is helping reproduce inequality in the United States down the generations."&lt;ref name="NYT_Porter_WIR_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WIR_2018"/&gt;{{rp|10,16}} The ''Times'' article also noted that, "China's strategy based on low-skill manufacturing for export, and underpinned by aggressive investment in infrastructure, has proven more effective at raising living standards for the bottom half of the population than India's more inward-looking strategy, which has limited the benefits of globalization to the well-educated elite."&lt;ref name="NYT_Porter_WIR_2018"/&gt; Tetlow of the ''Financial Times'' described inequality as the "defining characteristic of the age" as [[The rich get richer and the poor get poorer]].&lt;ref name="FT_London_Tetlow"/&gt; The ''India Times'' article drew attention to the way in which "[d]eregulation and opening-up reforms in India since 1980s have led to substantial increase in inequality so much that top 0.1% of earners has continued to capture more growth than all those in the bottom 50% combined."&lt;ref name="indiatimes_WIR_2017"/&gt; The WIR reported that, "Income inequality in India has reached historically high levels. In 2014, the share of national income accruing to India's top 1% of earners was 22%, while the share of the top 10% was around 56%."&lt;ref name="WIR_2018"/&gt;{{rp|123}}

''Quartz'' cited the report, "[S]ince 1980 the top 0.1% have captured as much income growth as the entire bottom half of world's (adult) population. And for the group of people in between the bottom 50% and top 1%—mostly the lower- and middle-income groups in North America and Europe—income growth has been either sluggish or flat."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt; The WIR 2018 shows that, "The gap between rich and poor has increased in nearly every region in the world over the past few decades."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt; Since "1980, income inequality has increased rapidly in North America and Asia, increased more moderately in Europe, and stabilized at very high levels in the Middle East, Africa, and Brazil."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt;

==First WID.world conference==
The conference held on December 14 and December 15, was sponsored by the Paris School of Economics, the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]], the Washington Center for Equitable Growth (CEG), the [[Ford Foundation]], and the [[European Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wid.world/news-article/first-wid-world-conference-program-available/ |title=First WID.world Conference |date=December 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017 |work=WID}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of the first issue of the World Inequality Report #wir2018 on Thursday 14th (9.30 am – 1 pm). The executive committee of the conference included Alvaredo, Chancel, Piketty, Saez, Zucman, the WID.world and the World Inequality Lab Executive Committee. The program included the release of the report that would "provide global estimates of income and wealth inequality drawing on the latest evidence gathered in WID.world" [and ] "discuss implications for future research and the global policy debate on rising inequality". There was a session honoring Tony Atkinson and presentations of "research papers on income and wealth inequality" and "on the DINA-Distributional National Accounts agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/news/save-the-date-release-of-the-world-inequality-report-2018-14-december-2017/ |title=(save the date) Release of the World Inequality Report 2018 - 14 December 2017 |date=December 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017 |work=WID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
Within days of its December 14, 2017 publication online, the report was featured in articles in the ''[[New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="NYT_Porter_WIR_2018"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/14/business/world-inequality.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 14, 2017 |access-date=December 16, 2017 |title=It's an Unequal World. It Doesn't Have to Be |first1=Eduardo |last1=Porter|first2=Karl |last2=Russell |quote="Examining the "World Inequality Report" — published Thursday by the creators of the World Wealth and Income Database, who include the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez — it is tempting to see the rising concentration of incomes as some sort of unstoppable force of nature, an economic inevitability driven by globalization and technology. The report finds that the richest 1 percent of humanity reaped 27 percent of the world's income between 1980 and 2016. The bottom 50 percent, by contrast, got only 12 percent."}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref name="theguardian_Neate_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/dec/14/world-richest-increased-wealth-same-amount-as-poorest-half |title=World's richest 0.1% have boosted their wealth by as much as poorest half |quote=Inequality report also shows UK's 50,000 richest people have seen their share of the country's wealth double since 1984 |first=Rupert |last=Neate |date=December 14, 2017 |access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Quartz]]'',&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://qz.com/1155448/thomas-piketty-says-the-us-is-setting-a-bad-example-on-inequality-for-the-world/ |title=Thomas Piketty says the US is setting a bad example on inequality for the world |first=Eshe |last=Nelson |date=December 14, 2017 |access-date=December 16, 2017 |publisher=Quartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Financial Times]]'',&lt;ref name="FT_London_Tetlow"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/7b1c080c-e026-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce |newspaper=Financial Times |date=December 13, 2017 |access-date=December 16, 2017 |title=Is the world becoming more unequal? |first=Gemma |last=Tetlow |location=London, UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''India Times'',&lt;ref name="indiatimes_WIR_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/indian-economic-inequality-widened-since-1980-report/articleshow/62070475.cms |title=Indian economic inequality widened since 1980: Report |author=ET Bureau |newspaper=India Times |date=December 14, 2017  |access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Associated Press]] via [[ABC News]].&lt;ref name="ABC_AP_Kurtenbach"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/report-rich-richer-world-inequality-grows-51806278 |title=Report: Rich will get still richer unless policies change |first1=Elaine |last1=Kurtenbach |first2=Christopher |last2=Rugaber |work=ABC News via AP |location=Tokyo |date=December 15, 2017 |access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interview with ''Quartz'', Piketty warned of the impediments to getting "a comprehensive picture of wealth", such as [[tax havens]]. Piketty observed that "there are financial and political forces that have a vested interest in keeping this information secret," noting the "paradox of today's globalized economy" where "we are supposed to be in the era of big data and transparency, and we see that we still don't have access to all the data sources we would need."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt;
