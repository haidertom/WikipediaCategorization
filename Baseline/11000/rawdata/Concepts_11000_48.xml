      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18181">'''Andrew Maraniss''' (pronounced MARE-uh-niss) is an American author, best known for his book "''Strong Inside: [[Perry Wallace]] and the collision of race and sports in the south'' ",&lt;ref name="strongbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maraniss|first1=Andrew|title=Strong Inside : Perry Wallace and the collision of race and sports in the south|date=2014|publisher=Vanderbilt Univ Press|location=Nashville|isbn=978-0-8265-2023-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   depicting Perry Wallace, the first African-American to play college basketball under an athletic scholarship in the [[Southeastern Conference]] ([[Vanderbilt University]]) in the 1960s. The book was on the [[New York Times Best Seller|''New York Times'' best-seller]] list in both the sports and civil rights categories for four consecutive months. It received the 2015 [[Lillian Smith Book Award]] and a Special Recognition Award by the [[Robert F. Kennedy]] Book Awards Foundation.

Maraniss attended Vanderbilt University in 1992 on a [[Fred Russell]]-[[Grantland Rice]]  Scholarship for Sports Journalism. He won the school's Charles Foster Alexander Award for excellence in journalism in 1992 and in 2016 was inducted in the Vanderbilt Student Media Hall of Fame. He was designated Vanderbilt's "Writer-in-Residence" in 2017. The popularity of the book reoriented his former career in public relations into that of full-time author. Maraniss' father, [[David Maraniss]], is a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author and associate editor for the ''[[Washington Post]]''.

==A family of writers==

Maraniss was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], the son of David and Linda Maraniss who met there in high school.&lt;ref name="madisonandpress"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Book Festival/Andrew Marannis|url=https://www.wisconsinbookfestival.org/presenters/andrew-maraniss|website=wisconsinbookfestival.com|publisher=Madison Public Library|accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, Elliott Maraniss, was editor of Madison's ''Capital Times'' newspaper in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="dougmoemadison"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moe|first1=Doug|title=Doug Moe: Another Maraniss, another compelling tale|url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/columnists/doug-moe/doug-moe-another-maraniss-another-compelling-tale/article_c7b95e8d-2390-5f4a-a58c-dadfdf334501.html|website=host.madison.com|publisher=Wisconsin State Journal|accessdate=April 23, 2018|date=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandmother, Mary Maraniss, was a 1966 graduate of the [[University of Wisconsin]], [[Phi Beta Kappa]], and book editor for the [[University of Wisconsin Press]].&lt;ref name="maryobituary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Maraniss/Obituary|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/jsonline/obituary.aspx?n=mary-maraniss&amp;pid=16495333&amp;fhid=3716|website=legacy.com|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|accessdate=April 26, 2018|date=January 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earlylifemadison"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolker|first1=Jeanne|title=David Maraniss continues to go where his subjects take him|url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/entertainment/arts_and_theatre/books/david-maraniss-continues-to-go-where-his-subjects-take-him/article_fc03a8aa-7b1b-5ca2-983d-7fc58c2c9166.html|website=host.madison.com|publisher=Wisconsin State Journal|accessdate=April 23, 2018|date=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marannis' father, David, has been associate editor of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' since 1977&lt;ref name="fatherwas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Piarrot|first1=Henry|title=Son of a journalist is award-winner like father|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=19456790|accessdate=April 22, 2018|issue=Davidson A.M./Southeast|publisher=Tennessean (Nashville)|date=December 26, 2003|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won a [[Pulitzer prize]] for national reporting in 1993 for his coverage of [[Bill Clinton]]'s candidacy during the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="pulitzerwinner"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pulitzer Prizes/National Reporting/Winners/1993|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/david-maraniss|website=pulitzer.org|publisher=The Pulitzer Prizes|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The senior Maraniss said  that his son Andrew "has always been more mature than Linda and I",&lt;ref name="earlylifemadison"/&gt; a child who would save his candy rather than eat it all at once. When Andrew was young,  his father was a budding journalist who found a job at the ''Trenton Times'' in New Jersey, that necessitated the family's move from Wisconsin to the east coast. In the 1970s another job opened up at the ''Washington Post''  so they moved to Washington, D.C.    As a youth in the late 1970s, Andrew attended press conferences with his father.  When Maraniss was in high school, his father was transferred to [[Austin, Texas]], to serve as southwest bureau chief for the ''Post''.

==Early life==

While in high school in Austin, Maraniss was sports editor for the school paper, the Austin High ''Maroon''.&lt;ref name="internstatesman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halliburton|first1=Suzanne|title=Andrew Maraniss in town to talk about his book on Perry Wallace|url=http://collegesports.blog.statesman.com/2015/03/30/andrew-maraniss-in-town-to-talk-about-his-book-on-perry-wallace/|website=collegesports.blog.statesman.com|publisher=Statesman (Gatehouse Media)|accessdate=April 24, 2018|date=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He got a job writing sports articles as an intern for the ''Austin American–Statesman''.&lt;ref name="internstatesman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="austinsample"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maraniss|first1=Andrew|title=Cowboys Scrimmage tickets on sale July 14 at Burger|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/358500970/?terms=%22Andrew+Maraniss%22|accessdate=April 22, 2018|publisher=Austin American–Statesman|date=June 30, 1990|page=D–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A poster at school about a college  scholarship caught his attention and prompted him to submit his news clippings to apply for it.&lt;ref name="dougmoemadison"/&gt; His writing won him a [[Fred Russell]]-[[Grantland Rice]] Sportswriting Scholarship to Vanderbilt University in 1988. Sportswriting Hall-of-Famer [[Fred Russell]], for whom the sportswriting scholarship is named, took the four recipients out to lunch a couple of times a year and developed personal relationships with them.&lt;ref name="mediahof"/&gt; The tradition continued until Russell's death in 2003.  Maraniss worked his way up to sports editor of the ''Hustler'', the college newspaper.&lt;ref name="fatherwas"/&gt; After graduation, he had a job as Vanderbilt basketball sports information director.&lt;ref name="joebiddle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Biddle|first1=Joe|title=Nashville's NFL team may have a giant name change|agency=newspapers.com|publisher=Tennessean (Nashville)|date=October 30, 1998|page=2C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Strong Inside''==

In 1989, as a 19 year old student, he read an article in a student publication about [[Perry Wallace]]. One of his professors, Yolette Jones (associate dean in the College of Arts and Sciences as of 2017), suggested that he interview Wallace who was then a law professor in Baltimore. Maraniss did so, and wrote two papers about Wallace and some student newspaper articles. Maraniss recalled, "I remember sitting on the floor of my dormitory, scribbling in a notebook and feeling like the world was opening up to me as I talked to the most impressive person I had ever talked to before".&lt;ref name="residencezeppos"/&gt;  After graduation Maraniss stayed on, working as associate director of media relations for Vanderbilt Athletics from 1992 to 1997. In 1998 he moved to [[Tampa]], taking a job as Media Relations Manager for the inaugural season of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]].&lt;ref name="tampamedia"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sports/Transactions/Baseball|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/392842891/|accessdate=April 22, 2018|agency=newspapers.com|publisher=Daily News (New York)|date=December 4, 1997|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to Nashville to join a public relations firm, McNeely, Pigott and Fox&lt;ref name="joebiddle"/&gt; and became a partner there for 18 years. Maraniss knew he could write a book (his father had written ten of them) and he was looking for inspiration. At a family gathering he lamented not having a compelling subject to write about. Family members reminded him of his articles about Perry Wallace years prior (which he had not thought of) and the idea clicked.&lt;ref name="taleneedstold"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Philpott|first1=Mary Laura|title=Wallace's story is tale 'that needs to be told'|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19456700/the_tennessean/|accessdate=April 22, 2018|agency=newspapers.com|publisher=Tennessean (Nashville)|date=November 19, 2014|page=9a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace was fascinating because he was not only a basketball star who broke racial barriers, but also a high school valedictorian, engineering major, law school graduate and eventually a law-school professor.&lt;ref name="vanderbiltnews"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vanderbilt alum pens biography of the ‘Jackie Robinson of the SEC’|url=https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2014/11/25/andrew-maraniss-strong-inside/|website=news.vanderbilt.edu|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|accessdate=April 21, 2018|date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maraniss had a full-time job, so his research and writing was on nights and weekends and was slow-moving, but he managed to do over 80 interviews in his preparation. To the credit of his research, Maraniss uncovered a transcript of a 1968 statement of Wallace's own words to the Vanderbilt race relations committee: "An occurrence of no consequence for a white player was transformed into a nightmare".&lt;ref name="dougmoemadison"/&gt; Maraniss and Wallace became fast friends through their dozens of interviews as well as later one-on-one public interviews which were broadcast.&lt;ref name="interviewvideo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strong Inside: Perry Wallace and the Collision of Race and Sports in the South/ Maraniss and Wallace Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJB_xjdSBrA|website=youtube.com|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript was published by the [[Vanderbilt University Press]] and became the best-selling book in its history.&lt;ref name="madisonandpress"/&gt;  Maraniss said, "It was seven years before I had a publisher, so I didn't know if it would ever get out there..."&lt;ref name="Maranisssuccess"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Organ|first1=Mike|title=Book's success spurs Maraniss to new career|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=19457025|accessdate=April 22, 2018|publisher=Tennessean|date=June 5, 2016|page=2–C}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the book's success, Maraniss was besieged with book signings and requests to appear on talk shows including [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'', [[NPR]]'s "''[[All Things Considered]] ''", [[MSNBC]]'s "''[[Morning Joe]] ''" [[ESPN]]'s "''Keith Olberman Show, ''"  ESPN Radio's "''The Sporting Life ''" and others. He has created an adaption of the original book, for young people, with a slightly different title, "''Strong Inside: The True Story of How Perry Wallace Broke College Basketball's Color Line''".&lt;ref name="youngreaders"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maraniss|first1=Andrew|title=Strong Inside (Young Readers Edition): The True Story of How Perry Wallace Broke College Basketball's Color Line|date=2016|publisher=Philomel Books (Penguin Random House)|location=New York|isbn=9780399548345|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wPfVBAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Andrew%20Maraniss|accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition was named as one of the Top 10 Biographies for Youth&lt;ref name="toptenbiographies"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Sarah|title=Top 10 Biographies for Youth: 2017 (Book Reviews from the American Library Association)|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Top-10-Biographies-for-Youth-2017/pid=8686047|website=booklistonline.com|publisher=Booklist Publications|accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Top 10 Sports Books for Youth of 2017&lt;ref name="tensportsbooks"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Julia|title=Top 10 Sports Books for Youth: 2017|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Top-10-Sports-Books-for-Youth-2017-Julia-Smith/pid=9053003|website=booklistonline.com|publisher=Booklist Publications (Book Reviews from the American Library Association)|accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[American Library Association]].&lt;ref name="libraryassociation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rawlins|first1=Sharon|title=Booklist Review/Strong Inside/Book Reviews from the American Library Association|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/ProductInfo.aspx?pid=8542532|website=booklistonline.com|publisher=Booklist Publications|accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of Maraniss' book, a motion picture documentary depicting Wallace's life has been made by filmmaker Rich Gentile, entitled "Triumph: The Untold Story of Perry Wallace". It is narrated by [[Academy Award]] winning actor [[Forest Whitaker]].&lt;ref name="rexrode"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rexrode|first1=Joe|title='Triumph' a fitting title for the big-screen story of Perry Wallace|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/college/vanderbilt/2017/12/05/triumph-fitting-title-big-screen-story-perry-wallace/922208001/|website=tennessean.com|publisher=Tennessean|accessdate=April 26, 2018|date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary coincides with the 50th anniversary of the integration of SEC basketball, and premiered at Vanderbilt on December 4, 2017. The film was commissioned by Vanderbilt University, and Chancellor [[Nicholas Zeppos]] is one of the film's executive producers.&lt;ref name="filmcarpet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Red-carpet premiere of film celebrates Perry Wallace’s life|url=https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2017/12/05/red-carpet-premiere-of-film-celebrates-perry-wallaces-life/|website=news.vanderbilt.edu|publisher=Vanderbilt University|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the film was not commercially released.&lt;ref name="filmcarpet"/&gt;

All first-year students at Vanderbilt are required to read over the summer prior to their first semester, known as the "Commons Reading". The Classes of 2020 and 2021 are assigned "''Strong Inside''".

[[Existential]] anxiety can occur when a person faces [[angst]], an [[existential crisis]], or [[Nihilism| nihilistic]] feelings. People can also face [[mathematical anxiety]], [[somatic anxiety]], [[stage fright]], or [[test anxiety]]. [[Social anxiety]] and [[stranger anxiety]] are caused when people are apprehensive around strangers or other people in general. Furthermore, anxiety has been linked{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} with physical symptoms such as [[Irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]] and can heighten other mental-health illnesses such as [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]] and [[panic disorder]]. The first step in the management of a person with anxiety symptoms involves  evaluating the possible presence of an underlying medical cause, whose recognition is essential in order to decide the correct treatment.&lt;ref name=WHO2009&gt;{{cite book |author= World Health Organization |date= 2009 |title= Pharmacological Treatment of Mental Disorders in Primary Health Care |url= http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44095/1/9789241547697_eng.pdf |location= Geneva |isbn= 978-92-4-154769-7 |deadurl= no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161120132530/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44095/1/9789241547697_eng.pdf |archive-date= November 20, 2016 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TestaGiannuzzi2013partIII&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Testa A, Giannuzzi R, Daini S, Bernardini L, Petrongolo L, Gentiloni Silveri N | title = Psychiatric emergencies (part III): psychiatric symptoms resulting from organic diseases | journal = European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 17 Suppl 1 | pages = 86–99 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23436670 | url = http://www.europeanreview.org/article/3087 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety symptoms may mask an [[Disease |organic disease]], or appear associated with or as a result of a medical disorder.&lt;ref name=WHO2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TestaGiannuzzi2013partIII /&gt;&lt;ref name=TestaGiannuzzi2013partII&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Testa A, Giannuzzi R, Sollazzo F, Petrongolo L, Bernardini L, Dain S | title = Psychiatric emergencies (part II): psychiatric disorders coexisting with organic diseases | journal = European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 17 Suppl 1 | pages = 65–85 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23436669 | url = http://www.europeanreview.org/article/3085 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TestaGiannuzzi2013partI&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Testa A, Giannuzzi R, Sollazzo F, Petrongolo L, Bernardini L, Daini S | title = Psychiatric emergencies (part I): psychiatric disorders causing organic symptoms | journal = European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 17 Suppl 1 | pages = 55–64 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23436668 | url = http://www.europeanreview.org/article/3083 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anxiety can be either a short-term "state" or a long-term "[[Trait theory|trait]]". Whereas trait anxiety represents worrying about future events, anxiety disorders are a group of [[mental disorder]]s characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear.&lt;ref name= DSM5&gt;{{cite book|title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders | author1=American Psychiatric Association |year= 2013|publisher= American Psychiatric Publishing |location= Arlington |isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8 |pages= 189–195 |edition= 5th | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-JivBAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety disorders are partly genetic but may also be due to [[Mood disorder#Substance-induced |drug use]], including [[alcohol]], [[caffeine]], and [[benzodiazepines]] (which are often prescribed to treat anxiety), as well as withdrawal from [[Substance abuse |drugs of abuse]]. They often occur with other mental disorders, particularly [[bipolar disorder]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[major depressive disorder]], or certain [[personality disorder]]s. Common treatment options include [[Lifestyle (sociology) | lifestyle]] changes, medication, and [[psychotherapy|therapy]]. [[Metacognitive therapy]] seeks to diminish anxiety through reducing worry, which is seen{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} as a consequence of metacognitive beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;

Anxiety is distinguished from [[fear]], which is an appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Dorschel]], ''Furcht und Angst.'' In: Dietmar Goltschnigg (ed.), ''Angst. Lähmender Stillstand und Motor des Fortschritts.'' Stauffenburg, Tübingen 2012, pp. 49-54&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety is related to the specific behaviors of [[fight-or-flight response]]s, defensive behavior or escape.

Fear and anxiety can be differentiated in four domains: (1) duration of emotional experience, (2) temporal focus, (3) specificity of the threat, and (4) motivated direction. Fear is short lived, present focused, geared towards a specific threat, and facilitating escape from threat; anxiety, on the other hand, is long-acting, future focused, broadly focused towards a diffuse threat, and promoting excessive caution while approaching a potential threat and interferes with constructive coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sylvers P, Lilienfeld SO, LaPrairie JL | title = Differences between trait fear and trait anxiety: implications for psychopathology | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 122–37 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20817337 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2010.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms ==
Anxiety can be experienced with long, drawn out daily symptoms that reduce quality of life, known as chronic (or generalized) anxiety, or it can be experienced in short spurts with sporadic, stressful [[panic attack]]s, known as acute anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rynn MA, Brawman-Mintzer O | title = Generalized anxiety disorder: acute and chronic treatment | journal = CNS Spectrums | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 716–23 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15448583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symptoms of anxiety can range in number, intensity, and frequency, depending on the person. While almost everyone has experienced anxiety at some point in their lives, most do not develop long-term problems with anxiety.

Anxiety may cause psychiatric and physiological symptoms.&lt;ref name=WHO2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TestaGiannuzzi2013partI /&gt;

The risk of anxiety leading to depression could possibly even lead to an individual harming themselves, which is why there are many 24-hour suicide prevention hotlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.psychguides.com/guides/depression-hotline/|title=Depression Hotline {{!}} Call Our Free, 24 Hour Depression Helpline|work=PsychGuides.com|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The behavioral effects of anxiety may include withdrawal from situations which have provoked anxiety or negative feelings in the past.&lt;ref name="Barker, P. 2003"/&gt; Other effects may include changes in sleeping patterns, changes in habits, increase or decrease in food intake, and increased motor tension (such as foot tapping).&lt;ref name="Barker, P. 2003"/&gt;

The emotional effects of anxiety may include "feelings of apprehension or dread, trouble concentrating, feeling tense or jumpy, anticipating the worst, irritability, restlessness, watching (and waiting) for signs (and occurrences) of danger, and, feeling like your mind's gone blank"&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Melinda (2008, June).

===Existential===
{{Further|Angst|Existential crisis|Nihilism}}

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], in ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'' (1844), described anxiety or dread associated with the "dizziness of freedom" and suggested the possibility for positive resolution of anxiety through the self-conscious exercise of responsibility and choosing. In ''Art and Artist'' (1932), the psychologist [[Otto Rank]] wrote that the [[psychological trauma]] of birth was the pre-eminent human symbol of existential anxiety and encompasses the creative person's simultaneous fear of – and desire for – separation, individuation, and differentiation.

The [[theology|theologian]] [[Paul Tillich]] characterized existential anxiety&lt;ref name="Tillich"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Paul Tillich |last=Tillich |first=Paul | name-list-format = vanc |year=1952 |title=The Courage To Be |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-08471-9|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "the state in which a [[being]] is aware of its possible nonbeing" and he listed three categories for the nonbeing and resulting anxiety: ontic (fate and death), [[Morality|moral]] ([[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and condemnation), and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] (emptiness and [[Meaning (existential)|meaninglessness]]). According to Tillich, the last of these three types of existential anxiety, i.e. spiritual anxiety, is predominant in modern times while the others were predominant in earlier periods. Tillich argues that this anxiety can be [[Acceptance#Self acceptance|accepted]] as part of the [[human condition]] or it can be resisted but with negative consequences. In its pathological form, spiritual anxiety may tend to "drive the person toward the creation of certitude in systems of meaning which are supported by [[tradition]] and [[authority]]" even though such "undoubted certitude is not built on the rock of [[reality]]".&lt;ref name=Tillich /&gt;

According to [[Viktor Frankl]], the author of ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', when a person is faced with extreme mortal dangers, the most basic of all human wishes is to find a [[meaning of life]] to combat the "trauma of nonbeing" as death is near.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abulof|first1=Uriel | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Mortality and Morality of Nations|date=2015|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-09707-0|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test and performance===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Educational psychology]] --&gt;
{{Main|Test anxiety|Mathematical anxiety|Stage fright|Somatic anxiety}}
According to [[Yerkes-Dodson law]], an optimal level of arousal is necessary to best complete a task such as an exam, performance, or competitive event. However, when the anxiety or level of arousal exceeds that optimum, the result is a decline in performance.&lt;ref name="Teigen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0959354394044004 |title=Yerkes-Dodson: A Law for all Seasons |journal=Theory &amp; Psychology |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=525–547 |year=1994 |last1=Teigen |first1=Karl Halvor | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test anxiety is the uneasiness, apprehension, or nervousness felt by students who have a fear of failing an [[Test (student assessment)|exam]]. Students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of [[Grade (education)|grades]] with [[Self-esteem|personal worth]]; fear of embarrassment by a teacher; fear of [[Social alienation|alienation]] from parents or friends; time pressures; or feeling a loss of control. Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, uncontrollable crying or laughing and drumming on a desk are all common. Because test anxiety hinges on [[fear of negative evaluation]],&lt;ref name="Liebert"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liebert RM, Morris LW | title = Cognitive and emotional components of test anxiety: a distinction and some initial data | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 975–8 | date = June 1967 | pmid = 6042522 | doi = 10.2466/pr0.1967.20.3.975 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder or whether it is a specific type of social [[phobia]].&lt;ref name="Beidel"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beidel DC, Turner SM | title = Comorbidity of test anxiety and other anxiety disorders in children | journal = Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–87 | date = June 1988 | pmid = 3403811 | doi = 10.1007/BF00913800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM-IV classifies test anxiety as a type of social phobia.&lt;ref name="Rapee"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rapee RM, Heimberg RG | title = A cognitive-behavioral model of anxiety in social phobia | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 741–56 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9256517 | doi = 10.1016/S0005-7967(97)00022-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stranger, social, and intergroup anxiety===
{{Main|Stranger anxiety|Social anxiety}}

Humans generally require social acceptance and thus sometimes dread the disapproval of others. Apprehension of being judged by others may cause anxiety in social environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-375096-9.00028-6 |chapter=Introduction: Toward an Understanding of Social Anxiety Disorder |title=Social Anxiety |pages=xix–xxvi |year=2010 |last1=Hofmann |first1=Stefan G. |last2=Dibartolo |first2=Patricia M. | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=978-0-12-375096-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anxiety during social interactions, particularly between strangers, is common among young people. It may persist into adulthood and become social anxiety or social phobia. "[[Stranger anxiety]]" in small children is not considered a phobia. In adults, an excessive fear of other people is not a developmentally common stage; it is called [[social anxiety]]. According to Cutting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Ben |editor1-last=Thomas |editor2-first=Sally |editor2-last=Hardy |editor3-first=Penny |editor3-last=Cutting | name-list-format = vanc |year=1997 |title=Mental Health Nursing: Principles and Practice |publisher=Mosby |location=London |isbn=978-0-7234-2590-8}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; social phobics do not fear the crowd but the fact that they may be judged negatively.

[[Social anxiety]] varies in degree and severity. For some people, it is characterized by experiencing discomfort or awkwardness during physical social contact (e.g. embracing, shaking hands, etc.), while in other cases it can lead to a fear of interacting with unfamiliar people altogether. Those suffering from this condition may restrict their lifestyles to accommodate the anxiety, minimizing social interaction whenever possible. Social anxiety also forms a core aspect of certain personality disorders, including [[Avoidant Personality Disorder|avoidant personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Settipani CA, Kendall PC | title = Social functioning in youth with anxiety disorders: association with anxiety severity and outcomes from cognitive-behavioral therapy | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 22581270 | doi = 10.1007/s10578-012-0307-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the extent that a person is fearful of social encounters with unfamiliar others, some people may experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members, or people who share different group memberships (i.e., by race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.). Depending on the nature of the antecedent relations, cognitions, and situational factors, intergroup contact may be stressful and lead to feelings of anxiety. This apprehension or fear of contact with outgroup members is often called interracial or intergroup anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1985.tb01134.x |title=Intergroup Anxiety |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=157–175 |year=1985 |last1=Stephan |first1=Walter G. |last2=Stephan |first2=Cookie White | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is the case the more generalized forms of [[social anxiety]], intergroup anxiety has behavioral, cognitive, and affective effects. For instance, increases in schematic processing and simplified information processing can occur when anxiety is high. Indeed, such is consistent with related work on attentional bias in implicit memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richeson JA, Trawalter S | title = The threat of appearing prejudiced and race-based attentional biases | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 98–102 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18271854 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02052.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathews A, Mogg K, May J, Eysenck M | title = Implicit and explicit memory bias in anxiety | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 236–40 | date = August 1989 | pmid = 2768658 | doi = 10.1037/0021-843x.98.3.236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(91)90096-t |title=Effects of encoding and anxiety on implicit and explicit memory performance |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=131–139 |year=1991 |last1=Richards |first1=Anne |last2=French |first2=Christopher C. | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally recent research has found that implicit racial evaluations (i.e. automatic prejudiced attitudes) can be amplified during intergroup interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amodio DM, Hamilton HK | title = Intergroup anxiety effects on implicit racial evaluation and stereotyping | journal = Emotion | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 1273–80 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22775128 | doi = 10.1037/a0029016 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.659.5717 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative experiences have been illustrated in producing not only negative expectations, but also avoidant, or  antagonistic, behavior such as hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plant EA, Devine PG | title = The antecedents and implications of interracial anxiety | journal = Personality &amp; Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 790–801 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 15189634 | doi = 10.1177/0146167203029006011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when compared to anxiety levels and cognitive effort (e.g., impression management and self-presentation) in intragroup contexts, levels and depletion of resources may be exacerbated in the intergroup situation.

===Trait===
Anxiety can be either a short-term 'state' or a long-term personality "trait". Trait anxiety reflects a stable tendency across the lifespan of responding with acute, state anxiety in the anticipation of threatening situations (whether they are actually deemed threatening or not).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html |title=Anxiety | vauthors = Schwarzer R  |date=December 1997 |access-date=2008-01-12 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070920115547/http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html |archive-date=September 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis showed that a high level of [[neuroticism]] is a risk factor for development of anxiety symptoms and disorders.&lt;ref name="NeuroticismMA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeronimus BF, Kotov R, Riese H, Ormel J | title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders halves after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history, but the adjusted association hardly decays with time: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 46 | issue = 14 | pages = 2883–2906 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27523506 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291716001653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such anxiety may be conscious or unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Giddey M, Wright H |title=Mental Health Nursing: From first principles to professional practice |publisher=Stanley Thornes}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personality can also be a trait leading towards anxiety and depression. Through experience many find it difficult to collect themselves due to their own personal nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gulfbend.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=8948|title=Gulf Bend MHMR Center|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Choice or decision ===
Anxiety induced by the need to choose between similar options is increasingly being recognized as a problem for individuals and for organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/fashion/trends/article85734.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=Premium choice anxiety |date=April 27, 2008 |access-date=2010-04-25 |first1=Jonathan |last1=Downey | name-list-format = vanc |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203132027/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/fashion/trends/article85734.ece |archive-date=February 3, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Capgemini]] wrote: "Today we're all faced with greater choice, more competition and less time to consider our options or seek out the right advice."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uk.capgemini.com/news/pr1487 Is choice anxiety costing british 'blue chip' business?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222143245/https://www.uk.capgemini.com/news/pr1487 |date=December 22, 2015 }}, [[Capgemini]], Aug 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In a decision context, unpredictability or uncertainty may trigger emotional responses in anxious individuals that systematically alter decision-making.&lt;ref name="Hartley"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartley CA, Phelps EA | title = Anxiety and decision-making | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–8 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22325982 | pmc = 3864559 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.12.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are primarily two forms of this anxiety type. The first form refers to a choice in which there are multiple potential outcomes with known or calculable probabilities. The second form refers to the uncertainty and ambiguity related to a decision context in which there are multiple possible outcomes with unknown probabilities.&lt;ref name="Hartley"/&gt;

===Anxiety disorders===
{{Main|Anxiety disorder}}
&lt;!-- Do not add new content here.  Add to body of Anxiety disorder article, and only if it rises to the importance of the lead there, update the lead there, then update this. Per [[WP:SYNC]] --&gt;
Anxiety disorders are a group of [[mental disorder]]s characterized by exaggerated feelings of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and [[fear]] responses.&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt; Anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt; --&gt; These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]] and shakiness.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt; --&gt; There are a number of anxiety disorders: including [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[phobia|specific phobia]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[separation anxiety disorder]], [[agoraphobia]], [[panic disorder]], and [[selective mutism]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt; --&gt; The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt; --&gt; People often have more than one anxiety disorder.&lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt;

&lt;!-- Causes and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause of anxiety disorders is a combination of [[heredity|genetic]] and environmental factors.&lt;ref name=NIH2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Anxiety Disorders|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders/index.shtml#pub2|website=NIMH|access-date=14 August 2016|date=March 2016|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727230427/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders/index.shtml#pub2|archive-date=July 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety can stem itself from certain factors: genetics, medicinal side-effects, shortness of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/anxiety/what-causes-anxiety.php|title=What causes anxiety?|last=The MNT Editorial Team|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk factors include a history of [[child abuse]], family history of mental disorders, and [[poverty]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; --&gt; Anxiety disorders often occur with other mental disorders, particularly [[major depressive disorder]], [[personality disorder]], and [[substance use disorder]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; To be diagnosed symptoms typically need to be present at least six months, be more than would be expected for the situation, and decrease functioning.&lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; Other problems that may result in similar symptoms including [[hyperthyroidism]], [[heart disease]], [[caffeine]], [[alcohol]], or [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use, and withdrawal from certain drugs, among others.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=TestaGiannuzzi2013partIII/&gt;

&lt;!-- Management  --&gt;
Without treatment, anxiety disorders tend to remain.&lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Treatment may include lifestyle changes, [[psychotherapy|counselling]], and medications.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; --&gt; Counselling is typically with a type of [[cognitive behavioural therapy]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; Medications, such as [[antidepressants]] or [[beta blockers]], may improve symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;

===Neuroanatomy===
Neural circuitry involving the [[amygdala]] (which regulates emotions like anxiety and fear, stimulating the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|HPA Axis]] and [[sympathetic nervous system]]) and [[hippocampus]] (which is implicated in emotional memory along with the amygdala) is thought to underlie anxiety.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosen JB, Schulkin J | title = From normal fear to pathological anxiety | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 105 | issue = 2 | pages = 325–50 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9577241 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.105.2.325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2013). (Ab)normal Psychology (6th edition). McGraw Hill.{{page needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers believe that excessive anxiety can lead to an overpotentiation of the limbic system (which includes the amygdala and nucleus accumbens), giving increased future anxiety, but this does not appear to have been proven.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Compassion and Healing in Medicine and Society: On the Nature and Use of Attachment Solutions to Separation Challenges | vauthors =Fricchione G |date=2011 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-1-4214-0220-8 |page=172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book |title=How the Brain Talks to Itself: A Clinical Primer of Psychotherapeutic Neuroscience | vauthors = Harris J |date=1998 |publisher=Haworth |isbn=978-0-7890-0408-6 |page=284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research upon adolescents who as infants had been highly apprehensive, vigilant, and fearful finds that their [[nucleus accumbens]] is more sensitive than that in other people when deciding to make an action that determined whether they received a reward.&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bar-Haim Y, Fox NA, Benson B, Guyer AE, Williams A, Nelson EE, Perez-Edgar K, Pine DS, Ernst M | display-authors = 6 | title = Neural correlates of reward processing in adolescents with a history of inhibited temperament | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 8 | pages = 1009–18 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19594857 | pmc = 2785902 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02401.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests a link between circuits responsible for fear and also reward in anxious people. As researchers note, "a sense of 'responsibility', or self-agency, in a context of uncertainty (probabilistic outcomes) drives the neural system underlying appetitive motivation (i.e., nucleus accumbens) more strongly in temperamentally inhibited than noninhibited adolescents".&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim" /&gt;

===Genetics===
Genetics and family history (e.g., parental anxiety) may predispose an individual for an increased risk of an anxiety disorder, but generally external stimuli will trigger its onset or exacerbation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders |edition=5th |last = American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |year=2013 |isbn= |location=Arlington, VA |pages= }}{{page needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic differences account for about 43% of variance in panic disorder and 28% in generalized anxiety disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bienvenu OJ, Davydow DS, Kendler KS | title = Psychiatric 'diseases' versus behavioral disorders and degree of genetic influence | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–40 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20459884 | doi = 10.1017/S003329171000084X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although single genes are neither necessary nor sufficient for anxiety by themselves, several gene [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s have been found to correlate with anxiety: [[PLXNA2]], [[Serotonin transporter|SERT]], [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]], [[Catechol-O-methyl transferase|COMT]] and [[Brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]].&lt;ref name="pmid17339520"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wray NR, James MR, Mah SP, Nelson M, Andrews G, Sullivan PF, Montgomery GW, Birley AJ, Braun A, Martin NG | title = Anxiety and comorbid measures associated with PLXNA2 | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 318–26 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17339520 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.64.3.318 }}{{primary source inline|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen ZY, Jing D, Bath KG, Ieraci A, Khan T, Siao CJ, Herrera DG, Toth M, Yang C, McEwen BS, Hempstead BL, Lee FS | title = Genetic variant BDNF (Val66Met) polymorphism alters anxiety-related behavior | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5796 | pages = 140–3 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17023662 | pmc = 1880880 | doi = 10.1126/science.1129663 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tocchetto A, Salum GA, Blaya C, Teche S, Isolan L, Bortoluzzi A, Rebelo E, Silva R, Becker JA, Bianchin MM, Rohde LA, Leistner-Segal S, Manfro GG | display-authors = 6 | title = Evidence of association between Val66Met polymorphism at BDNF gene and anxiety disorders in a community sample of children and adolescents | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 502 | issue = 3 | pages = 197–200 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21839144 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2011.07.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these genes influence neurotransmitters (such as [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]]) and hormones (such as [[cortisol]]) which are implicated in anxiety.

===Substance-induced===
Several drugs can cause or worsen anxiety, whether in intoxication, withdrawal or from chronic use. These include [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[cannabis]], [[sedative]]s (including prescription [[benzodiazepine]]s), [[opioid]]s (including prescription pain killers and illicit drugs like heroin), [[stimulant]]s (such as [[caffeine]], [[cocaine]] and amphetamines), [[hallucinogen]]s, and [[inhalants]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While many often report self-medicating anxiety with these substances, improvements in anxiety from drugs are usually short-lived (with worsening of anxiety in the long term, sometimes with acute anxiety as soon as the drug effects wear off) and tend to be exaggerated. Acute exposure to toxic levels of [[benzene]] may cause euphoria, anxiety, and irritability lasting up to 2 weeks after the exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: Systemic Agent: BENZENE - NIOSH|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750032.html|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-01-27|deadurl = no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160117001341/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750032.html|archive-date = January 17, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
Poor [[Coping (psychology)|coping skills]] (e.g., rigidity/inflexible problem solving, denial, avoidance, impulsivity, extreme self-expectation, negative thoughts, affective instability, and inability to focus on problems) are associated with anxiety. Anxiety is also linked and perpetuated by the person's own pessimistic outcome expectancy and how they cope with feedback negativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gu R, Huang YX, Luo YJ | title = Anxiety and feedback negativity | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 47 | issue = 5 | pages = 961–7 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20374540 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2010.00997.x }}{{primary source inline|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperament (e.g., [[neuroticism]])&lt;ref name="NeuroticismMA"/&gt; and attitudes (e.g. pessimism) have been found to be risk factors for anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bienvenu Ginsburg 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bienvenu OJ, Ginsburg GS | title = Prevention of anxiety disorders | journal = International Review of Psychiatry | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 647–54 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18092242 | doi = 10.1080/09540260701797837 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognitive distortion]]s such as overgeneralizing, catastrophizing, mind reading, emotional reasoning, binocular trick, and mental filter can result in anxiety. For example, an overgeneralized belief that something bad "always" happens may lead someone to have excessive fears of even minimally risky situations and to avoid benign social situations due to anticipatory anxiety of embarrassment. In addition, those who have high anxiety can also create future stressful life events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips AC, Carroll D, Der G | title = Negative life events and symptoms of depression and anxiety: stress causation and/or stress generation | journal = Anxiety, Stress, and Coping | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 357–71 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25572915 | pmc = 4772121 | doi = 10.1080/10615806.2015.1005078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these findings suggest that anxious thoughts can lead to anticipatory anxiety as well stressful events, which in turn cause more anxiety. Such unhealthy thoughts can be targets for successful treatment with [[cognitive therapy]].

[[Psychodynamics|Psychodynamic]] theory posits that anxiety is often the result of opposing [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] wishes or fears that manifest via maladaptive [[Defence mechanisms|defense mechanisms]] (such as suppression, repression, anticipation, regression, somatization, passive aggression, dissociation) that develop to [[Ego psychology|adapt]] to problems with early [[Object relations theory|objects]] (e.g., caregivers) and [[Self psychology|empathic failures]] in childhood. For example, persistent parental discouragement of anger may result in repression/suppression of angry feelings which manifests as gastrointestinal distress (somatization) when provoked by another while the anger remains unconscious and outside the individual's awareness. Such conflicts can be targets for successful treatment with [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic therapy]]. While psychodynamic therapy tends to explore the underlying roots of anxiety, cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to be a successful treatment for anxiety by altering irrational thoughts and unwanted behaviors.

====Evolutionary psychology====
An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation is that increased anxiety serves the purpose of increased [[vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] regarding potential  threats in the environment as well as increased tendency to take proactive actions regarding such possible threats. This may cause [[false positive]] reactions but an individual suffering from anxiety may also avoid real threats. This may explain why anxious people are less likely to die due to accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andrews PW, Thomson JA | title = The bright side of being blue: depression as an adaptation for analyzing complex problems | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 116 | issue = 3 | pages = 620–54 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19618990 | pmc = 2734449 | doi = 10.1037/a0016242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When people are confronted with unpleasant and potentially harmful stimuli such as foul odors or tastes, [[Positron emission tomography|PET-scans]] show increased bloodflow in the [[amygdala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zald DH, Pardo JV | title = Emotion, olfaction, and the human amygdala: amygdala activation during aversive olfactory stimulation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 8 | pages = 4119–24 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9108115 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.8.4119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zald DH, Hagen MC, Pardo JV | title = Neural correlates of tasting concentrated quinine and sugar solutions | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 1068–75 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11826070 | doi = 10.1152/jn.00358.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these studies, the participants also reported moderate anxiety. This might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in potentially harmful behaviors.

===Social===
Social risk factors for anxiety include a history of trauma (e.g., physical, sexual or emotional abuse or assault), early life experiences and parenting factors (e.g., rejection, lack of warmth, high hostility, harsh discipline, high parental [[Negative affectivity|negative affect]], anxious childrearing, modelling of dysfunctional and drug-abusing behaviour, discouragement of emotions, poor socialization, poor attachment, and child abuse and neglect), cultural factors (e.g., stoic families/cultures, persecuted minorities including the disabled), and socioeconomics (e.g., uneducated, unemployed, impoverished (although developed countries have higher rates of anxiety disorders than developing countries).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12480&amp;page=530 |chapter=Table E-4 Risk Factors for Anxiety |page=530 |editor1-first=Mary Ellen |editor1-last=O'Connell |editor2-first=Thomas |editor2-last=Boat |editor3-first=Kenneth E. |editor3-last=Warner | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=National Academies Press |title=Prevention of Mental Disorders, Substance Abuse, and Problem Behaviors: A Developmental Perspective |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-309-12674-8 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender socialization====
Contextual factors that are thought to contribute to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, with higher levels of anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03634520009379205 |title=Anticipatory anxiety patterns for male and female public speakers |journal=Communication Education |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=187–195 |year=2000 |last1=Behnke |first1=Ralph R. |last2=Sawyer |first2=Chris R. | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=June 2015}} Research has demonstrated the ways in which facial prominence in photographic images differs between men and women. More specifically, in official online photographs of politicians around the world, women's faces are less prominent than men's. The difference in these images actually tended to be greater in cultures with greater institutional gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312450004 |title=Understanding Gender Differences in Anxiety |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=488–499 |year=2012 |last1=Zalta |first1=Alyson K. |last2=Chambless |first2=Dianne L. | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Anxiety disorder appears to be a genetically inherited neurochemical dysfunction that may involve autonomic imbalance; decreased GABA-ergic tone; allelic polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene; increased adenosine receptor function; increased cortisol.

In the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), the major mediators of the symptoms of anxiety disorders appear to be norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Other neurotransmitters and peptides, such as corticotropin-releasing factor, may be involved. Peripherally, the [[autonomic nervous system]], especially the sympathetic nervous system, mediates many of the symptoms. Increased flow in the right parahippocampal region and reduced serotonin type 1A receptor binding in the anterior and posterior cingulate and raphe of patients are the diagnostic factors for prevalence of anxiety disorder.

The amygdala is central to the processing of fear and anxiety, and its function may be disrupted in anxiety disorders. Anxiety processing in the basolateral amygdala has been implicated with dendritic arborization of the amygdaloid neurons. SK2  potassium channels mediate inhibitory influence on action potentials and reduce arborization.

[[Joseph E. LeDoux]] and [[Lisa Feldman Barrett]] have both sought to separate automatic threat responses from additional associated cognitive activity within anxiety.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3751">In [[neuroscience]] the '''bridge locus''' for a particular sensory [[percept]] is a hypothetical set of [[neuron]]s whose activity is the basis of that sensory percept. The term was introduced by D.N. Teller and E.Y. Pugh, Jr. in 1983, and has been sparingly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=D.N. Teller |author2=E.Y. Pugh, Jr. |title=Colour Vision |editors=J.D. Mollon, L.T. Sharpe |year=1983 |publisher=Academic Press |pages=581 |isbn=978-0-12-504280-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activity in the bridge locus neurons is postulated to be [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient]] for sensory perception: if the bridge locus neurons are not active, then the sensory perception does not occur, regardless of the actual sensory input. Conversely if the bridge locus neurons are active, then sensory perception occurs, regardless of the actual sensory input. It is the highest neural level of a sensory perception. So, for example, [[retina]]l neurons are not considered a bridge locus for visual perception because stimulating [[visual cortex]] can give rise to [[phosphene|visual percepts]].&lt;ref&gt;Davida Y Teller "Linking propositions" Vision Research (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all scholars believe in such a [[neural correlate of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Quest for Consciousness |author=Christof Koch |page=88 |publisher=Roberts and Company Publishers |year=2004 |isbn13=9780974707709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pessoa et al., for example, argue that there is no necessity for a bridge locus, basing their argument on the requirement of an isomorphism between neural states and conscious states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Neural Correlates of Consciousness |editor=Thomas Metzinger |chapter=What is a Neural Correlate of Consciousness |author=David J. Chalmers |page=37 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2000 |isbn13=9780262133708}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2011}} Thompson argues that there are good reasons to think that the notion of a bridge locus, which he calls a "localizationist approach", is misguided, questioning the premise that there has to be one particular neural stage whose activity forms the immediate substrate of perception. He argues, based upon work by Zeki &amp; Shipp, DeYoe &amp; Van Essen, and others, that brain regions are not independent stages or modules but have dense forward and backward projections that act reciprocally, and that visual processing is highly interactive and context-dependent. He also argues that cells in the visual cortex "are not mere 'feature detectors{{'"}}, and that neuroscience has revealed that the brain in fact employs distributed networks, rather than centralized representations. He equates the notion of a bridge locus to a [[Cartesian theatre]] and suggests that as a notion it should be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Consciousness and Intentionality |editor=Denis Fisette |chapter=Filling-in: Visual Science and the Philosophy of Perception |author=Evan Thompson |page=156 |publisher=Springer |year=1999 |isbn13=9780792359074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''China Time-honored Brand''' ([[simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: '''''Zhonghua lao zihao''''' 中华老字号 or simply '''''lao zihao''''' 老字号) is a title granted by the [[Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Commerce]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] to Chinese enterprises that existed before 1956, sell products, techniques or services passed down through generations, have distinct Chinese cultural characteristics and are widely recognized by society.{{sfn|van der Meulen|Sun|Carvajal|Kite|2016|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=H2glBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA454&amp;dq=%22China%20time-honored%20brand%22&amp;pg=PA454#v=onepage&amp;q=%22China%20time-honored%20brand%22&amp;f=false 454]}}

This title was first granted soon after the foundation of the PRC in 1949.{{sfn|Forêt|Mazzalovo|2014|p=133}} The current eligibility criteria were set in 2006, when the Ministry of Commerce revised them for the last time.{{sfn|Forêt|Mazzalovo|2014|p=133}}

There are currently around 1,000 brands granted this title,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} among which are [[Tongrentang]] ([[traditional Chinese medicine]]), [[Quanjude]] ([[Peking Duck]]) and [[Go Believe]] ([[baozi]] or steamed dumpling). Many of the shops have a history of over 400 years, and in modern times have begun to expand via mass [[commercialization]] of their products.

'''Chronology''' (from [[Latin]] ''chronologia'', from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]]}}, ''chrónos'', "time"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chronology|volume=6|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[science]] of arranging events in their order of occurrence in [[time]]. Consider, for example, the use of a [[timeline]] or [[sequence of events]]. It is also "the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events".&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;Memidex/WordNet, "chronology," [http://www.memidex.com/chronology+humanistic-discipline memidex.com] (accessed September 25, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronology is part of [[periodization]]. It is also part of the discipline of [[history]], including [[earth history]], the [[earth sciences]], and study of the [[geologic time scale]].

==Related fields==
Chronology is the science of locating historical events in time. It relies upon [[chronometry]], which is also known as timekeeping, and [[historiography]], which examines the writing of history and the use of historical methods. [[Radiocarbon dating]] estimates the age of formerly living things by measuring the proportion of [[carbon-14]] [[isotope]] in their [[carbon]] content. [[Dendrochronology]] estimates the age of trees by [[correlation]] of the various [[growth rings]] in their wood to known year-by-year reference sequences in the region to reflect year-to-year climatic variation. Dendrochronology is used in turn as a [[calibration]] reference for [[radiocarbon dating]] curves.

==Calendar and era==
{{Main article|Calendar}}

The familiar terms ''[[calendar]]'' and ''[[era]]'' (within the meaning of a coherent system of numbered calendar years) concern two complementary fundamental concepts of chronology. For example, during eight centuries the calendar belonging to the [[Christian era]], which era was taken in use in the 8th century by [[Bede]], was the Julian calendar, but after the year 1582 it was the Gregorian calendar. [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (about the year 500) was the founder of that era, which is nowadays the most widespread dating system on earth. An [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] is the date (year usually) when an era begins.

===Ab Urbe condita era===
{{Main article|Ab urbe condita}}
''Ab Urbe condita'' is [[Latin]] for "from [[founding of Rome|the founding]] of the City ([[Rome]])",&lt;ref&gt;Literally translated as "From the city having been founded".&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally set in 753 BC. It was used to identify the Roman year by a few Roman historians. Modern historians use it much more frequently than the Romans themselves did; the dominant method of identifying Roman years was to name the two [[consul]]s who held office that year. Before the advent of the modern critical edition of historical Roman works, AUC was indiscriminately added to them by earlier editors, making it appear more widely used than it actually was.

It was used systematically for the first time only about the year 400, by the Iberian historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. [[Pope Boniface IV]], in about the year 600, seems to have been the first who made a connection between these this era and [[Anno Domini]]. (AD 1 = AUC 754.)

===Astronomical era===
{{Main article|Astronomical year numbering}}
Dionysius Exiguus’ Anno Domini era (which contains only calendar years ''AD'') was extended by [[Bede]] to the complete [[Christian]] era (which contains, in addition all calendar years ''BC'', but no ''year zero''). Ten centuries after Bede, the French astronomers [[Philippe de la Hire]] (in the year 1702) and [[Jacques Cassini]] (in the year 1740), purely to simplify certain calculations, put the [[Julian Date|Julian Dating System]] (proposed in the year 1583 by [[Joseph Scaliger]]) and with it an astronomical era into use, which contains a [[leap year]] zero, which precedes the year 1 (AD).&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, pp. 591-592.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistoric chronologies==
While of critical importance to the historian, methods of determining chronology are used in most disciplines of science, especially [[astronomy]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]] and [[archaeology]].

In the absence of [[written history]], with its [[chronicle]]s and [[:Category:King lists|king lists]], late 19th century archaeologists found that they could develop relative chronologies based on pottery techniques and styles. In the field of [[Egyptology]], [[William Flinders Petrie]] pioneered sequence dating to penetrate pre-dynastic [[Neolithic]] times, using groups of contemporary artefacts deposited together at a single time in graves and working backwards methodically from the earliest historical phases of Egypt. This method of dating is known as [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]].

Known wares discovered at strata in sometimes quite distant sites, the product of trade, helped extend the network of chronologies. Some cultures have retained the name applied to them in reference to characteristic forms, for lack of an idea of what they called themselves: "The [[Beaker People]]" in northern Europe during the 3rd millennium BCE, for example. The study of the means of placing pottery and other cultural artifacts into some kind of order proceeds in two phases, classification and typology: Classification creates categories for the purposes of description, and typology seeks to identify and analyse changes that allow artifacts to be placed into sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Greene | first =Kevin | authorlink = | title =Archaeology : An Introduction | publisher =University of Newcastle Upon Tyne |date=November 2007 | location = | pages = Chapter 4 | url =http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/kevin.greene/wintro/chap4.htm | isbn = | accessdate =2008-01-04 | nopp =true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory techniques developed particularly after mid-20th century helped constantly revise and refine the chronologies developed for specific cultural areas. Unrelated dating methods help reinforce a chronology, an axiom of corroborative [[evidence]]. Ideally, archaeological materials used for dating a site should complement each other and provide a means of cross-checking. Conclusions drawn from just one unsupported technique are usually regarded as unreliable.

==Chronological synchronism==
The fundamental problem of chronology is to synchronize events. By synchronizing an event it becomes possible to relate it to the current time and to compare the event to other events. Among historians, a typical need to is to synchronize the reigns of kings and leaders in order to relate the history of one country or region to that of another. For example, the [[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicon of Eusebius]] (325 A.D.) is one of the major works of historical synchronism. This work has two sections. The first contains narrative chronicles of nine different kingdoms: Chaldean, Assyrian, Median, Lydian, Persian, Hebrew, Greek, Peloponnesian, Asian, and Roman. The second part is a long table synchronizing the events from each of the nine kingdoms in parallel columns. The adjacent image shows two pages from the second section.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Eusebius Chronicon example.png|thumb|alt=Example pages from the Chronicon of Eusebius.|Chronicon of Eusebius.]] --&gt;

By comparing the parallel columns, the reader can determine which events were contemporaneous, or how many years separated two different events. To place all the events on the same time scale, Eusebius used an [[Anno Mundi]] (A.M.) era, meaning that events were dated from the supposed beginning of the world as computed from the [[Book of Genesis]] in the Hebrew [[Pentateuch]]. According to the computation Eusebius used, this occurred in 5199 B.C. The Chronicon of Eusebius was widely used in the medieval world to establish the dates and times of historical events. Subsequent chronographers, such as [[George Syncellus]] (died circa 811), analyzed and elaborated on the Chronicon by comparing with other chronologies. The last great chronographer was [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] (1540-1609) who reconstructed the lost Chronicon and synchronized all of ancient history in his two major works, ''De emendatione temporum'' (1583) and ''Thesaurus temporum'' (1606). Much of modern historical datings and chronology of the ancient world ultimately derives from these two works.&lt;ref name=Grafton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|title=Joseph Scaliger: A Study in the History of Classical Scholarship|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scaliger invented the concept of the [[Julian day|Julian Day]] which is still used as the standard unified scale of time for both historians and astronomers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In addition to the literary methods of synchronism used by traditional chronographers such as Eusebius, Syncellus and Scaliger, it is possible to synchronize events by archaeological or astronomical means. For example, the [[Eclipse of Thales]], described in the first book of [[Herodotus]] can potentially be used to date the Lydian War because the eclipse took place during the middle of an important battle in that war. Likewise, various eclipses and other astronomical events described in ancient records can be used to astronomically synchronize historical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=David H.|title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1441976239|pages=614}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method to synchronize events is the use of archaeological findings, such as pottery, to do [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|sequence dating]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37625">In [[cognitive psychology]], '''cognitive load''' refers to the effort being used in the [[working memory]].  Cognitive load theory differentiates cognitive load into three types: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.

''Intrinsic'' cognitive load is the effort associated with a specific topic, ''extraneous'' cognitive load refers to the way information or tasks are presented to a learner, and ''germane'' cognitive load refers to the work put into creating a permanent store of knowledge, or a [[schema (psychology)|schema]].

Cognitive load theory was developed  in the late 1980s out of a study of [[problem solving]] by [[John Sweller]].&lt;ref name="Sweller, 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweller|first1=J|title=Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning|journal=Cognitive Science|date=June 1988|volume=12|issue=2|pages=257–285|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweller argued that [[instructional design]] can be used to reduce cognitive load in learners.
Much later, other researchers developed a way to measure perceived mental effort which is indicative of cognitive load.&lt;ref name=Paas1993&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paas|first1=Fred G. W. C.|last2=Van Merriënboer|first2=Jeroen J. G.|title=The Efficiency of Instructional Conditions: An Approach to Combine Mental Effort and Performance Measures|journal=Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society|date=1993|volume=35|issue=4|pages=737–743|doi=10.1177/001872089303500412|url=http://hfs.sagepub.com/content/35/4/737.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skulmowski &amp; Rey 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skulmowski |first1=Alexander |last2=Rey |first2=Günter Daniel |title=Measuring Cognitive Load in Embodied Learning Settings |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |date=2017 |volume=8 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01191}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Task-invoked pupillary response]] is a reliable and sensitive measurement of cognitive load that is directly related to [[working memory]].&lt;ref name="Granholm et al. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pupillary responses index cognitive resource limitations|journal=Psychophysiology|date=July 1996|volume=33|issue=4|pages=457–461|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1996.tb01071.x|pmid=8753946|author1=Granholm|first1=E.|last2=Asarnow|first2=R. F.|last3=Sarkin|first3=A. J.|last4=Dykes|first4=K. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy cognitive load can have negative effects on task completion, and it is important to note that the experience of cognitive load is not the same in everyone. The elderly, students, and children experience different, and more often higher, amounts of cognitive load.

High cognitive load in the elderly has been shown to affect their center of balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersson|first1=Gerhard|last2=Hagman|first2=Jenni|last3=Talianzadeh|first3=Roya|last4=Svedberg|first4=Alf|last5=Larsen|first5=Hans Christian|title=Effect of cognitive load on postural control|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|date=May 2002|volume=58|issue=1|pages=135–139|doi=10.1016/s0361-9230(02)00770-0|pmid=12121823}}&lt;/ref&gt; With increased distractions, particularly from cell phone use, students are more prone to experiencing high cognitive load which can reduce academic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frein|first1=Scott T.|last2=Jones|first2=Samantha L.|last3=Gerow|first3=Jennifer E.|title=When it comes to Facebook there may be more to bad memory than just multitasking|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=November 2013|volume=29|issue=6|pages=2179–2182|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.04.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
"Cognitive load theory has been designed to provide guidelines intended to assist in the presentation of information in a manner that encourages learner activities that optimize intellectual performance".&lt;ref name="Sweller et al., 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sweller, J. |author2=Van Merriënboer, J. |author3=Paas, F.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1998 |title=Cognitive architecture and instructional design |journal=[[Educational Psychology Review]] |volume= 10 |issue=3 |pages=251–296 |doi=10.1023/A:1022193728205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweller's theory employs aspects of [[information processing]] theory to emphasize the inherent limitations of concurrent [[working memory]] load on learning during instruction. It makes use of the [[schema (psychology)|schema]] as primary unit of analysis for the design of [[instructional materials]].

===History===
The history of cognitive load theory can be traced to the beginning of Cognitive Science in the 1950s and the work of [[George Armitage Miller|G.A. Miller]]. In his classic paper,&lt;ref name="Miller, 1956"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miller, G.A. |year=1956 |title=The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity to process information  |journal=Psychological Review |volume=63 |pages=81–97 |doi=10.1037/h0043158 |pmid=13310704 |issue=2|titlelink=The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|citeseerx=10.1.1.308.8071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller was perhaps the first to suggest our [[Working memory#Capacity|working memory capacity]] has inherent limits.  His experimental results suggested that humans are generally able to hold only [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|seven plus or minus two units]] of information in short-term memory. And in the early 1970s Simon and Chase&lt;ref name="Simon and Chase, 1973"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chase, W.G.  |author2=Simon, H.A. |year=1973 |title=Perception in chess |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=55–81 |doi= 10.1016/0010-0285(73)90004-2|bibcode=1992CogPs..24..535V }}&lt;/ref&gt; were the first to use the term "chunk" to describe how people might organize information in short-term memory. This chunking of memory components has also been described as [[schema (psychology)|schema]] construction.

In the late 1980s [[John Sweller]] developed cognitive load theory (CLT) while studying problem solving.&lt;ref name="Sweller, 1988"/&gt; Studying learners as they solved problems, he and his associates found that learners often use a problem solving strategy called [[means-ends analysis]]. He suggests problem solving by means-ends analysis requires a relatively large amount of cognitive processing capacity, which may not be devoted to schema construction. Sweller suggests that instructional designers should prevent this unnecessary cognitive load by designing instructional materials which do not involve problem solving. Examples of alternative instructional materials include what are known as worked-examples and goal-free problems.

In the 1990s, cognitive load theory was applied in several contexts. The empirical results from these studies led to the demonstration of several learning effects: the completion-problem effect;&lt;ref name="Paas, 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paas, F. |year=1992 |title=Training strategies for attaining transfer of problem-solving skill in statistics: A cognitive-load approach |journal=[[Journal of Educational Psychology]] |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=429–434 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.84.4.429}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[modality effect]];&lt;ref name="Moreno &amp; Mayer, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moreno, R. |author2=Mayer, R.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1999 |title=Cognitive principles of multimedia learning: The role of modality and contiguity |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=358–368 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.91.2.358|citeseerx=10.1.1.458.4719  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousavi, Low, &amp; Sweller, 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mousavi, S. |author2=Low, R. |author3=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1995 |title=Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=319–334 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.87.2.319|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.2089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[split-attention effect]];&lt;ref name="Chandler and Sweller, 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chandler, P. |author2=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1992 |title=The split-attention effect as a factor in the design of instruction |journal=British Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=62 |issue=2  |pages=233–246 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8279.1992.tb01017.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[worked-example effect]];&lt;ref name="Cooper &amp; Sweller, 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cooper, G. |author2=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1987 |title=Effects of schema acquisition and rule automation on mathematical problem-solving transfer |journal= Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=347–362 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.79.4.347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweller &amp; Cooper, 1985"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sweller, J. |author2=Cooper, G.A.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1985 |title=The use of worked examples as a substitute for problem solving in learning algebra |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=59–89 |doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0201_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[expertise reversal effect]].&lt;ref name="Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, and Sweller, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kalyuga, S. |author2=Ayres, P.

==Types==
Cognitive load theory provides a general framework and has broad implications for [[instructional design]], by allowing instructional designers to control the conditions of learning within an environment or, more generally, within most instructional materials. Specifically, it provides empirically-based guidelines that help instructional designers decrease extraneous cognitive load during learning and thus refocus the learner's attention toward germane materials, thereby increasing germane (schema related) cognitive load. This theory differentiates between three types of cognitive load: intrinsic cognitive load, germane cognitive load, and extraneous cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Sweller et al., 1998" /&gt;

===Intrinsic===
''Intrinsic cognitive load'' is the inherent level of difficulty associated with a specific instructional topic. The term was first used in the early 1990s by Chandler and Sweller.&lt;ref name="Chandler &amp; Sweller, 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chandler, P.  |author2=Sweller, J. |year=1991 |title=Cognitive Load Theory and the Format of Instruction |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=293–332 |doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0804_2|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/edupapers/128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, all instruction has an inherent difficulty associated with it (e.g., the calculation of 2 + 2, versus solving a [[differential equation]]). This inherent difficulty may not be altered by an instructor. However, many schemas may be broken into individual "subschemas" and taught in isolation, to be later brought back together and described as a combined whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1|title=Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching|journal=Educational Psychologist|volume=41|issue=2|pages=75–86|year=2006|last1=Kirschner|first1=Paul A.|last2=Sweller|first2=John|last3=Clark|first3=Richard E.|url=http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/kirschner_Sweller_Clark.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329224506/http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/kirschner_Sweller_Clark.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extraneous===
''Extraneous cognitive load'' is generated by the manner in which information is presented to learners and is under the control of instructional designers.&lt;ref name="Chandler &amp; Sweller, 1991" /&gt; This load can be attributed to the design of the instructional materials. Because there is a single limited cognitive resource using resources to process the extraneous load, the amount of resources available to process the intrinsic load and germane load (i.e., learning) is reduced. Thus, especially when intrinsic and/or germane load is high (i.e., when a problem is difficult), materials should be designed so as to reduce the extraneous load.&lt;ref name="Ginns, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ginns, P. |year= 2006 |title=Integrating information: A meta-analysis of the spatial contiguity and temporal contiguity effects |journal=Learning and Instruction |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=511–525 |doi= 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2006.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of extraneous cognitive load occurs when there are two possible ways to describe a square to a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Clark, R. |author2=Nguyen, F. |author3=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2006 |title=Efficiency in Learning: Evidence-Based Guidelines to Manage Cognitive Load |location=San Francisco |publisher=Pfeiffer |isbn=978-0-7879-7728-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A square is a figure and should be described using a figural medium. Certainly an instructor can describe a square in a verbal medium, but it takes just a second and far less effort to see what the instructor is talking about when a learner is shown a square, rather than having one described verbally. In this instance, the efficiency of the visual medium is preferred. This is because it does not unduly load the learner with unnecessary information. This unnecessary cognitive load is described as extraneous.

Chandler and Sweller introduced the concept of extraneous cognitive load. This article was written to report the results of six experiments that they conducted to investigate this working memory load. Many of these experiments involved materials demonstrating the [[split attention effect]]. They found that the format of instructional materials either promoted or limited learning. They proposed that differences in performance were due to higher levels of the cognitive load imposed by the format of instruction. "Extraneous cognitive load" is a term for this unnecessary (artificially induced) cognitive load.

===Germane===
''Germane cognitive load'' is the processing, construction and automation of [[schema (psychology)|schemas]]. It was first described by Sweller, Van Merriënboer and Paas in 1998. While [https://acmecollinsschool.com/blog/cognitive-load intrinsic cognitive load] is generally thought to be immutable (although techniques can be applied to manage complexity by segmenting and sequencing complex material), instructional designers can manipulate extraneous and germane load. It is suggested that they limit extraneous load and promote germane load.&lt;ref name="Sweller et al., 1998"/&gt;

Until the 1998 article by Sweller, Van Merriënboer &amp; Paas, cognitive load theory primarily concentrated on the reduction of extraneous cognitive load. With this article, cognitive load researchers began to seek ways of redesigning instruction to redirect what would be extraneous load, to now be focused toward schema construction (germane load). Thus it is very important for instructional designers to "reduce extraneous cognitive load and redirect learners' attention to cognitive processes that are directly relevant to the construction of schemas".&lt;ref&gt;(Sweller et al., 1998, p. 265)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
Paas and Van Merriënboer&lt;ref name=Paas1993/&gt; developed a construct (known as relative condition efficiency) which helps researchers measure perceived mental effort, an index of cognitive load. This construct provides a relatively simple means of comparing instructional conditions. It combines mental effort ratings with performance scores. Group mean z-scores are graphed and may be compared with a one-way [[ANOVA|Analysis of variance (ANOVA)]].

Paas and Van Merriënboer used relative condition efficiency to compare three instructional conditions (worked examples, completion problems, and discovery practice). They found learners who studied worked examples were the most efficient, followed by those who used the problem completion strategy. Since this early study many other researchers have used this and other constructs to measure cognitive load as it relates to learning and instruction.&lt;ref name="Paas et al. (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Paas, F. |author2=Tuovinen, J.E. |author3=Tabbers, H.K. |author4=Van Gerven, P.W.M.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2003 |title=Cognitive load measurement as a means to advance cognitive load theory |journal=Educational Psychologist |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=63–71 |doi=10.1207/S15326985EP3801_8|citeseerx=10.1.1.670.1047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ergonomic approach seeks a quantitative neurophysiological expression of cognitive load which can be measured using common instruments, for example using the [[heart rate]]-[[blood pressure]] product (RPP) as a measure of both cognitive and physical occupational workload.&lt;ref name="Fredericks et al., 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fredericks T.K. |author2=Choi S.D. |author3=Hart J. |author4=Butt S.E. |author5=Mital A. |year=2005 |title=An investigation of myocardial aerobic capacity as a measure of both physical and cognitive workloads |journal=International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=1097–1107 |doi= 10.1016/j.ergon.2005.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that it may be possible to use RPP measures to set limits on workloads and for establishing work allowance.

[[Task-invoked pupillary response]] is a form of measurement that directly reflects the cognitive load on [[working memory]]. Greater pupil dilation is found to be associated with high cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Granholm et al. 1996"/&gt; Pupil constriction occurs when there is low cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Granholm et al. 1996"/&gt; [[Task-invoked pupillary response]] shows a direct correlation with working memory, making it an effective measurement of cognitive load explicitly unrelated to learning.

Some researchers have compared different measures of cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski &amp; Rey 2017" /&gt;  For example, Deleeuw and Mayer (2008)&lt;ref name="DeLeeuw and Mayer (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=DeLeeuw, K.E. |author2=Mayer, R.E.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2008 |title=A comparison of three measures of cognitive load: Evidence for separable measures of intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load. |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=223–234 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.100.1.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared three commonly used measures of cognitive load and found that they responded in different ways to extraneous, intrinsic, and germane load.

==Individual differences in processing capacity==
Evidence has been found that individuals systematically differ in their processing capacity.&lt;ref name="Scandura, 1971"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scandura|first1=Joseph M.|title=Deterministic Theorizing in Structural Learning: Three Levels of Empiricism|journal=Journal of Structural Learning|language=en|date=1971|volume=3|issue= 1|pp=21–53|citeseerx=10.1.1.532.3585|issn=0022-4774|id=[[ERIC]]: [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ085112 EJ085112]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Voorhies &amp; Scandura, 1977"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voorhies|first1= D.|last2=Scandura|first2=J.

M.|location=New York|chapter= Determination of memory load in information processing|pp=299–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are individual differences in processing capacities between novices and experts.&lt;ref name="Murphy and Wright 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Gregory L.|last2=Wright|first2=Jack C.|title=Changes in conceptual structure with expertise: Differences between real-world experts and novices.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=1984|volume=10|issue=1|pages=144–155|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.10.1.144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have more knowledge or experience with regard to a specific task which reduces the cognitive load associated with the task. Novices do not have this experience or knowledge and thus have heavier cognitive load.

It has been theorized that an impoverished environment can contribute to cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Mani et al. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mani|first1=A.|last2=Mullainathan|first2=S.|last3=Shafir|first3=E.|last4=Zhao|first4=J.|title=Poverty Impedes Cognitive Function|journal=Science|date=29 August 2013|volume=341|issue=6149|pages=976–980|doi=10.1126/science.1238041|pmid=23990553|bibcode=2013Sci...341..976M|citeseerx=10.1.1.398.6303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the task at hand, or the processes used in solving the task, people who experience poverty also experience higher cognitive load. A number of factors contribute to the cognitive load in people with lower [[socioeconomic status]] that are not present in middle and upper-class people.&lt;ref name="Hackman and Farah"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackman|first1=Daniel A.|last2=Farah|first2=Martha J.|title=Socioeconomic status and the developing brain|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=February 2009|volume=13|issue=2|pages=65–73|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003|pmid=19135405|pmc=3575682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifying the processing capacity of individuals could be extremely useful in further adapting instruction (or predicting the behavior) of individuals. Accordingly, further research would clearly be desirable. First, it is essential to compute the memory load imposed by detailed analysis of the processes to be used. Second, it is essential to ensure that individual subjects are actually using those processes. The latter requires intensive pre-training.

==Effects of heavy cognitive load==
{{See also|Audience effect|Drive theory}}
A heavy cognitive load typically creates [[error]] or some kind of interference in the task at hand.&lt;ref name="Paas, 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moreno &amp; Mayer, 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousavi, Low, &amp; Sweller, 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandler and Sweller, 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper &amp; Sweller, 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweller &amp; Cooper, 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, and Sweller, 2003"/&gt; A heavy cognitive load can also increase [[Stereotype|stereotyping]].&lt;ref name="Biernat et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biernat|first1=Monica|last2=Kobrynowicz|first2=Diane|last3=Weber|first3=Dara L.|title=Stereotypes and Shifting Standards: Some Paradoxical Effects of Cognitive Load|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=October 2003|volume=33|issue=10|pages=2060–2079|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb01875.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stereotype|Stereotyping]] is an extension of the [[Fundamental Attribution Error]] which also increases in frequency with heavier cognitive load.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1989&gt;Gilbert, D. T. (1989). Thinking lightly about others: Automatic components of the social inference process. In J. S. Uleman &amp; J. A. Bargh (Eds.), ''Unintended thought'' (pp. 189–211). New York, Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The notions of cognitive load and [[arousal]] contribute to the "Overload Hypothesis" explanation of [[social facilitation]]: in the presence of an audience, subjects tend to perform worse in subjectively complex tasks (whereas they tend to excel in subjectively easy tasks).

==Sub-population studies==
===Elderly===
The danger of heavy cognitive load is seen in the elderly population. Aging can cause declines in the efficiency of [[working memory]] which can contribute to higher cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Wingfield et al. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wingfield|first1=Arthur|last2=Stine|first2=Elizabeth A.L.|last3=Lahar|first3=Cindy J.|last4=Aberdeen|first4=John S.|title=Does the capacity of working memory change with age?|journal=Experimental Aging Research|date=June 1988|volume=14|issue=2|pages=103–107|doi=10.1080/03610738808259731|pmid=3234452}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between heavy cognitive load and control of [[center of mass]] are heavily correlated in the elderly population.

Conversely, an increasing demand for balance can increase cognitive load.

===College students===
With the widespread acceptance of laptops in the classroom, an increasing cognitive load while in school is a major concern. With the use of [[Facebook]] and other social forms of communication, adding multiple tasks is hurting students performance in the classroom. When many cognitive resources are available, the probability of switching from one task to another is high and does not lead to optimal switching behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Calderwood | first1 = C. | last2 = Ackerman | first2 = P.

===Children===
The components of [[working memory]] as proposed by British psychologists, [[Alan Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch]], are in place at 6 years of age.&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gathercole|first1=Susan E.|last2=Pickering|first2=Susan J.|last3=Ambridge|first3=Benjamin|last4=Wearing|first4=Hannah|title=The Structure of Working Memory From 4 to 15 Years of Age.|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=40|issue=2|pages=177–190|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.2.177|pmid=14979759|date=March 2004|citeseerx=10.1.1.529.2727}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a clear difference between adult and child knowledge. These differences are due to developmental increases in processing efficiency.&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt; Children lack general knowledge, and this is what creates increased cognitive load in children. Children in impoverished families often experience even higher cognitive load in learning environments than those in middle-class families.&lt;ref name="Siegler and Alibali"/&gt; These children do not hear, talk, or learn about schooling concepts because their parents often do not have formal education. When it comes to learning, their lack of experience with numbers, words, and concepts increases their cognitive load.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8792">In [[computer programming]], '''cohesion''' refers to the ''degree to which the elements inside a [[module (programming)|module]] belong together''.{{sfn|Yourdon|Constantine|1979}} In one sense, it is a measure of the strength of relationship between the methods and data of a class and some unifying purpose or concept served by that class. In another sense, it is a measure of the strength of relationship between the class’s methods and data themselves.

Cohesion is an [[level of measurement#Ordinal scale|ordinal]] type of measurement and is usually described as “high cohesion” or “low cohesion”. Modules with high cohesion tend to be preferable, because high cohesion is associated with several desirable traits of software including [[Robustness (computer science)|robustness]], reliability, [[reusability]], and understandability. In contrast, low cohesion is associated with undesirable traits such as being difficult to maintain, test, reuse, or even understand.

Cohesion is often contrasted with [[coupling (computer science)|coupling]], a different concept. High cohesion often correlates with [[loose coupling]], and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ingeno | first = Joseph | author-link =  | title = Software Architect’s Handbook  | publisher = Packt Publishing  | series =  | volume =
 | edition =  | date = 2018 | location =  | pages = 175 | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1788624068  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[software metric]]s of coupling and cohesion were invented by [[Larry Constantine]] in the late 1960s as part of [[Structured Design]], based on characteristics of “good” programming practices that reduced maintenance and modification costs. Structured Design, cohesion and coupling were published in the article {{harvtxt|Stevens|Myers|Constantine|1974}} and the book {{harvtxt|Yourdon|Constantine|1979}}; the latter two subsequently became standard terms in software engineering.

== High cohesion ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
In [[object-oriented programming]], if the methods that serve a class tend to be similar in many aspects, then the class is said to have high cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;Marsic (2012). Software Engineering. Rutgers University&lt;/ref&gt; In a highly cohesive system, code readability and [[reusability]] is increased, while complexity is kept manageable.

Cohesion is increased if:
*The functionalities embedded in a class, accessed through its methods, have much in common.
*Methods carry out a small number of related activities, by ''avoiding'' [[Granularity#Data granularity|coarsely grained]] or unrelated sets of data.

Advantages of high cohesion (or "strong cohesion") are:
*Reduced module complexity (they are simpler, having fewer operations).
*Increased system [[maintainability]], because logical changes in the domain affect fewer modules, and because changes in one module require fewer changes in other modules.
*Increased module reusability, because application developers will find the component they need more easily among the cohesive set of operations provided by the module.

While in principle a module can have perfect cohesion by only consisting of a single, atomic element – having a single function, for example – in practice complex tasks are not expressible by a single, simple element. Thus a single-element module has an element that either is too complicated, in order to accomplish a task, or is too narrow, and thus tightly coupled to other modules. Thus cohesion is balanced with both unit complexity and coupling.

== Types of cohesion ==
Cohesion is a qualitative measure, meaning that the source code to be measured is examined using a [[rubric (academic)|rubric]] to determine a classification. Cohesion types, from the worst to the best, are as follows:

;Coincidental cohesion (worst): Coincidental cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped arbitrarily; the only relationship between the parts is that they have been grouped together (e.g. a “Utilities” class). Example:
::&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
/*
Groups: The function definitions
Parts: The terms on each function
*/
Module A{
    /*
    Implementation of r(x) = 5x + 3
    There is no particular reason to group functions in this way,
    so the module is said to have Coincidental Cohesion.
    */    
    r(x) = a(x) + b(x) 
    a(x) = 2x + 1
    b(x) = 3x + 2
}

&lt;/source&gt;

;Logical cohesion: Logical cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they are logically categorized to do the same thing even though they are different by nature (e.g. grouping all mouse and keyboard input handling routines).

;Temporal cohesion: Temporal cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped by when they are processed - the parts are processed at a particular time in program execution (e.g. a function which is called after catching an exception which closes open files, creates an error log, and notifies the user).

;Procedural cohesion: Procedural cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they always follow a certain sequence of execution (e.g. a function which checks file permissions and then opens the file).

;Communicational/informational cohesion: Communicational cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they operate on the same data (e.g. a module which operates on the same record of information).

;Sequential cohesion: Sequential cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because the output from one part is the input to another part like an assembly line (e.g. a function which reads data from a file and processes the data).

;Functional cohesion (best): Functional cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they all contribute to a single well-defined task of the module (e.g. [[Lexical analysis]] of an XML string). Example:
::&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
/*
Groups: The function definitions
Parts: The terms on each function
*/
Module A {
    /*
    Implementation of arithmetic operations
    This module is said to have functional cohesion because 
    there is an intention to group simple arithmetic operations
    on it. 
    */
    a(x, y) = x + y
    b(x, y) = x * y
}

Module B {
    /*
    Module B: Implements r(x) = 5x + 3
    This module can be said to have atomic cohesion. The whole
    system (with Modules A and B as parts) can also be said to have functional
    cohesion, because its parts both have specific separate purposes. 
    */
    r(x) = [Module A].a([Module A].b(5, x), 3)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

;Perfect cohesion (atomic): Example.
::&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
/*
Groups: The function definitions
Parts: The terms on each function
*/
Module A {
  /* 
  Implementation of r(x) = 2x + 1 + 3x + 2
  It´s said to have perfect cohesion because it cannot be reduced any more than that.
  */
  r(x) = 5x + 3
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Although cohesion is a ranking type of scale, the ranks do not indicate a steady progression of improved cohesion. Studies by various people including [[Larry Constantine]], [[Edward Yourdon]], and [[Steve McConnell]] &lt;ref&gt;Code Complete 2nd Ed., p168-171&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that the first two types of cohesion are inferior; communicational and sequential cohesion are very good; and functional cohesion is superior.

While functional cohesion is considered the most desirable type of cohesion for a software module, it may not be achievable. There are cases where communicational cohesion is the highest level of cohesion that can be attained under the circumstances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Holding corporations accountable for either direct conduct or complicity for [[human rights]] violations has become an increasing area of attention in promoting human rights. [[Multinational corporation]]s in particular have been singled out as important figures, for better or worse, in the maintenance of human rights given their economic status and international dimension. As it currently stands there is no mechanism at the international level which can hold corporations legally accountable. Reliance has instead been placed upon a number of [[soft law]] instruments the most important one of which is the [[United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights]]. With the potential exception for redress under the [[Alien Tort Statute]] corporations are only legally accountable for human rights violations under the municipal law of the Nation in which the violation is alleged to have occurred or the company is based.

==Multinational corporations and human rights==
[[Multinational corporations]] emerged in the 1990s as one of the most significant challenges to the dominance of states in the social and economic international order.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Blitt “Beyond Ruggie’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Charting an Embracive Approach to Corporate Human Rights Compliance” (2012) 48 Tex Int’l L J 33 at 36&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 37 of the top 100 economies in the world were corporations, with [[Wal-Mart Stores]] annual revenue exceeding the GDP of all but the top 27 states in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tni.org/article/planet-earth-corporate-world], Transnational Institute"Planet Earth: A corporate world" (24 January 2013) &lt;www.tni.org&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, there have been increasing concerns over the role multinationals have in promoting and protecting international human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tni.org/sites/www.tni.org/files/download/state_of_power_hyperlinked_0.pdf], Transnational Institute "Architecture of Impunity" (23 January 2015) &lt;www.tni.org&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Under an orthodox view of international law the obligation to protect human rights lies with the nation state. The power of multinationals has been recognized as diminishing the ability of weaker states to enforce human rights.  Furthermore, concerns have been raised over the operation of multinationals in countries which have a poor human rights record.  Numerous cases such as [[Doe v. Unocal Corp.]] alleging gross human rights violations carried out by multinationals or their associates in countries such as [[Burma]] (Myanmar) exist. Whilst concern has been raised over the role multinationals have played in human rights violations, recognition has also been given to the fact that multinationals have the potential to promote human rights in states with a poor track record beyond the ability of other nation states.

==Accountability under the International human rights framework==
Under the International human rights framework corporations can only be held directly accountable for human rights violations which constitute international crimes as provided for in the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Emeka Duruigbo "Corporate Accountability and Liability for International Human Rights Abuses: Recent Changes and Recurring Challenges" (2008) 6 Nw U J Int'l Hum Rts 222 at 224&lt;/ref&gt;   Under the orthodox view States are the primary “subjects” of [[Public international law|international law]], and whilst [[International Organization]]s hold international legal personality, individuals and corporations hold limited standing&lt;ref&gt;Dapo Akande "International Organizations" in Evans, MD (ed) ''International Law'' (3rd ed, Oxford, Oxford, 2010) at 256&lt;/ref&gt; There has been extensive debate on what status multinational corporations should hold at international law. Those arguing that multinationals should hold rights and duties do so on the ground that this is necessary given their size and influence.&lt;ref&gt;Mirela V. Hristova "The Alien Tort Statute: A Vehicle for Implementing the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights and Promoting Corporate Social Responsibility" (2012) 47 USFL Rev 89 at 91&lt;/ref&gt; Those who argue against the imposition of international law upon multinationals contend that to do so would mean conveying rights which would inevitably enhance the influence and power they hold.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Alston, and Ryan Goodman ''International human rights: the successor to International human rights in context'' (Oxford, Oxford, 2013) at 1496&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments have seen the articulation of the human rights obligations of corporations but no enforceable regulatory mechanism exists at the international level.

===United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights===
{{Main|United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights}}

The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights stand as the authoritative statement on the human rights standards corporations should adhere to. The Principles consist of a three pillar framework: protect, respect and remedy. The Principles do not create new law or impose obligations on corporations, instead they provide what should constitute best practice.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Blitt, above n 1, at 43&lt;/ref&gt; The protect pillar retains the orthodox position that is the responsibility of states to protect human rights. The respect pillar holds that corporations should respect human rights, undertaking due diligence to ensure that their conduct does not infringe upon any rights. The remedy pillar calls for remedies both judicial and non-judicial to be provided for those whose human rights have been infringed by a corporation.  The response to the Principles has been mixed. The [[OECD]], [[European Commission]], and the [[United Nations Global Compact]] have all endorsed the Principles as providing clarity and a point of reference for future developments.&lt;ref&gt;at 50&lt;/ref&gt; Of most significance the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] formally endorsed the Principles shortly after their publication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38742#.VUDViCGqqko], "UN Human Rights Council endorses principles to ensure businesses respect human rights" UN News Centre (16 June 2011) &lt;www.un.org&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Principles not been met with universal favour. The [[International Federation for Human Rights]], which represents numerous human rights groups, criticized the Principles for failing to provide an effective remedy for victims on an international level and failing to recognize the responsibility of states for the actions of their companies abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fidh.org/International-Federation-for-Human-Rights/globalisation-human-rights/business-and-human-rights/UN-Human-Rights-Council-adopts], International Federation for Human Rights "UN Human Rights Council adopts Guiding Principles on business conduct, yet victims still waiting for effective remedies" (17 June 2011) &lt;www.fidh.org&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although currently non-binding there has been speculation by scholars that the Principles could provide a platform for a binding instrument or solidify into [[customary international law]] therefore creating legally binding obligations.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Knox "The Human Rights Council Endorses “Guiding Principles” for Corporations" (2011) 20 Am Soc'y Int'l L Insights 1 at 5,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Blitt, above n 1, at 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations Global Compact===
{{Main|United Nations Global Compact}}

===OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises===

The ''[[OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises]]'' is a soft-law instrument containing information on the standards of conduct Multinational corporations should aim to meet. “They provide non-binding principles and standards for responsible business conduct in a global context consistent with applicable laws and internationally recognised standards.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/text/], OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises 2011 Edition, 25 May 2011 at 3&lt;/ref&gt; Section IV of the updated 2011 version of the Guidelines deals directly with human rights and reiterates much of the content present in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. As such the Guidelines directly endorse the UN Guiding Principles.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Blitt. above n 1, at 50&lt;/ref&gt; Section IV provides:&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises 2011 Edition at 31&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"States have the duty to protect human rights. Enterprises should, within the framework of internationally recognised human rights, the international human rights obligations of the countries in which they operate as well as relevant domestic laws and regulations:
# Respect human rights, which means they should avoid infringing on the human rights of others and should address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved.
# Within the context of their own activities, avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts and address such impacts when they occur.
# Seek ways to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their business operations, products or services by a business relationship, even if they do not contribute to those impacts.
# Have a policy commitment to respect human rights.
# Carry out human rights due diligence as appropriate to their size, the nature and context of operations and the severity of the risks of adverse human rights impacts.
# Provide for or co-operate through legitimate processes in the remediation of adverse human rights impacts where they identify that they have caused or contributed to these impacts."
:::-- ''OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises'' (2011), Section IV
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The above six points mirror the three pillars of the UN Guiding Principles; State duty to protect, corporate responsibility to respect, and access to remedy. The Guidelines require participating states to establish National Contact Points (NCP). Allegations from individuals can be brought forward to the NCP. These are referred to as specific instances. The merits of the claim are then addressed by the NCP and if a case is found then an investigation will be undertaken. Mediation may take place between the company in question and the complainant as one of the final stages in the process. If a company is found to be in breach of the guidelines then a Final Statement will be produced outlining the violations of the Guidelines which occurred along with an impact assessment. Although remedies for any breaches of human rights are sought they cannot be enforced under the Guidelines. [[Amnesty International]] has commented that the Guidelines provide a "lens for examining business conduct with regard to human rights."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oecdwatch.org/publications-en/Publication_3966], Amnesty International United Kingdom, ''Briefing for UK National Contact Point on Human Rights Implementation of OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises'' (Amnesty International, June 2013) at 6&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense it has been argued that the OECD Guidelines have the potential to promote a degree of accountability. Amnesty International in its Briefing for the UK National Contact Point advised on the potential repercussions of a Final Statement for companies found to be non-compliant. Reputation, ability to operate, and value of shares may all be detrimentally affected by a finding of non-compliance.&lt;ref&gt;at 7&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty believes that this may act as a deterrent, leveling the playing field for those companies who ensure they adhere to human rights standards.&lt;ref&gt;at 8&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale behind this being that the cost-benefit relationship is altered in favour of adherence to human rights.

===Company codes===
{{See also|Corporate social responsibility}}

Many companies have taken it upon themselves to adopt their own codes of conduct which are self-imposed ethical standards. Most contain provisions on human rights. The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre maintains a list of companies which have a human rights policy in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business-humanrights.org/en/company-policy-statements-on-human-rights |title=Company policy statements on human rights |publisher=business-humanrights.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst codes promote accountability, critics have argued that given their voluntary nature, and generally speaking lack of enforcement mechanisms, they are of limited value.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Anderson "Respecting Human Rights: Multinational Corporations Strike Out" (2000) 2 U Pa J Lab &amp; Emp L 463, at 490&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alien Tort Statute===
{{Main|Alien Tort Statute}}

Several organisations and commentators have recognised that many victims of human rights violations at the hands of multinational corporations will not have a means of redress in the country the violation has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/guide_entreprises_uk-sectionii.pdf], International Federation for Human Rights ''Corporate Accountability for Human Rights Abuses: A Guide for Victims and NGOs on Recourse Mechanisms'' (FIDH, March 2012) at 179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://business-humanrights.org/sites/default/files/documents/BHRRC-Corp-Legal-Acc-Annual-Briefing-Jan-2015-FINAL%20REV.pdf] Business and Human Rights Resource Centre ''Annual Briefing: Corporate Legal Accountability'' (www.business-humanrights.org, January 2015) at 1&lt;/ref&gt; As such victims often rely on the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction. In Europe jurisdiction is granted to hear civil claims against via Resolution 44/2001 of the [[European Council]] but this requires that the corporation in question be domiciled in a Member State.&lt;ref&gt;International Federation for Human Rights, above n 21, at 216&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alien Tort Statute]] is unique in that it in principle provides Federal courts in the [[United States of America]] with near universal jurisdiction to hear claims alleging serious violation of [[customary international law]] or the "law of nations", the only nexus required being that the defendant be present in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;at 181&lt;/ref&gt; However, the application of the statute to claims made against multinational corporations for human rights violations occurring abroad remains uncertain. Corporate liability for extraterritorial harms has been allowed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C.]] Circuits but an increasing number of procedural limitations restricting access of foreign plaintiffs to redress have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Mirela V. Hristova, above n 6, at 106&lt;/ref&gt; The recent decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in [[Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.]] ruled that there is a presumption against the extraterritorial application of the Alien Tort Statue.&lt;ref name=second&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=kiobel&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006&amp;case=17590512216294512273&amp;scilh=0 ''Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum'', 621 F.3d 111 (2d Cir. 2010).]&lt;/ref&gt; The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre cites Kiobel as a turning point in the use of the Alien Tort Statue as a means for redress for human rights violations at the hands of corporations, and part of a wider trend globally in which avenues for extraterritorial claims are closing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business-humanrights.org/sites/default/files/documents/BHRRC-Corp-Legal-Acc-Annual-Briefing-Jan-2015-FINAL%20REV.pdf] Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, above n 22, at 1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3083">A '''critical vocabulary''' is a formal [[terminology]] related to one or more branches of [[critical theory]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Although it may be considered a type of [[jargon]], it is predominantly used by [[academic]]s {{Who|date=February 2018}} and is not [[slang]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  The word "critical", as used in the term ''critical vocabulary'', takes on two meanings: "of essential importance" and "of or pertaining to [[critic]]s or [[criticism]]."{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Thus, the vocabulary is of essential importance to the critical theory that employs it and is used by that critical theory in order to produce [[criticism]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Usage==
Unlike the term ''jargon'', the term ''critical vocabulary'' is seldom used as a [[collective noun]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  It is typically preceded by the [[definite article|definite]] or [[indefinite article]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  When speaking about more than one critical theory, it is used in the plural (i.e. "the critical vocabularies of postmodern studies").{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Criticism==
Several people have criticized critical vocabularies as tools of alienation or obfuscation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.www.tuftsdaily.com/media/storage/paper856/news/2005/04/22/Features/Has-Academic.Jargon.Finally.Gone.Too.Far-1490971.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110807012651/http://media.www.tuftsdaily.com/media/storage/paper856/news/2005/04/22/Features/Has-Academic.Jargon.Finally.Gone.Too.Far-1490971.shtml |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.case.edu/webdev/2006/03/23/beware_of_your_vocabulary |title=Beware of your vocabulary: Web Development Blog: Creative Services: Marketing and Communications: Case Western Reserve University |publisher=Blog.case.edu |date=2006-03-23 |accessdate=2013-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} Also there have been assertions that the relatively recent proliferation of critical vocabularies has resulted in redundancy of both terms and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans|first1=William W.|year=1977|title=Language and the lay linguist|journal=American Speech|volume=52|issue=1/2|pages=134–145 |doi=10.2307/454728 |last2=Newman |first2=Edwin |last3=Mueller |first3=Robert K.|jstor=454728}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} See the Pitfalls section under [[jargon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4523">A '''disability pretender''' is [[subculture]] term meaning a person who behaves as if he or she were disabled. It may be classified as a type of [[factitious disorder]] or as a [[medical fetishism]].

One theory{{cn|date=January 2018}} is that pretenders may be the "missing link" between devotees and wannabes, demonstrating an assumed continuum between those merely [[attraction to disability|attracted to people with disabilities]] and those who actively wish to become disabled. Many wannabes use pretending as a way to appease the intense emotional pain related to having [[body integrity identity disorder]].

Pretending takes a variety of forms. Some [[chatroom]] users on internet sites catering to devotees have complained that chat counterparts they assumed were female were revealed as male devotees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transabled.org/thoughts/other-thoughts/chloes-thoughts/pretence-and-authenticity.htm#more-7656 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425035041/http://transabled.org/thoughts/other-thoughts/chloes-thoughts/pretence-and-authenticity.htm#more-7656 |title=Pretence and Authenticity |author=Chloe |date=April 18, 2013 |archivedate=25 April 2013 |publisher=transabled.org » Blogging about BIID |accessdate=27 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of pretending (where a devotee derives pleasure by pretending to be a disabled woman) may indicate a very broad predisposition to pretending among devotees.

Pretending includes dressing and acting in ways typical of disabled people, including making use of aids ([[Walking sticks]], [[crutches]],  [[wheelchair]]s, [[mobility scooters]], [[white cane]]s, etc). Pretending may also take the form of a devotee persuading his or her sexual partner to play the role of a disabled person. Pretending may be practised in private, in intimacy, or in public, and may occupy surprisingly long periods. In the latter case, some pretenders hope that the disability may become permanent, such as through tissue [[necrosis]] caused by constricted blood supply.

People with this condition may refer to themselves as "transabled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baril|first1=Alexandre|last2=Trevenen|first2=Kathryn|title=Transabled women lost in translation?

'''Dry dung fuel''' (or '''dry manure fuel''') is animal [[feces]] that has been dried in order to be used as a fuel source. It is used as a fuel in many countries around the world. Using dry [[manure]] as a fuel source is an example of [[reuse of excreta]]. A disadvantage of using this kind of fuel is increased air pollution.&lt;ref name="MudwayDuggan2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mudway|first1=Ian S|last2=Duggan|first2=Sean T|last3=Venkataraman|first3=Chandra|last4=Habib|first4=Gazala|last5=Kelly|first5=Frank J|last6=Grigg|first6=Jonathan|title=Combustion of dried animal dung as biofuel results in the generation of highly redox active fine particulates| journal=Particle and Fibre Toxicology|volume=2|issue=1|year=2005|pages=6|issn=1743-8977|doi=10.1186/1743-8977-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, this kind of fuel source is known as "dung cakes".

== Types ==

===Dry dung and moist dung===
Dry dung is more commonly used than moist dung, because it [[Combustion|burns]] more easily. Dry manure is typically defined as having a moisture content less than 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fs.fed.us/woodybiomass/documents/Yakima_County_Biomass_Report.pdf|title = Biomass Report, Yakima County Public Works Solid Waste Division|format = PDF|date = |accessdate = 2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dung cakes ===
[[File:A Pile of Dung Cakes.JPG|thumb|A pile of dung cakes in the village [[Nihal Singh Wala]] of District [[Moga District|Moga]] in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]]]
"Dung cakes", made from the by-products of [[animal husbandry]], are traditionally used as fuel in [[India]] for making food in a domestic [[hearth]] called a [[Chulha]]. They are made by hand by village women and are traditionally made from cow or buffalo dung. One dung cake of an average size gives 2100 kJ worth of energy. Dung cakes are also known as ''goitha'', ''uple'', ''kande'', ''gosse'' or ''thepdi''.

These are the cakes of cow dung molded by bare hands with a curvature to be able to keep stuck to the walls. Once dried they are put in a pile and covered with thatch called ''bitauda''. These bitaudas are visible in parts of rural India albeit with different names. The size and shape of the cake might vary with region. Its also not uncommon to see these cakes directly used in earthen ovens.

This bio-fuel has been used primarily for two reasons: for easy disposal of cow dung and as easily available and cheap fuel. 

=== Human feces ===
[[Human feces]] can in principle also be dried and used as a fuel source if they are collected in a type of [[dry toilet]], for example an [[incinerating toilet]]. Since 2011, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] is supporting the development of such toilets as part of their "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge" to promote safer, more effective ways to treat human [[excreta]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth von Muench, Dorothee Spuhler, Trevor Surridge, Nelson Ekane, Kim Andersson, Emine Goekce Fidan, Arno Rosemarin (2013) [http://www.susana.org/_resources/documents/default/2-2042-ssp-17okt20134-10-about-the-gates-sanitation-grants-on-forum.pdf Sustainable Sanitation Alliance members take a closer look at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation’s sanitation grants], Sustainable Sanitation Practice Journal, Issue 17, p. 4-10&lt;/ref&gt; The [[omniprocessor|omni-processor]] is another example of using human feces contained in [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] or [[sewage sludge]] as a fuel source.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4341">'''Feed The Deed''', also known as '''#FeedtheDeed''', is a social media [[Pay it forward|pay-it-forward]] initiative that started in February 2014. Participants film themselves performing a creative [[random act of kindness]], then nominate friends and family to continue on the chain. The participant usually uploads a video or pictures of the kind act to [[Facebook]], then will tag four or five friends in the post. The nominated person is generally told to complete the task within 24 hours.&lt;ref name="torontosun1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2014/02/06/online-drinking-game-sparks-kindness-challenge |title=Online drinking game sparks kindness challenge &amp;#124; Toronto &amp; GTA &amp;#124; News |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=2014-02-06 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since this initiative was started, over 10,000 #FeedtheDeed posts have been uploaded to various forms of social media.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Megan Griffo |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/05/feed-the-deed_n_4898943.html |title=5 Priceless Ways These People Made Someone Else's Day Just A Little Bit Brighter |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend is most popular in Canada, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Mexico, but has since spread to over 30 countries.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; The act of kindness can be anything – from donating food and clothes to the homeless, to giving blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Feed+Deed+fuels+positivity+Canadian+university+campuses/9527086/story.html |title=Feed the Deed fuels positivity on Canadian university campuses |publisher=Montrealgazette.com |date=2014-02-19 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Feed The Deed originated as a response to the [[Neknominate]] drinking game, in which participants film themselves drinking alcohol then nominate friends to do the same.&lt;ref name="torontosun1"/&gt;

Josh Stern, a medical student at the [[University of Ottawa]], posted his original #FeedtheDeed video to his Facebook page. He was then contacted by his friend Russell Citron, who is president and founder of the non-profit organization [[Kindness Counts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/heebonics/spread-kindness-not-drunken-recklessness |title=Spread kindness, not drunken recklessness &amp;#124; The Canadian Jewish News |publisher=Cjnews.com |date=2014-02-18 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two decided to collaborate on the project by taking Stern's #FeedtheDeed moniker and running it through Citron's organization Kindness Counts.&lt;ref name="torontosun1"/&gt;

Stern says that the inspiration for #FeedtheDeed came from a [[YouTube]] video in which Brent Lindeque decided to use his neknomination to give food to a homeless man instead of drinking alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaritanmag.com/features/alcohol-fuelled-neknominations-replaced-feed-deed-kindness |title=Alcohol-Fuelled Neknominations Replaced by Feed The Deed Kindness &amp;#124; Samaritanmag.com - The Anti-Tabloid |publisher=Samaritanmag.com |date=2014-02-18 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindeque is currently running a similar campaign in [[South Africa]] called #ChangeOneThing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsu.ca/interrobang_article.php?storyID=10413&amp;sectionID=1&amp;issueID=251 |title=Fanshawe Student Union &gt; Interrobang |publisher=Fsu.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feed the Deed has been run through the "Kindness Counts" Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=March |first=Wednesday |url=http://www.gazette.uottawa.ca/en/2014/03/goodness-goes-viral/ |title=Goodness goes viral &amp;#124; uOttawa Gazette – Keeping our campus community informed |publisher=Gazette.uottawa.ca |date=2014-03-12 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1784">The term '''Formalesque''' was coined in 1994 by Australian art historian [[Bernard William Smith|Bernard Smith]] to replace 
[[Modernism]] as the name of the [[Art styles, periods and movements|artistic style]] of the period from around 1890 to 1960, now that this is no longer "modern".

''[[Modernism]]'' had emerged as a generic term to replace ''[[Post-Impressionism]]'' for the paintings of [[Manet]], [[Cézanne]], [[van Gogh]], and [[Gauguin]]. According to Smith, the key emphasis in such work is the importance of ''form'' and ''flatness''. The term was soon applied also in architecture (e.g. [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Walter Gropius]]) and sculpture (e.g. [[Jacob Epstein|Epstein]] and [[Brâncuși]]).

After 1960, Modernism was displaced by [[Postmodern art|Postmodernism]], and then by the art still at present referred to as "[[contemporary art]]". Since [[Modernism]] is no longer "modern", Smith argues that it requires a more appropriate [[Art styles, periods and movements|period style]] name to distinguish it: hence his introduction of '''Formalesque'''. Like "romanesque" and "arabesque", the name is intended to indicate a style that arose by the development of a basic interest in form (but without the specific connotations of the term [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]]).

[[File:Gillray Temperance 051126.jpg|thumb|[[James Gillray]]'s satirical print ''Temperance Enjoying a Frugal Meal''. [[George III]] is depicted with patched trousers and a chair covered with protective fabric, eating a simple boiled egg and using the tablecloth as his napkin. Winter flowers fill the unlit fireplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temperance enjoying a frugal meal|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1477394&amp;partId=1|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Frugality''' is the quality of being frugal, sparing, thrifty, prudent or economical in the [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of consumable [[resources]] such as [[food]], [[time]] or [[money]], and avoiding waste, lavishness or extravagance.&lt;ref name=cent&gt;{{cite web|title=frugal|url=http://www.leoyan.com/century-dictionary.com/cent2jpgframes.php?volno=03&amp;page=2393|work=Century Dictionary Online|accessdate=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macdonald|first=A.M. (ed.)|title=Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary|year=1972|publisher=Chambers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford American Dictionaries (computer application)|year=2005|publisher=Apple Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woolf|first=Henry (ed.)|title=Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary|year= 1980|publisher= Merriam|location=Springfield MA|isbn= 0-87779-398-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[behavioral science]], frugality has been defined as the tendency to acquire goods and services in a restrained manner, and resourceful use of already owned economic goods and services, to achieve a longer term [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lastovicka|first=J. L.|author2=Bettencourt, L. A.|author3= Hughner, R. S.|author4= Kuntze, R. J. |title=Lifestyle of the tight and frugal: Theory and measurement|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=1999|volume=26|pages=85–98|doi=10.1086/209552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==
Common [[strategies]] of frugality include the reduction of [[waste]], curbing costly [[habituation|habit]]s, suppressing instant [[gratification]] by means of fiscal self-restraint, seeking [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]], avoiding traps, defying expensive [[social norms]], detecting and avoiding [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] advertising, embracing cost-free options, using [[barter]], and staying well-informed about local circumstances and both market and product/service realities. Frugality may contribute to health by leading people to avoid products that are both expensive and unhealthy when used to excess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=P.|author2=Toney Smith, S.|author3=Segrist, D. J.|title=Too cheap to chug: Frugality as a buffer against college-student drinking |journal=Journal of Consumer Behaviour|year=2010|volume=9|pages=228–238|doi=10.1002/cb.314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frugal living is mainly practiced by those who aim to cut expenses, have more money, and get the most they possibly can from their money.&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, C. The Frugal Mind: 1,479 Money Saving Tips for Surviving the 1990s. Nottingham Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
In the context of some belief systems, frugality is a ''[[philosophy]]'' in which one does not trust (or is deeply wary of) "expert" knowledge from commercial markets or corporate cultures, claiming to know what is in the best economic, material, or spiritual interests of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Child, Hamilton: "How to Succeed in Business," Gazetteer and Business Directory of Ontario County, N.Y., for 1867-8, Page 91 e.g. H. Child, 1867&lt;/ref&gt;

Different spiritual communities consider frugality to be a virtue or a spiritual discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Richard Cartwright: "Environmental Theology", Page 169. Creekside Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Religious Society of Friends]] and the [[Puritan]]s are examples of such groups.&lt;ref&gt;Mecklin, John M.: "An Introduction to Social Ethics, The Social Conscience in a Democracy", Page 254. Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; The basic philosophy behind this is the idea that people ought to save money in order to allocate it to more charitable purposes, such as helping others in need.&lt;ref&gt;Watkinson, William L.: "Frugality in the Spiritual Life", Page 7. F. H. Revell company, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also [[environmentalists]] who consider frugality to be a virtue&lt;ref&gt;[[George Fillmore Swain|Swain, George Fillmore]]; ''Conservation of Water by Storage'', [[Yale University Press]], 1915, p. 26 e.g.&lt;/ref&gt; through which humans can make use of their ancestral skills as hunter-gatherers, carrying little and needing little, and finding meaning in nature instead of man-made conventions or religion. [[Henry David Thoreau]] expressed a similar philosophy in ''[[Walden]]'', with his zest for self-reliance and minimal possessions while [[simple living|living simply]] in the woods.&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David: "Walden", Page 184 e.g. T. Y. Crowell &amp; co, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate world==
Frugality has been adopted as a strategic imperative by large enterprises as a means of cost reduction&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Phil: "http://freecheap.blogspot.com/" 2010&lt;/ref&gt; through engenderment of a philosophy of careful spending amongst the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Woerner, Stephanie L.; "Networked at Cisco", Page 13. Center for eBusiness, Sloan School of Management, MIT, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Cost reduction is often perceived negatively, be it within a corporate organisation or in society, so inviting each employee to embrace frugality transfers the burden of cost reduction from management to the employee. In doing so, corporations introduce a moral obligation to cost cutting, proposing the notion that careful management of costs is in the company, shareholder and employee's best interests.

The '''global waste trade''' is the [[international trade]] of [[waste]] between countries for further [[waste treatment|treatment]], [[waste disposal|disposal]], or [[waste recycling|recycling]]. Toxic or [[hazardous waste]]s are often exported from developed countries to [[developing countries]], also known as countries of the [[Global South]]. Therefore, the burden of the toxicity of wastes from Western countries falls predominantly onto developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name=laha&gt;Laha, Somjita. Transboundary Toxic E-Waste Flow: Environmental Injustice through Neo-ecological Imperialism. Diss. Erasmus U Rotterdam, 2011. N.p.: International Institute of Social Studies, n.d. Web. &lt;http://www.iss.nl/fileadmin/ASSETS/iss/Documents/Conference_presentations/NatureInc_Somjita_Laha.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[World Bank]] Report ''What a Waste: A Global Review of Solid Waste Management'', describes the amount of solid waste produced in a given country. Specifically, countries which produce more solid waste are more economically developed and more industrialized.&lt;ref name=worldbank&gt;"What a Waste: A Global Review of Solid Waste Management." World Bank: 8–13. Urban Development. Web. http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTURBANDEVELOPMENT/Resources/336387-1334852610766/Chap3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The report explains that "[g]enerally, the higher the economic development and rate of urbanization, the greater the amount of solid waste produced.”&lt;ref name=worldbank /&gt; Therefore, countries in the Global North, which are more economically developed and urbanized, produce more solid waste than Global South countries.&lt;ref name=worldbank /&gt;

Current international trade flows of waste follow a pattern of waste being produced in the Global North and being exported to and disposed of in the Global South. Multiple factors affect which countries produce waste and at what magnitude, including geographic location, degree of [[industrialization]], and level of integration into the global economy.

Numerous scholars and researchers have linked the sharp increase in waste trading and the negative impacts of waste trading to the prevalence of [[Neoliberalism#Economic neoliberalism|neoliberal economic policy]].&lt;ref name=nixon&gt;Nixon, Rob. Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor. Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 2011. 1.

Pol'y 373 (1992)Fallacies of Free Market Environmentalism, The ; Blumm, Michael C.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the major economic transition towards neoliberal economic policy in the 1980s, the shift towards [[Free market|“free-market”]] policy has facilitated the sharp increase in the global waste trade. [[Henry Giroux]], Chair of Cultural Studies at McMaster University, gives his definition of neoliberal economic policy: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Neoliberalism ...removes economics and markets from the discourse of social obligations and social costs. ...As a policy and political project, neoliberalism is wedded to the privatization of public services, selling off of state functions, deregulation of finance and labor, elimination of the welfare state and unions, liberalization of trade in goods and capital investment, and the marketization and [[commodification]] of society.”&lt;ref&gt;Polychroniou, CJ. "Neoliberalism and the Politics of Higher Education: An Interview With Henry A. Giroux." Truthout. N.p., 26 Mar. 2013. Web. 13 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://truth-out.org/news/item/15237-predatory-capitalism-and-the-attack-on-higher-education-an-interview-with-henry-a-giroux&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Given this economic platform of privatization, neoliberalism is based on expanding free-trade agreements and establishing open-borders to international trade markets. [[Free trade|Trade liberalization]], a [[neoliberal]] economic policy in which trade is completely [[deregulation|deregulated]], leaving no tariffs, quotas, or other restrictions on international trade, is designed to further developing countries’ economies and integrate them into the global economy. Critics claim that although free-market trade liberalization was designed to allow any country the opportunity to reach economic success, the consequences of these policies have been devastating for Global South countries, essentially crippling their economies in a servitude to the Global North.&lt;ref name=laha /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Neoliberalism – Neoimperialism." EconomiX-CNRS (2005): 1–12. Web. &lt;http://www.oid-ido.org/IMG/pdf/neoico.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Even supporters such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], “progress of integration has been uneven in recent decades” &lt;ref&gt;"Global Trade Liberalization and the Developing Countries – An IMF Issues Brief. International Monetary Fund. Nov. 2001. Web. 11 Apr. 2014. http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/ib/2001/110801.htm#i&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, developing countries have been targeted by trade liberalization policies to import waste as a means of [[economic expansion]].&lt;ref name=cato&gt;Johnson, J. “Potential Gains from Trade in Dirty Industries: Revisiting Lawrence Summers’ Memo.” 398–402. Cato Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; The guiding neoliberal economic policy argues that the way to be integrated into the global economy is to participate in trade liberalization and exchange in international trade markets.&lt;ref name=cato /&gt; Their claim is that smaller countries, with less infrastructure, less wealth, and less manufacturing ability, should take in hazardous wastes as a way to increase profits and stimulate their economies.&lt;ref name=cato /&gt;

==Current debate over global waste trade==

===Arguments supporting global waste trade===
Current supporters of global waste trade argue that importing waste is an economic transaction which can benefit countries with little to offer the [[global economy]].&lt;ref name=cato /&gt; Countries which do not have the production capacity to manufacture high quality products can import waste to stimulate their economy.

[[Lawrence Summers]], former President of Harvard University and Chief Economist of the World Bank, issued a confidential memo arguing for global waste trade in 1991. The memo stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that… I’ve always thought that countries in Africa are vastly under polluted; their air quality is probably vastly inefficiently low compared to Los Angeles… Just between you and me shouldn't the World Bank be encouraging more migration of the dirty industries to the Least Developed Countries?"&lt;ref name=nixon /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This position, which is mainly motivated by economics and financial profit in particular, demonstrates the main argument for global waste trade. The Cato Institute published an article supporting global waste trade suggesting that “there is little evidence that hazardous wastes, which are often chronic carcinogens, contribute to death rates in developing countries.”&lt;ref name=cato /&gt; Elaborating on this point, the article argues that “people in developing countries would rationally accept increased exposure to hazardous pollutants in exchange for opportunities to increase their productivity—and, hence, their income.”&lt;ref name=cato /&gt;

Overall, the argument for global waste trade rests largely upon a perception that developing countries need to further their economic development. Supporters suggest that in engaging in global waste trade, developing countries of the Global South will expand their economies and increase profits.&lt;ref name=cato /&gt;

===Critiques of global waste trade===
Critics of global waste trade claim that lack of regulation and failed policies have allowed developing nations to become toxic dump yards for hazardous waste. The ever-increasing amounts of hazardous waste being shipped to developing countries increases the disproportionate risk that the people in these nations face. Critics of the effects of the global waste trade emphasize the enormous amount of hazardous wastes that people in poorer countries must deal with. They highlight the fact that most of the world’s hazardous wastes are produced by Western countries (the United States and Europe), yet the people who suffer [[health threat|negative health effects]] from these wastes are from poorer countries that did not produce the waste.

Peter Newell, Professor of Development Studies, argues that “environmental inequality reinforces and, at the same time reflects, other forms of hierarchy and exploitation along lines of class, race and gender.”&lt;ref name=newell&gt;Newell, Peter. "Race, Class, and the Global Politics of Environmental Inequality." Global Environmental Politics 5.3 (2005): 70–94. MIT Press Journals. Web. 14 Mar. 2014. &lt;http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/1526380054794835&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that the detrimental effects of hazardous waste trade affect the disadvantaged more than others, critics of global waste trade suggest that the implications of dumping hazardous waste has significant consequences for [[Person of color|People of Color]], women, and low-income people in particular.&lt;ref name=newell /&gt;

Critiquing the global waste trade for reproducing inequality on a global scale, many activists, organizers, and environmentalists from regions affected in the Global South have vocalized their disappointment with global waste trade policies. Evo Morales, the first indigenous [[Amerind peoples|Amerindian]] President of Bolivia, argues against the current economic system forcing the exploitation of his country and people. He claims:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If we want to save the planet earth, to save life and humanity, we have a duty to put an end to the capitalist system. Unless we put an end to the capitalist system, it is impossible to imagine that there will be equality and justice on this planet earth. This is why I believe that it is important to put an end to the exploitation of human beings and to the pillage of natural resources, to put an end to destructive wars for markets and raw materials, to the plundering of energy, particularly fossil fuels, to the excessive consumption of goods and to the accumulation of waste. The capitalist system only allows us to heap up waste.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan. "Material World: Evo Morales:A Call for Socialism?" World Socialist Movement. The Socialist Party of Great Britain, n.d. Web. 24 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2008/no-1246-june-2008/material-world-evo-moralesa-call-socialism&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Jean Francois Kouadio, an African native living near a toxic dump site in the Ivory Coast, explains his experience with the effects of toxic substances lingering throughout his community. With major Western corporations dumping their toxic wastes in the Ivory Coast, Kuoadio has lost two children to the effects of toxic wastes. He describes the loss of his second daughter Ama Grace, and how the doctors "said she suffered from acute glycemia caused by the toxic waste."&lt;ref&gt;Kauodio, Jean Francois. "Dirty Tricks and Toxic Waste in Ivory Coast." BBC, n.d. Web. 26 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article23715.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to critics from the Global South, researchers and scholars in the West have begun critiquing the uneven distribution of negative effects these hazardous waste dumpings are causing. [[Dorceta Taylor]], Professor at the University of Michigan, argues how Women of Color in the United States are disproportionately affected by these policies: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Women of color have been at the forefront of the struggle to bring attention to the issues that are devastating minority communities – issues such as hazardous waste disposal; exposure to toxins; ...Their communities, some of the most degraded environments ... are repositories of the waste products of capitalist production and excessive consumption. As a result, they have been in the vanguard of the struggle for environmental justice; they are the founders of environmental groups, grassroots activists, researchers, conference organizers, workshop leaders, lobbyists, and campaign and community organizers."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Dorceta E. "Women of Color, Environmental Justice, and Ecofeminism." In K. Warren (ed.) ''Ecofeminism: Women, Culture, Nature''(1997), pages 58–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

T.V. Reed, Professor of English and American Studies at Washington State University, argues that the correlation between historical colonialism and toxic colonialism is based on perceptions of indigenous land as ‘waste.’&lt;ref name=reed&gt;Toxic Colonialism, Environmental Justice, and Native Resistance in Silko's "Almanac of the Dead" T. V. Reed MELUS , Vol. 34, No. 2, Ethnicity and Ecocriticism (Summer, 2009) , pp. 25–42. https://www.jstor.org/stable/20532677.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that Western cultures have deemed indigenous land as “underdeveloped” and “empty,” and that the people inhabiting it are therefore less “civilized.”&lt;ref name=reed /&gt; Using the historical premises of colonialism, toxic colonialism reproduces these same arguments by defining Global South land as expendable for Western wastes.&lt;ref name=reed /&gt;

====Toxic colonialism====
[[Toxic Colonialism|Toxic colonialism]], defined as the process by which “underdeveloped states are used as inexpensive alternatives for the export or disposal of hazardous waste pollution by developed states,” is the core critique against the global waste trade.&lt;ref name=pratt&gt;Laura A. Pratt, Decreasing Dirty Dumping? A Reevaluation of Toxic Waste Colonialism and the Global Management of Transboundary Hazardous Waste, 35 Wm. &amp; Mary Envtl. L. &amp; Pol'y Rev. (2011), http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmelpr/vol35/iss2/5&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic colonialism represents the [[neocolonial]] policy which continues to maintain [[global inequality]] today through unfair [[trade system]]s.&lt;ref name=pratt /&gt; Toxic colonialism uses the term colonialism because “the characteristics of colonialism, involving [[economic dependence]], [[exploitation of labour]], and cultural inequality are intimately associated within the new realm of toxic waste colonialism.” &lt;ref name=pratt /&gt;

==Electronic waste==
{{main|Electronic waste}}
Electronic waste, also known as e-waste, refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices. A rapidly growing surplus of electronic waste around the world has resulted from quickly evolving technological advances, changes in media (tapes, software, MP3), falling prices, and [[planned obsolescence]]. An estimated 50 million tons of e-waste are produced each year, the majority of which comes from the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name=developing&gt;Sthiannopkao S, Wong MH. (2012) Handling e-waste in developed and developing countries: Initiatives, practices, and consequences. Sci Total Environ.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this electronic waste is shipped to developing countries in Asia and Africa to be processed and recycled.&lt;ref name=developing /&gt;

Various studies have investigated the [[Electronic waste#Environmental Impact of Electronic Waste|environmental and health effects]] of this e-waste upon the people who live and work around electronic waste dumps.  [[Heavy metal (chemical element)|Heavy metal]]s, [[toxin]]s, and chemicals leak from these discarded products into surrounding waterways and groundwater, [[poisoning]] the local people.&lt;ref name=E-Waste&gt;Wong, M.h., S.c. Wu, W.j. Deng, X.z. Yu, Q. Luo, A.o.w. Leung, C.s.c. Wong, W.j. Luksemburg, and A.s. Wong. "Export of Toxic Chemicals – A Review of the Case of Uncontrolled Electronic-Waste Recycling." Environmental Pollution 149.2 (2007): 131–40. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; People who work in these dumps, local children searching for items to sell, and people living in the surrounding communities are all exposed to these deadly toxins.

One city suffering from the negative results of the hazardous waste trade is [[Electronic waste in China|Guiyu, China]], which has been called the electronic waste dump of the world. It may be the world's largest e-waste dump, with workers dismantling over 1.5 million pounds of junked computers, cell phones and other electronic devices per year.&lt;ref&gt;"China's Electronic Waste Village – Photo Essays." Time. Time Inc., n.d. Web. 24 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0%2C29307%2C1870162_1822153%2C00.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incinerator ash==
[[Incinerator bottom ash|Incinerator Ash]] is the [[Incineration|ash]] produced when incinerators burn waste in order to dispose of it. Incineration has many [[Incineration#pollution|polluting]] effects which include the release of various hazardous gases, [[Heavy metal (chemistry)#Heavy metal pollution|heavy metals]], and [[Sulfur dioxide#As an air pollutant|sulfur dioxide]].

===Khian Sea incident===
An example of incinerator ash being dumped onto the Global South from the Global North in an unjust trade exchange is the [[Khian Sea waste disposal incident]]. Carrying 14,000 tons of ash from an incinerator in Philadelphia, the cargo ship, Khian Sea, was to dispose of its waste.&lt;ref&gt;"Ash From Khian Sea Is On The Move Again The 14-year-old Philadelphia Waste, Dumped In Haiti 12 Years Ago, Is On Its Way To Be Disposed Of In Louisiana"&lt;/ref&gt; However, upon being rejected by The Dominican Republic, Panama, Honduras, Bermuda, Guinea Bissau, and the Dutch Antilles, the crew finally dumped a portion of the ash near Haiti.&lt;ref name=mcgraw&gt;Cunningham, William P &amp; Mary A (2004). Principles of Environmental Science. McGrw-Hill Further Education. p. Chapter 13, Further Case Studies. {{ISBN|0072919833}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After changing the name of the ship twice to try and conceal the original identity, Senegal, Morocco, Yemen, Sri Lanka, and Singapore still banned the ship’s entry.&lt;ref name=mcgraw /&gt; Upon consistent rejections, the ash is believed to have been disposed of in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Hope (2001-02-18). "A Trail of Refuse". New York Times – Magazine. Retrieved 5 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Following this disaster of handling hazardous waste, the Haitian government banned all waste imports leading a movement to recognize all of the disastrous consequences of this global waste trade. Based on the Khian Sea waste disposal incident and similar events, the [[Basel Convention]] was written to resist what is known to developing countries as ‘toxic colonialism.’&lt;ref&gt;Dalyell, Tam (July 2, 1992). "Thistle Diary: Toxic Wastes and Other Ethical Issues". New Scientist: 50.&lt;/ref&gt; It was open for signature in March 1989 and went into effect in May 1992.&lt;ref name=basel&gt;"Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal." United Nations Treaty Collection, n.d.

==Chemical waste==
[[Chemical waste]] is the excess and unusable waste from hazardous chemicals, mainly produced by large factories. It is extremely difficult and costly to dispose of. It poses many problems and health risks upon exposure, and must be carefully treated in toxic waste processing facilities.

===Italy dumping hazardous chemicals in Nigeria===
One example of chemical waste being exported from the Global North onto the Global South was the event of an Italian business man seeking to avoid European economic regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Clapp, J. "Africa, NGOs, and the International Toxic Waste Trade." The Journal of Environment &amp; Development 3.2 (1994): 17–46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly exporting 4,000 tons of toxic waste, containing 150 tons of [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s, or PCBs, the Italian businessman made $4.3 million in shipping hazardous waste to Nigeria.&lt;ref name=okaru&gt;Okaru, Valentina O. "The Basil Convention: Controlling the Movement of Hazardous Wastes to Developing Countries." Fordham Environmental Law Review 6th ser. 4.2 (2011): 138. Web. 11 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fordham Environmental Law Review published an article explaining the impacts of the toxic waste imposed on Nigeria in further detail:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mislabelling the garbage as fertilizers, the Italian company deceived a retired/illiterate timber worker into agreeing to store the poison in his backyard at the Nigerian river port of [[Koko, Nigeria|Koko]] for as little as 100 dollars a month. These toxic chemicals were exposed to the hot sun and to children playing nearby. They leaked into the Koko water system resulting in the death of nineteen villagers who ate contaminated rice from a nearby farm."&lt;ref name=okaru /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This is just one example of how the traditional trade flow, from developed Western countries has severely, unfairly, and disproportionately impacted developing countries in the Global South.

===Shipbreaking in Asia===
[[File:Jafrabad Chittagong shipbreaking (8).JPG|thumb|Shipbreaking in [[Chittagong]], Bangladesh]]
Another danger to developing countries is the growing issue of [[Ship breaking|shipbreaking]], which is occurring mainly in Asia. Industrialized countries seeking to retire used vessels find it cheaper to send these ships to Asia for dismantling. [[China]] and [[Bangladesh]] are seen as the two hubs of shipbreaking in Asia. One of the main issues lies in the fact that these ships which are now too aged to continue, were constructed at a time with less environmental regulation. In an environmental fact sheet, researchers demonstrate the immense impact this new toxic trade sector has on workers and the environment. For one, the older ships contain health-damaging substances such as [[asbestos]], [[lead oxide]], [[zinc chromate]]s, [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]], and [[tributyltin]].&lt;ref name=jones&gt;Jones, Samantha L. "A Toxic Trade: Ship Breaking in China." A China Environmental Health Project Fact Sheet (2007): n. 2. Web. &lt;http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/shipbreaking_feb1.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, shipbreaking workers in China and in other developing countries traditionally lack proper equipment or protective gear when handling these toxic substances.&lt;ref name=jones /&gt;

==Impacts of the global waste trade==
The global waste trade has had negative effects for many people, particularly in poorer, developing nations. These countries often do not have safe recycling processes or facilities, and people process the toxic waste with their bare hands.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Elizabeth. "Where Computers Go to Die — and Kill." Salon. N.p., 10 Apr. 2006. Web. &lt;http://www.salon.com/2006/04/10/ewaste&lt;/ref&gt; Hazardous wastes are often not properly disposed of or treated, leading to poisoning of the surrounding environment and resulting in illness and death in people and animals.&lt;ref name=Frazzoli&gt;Frazzoli, Chiara, Orish Ebere Orisakwe, Roberto Dragone, and Alberto Mantovani. "Diagnostic Health Risk Assessment of Electronic Waste on the General Population in Developing Countries' Scenarios." Environmental Impact Assessment Review 30 (2010): 388–99. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people have experienced illnesses or death due to the unsafe way these hazardous wastes are handled.

===Effects upon the environment===
The hazardous waste trade has disastrous effects upon the environment and natural ecosystems. Various studies explore how the concentrations of persistent organic pollutants have poisoned the areas surrounding the dump sites, killing numerous birds, fish, and other wildlife.&lt;ref name=Frazzoli /&gt; There are heavy metal chemical concentrations in the air, water, soil, and sediment in and around these toxic dump areas, and the concentration levels of heavy metals in these areas are extremely high and toxic.&lt;ref name=Frazzoli /&gt;

===Implications for human health===
The hazardous waste trade has serious damaging effects upon the health of humans. People living in developing countries may be more vulnerable to the dangerous effects of the hazardous waste trade, and are particularly at risk from developing health problems.&lt;ref name=Frazzoli /&gt; The methods of disposal of these toxic wastes in developing countries expose the general population (including future generations) to the highly toxic chemicals. These toxic wastes are often disposed of in open landfills, burned in incinerators, or in other dangerous processes. Workers wear little to no protective gear when processing these toxic chemicals, and are exposed to these toxins through direct contact, inhalation, contact with soil and dust, as well as oral intake of contaminated locally produced food and drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Elizabeth. "Where Computers Go to Die — and Kill." Salon. N.p., 10 Apr. 2006. Web. &lt;http://www.salon.com/2006/04/10/ewaste/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Health problems resulting from these hazardous wastes affect humans by causing cancers, diabetes, alterations in neurochemical balances, hormone disruptions from [[endocrine disruptor]]s, skin alterations, [[neurotoxicity]], kidney damage, [[liver damage]], [[bone disease]], [[emphysema]], [[ovotoxicity]], [[reproductive damage]], and many other fatal diseases.&lt;ref name=Frazzoli /&gt; The improper disposal of these hazardous wastes creates fatal health problems, and is a serious public health risk.

==International responses to global waste trade issues==
There have been various international responses to the problems associated with the global waste trade and multiple attempts to regulate it for over thirty years. The hazardous waste trade has proven difficult to regulate as there is so much waste being traded, and laws are often difficult to enforce. Furthermore, there are often large loopholes in these international agreements that allow countries and corporations to dump hazardous wastes in dangerous ways. The most notable attempt to regulate the hazardous waste trade has been the [[Basel Convention]].&lt;ref name=Basel&gt;Abrams, David J. "Regulating the International Hazardous Waste Trade: A Proposed Global Solution." Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 28 (1990): 801–46. Hein Online. Web. 24 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International treaties and relevant trade law===

====Basel Convention====
The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, usually known as the '''[[Basel Convention]]''', is an international treaty that plays a crucial role in regulating the transnational movement of hazardous wastes. The Basel Convention was created in 1989 and attempts to regulate the hazardous waste trade, specifically to prevent the dumping of hazardous waste from more developed countries into less developed countries.&lt;ref name=Basel /&gt; The Basel Convention was developed following a series of high-profile cases in which large amounts of toxic waste were dumped into less developed countries, poisoning the people and environment.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, Jonathan. "The Basel Convention and the International Trade in Hazardous Wastes." YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION ON ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT (2001/2002): 43–51. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention seeks to reduce the creation of hazardous wastes, and to control and reduce its trade across borders.

The Convention was opened for signatures on 22 March 1989, and officially entered into force on 5 May 1992.&lt;ref name=Basel /&gt; As of May 2014, 180 states and the European Union are parties to the Convention.&lt;ref name=Basel2&gt;"Parties to the Basel Convention." The Basel Convention. N.p., n.d. Web. 2 May 2014. &lt;http://www.basel.int/Countries/StatusofRatifications/PartiesSignatories/tabid/1290/Default.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Haiti and the United States have signed the Convention but not ratified it.&lt;ref name=Basel2 /&gt;

====ENFORCE====
The [[Environmental Network for Optimizing Regulatory Compliance on Illegal Traffic]] (ENFORCE) is an agency staffed by relevant experts to promote compliance with the Basel Convention.&lt;ref name=ENFORCE&gt;ENFORCE. Terms of Reference for Cooperative Arrangements on Preventing and Combating Illegal Traffic: The Environmental Network for Optimizing Regulatory Compliance on Illegal Traffic (ENFORCE). By UNEP. Bangkok, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an international body created to deal with transboundary issues of the international hazardous waste trade. Because the issue of the transnational hazardous waste trade crosses many borders and affects many nations, it has been important to have a multinational, multilateral organization presiding over these affairs. The members of ENFORCE include one representative from each of the five United Nations regions that are parties to the Convention as well as five representatives from the Basel Convention regional and coordinating centers, based on equitable geographical representation.&lt;ref name=ENFORCE /&gt; Members of organizations such as the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), NGOs working to prevent and stop illegal traffic such as the Basel Action Network (BAN), and many other organizations are also eligible to become members of ENFORCE.&lt;ref&gt;ENFORCE. Report of the First Meeting of the Environmental Network for Optimizing Regulatory Compliance on Illegal Traffic (ENFORCE). Bangkok, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protocol on Liability and Compensation====

In 1999 the Basel Convention passed the Protocol on Liability and Compensation that sought to improve regulatory measures and better protect people from hazardous waste. The Protocol on Liability and Compensation attempts to “assign appropriate liability procedures when the transboundary movements of hazardous wastes result in damages to human health and the environment”.&lt;ref name=Pratt&gt;Pratt, Laura A. "Decreasing Dirty Dumping? A Reevaluation of Toxic Waste Colonialism and the Global Management of Transboundary Hazardous Waste." William &amp; Mary Environmental Law and Policy Review 35.2 (2011): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The Protocol “imposes strict liability for damages in situations involving Parties to the Basel Convention, but only while they maintain control of the hazardous waste through their respective notifying, transporting, or disposing entities.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; It seeks to regulate and ensure countries’ and corporations’ compliance with the Basel Convention laws. However, this Protocol remains unsigned by most countries, so its applicability is limited.&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt;

====Lomé IV Convention and Cotonou Agreement====

In an effort to protect themselves against unfair hazardous waste dumping, the African, Caribbean, and Pacific States (ACP) signed the Lome IV Convention, which is a supplement to the Basel Convention and prohibits the “export of hazardous wastes from the European Community to ACP States.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; This Convention is one attempt by developing countries to protect themselves from Western countries exporting their waste to poorer nations through the hazardous waste trade. When the Lomé IV Convention expired in 2000, the ACP countries and the European countries entered into a new agreement known as the Cotonou Agreement, which “recognizes the existence of disproportionate risks in developing countries and desires to protect against inappropriate hazardous waste shipments to these countries.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt;

====The Bamako Convention====

In 1991 multiple developing nations in Africa met to discuss their dissatisfaction with the Basel Convention in regulating the dumping of hazardous waste into their countries, and designed a ban on the import of hazardous wastes into their countries called the [[Bamako Convention]]. The Bamako Convention is different from the Basel Convention in that Bamako “essentially bans the import of all hazardous waste generated outside of the OAU [the Organization of African Unity] for disposal or recycling and deems any import from a non-Party to be an illegal act.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; However, these countries could not effectively implement the stipulations of the Convention and could not prevent the dump of toxic wastes due to limited resources and a lack of powerful enforcement. Therefore, the application of the Bamako Convention was very limited.

===Critiques of these responses===
[[Laura Pratt]], expert on the hazardous waste trade, claims that despite local and international attempts to regulate the hazardous waste trade, the “current international agreements, both the widespread, legally binding agreements and the ad hoc agendas among smaller groups of countries, have not been as successful at eliminating toxic waste colonialism as proponents would have hoped.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; She explains that there are various loopholes in the current system that allow toxic waste to continue being dumped, and toxic colonialism to go unchecked. Some of the problems with these international agreements include continued illegal shipments and unclear definitions of terms.

====Fraudulent shipments and concealments====
Pratt explains that despite attempts to regulate illegal dumping, “[o]ftentimes hazardous waste is simply moved under false permits, bribes, improper labels, or even the pretext of 'recycling,' which is a growing trend.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; Companies often export their hazardous wastes to poorer countries through illegal smuggling.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, Elisabeth. "Smuggling Europe’s Waste to Poorer Countries." The New York Times. N.p., 26 Sept. 2009. Web. &lt;http://www.mrwmd.org/archives/2009%20Board%20Meeting/October/MRWMDSep09_6a_Smuggling_Europe.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to regulate this market have been hindered by a lack of ability to monitor the trade, as many countries do not have any authoritative legislative bodies in place to prevent or punish the illegal trafficking of hazardous wastes.&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; Furthermore, Pratt explains that without coordinated international methods to enforce the regulations, it is extremely difficult for countries to "control the illegal trade of hazardous waste, due to the disparity between enforcement resources and regulation uniformity.” &lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; Developing nations still bear the brunt of this illegal activity the most, and often do not have the resources or capability to protect themselves.

====Issues with legal definitions====
Another issue with the Basel Convention and other international agreements to regulate the waste trade is the difficulty of establishing clear, uniform definitions regarding wastes. These overly broad and ambiguous definitions cause problems with the international agreements, as different parties interpret the language of the agreements differently and thus act accordingly. For example, the “‘lack of distinction between ‘waste’ and ‘products’ in the convention and its vague criteria for ‘hazardous’ allowed the continued export of 'hazardous waste’ under the label of commodities or raw materials, despite the fact that these wastes still present environmental and health risks to developing countries.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt;

[[File:Great Blue Hill in Milton.jpg|thumb|right|Great Blue Hill ]]
On April 1, 1980, [[WNAC-TV (defunct)|WNAC-TV]] aired a fake news bulletin that stated that [[Great Blue Hill]] was erupting. Intended as an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke, the prank resulted in panic in [[Milton, Massachusetts]] and the surrounding area.

==News report==

WNAC-TV ended its 6 pm news broadcast with a bulletin reporting that Great Blue Hill in Milton had erupted and was spraying lava and ash onto nearby homes. The report showed footage of lava flowing down a hillside (taken from the March 27 eruption of [[Mount St. Helens]]) and edited remarks from President [[Jimmy Carter]] (who expressed concern) and Governor [[Edward J. King]] (who called the situation "serious"). According to reporter Jan Harrison, the disaster had been caused by a geological chain reaction set off by the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|eruption of Mount St. Helens a week earlier]].

The '''Green Scare''' is legal action by the [[US government]] against the radical [[environmental movement]]. It alludes to the [[Red Scare]]s, periods of fear over [[communist]] infiltration of US society.

The term was popularized by [[environmental activist]]s. It is first known to have appeared in 2002 in the wake of the February 12 congressional hearings titled "The Threat of Eco-Terrorism", which discussed groups including the [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) and the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress02/jarboe021202.htm Federal Bureau of Investigation - Congressional Testimony&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021002120937/http://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress02/jarboe021202.htm |date=2002-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spring edition of the prisoner support [[zine]] ''Spirit of Freedom'' defined the term as "the tactics that the US government and all their tentacles ([[FBI]], [[IRS]], [[BATF]], [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]]s, local police, the court system) are using to attack the ELF/ALF and specifically those who publicly support them."

The term has been used by activists to describe a sweep of arrests, convictions and [[grand jury]] indictments of ELF and ALF operatives on charges relating to acts of [[property damage]], [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], [[arson]] and use of [[destructive device]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan06/elf012006.htm Federal Bureau of Investigation - Press Room - Headline Archives - Eco-Terror Indictments&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817222138/http://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan06/elf012006.htm |date=2010-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cases ==
Since 2000, the [[US government]] has prosecuted over 20 cases involving [[environmentalist]]s, which ''[[Los Angeles CityBeat]]'' claims "redefined not only free speech, but also redefined environmentally motivated property destruction - like torching [[Hummer]]s or tree-felling equipment." &lt;ref name="CityBeat"&gt;[[Dean Kuipers]], [http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5450&amp;IssueNum=204 The Green Scare] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324070221/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5450&amp;IssueNum=204 |date=2008-03-24 }}, ''[[Los Angeles CityBeat]]'', 3 May 2007,&lt;/ref&gt; These arrests, indictments and trials, which have collectively been termed the ''Green Scare'' by [[environmentalist]]s, include:

=== Individuals ===

[[Rod Coronado]], a prominent [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[eco-anarchist]], who was arrested on a felony charge of demonstrating the use of a destructive device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sandiego.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel06/sd022206.htm Federal Bureau of Investigation - San Diego Field Division - Department of Justice Press Release - February 22, 2006], San Diego [[FBI]].&lt;/ref&gt; His indictment indirectly related to an August 1, 2003 fire in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] that destroyed an apartment complex causing an estimated $50 million worth of damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20060223-9999-1m23rod.html|title=SignOnSanDiego.com &gt; News &gt; Metro - Feds arrest environment radical over S.D. speech&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coronado, a self-described "unofficial ELF spokesman",&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10370129"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;ObjectID=10370129 |title=Paul Watson: Assault on the foundations of freedom |author=Watson, Paul |authorlink=Paul Watson |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |date=February 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; stood trial in 2007.

[[Jeff Luers|Jeff "Free" Luers]], a [[veganarchist]] from [[Los Angeles, California]], who served a prison sentence of almost ten years for [[arson]].  His initial sentence was over 22 years, but the [[Oregon Court of Appeals]] overturned it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/A115208.htm|title=Appeal from Circuit Court, Lane County|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115145745/http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/A115208.htm|archivedate=15 January 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Lane County Circuit Court determined a new sentence of 10 years in February 2008,&lt;ref name=RGresentence&gt;{{cite news

Luers declared that he was looking forward to "promoting activism through legal means."&lt;ref name=RGresentence/&gt;

Christopher McIntosh, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for setting fire to a Seattle [[McDonald's]] restaurant in January, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/242381_fire27.html | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Paul | last1=Shukovsky | title=Animal activist pleads guilty in McDonald's fire | date=September 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; McIntosh admitted guilt as part of a [[plea agreement]], in which the prosecution said they would not ask that he spend more than ten years in prison.&lt;ref name="McIntosh"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002688656_mcdonalds17m.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=8-Year Sentence For 2003 Arson At Eatery | first=Peter | last=Lewis | date=December 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters criticized the sentence as excessive "for someone who caused $5,000 damage". Prosecutors argued it was important to "protect the public" from some one who expressed no remorse, saying McIntosh was "proud of his crime, and, given the chance, he would do the same thing again."&lt;ref name="McIntosh"/&gt;
[[Peter Daniel Young]] and a friend, Justin Samuel, who were indicted in by a federal grand jury in September 1998 on four charges of "Extortion by Interfering with Interstate Commerce", and two charges of "Animal Enterprise Terrorism".&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, Todd. Associated Press, October 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; They released over 8,000 animals from various fur farms in [[Iowa]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Wisconsin]] and disposed of the breeding records at each farm. Samuel was arrested on September 4, 1999 in Belgium and was extradited to the [[United States]] to face trial. He agreed to cooperate with the government in exchange for a reduced sentence of two years. Young was arrested in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]] on March 21, 2005 on charges of [[shoplifting]] from a local [[Starbucks]] and was extradited to Wisconsin to face trial for the fur farm raids. He was sentenced to two years in federal prison; 360 hours of community service at a charity; $254,000 restitution; and one year probation.

[[Eric McDavid]], Lauren Weiner and Zachary Jenson, who were arrested in [[Auburn, California]], and charged with conspiring to damage telephone towers, the [[Nimbus Dam]], and [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] facilities "by explosive or fire".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auburnjournal.com/articles/2006/01/18/news/top_stories/03elf.txt Auburn Journal : Top Stories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707184850/http://www.auburnjournal.com/articles/2006/01/18/news/top_stories/03elf.txt |date=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors allege the FBI recorded one of the suspects suggesting anti-personnel [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] be added to the planned bombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=608 Eco-Radicalism], [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FBI affidavit, evidence against the three came from a paid "confidential source (CS) who is deeply embedded within the subjects' cell.

&lt;/ref&gt; Originally seven individuals were charged, leading sympathizers to describe the defendants as the ''SHAC 7'', but the case against one of the defendants was dropped. [[Pamelyn Ferdin]], the current president of [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty|SHAC USA]], told the jury that "for the government to say you can't say this and you can't say that is going down a very scary path of going toward [[fascism]]." However, the US Attorney's Office described the convicts as "thugs who went far beyond protected speech and lawful protest to engage in and incite intimidation, harassment and violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=6534|title=Americanchronicle.com|website=www.americanchronicle.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge sentenced the individuals to an aggregate of 24 years in prison, and ordered to pay a joint [[restitution]] of $1,000,001.00.

[[Operation Backfire (FBI)|Operation Backfire]], a multi-agency criminal investigation into destructive acts in the name of animal rights and environmental causes in the United States, that resulted in the December 7, 2005 arrest of seven people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002672354_webecoterrorism08.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=Six people arrested for Northwest ecoterrorism attacks | date=December 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least six people were subpoenaed to testify before grand juries. Three of the individuals subpoenaed ended up on a January 20, 2006, 65 count, 84-page-long indictment. The new indictment charged 11 people with conspiring to commit 18 acts of arson and vandalism over a 5-year period across multiple states. Some of the charges relate to a 1998 arson attack on the Vail Ski Resort in [[Colorado]] and the sabotage of a power line near [[Bend, Oregon]], in 1999. The [[FBI]] considers these crimes to be acts of [[domestic terrorism]] and the ELF to be the nation's top domestic terror threat.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prfamerica.org/EarthLiberationFrontNo1onFBIList.html|title=Earth Liberation Front is now FBI's No. 1 Domestic Terrorist Threat|website=prfamerica.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' reports that the Operation Backfire indictments have elicited concern, from activists, that authorities have "cracked the super-secrecy of ALF and ELF".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0130/p20s01-sten.html|title=Backstory: Eco-vigilantes: All in 'The Family?'|first=Brad|last=Knickerbocker|date=30 January 2006|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alternative media]] organizations have condemned the arrests, some calling them a "[[witch-hunt]]", "aimed at disrupting and discrediting political movements". [[Activist]]s, maintaining the ''Red Scare'' [[allusion]], claim the operations are "[[fishing expedition]][s]" carried out "in the midst of [[9/11]] [[McCarthyism]]. The FBI disputes these claims, with former Director [[Robert Mueller]] claiming the agency takes action "only when volatile talk crosses the line into violence and criminal activity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/speeches/mueller012006.htm Federal Bureau of Investigation - Major Executive Speeches - January 20, 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409123308/http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/speeches/mueller012006.htm |date=April 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hedonic treadmill''', also known as '''hedonic adaptation''', is the observed tendency of [[human]]s to quickly return to a relatively stable level of [[happiness]] despite major positive or negative events or life changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|last=  Rosenbloom| first=  Stephanie| url=  https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/business/08consume.html?pagewanted=all
|title=  But Will It Make You Happy?|newspaper=  [[The New York Times]]| date=  August 7, 2010| accessdate= August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to this theory, as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness. Brickman and Campbell coined the term in their essay "Hedonic Relativism and Planning the Good Society" (1971).&lt;ref name="Brickman1971"/&gt; During the late 1990s, the concept was modified by [[Michael Eysenck]], a British psychologist, to become the current "hedonic treadmill theory" which compares the [[pursuit of happiness]] to a person on a [[treadmill]], who has to keep walking just to stay in the same place.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The concept dates back centuries, to such writers as [[St. Augustine]], cited in [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s 1621 ''[[Anatomy of Melancholy]]'': "A true saying it is, ''Desire hath no rest'', is infinite in itself, endless, and as one calls it, a perpetual rack, or horse-mill."{{synthesis inline|date=May 2016}}

The '''hedonic''' (or '''happiness''') '''set point''' has gained interest throughout the field of [[positive psychology]] where it has been developed and revised further.&lt;ref name="Lykken1996"/&gt; Given that hedonic adaptation generally demonstrates that a person's long-term happiness is not significantly affected by otherwise impacting events, positive psychology has concerned itself with the discovery of things that can lead to lasting changes in happiness levels.
{{Hedonism}}

==Overview==
Hedonic adaptation is a process or mechanism that reduces the affective impact of emotional events. Generally, hedonic adaptation involves a happiness "set point", whereby humans generally maintain a constant level of happiness throughout their lives, despite events that occur in their environment.&lt;ref name="Brickman1971"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brickman |last2=Campbell|title=Hedonic relativism and planning the good society|date=1971|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|pages=287–302}} in M.&amp;nbsp;H. Apley, ed., ''Adaptation Level Theory: A Symposium,'' New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhn2011"/&gt; The process of hedonic adaptation is often conceptualized as a treadmill, since one must continually work to maintain a certain level of happiness. Others conceptualize hedonic adaptation as functioning similarly to a thermostat (a [[negative feedback]] system) that works to maintain an individual's happiness set point. One of the main concerns of positive psychology is determining how to maintain or raise one's happiness set point, and further, what kind of practices lead to lasting happiness.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Hedonic adaptation can occur in a variety of ways. Generally, the process involves cognitive changes, such as shifting values, goals, attention and interpretation of a situation.&lt;ref name="Frederick1999"/&gt; Further, neurochemical processes desensitize overstimulated hedonic pathways in the brain, which possibly prevents persistently high levels of intense positive or negative feelings.&lt;ref name="Solomon1974"/&gt; The process of adaptation can also occur through the tendency of humans to construct elaborate rationales for considering themselves deprived through a process social theorist [[Gregg Easterbrook]] calls "abundance denial".&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook, Gregg.  ''The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse'' (Random House, 2003). {{ISBN|0812973038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major theoretical approaches==

===Behavioral/psychological approach===
The "Hedonic Treadmill" is a term coined by Brickman and Campbell in their article "Hedonic Relativism and Planning the Good Society" (1971), describing the tendency of people to keep a fairly stable baseline level of happiness despite external events and fluctuations in demographic circumstances.&lt;ref name="Brickman1971"/&gt; The idea of relative happiness had been around for decades when in 1978 Brickman et al. began to approach hedonic pleasure within the framework of Helson's adaptation level theory, which holds that perception of stimulation is dependent upon comparison of former stimulations.&lt;ref name="Brickman1978"/&gt; The hedonic treadmill functions similarly to most [[adaptation]]s that serve to protect and enhance perception. In the case of hedonics, the sensitization or desensitization to circumstances or environment can redirect motivation. This reorientation functions to protect against complacency, but also to accept unchangeable circumstances, and redirect efforts towards more effective goals. Frederick and Lowenstein classify three types of processes in hedonic adaptation: shifting adaptation levels, [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]], and [[sensitization]]. Shifting adaptation levels occurs when a person experiences a shift in what is perceived as a "neutral" stimulus, but maintains sensitivity to stimulus differences. For example, if Sam gets a raise he will initially be happier, and then habituate to the larger salary and return to his happiness set point. But he will still be pleased when he gets a holiday bonus. Desensitization decreases sensitivity in general, which reduces sensitivity to change.  Those who have lived in war zones for extended periods of time may become desensitized to the destruction that happens on a daily basis, and be less affected by the occurrence of serious injuries or losses that may once have been shocking and upsetting. Sensitization is an increase of hedonic response from continuous exposure, such as the increased pleasure and selectivity of connoisseurs for wine, or food.&lt;ref name="Frederick1999"/&gt;

Brickman, Coates, and Janoff-Bulman were among the first to investigate the hedonic treadmill in their 1978 study, "Lottery Winners and Accident Victims: Is Happiness Relative?". Lottery winners and paraplegics were compared to a control group and as predicted, comparison (with past experiences and current communities) and [[habituation]] (to new circumstances) affected levels of happiness such that after the initial impact of the extremely positive or negative events, happiness levels typically went back to the average levels.&lt;ref name="Brickman1978"/&gt; This interview-based study, while not longitudinal, was the beginning of a now large body of work exploring the relativity of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Best Walking Machine aka Treadmills on Amazon

Brickman and Campbell originally implied that everyone returns to the same neutral set point after a significantly emotional life event.&lt;ref name="Brickman1971"/&gt; In the literature review, "Beyond the Hedonic Treadmill, Revising the Adaptation Theory of Well-Being" (2006), Diener, Lucas, and Scollon concluded that people are not hedonically neutral, and that individuals have different set points which are at least partially heritable. They also concluded that individuals may have more than one happiness set point, such as a [[life satisfaction]] set point and a [[Subjective well-being|subjective well being]] set point, and that because of this, one's level of happiness is not just one given set point but can vary within a given range. Diener and colleagues point to longitudinal and cross-sectional research to argue that happiness set point can change, and lastly that individuals vary in the rate and extent of adaptation they exhibit to change in circumstance.&lt;ref name="Diener2006"/&gt;

In a longitudinal study conducted by Mancini, Bonnano, and Clark, people showed individual differences in how they responded to significant life events, such as marriage, divorce and widowhood. They recognized that some individuals do experience substantial changes to their hedonic set point over time, though most others do not, and argue that happiness set point can be relatively stable throughout the course of an individual's life, but the life satisfaction and subjective well being set points are more variable.&lt;ref name="Mancini2011"/&gt;

Similarly, the longitudinal study conducted by Fujita and Diener (2005) described the life satisfaction set point as a "soft baseline". This means that for most people, this baseline is similar to their happiness baseline. Typically, life satisfaction will hover around a set point for the majority of their lives and not change dramatically. However, for about a quarter of the population this set point is not stable, and does indeed move in response to a major life event.&lt;ref name="Fujita2005"/&gt;
Other longitudinal data has shown that subjective well being set points do change over time, and that adaptation is not necessarily inevitable. In his archival data analysis, Lucas found evidence that it is possible for someone's subjective well-being set point to change drastically, such as in the case of individuals who acquire a severe, long term disability.&lt;ref name="Lucas2003"/&gt;  However, as Diener, Lucas, and Scollon point out, the amount of fluctuation a person experiences around their set point is largely dependent on the individual's ability to adapt.&lt;ref name="Diener2006"/&gt;

After following over a thousand sets of twins for 10 years, Lykken and Tellegen (1996) concluded that almost 50% of our happiness levels are determined by genetics.&lt;ref name="Lykken1996"/&gt; Headey and Wearing (1989) suggested that our position on the spectrum of the stable [[Trait theory|personality traits]] ([[Revised NEO Personality Inventory|neuroticism, extraversion, and openness]] to experience) accounts for how we experience and perceive life events, and indirectly contributes to our happiness levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Headey|first1=Bruce|last2=Wearing|first2=Alexander J.|title=Understanding Happiness: A Theory of Subjective Well-being|date=1992|publisher=Longman Cheshire|isbn=9780582875081|url=http://www1.eur.nl/fsw/happiness/hap_bib/freetexts/headey_b_1992.pdf|language=en|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515202531/http://www1.eur.nl/fsw/happiness/hap_bib/freetexts/headey_b_1992.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on happiness has spanned decades and crossed cultures in order to test the true limits of our hedonic set point.

==Major empirical findings==
In general there is conflicting evidence on the validity of the hedonic treadmill, if people always return to a baseline level of happiness or if some events have the ability to change this baseline for good. While some researchers believe life events change people's baseline for good over the course of one's life, others believe people will always return to their baseline.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In recent large panel studies divorce, death of a spouse, unemployment, disability and similar events have been shown to change the long-term subjective well-being, even though some adaptation does occur and inborn factors affect this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00479.x|title=Adaptation and the Set-Point Model of Subjective Well-Being. Does Happiness Change After Major Life Events?|author1=Richard E. Lucas|volume=16|issue=2|pages=75-79|date=April 1, 2007|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00479.x|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aforementioned Brickman study (1978), researchers interviewed 22 lottery winners and 29 [[paraplegia|paraplegics]] to determine their change in happiness levels due to their given event (winning lottery or becoming paralyzed). The event in the case of lottery winners had taken place between one month and one and a half years before the study, and in the case of paraplegics between a month and a year. The group of lottery winners reported being similarly happy before and after the event, and expected to have a similar level of happiness in a couple of years. These findings show that having a large monetary gain had no effect on their baseline level of happiness, for both present and expected happiness in the future. They found that the paraplegics reported having a higher level of happiness in the past than the rest (due to a nostalgia effect), a lower level of happiness at the time of the study than the rest (although still above the middle point of the scale, that is, they reported being more happy than unhappy) and, surprisingly, they also expected to have similar levels of happiness than the rest in a couple of years. One must note that the paraplegics did have an initial decrease in life happiness, but the key to their findings is that they expected to eventually return to their baseline in time.&lt;ref name="Brickman1978"/&gt;

In a newer study (2007), winning a medium-sized lottery prize had a lasting mental wellbeing effect of 1.4 GHQ points on Britons even two years after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629606000853|title=Money and mental wellbeing: A longitudinal study of medium-sized lottery wins|author1=Jonathan Gardner|author2=Andrew J.Oswald|journal=Journal of Health Economics|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 2007|pages=49-60|doi=10.1016/j.jhealeco.2006.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some research suggests that hedonic setpoints can potentially be raised with new compounds like [[NSI-189]].&lt;ref&gt;http://investor.neuralstem.com/2013-04-22-FDA-Approves-Neuralstem-To-Treat-Final-Cohort-In-NSI-189-Phase-Ib-Trial-In-Major-Depressive-Disorder{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could potentially have critical implications for the treatment of dysthymia and depression. Other research suggests that resilience to suffering is partly due to a decreased fear response in the amygdala and increased levels of BDNF in the brain. New genetic research have found that changing a gene could increase intelligence and resilience to depressing and traumatizing events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futuretimeline.net/blog/2015/08/17-2.htm#.VuviaVnD9qU Cites: {{cite journal|last1=McGirr|first1=Alexander|last2=Lipina|first2=Tatiana V|last3=Mun|first3=Ho-Suk|last4=Georgiou|first4=John|last5=Al-Amri|first5=Ahmed H|last6=Ng|first6=Enoch|last7=Zhai|first7=Dongxu|last8=Elliott|first8=Christina|last9=Cameron|first9=Ryan T|last10=Mullins|first10=Jonathan GL|last11=Liu|first11=Fang|last12=Baillie|first12=George S|last13=Clapcote|first13=Steven J|last14=Roder|first14=John C|title=Specific Inhibition of Phosphodiesterase-4B Results in Anxiolysis and Facilitates Memory Acquisition|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=2015|volume=41|issue=4|pages=1080–1092|doi=10.1038/npp.2015.240|pmid=26272049|pmc=4748432}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could have crucial benefits for those suffering from anxiety and [[PTSD]]. 
 
Recent research reveals certain types of brain training can increase brain size. The hippocampus volume can affect mood, hedonic setpoints, some forms of memory. A smaller hippocampus has been linked to depression and dysthymia.&lt;ref&gt;http://psychcentral.com/news/2015/07/06/recurrent-depression-linked-to-smaller-hippocampus/86512.html&lt;/ref&gt; Certain activities and environmental factors can reset the hedonic setpoint and also grow the hippocampus to an extent. London taxi drivers' hippocampi grow on the job, and the drivers have a better memory than those who didn't become taxi drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/677048.stm|date = 14 March 2000|work = BBC NEWS |title = Taxi drivers' brains 'grow' on the job}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the posterior hippocampus seemed to be the most important for enhanced mood and memory.

Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, and Diener (2003) researched changes in baseline level of [[well-being]] due to marital status, birth of first child, and layoff. While they found that a negative life event can have a greater impact on a person's psychological state and happiness set point than a positive event, they concluded that people completely adapt, finally returning to their baseline level of well-being, after divorce, losing a spouse, the birth of a child, and for women losing their job. They did not find a return to baseline for marriage or for layoffs in men. This study also illustrated that the amount of adaptation depends on the individual.&lt;ref name="Lucas2003"/&gt;

Wildeman, Turney, and Schnittker (2014) studied the effects of [[imprisonment]] on one's baseline level of well-being. They researched how being in jail affects one's level of happiness both short term (while in prison) and long term (after being released). They found that being in prison has negative effects on one's baseline well-being; in other words one's baseline of happiness is lower in prison than when not in prison. Once people were released from prison, they were able to bounce back to their previous level of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Wildeman, Kristin Turney, and Jason Schnittker, [http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol104/iss1/4 "The Hedonic Consequences of Punishment Revisited"], 103 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver (1982) researched the effects of a traumatic accident on one's baseline level of happiness. Silver found that accident victims were able to return to a happiness set point after a period of time. For eight weeks, Silver followed accident victims who had sustained severe [[spinal cord injuries]]. About a week after their accident, Silver observed that the victims were experiencing much stronger negative emotions than positive ones. By the eighth and final week, the victims' positive emotions outweighed their negative ones. The results of this study suggest that regardless of whether the life event is significantly negative or positive, people will almost always return to their happiness baseline.&lt;ref&gt;Silver (1982).

Fujita and Diener (2005) studied the stability of one's level of subjective well-being over time and found that for most people, there is a relatively small range in which their level of satisfaction varies. They asked a panel of 3,608 German residents to rate their current and overall satisfaction with life on a scale of 0-10, once a year for seventeen years. Only 25% of participants exhibited shifts in their level of life satisfaction over the course of the study, with just 9% of participants having experienced significant changes. They also found that those with a higher mean level of life satisfaction had more stable levels of life satisfaction than those with lower levels of satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Fujita2005"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Happiness set point===
The concept of the happiness set point (proposed by [[Sonja Lyubomirsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/fashion/happiness-inc.html | title = Happiness Inc.|work = The New York Times|date= 19 April 2013|last = Weil|first = Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can be applied in clinical psychology to help patients return to their hedonic set point when negative events happen. Determining when someone is mentally distant from their happiness set point and what events trigger those changes can be extremely helpful in treating conditions such as depression. When a change occurs, clinical psychologists work with patients to recover from the depressive spell and return to their hedonic set point more quickly. Because acts of kindness often promote long-term well-being, one treatment method is to provide patients with different altruistic activities that can help a person raise his or her hedonic set point.&lt;ref name="Sheldon2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elias|first1=Marilyn|title=Psychologists now know what makes people happy|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2002-12-08-happy-main_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=December 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can in turn be helpful in reducing reckless habits in the pursuit of well-being.&lt;ref name=Mathews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vacounseling.com/hedonic-treadmill/ |title=The Hedonic Treadmill: From Overconsumption to Minimalism |last=Mathews |first=John |publisher=Virginia Counseling |date=2015 |website=Virginia Counseling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, helping patients understand that long-term happiness is relatively stable throughout one's life can help to ease anxiety surrounding impactful events.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Resilience research===
Hedonic adaptation is also relevant to resilience research. Resilience is a "class of phenomena characterized by patterns of positive adaptation in the context of significant adversity or risk," meaning that resilience is largely the ability for one to remain at their hedonic setpoint while going through negative experiences. Psychologists have identified various factors that contribute to a person being resilient, such as positive attachment relationships (see [[Attachment Theory]]), positive self-perceptions, self-regulatory skills (see [[Emotional self-regulation]]), ties to prosocial organizations (see [[prosocial behavior]]), and a positive outlook on life.&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A. S., Cutuli, J. J., Herbers, J. E., &amp; Reed, M.-G. J. (2009). Resilience in development. In C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology, 2nd ed. (pp. 117–131). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These factors can contribute to maintaining a happiness set point even in the face of adversity or negative events.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Critical views==
One critical point made regarding our individual set point is to understand it may simply be a genetic tendency and not a completely determined criterion for happiness, and it can still be influenced.&lt;ref name="Lykken1996"/&gt; In a study on moderate to excessive drug intake on rats, Ahmed and Koob (1998), sought to demonstrate that the use of [[mind-altering drugs]] such as [[cocaine]] could change an individual's hedonic set point. Their findings suggest that drug usage and addiction lead to neurochemical adaptations whereby a person needs more of that substance to feel the same levels of pleasure. Thus, drug abuse can have lasting impacts on one's hedonic set point, both in terms of overall happiness and with regard to pleasure felt from drug usage.&lt;ref name="Ahmed1998"/&gt;

Genetic roots of the hedonic set point are also disputed. Sosis (2014) has argued the "hedonic treadmill" interpretation of twin studies depends on dubious assumptions. Pairs of identical twins raised apart aren't necessarily raised in substantially different environments. The similarities between twins (such as intelligence or beauty) may invoke similar reactions from the environment. Thus, we might see a notable similarity in happiness levels between twins even though there aren't happiness genes governing affect levels.&lt;ref name="Sosis2014"/&gt;

Further, hedonic adaptation may be a more common phenomenon when dealing with positive events as opposed to negative ones. [[Negativity bias]], where people tend to focus more on negative emotions than positive emotions, can be an obstacle in raising one's happiness set point. Negative emotions often require more attention and are generally remembered better, overshadowing any positive experiences that may even outnumber negative experiences.&lt;ref name="Lykken1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister2001"/&gt; Given that negative events hold more psychological power than positive ones, it may be difficult to create lasting positive change.

Headey (2008) concluded that an internal [[locus of control]] and having "positive" personality traits (notably low [[neuroticism]]) are the two most significant factors affecting one's subjective well-being. Headey also found that adopting "non-zero sum" goals, those which enrich one's relationships with others and with society as a whole (i.e. family-oriented and altruistic goals), increase the level of subjective well-being. Conversely, attaching importance to zero-sum life goals (career success, wealth, and social status) will have a small but nevertheless statistically significant negative impact on people's overall subjective well-being (even though the size of a household's [[disposable income]] does have a small, positive impact on subjective well-being). Duration of one's education seems to have no direct bearing on life satisfaction. And, contradicting set point theory, Headey found no return to homeostasis after sustaining a disability or developing a chronic illness. These disabling events are permanent, and thus according to [[cognitive model]] of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], may contribute to depressive thoughts and increase neuroticism (another factor found by Headey to diminish subjective well-being). Disability appears to be the single most important factor affecting human subjective well-being. The impact of disability on subjective well-being is almost twice as large as that of the second strongest factor affecting life satisfaction—the personality trait of [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name="Headey2008"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14021">[[File:Panel9SBCTajin.JPG|thumb|350x350px|Human sacrifice shown on a panel at one of the [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] at [[El Tajín]], Veracruz, in Mexico.]]
Most of the ancient civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]] such as the [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Mixtec civilization|Mixtec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] and [[Aztec]] cultures practised some kind of taking of [[Human trophy collecting|human trophies]] during warfare. Captives taken during war would often be taken to their captors' city-states where they would be ritually tortured and sacrificed. These practices are documented by a rich material of iconographic and archaeological evidence from across Mesoamerica.

==In ancient Maya culture==
Evidence of the [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|ritualistic sacrifice]] and taking human body parts as trophies in [[Maya civilization]] exists from as far back as the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Formative]] period (800 – 500 BC). The evidence consists of skeletal remains and depictions in Maya [[iconography]], commonly showing acts of human [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]]. Excavations at the non-Maya site of [[Teotihuacan]] have unearthed the remains of hundreds of bodies that are thought to represent a mass sacrifice at the [[Temple of the Feathered Serpent]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch03|Berryman 2007]]: 378&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Temple of the Moon (Peru)|Temple of the Moon]], another excavation site, there were a number of decapitated remains found along with numerous [[bound up|bound]] bodies of headless males. Given these two examples of mass sacrificial sites, there is no reason why this could not have taken place in Maya society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch01|Berryman 2007]]:377-378&lt;/ref&gt;

With that in mind, there are other possible explanations that are commonly used among the Maya. It is not unreasonable to think that some of these sites are examples of ancestral [[veneration]]. This was a selective social practice in which ancestors were considered a 
subset of all the deceased and were the ones who validated political power, status and access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mc12|McAnany 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also proof that the mortuary practices of the region were varied and once thought to be evidence of human sacrifice. They were commonly found in locations of tomb reuse and secondary burial practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch02|Berryman 2007]]:378&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed for the most part, that the soldiers did not patrol in large armies; rather there were many smaller groups or raiding parties. Most of these battles were driven by the desire for domination and the intention to intimidate other cities. During this time it was not uncommon that the victors of a battle would take captives back to their cities and use them for ritual sacrifice. In some instances they would bind or hinder the captive so that he could not fairly compete in a winner-take-all [[Ballcourts|ballcourt]] match. Herein, the loser would be beheaded and the victor would, in certain situations, keep his head as a trophy and confirm victory in order to establish his city's dominance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch03|Berryman]]:379&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Popul Vuh]], the vision of human sacrifice and decapitation is abundantly clear and emphasized. However, in instances of decapitation, the sacrifice was intended to signify rebirth and creation. This theme is confirmed when the [[Hero Twins]] played the Lords of Death in a ball game match and ended up tricking the Lords of Death into decapitating themselves. With the Lords of Death out of the picture, the Hero Twins were able to resurrect their father, the Maize God.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch04|Berryman]]:379&lt;/ref&gt; This shows the significance of sacrifice and decapitation in warfare as a means to reenact rebirth, in the Popul Vuh.

===Maya art===
[[Maya art]] and iconography is a major source to anthropologists' knowledge and beliefs about the culture and history of the Maya. For instance, at the site of [[Bonampak]], photographer Giles Healy discovered exquisite murals showing a battle and its aftermath, including the torture of captives. Other examples of Maya art depicting sacrifice and torture include carved stone stelae, altars, and panels. There is evidence that this type of art was recorded on wood and other perishable media, but they have eroded with time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch03|Chacon, O'Mansky, and Demarest 2007]]:13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Iconographic depictions of trophy heads tend to show the heads being suspended in midair, held by the hair, or even upside down. In addition they depict blood or possibly other fluids flowing from the neck, eyes or mouth. Holding a head by the hair is seen as a sign of disrespect. In Maya iconography, these heads are usually fastened upright with the eyes opened and are worn on a belt that is positioned on the small of the wearer's back. The actual act of decapitation in the iconography is rare but does appear from time to time. The most common place to see the decapitation of human heads being worn or presented as trophy heads are on painted cylinder vases of the Late Classic period and usually involve the [[Hero Twins]] or some type of Creation myth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch04|Chacon, Dye &amp; Berryman 2007]]:384&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological examples==

===In the South West of Mexico===

In Oaxaca there are various pre-Columbian figures in which high-ranking characters, warriors and ball players wear ritual and military paraphernalia, holding inverted heads with their loose, long hair hanging down. One of these figures can be seen in the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in Washington. Javier Urcid writes that these trophies may have been "soft parts of decapitated heads turned into relics to hang"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch03|Urcid 2010]]: 135.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several figures showing characters with facial skin on their faces: the skin of a flayed human. Urcid’s article in ''El Sacrificio Humano en la Tradición Religiosa Mesoamericana'' includes eight illustrations of these trophies in the southern west of Mexico, including a brazier depicting a ball player with a flayed facial mask, wearing a necklace of human bones and carrying a severed head.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch03|Urcid 2010]]: 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Relación Geográfica'' of 1580 mentions the festivity of the [[Xipe_Totec#Human_sacrifice | tlacaxipehualiztli]] in the context of human skin as trophies in Oaxaca: "with rods they hit throughout the body until it swelled, and then flayed the bodies and washed the meat with hot water and ate it, and carried the skins in the nearby villages for begging."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch03|Urcid 2010]]: 137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Mangales (Early Preclassic)===

Los Mangales lies within the [[Salamá River|Salama Valley]] in the Northern Highlands of Guatemala. It has been estimated that this site was active from approximately 1000 until 400 BC and was the site of vast, elaborate burials. Three principal mounds entail the main composition of the site, (Str. D6-1) containing varied amounts of adult male crania that have been interpreted as trophy heads or possibly dismembered sacrificial retainers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch07|Chacon, Mendoza &amp; Berryman]]:389&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the three principal burial mounds, there were multiple burial sites. In particular at burial site 6, there was conclusive evidence of human sacrifice, where were located at least 12 dismembered victims and three possible trophy heads. The heads were found lying inside the crypt with specific individuals. A common trend at this site is that the victims found outside the formal crypt were lying in the [[prone position]] (their wrists and ankles were bound tightly together and that they were faced down) and the individuals that were inside the crypt were in the [[supine position]] (face up and unbound). However, finding a body in the prone position does not necessarily mean that the individual was a victim of sacrifice. It is believed that finding isolated crania was seen as early evidence of trophy taking in the Maya region.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch08|Berryman]]:389-390&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chalchuapa (Preclassic) ===

Evidence of sacrifice and trophy taking was found at an evacuation site in [[Chalchuapa|El Chalchuapa]], El Salvador. The remains of 33 individuals were found and had appeared to have been victims of ritual sacrifice that had spanned five different episodes of construction to the structure. Many of the individuals were found to be male and most were lying in the prone position. Of the individuals found it was noted that they were represented as crania and were determined to have been trophy heads. The others had a range of signs of mutilation, including: one individual was missing his/her head, two were cut in half at the waist, one individual was missing his/her legs and another was missing his/her feet. Given the age of the individuals, the absence of grave goods, the positions and placement of the bodies, the lack of grave preparation and the evidence for dismemberment, this site seems to show that these individuals were war captives and then used in a form of ritualistic sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch09|Berryman]]:389-390&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuello, Belize (Late Preclassic)===

[[Cuello]] is a site that provides several examples of decapitation, dismemberment, and sacrifice of young to middle-aged males at public events. Here we see evidence of the sacrifice of children, one of whom appeared to have been decapitated demonstrating the incidence of decapitated individuals in common grounds and public structures. In most mass burials there seem to be primary individuals in the center, surrounded by the remains of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch12|Berryman]]:391&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colha, Belize (Terminal Classic)===

In [[Colha, Belize]], archaeologists discovered a large pit next to a stairway near the center of a monumental structure (operation 2010). This "Skull Pit" contained the heads of around 30 individuals. Ten of these were children ranging in age from 6 months to 6 or 7 years old. The remaining 20 individuals were adults. There were cut marks on the crania and the remains were burnt, and the age grouping and the location of the pit has led to multiple conclusions on the reasons behind these sacrifices. One theory is that they were sacrificed as a part of a religious ceremony. Other hypotheses are that the victims were political prisoners treated with ritual violence or that they were ancestors of an elite lineage that was violently deposed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch13|Berryman]]:392&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teotihuacan (Feathered Serpent Pyramid)===

At this excavation site in Mexico, archaeologists found roughly 72 males. Due to the evidence surrounding them they were determined to be soldiers. The individuals were placed in a series of highly structured graves that were below, and just outside, the pyramid. From the other evidence unearthed, it was found that each individual had between 7 and 11 human maxillae, or human jaw bones, in his possession. These maxillae were mostly worn around the arm, generally on the biceps of soldiers. This was seen as a testament of strength and power that proved that these individuals had been in multiple battles or campaigns. Along with the maxillae, the men had necklaces made of teeth, obsidian projectile points and slate disks located behind their lower back, which were commonly found on Teotihuacan military figures. This led the excavators to believe that these soldiers were of an elite class of warrior, and not just some semi-organized militia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sp10|Spence, White, Longstaffe &amp; Law 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the remains of apparent soldiers, there were also remains found of other males with rich offerings that would suggest they were members of higher social status. This evidence proved that even at an early stage of Teotihuacan’s existence there was large scale human sacrifice as well as warfare-related symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sp11|Spence, White, Longstaffe &amp; Law 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Emotion}}

'''Humiliation''' is the abasement of [[pride]], which creates mortification or leads to a state of being [[Humility|humbled]] or reduced to lowliness or [[submission]]. It is an emotion felt by a person whose [[social status]], either by force or willingly, has just decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Neel.  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201408/the-psychology-humiliation "The Psychology of Humiliation."] ''Psychology Today''.  27 August 2014.  10 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be brought about through  [[intimidation]], physical or mental [[mistreatment]] or trickery, or by [[embarrassment]] if a person is revealed to have committed a socially or legally unacceptable act. Whereas [[humility]] can be sought alone as a means to de-emphasize the ego, humiliation must involve other person(s), though not necessarily directly or willingly. 

Humiliation is currently an active research topic, and is now seen as an important – and complex – core dynamic in human [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], having implications at intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional and international levels.&lt;ref name=Lindner&gt;Lindner, Evelin, Making Enemies: Humiliation and International Conflict. London, England: Praeger Security International, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects==
A person who suffers from severe humiliation could experience [[Major depressive disorder|major depressions]], suicidal states, and severe anxiety states such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The loss of status, like losing a job or being labeled as a liar or discredited unfairly, could cause people inability to behave normally in their communities. Humiliated individuals could be provoked and crave for revenge, and some people could feel worthless, hopeless and helpless, creating suicidal thoughts if justice is not met. It also can lead to new insights, activism and a new kinship with marginalized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Torres |first=Walter J. |last2=Bergner |first2=Raymond M. |date=June 2010 |title=Humiliation: Its Nature and Consequences |url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/38/2/195.full |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law]] |publisher=AAPL |volume=38 |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feelings of humiliation can produce 'humiliated fury'&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helen B. 1971, ''Shame and Grief in Neurosis.'' New York: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which, when turned inward can result in [[apathy]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and when turned outward can give rise to [[paranoia]], sadistic behaviour and fantasies of revenge. Klein explains, "When it is outwardly directed, humiliated fury unfortunately creates additional victims, often including innocent bystanders ... . When it is inwardly directed, the resulting self-hate renders victims incapable of meeting their own needs, let alone having energy available to love and care for others." He goes on to say, "In either case, those who are consumed by humiliated fury are absorbed in themselves or their cause, wrapped in wounded pride..."&lt;ref name=Klein /&gt; 

A study by researchers at the University of Michigan revealed that “the same regions of the brain that become active in response to painful sensory experiences are activated during intense experiences of social rejection.” In other words, humiliation and isolation are experienced as intensely as physical pain.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;[http://www.onbeing.org/blog/the-violence-of-humiliation/6753 Martin, Courtney E. "The Violence of Humiliation", ''On Being'', September 10, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishments and interrogation tactics==

Humiliating of one person  by another (the humiliator) is often used as a way of asserting power over them, and is a common form of [[oppression]] or [[abuse]] used in a [[Police abuse|police]], military, or [[Prisoner abuse|prison]] context during legal interrogations or illegal [[torture]] sessions. Many now-obsolete public [[punishment]]s were deliberately designed to be humiliating, e.g. [[tarring and feathering]] lawbreakers, [[pillory]], "[[mark of shame]]" ([[social stigma|stigma]]) as a means of "making an example" of a person and presenting a deterrent to others. Some practices, such as tarring and feathering, became tools of unofficial mob justice. In folk customs such as the English [[Skimmington|skimmington rides]] and [[rough music]] (and their continental equivalents, such as the French [[Charivari]]), dramatic public demonstrations of moral disapproval were enacted to humiliate [[Norm (social)|transgressors]] and drive them out of the community.&lt;ref name="Thompson1992"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = E.

Some U.S. states have experimented with humiliating or [[shaming]] lawbreakers by publishing their names and indicating their offense (e.g., with soliciting prostitutes or drinking and driving). In 2010, there was public outcry about reports showing police in [[Dongguan]] and [[Guangdong]] in China leading a parade of arrested prostitutes for the purpose of humiliating them. The national [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] reprimanded the local police and affirmed that such punishments are not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/china24/20100727/100816.shtml|title=Prostitute humiliation dents police image|first=Ning|last=Zhang|date=2010-07-27|accessdate=2012-01-19|publisher=[[China Network Television]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A wider human perspective==
[[Image:The Humiliation of Emperor Valerian by Shapur, King of Persia, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|''The Humiliation of [[Valerian (emperor)|Emperor Valerian]] by [[Shapur I|Shapur]], King of Persia'' by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]].]]

Donald Klein described humiliation as "a powerful factor in human affairs that has, for a variety of reasons, been overlooked by students of individual and collective behavior. It is a pervasive and all too destructive influence in the behavior of individuals, groups, organizations, and nations."&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;Klein, Donald C. (Ed.), ''The Humiliation Dynamic: Viewing the Task of Prevention From a New Perspective'', Special Issue, Journal of Primary Prevention, Part I, 12, No. 2, 1991. New York, NY: Kluwer Academic/ Plenum Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is a subjective emotion, humiliation has a universal aspect which applies to all human beings: "it is the feeling of being put down, made to feel less than one feels oneself to be."&lt;ref name=Lindner /&gt;

A [[society]] that suffers from humiliation is an unstable one.  The [[cognitive dissonance]] between the way in which the society is perceived and the way in which it sees itself can be so great that violence can result on a massive scale against people belonging to an [[out group]].  According to [[Jonathan Sacks]], "By turning the question 'What did we do wrong?' into 'Who did this to us?', [hate against an out group] restores some measure of self-respect and provides a course of action.  In psychiatry, the clinical terms for this process are splitting and projection; it allows people to define themselves as victims."&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Jonathan.  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-return-of-anti-semitism-1422638910 "The Return of Anti-Semitism."] ''The Wall Street Journal''.  30 January 2015.  19 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21287">'''Interindividual differences in perception''' describes the effect that differences in brain structure or factors such as culture, upbringing and environment have on the [[perception]] of humans.
Interindividual (differing from person to person) variability is usually regarded as a source of noise for research. However, in recent years, it has become an interesting source to study sensory mechanisms and understand [[human behavior]]. With the help of modern [[neuroimaging]] methods such as [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], individual differences in perception could be related to the underlying brain mechanisms. This has helped to explain differences in  behavior and [[cognition]] across the population. Common methods include studying the perception of [[illusion]]s, as they can effectively demonstrate how different aspects such as [[culture]], [[Human genetics|genetics]] and the [[Human ecology|environment]] can influence human behavior.

A motion quartet is a [[Bistability|bistable]] stimulus - it consists of two dots that change their position from frame to frame. This position change can either be interpreted as horizontal or vertical movement by viewers, and this experience can switch during viewing between interpretations. Depending on the [[aspect ratio]] of the two dots' positions, one or the other state is perceived longer or more often. At an aspect ratio of one, the illusion is biased towards the vertical perception. The reason for this might be the way the human brain processes the signals from both eyes in the [[visual system]]. The right half of an eye's field of view is processed by the left hemisphere, and the left half by the right hemisphere. A stimulus moving vertically only involves one field of view and so one hemisphere, while a stimulus moving vertically from one field of view to the other involves both hemispheres, and requires communication between them. The delay caused by this additional signalling might be the cause for the bias.&lt;ref name="metastable anisotropy"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Metastable motion anisotropy. | author=Chaudhuri, Avi | journal=Visual Neuroscience | year=1991 | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=397–407 | pmid=1764411 | doi=10.1017/s0952523800009706}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also individual differences in the way the motion quartet is perceived: Some people require a different aspect ratio to perceive both axes of movement than others.
A study using diffusion tensor imaging further showed differences in the structure of the corpus callosum, the primary connection between the two hemispheres, might be the origin of these differences.&lt;ref name="Genç bistable"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211008773 | title=Interhemispheric Connections Shape Subjective Experience of Bistable Motion | author= Genç, Erhan | journal=Current Biology | year=2011 |  volume=21 | issue=17 | pages=1494–1499 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.003| pmid=21885284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object size estimation===
There exist a variety of illusions that make objects appear bigger or smaller compared to their real size. Two such illusions are the [[Ebbinghaus illusion|Ebbinghaus]] and the [[Ponzo illusion|Ponzo]] illusions. The Ebbinghaus illusion makes a dot seem bigger because it is surrounded by smaller dots, while the Ponzo illusion exploits human [[Perspective (visual)#Linear perspective|perspective]] processing by making a dot appear bigger because it seems farther away. Schwarzkopf et al.&lt;ref name="surface_V1" /&gt; found that the size of the [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex .28V1.29|primary visual cortex (V1)]] has an effect on the magnitude of these illusions. The larger the subject's V1 surface area was, the less the subjects fell for the illusion. This is hypothesized to be due to the fact that a larger V1 dedicated to the same portion of the visual field means a lesser effect of later, fixed-size visual areas (which are the ones that are responsible for the illusion effect).&lt;ref name="surface_V1"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n1/full/nn.2706.html | title=The surface area of human V1 predicts the subjective experience of object size | author=Schwarzkopf, D Samuel | journal=Nature Neuroscience | volume=14 | year=2011 | issue=1 | pages=28–30 | doi=10.1038/nn.2706 | pmid=21131954 | pmc=3012031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditory Illusions==

===McGurk Effect===
The [[McGurk effect]] is an auditory illusion in which people perceive a different syllable when incongruent audiovisual speech is presented: an auditory syllable "ba" is presented while the mouth movement is "ga". As a result, the listener perceives the syllable "da". However, according to Gentilucci and Cattaneo (2005), not everyone perceives this illusion; only about 26% to 98% of the population are susceptible to this illusion.&lt;ref name="McGurk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gentilucci | first1 = M. | last2 = Cattaneo | first2 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Automatic audiovisual integration in speech perception" ''Experimental Brain Research'' 167(1), 66-75. McGurk, H., &amp; MacDonald, J. (1976). Hearing lips and seeing voices | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 264 | issue = | pages = 746–748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the psychological models that explains the interindividual differences in speech perception is the [[fuzzy logic]] model of speech perception&lt;ref name="fuzzy speech"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oden | first1 = G. C. | last2 = Massaro | first2 = D. W. | year = 1978 | title = Integration of featural information in speech perception | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 85 | issue = 3| pages = 172–191 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.85.3.172 | pmid=663005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, a categorization process is carried out when processing speech sounds. When listening to a stimulus, the features of the acoustic signal are analyzed. Subsequently, this signal is compared with the features that are stored in the memory; finally the sound is classified into the category that best fits. However, this classification may have a blurred boundary respectively to the category which the sound belongs to. As a result, the final decision may depend on integration of multiple sources of information. When the McGurk effect is presented the auditory and visual components of the speech are separately evaluated before being integrated. In those who perceive the McGurk effect, the visual information has a higher influence on the perception of the ambiguous audiovisual information and thus the sound is classified as "da".

Many studies have concluded that the area responsible for the perception of this phenomenon is the left [[Superior temporal sulcus|superior temporal sulcus(STS)]].&lt;ref name="McGurk_Nath"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nath | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Beauchamp | first2 = M. S. | year = 2012 | title = A neural basis for interindividual differences in the McGurk effect, a multisensory speech illusion | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 781–787 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.024 | pmid=21787869 | pmc=3196040}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is critical for the [[multisensory integration]] of visual and auditory information during speech perception. Moreover,  there is a correlation between the activation of the STS and the perception of the McGurk effect. In that sense, if the left STS  correctly integrates the mismatched audiovisual information, a McGurk effect is perceived; if the left STS is not active, the visual and auditory information are not integrated and thus a McGurk effect is not perceived.

In one study&lt;ref name="McGurk_Nath" /&gt; [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (BOLD fMRI) was used to measure the brain activity in perceivers and non-perceivers of the McGurk effect while presented with congruent audiovisual syllables, McGurk audiovisual syllables (auditory "ba" + visual "ga" producing perception of "da"),  and non-McGurk incongruent syllables( auditory "ga" + visual "ba" producing auditory perception of "ga"). The researchers found that there was a positive correlation between the amplitude of response in the left STS and the probability of perceiving the McGurk effect. In other words, the subject with the weakest STS activation to incongruent speech had the smallest probability of experiencing a McGurk percept; whereas the subject with the strongest STS response had the highest probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK3T7LWIkP8|title=McGurk effect: Auditory "ba" + Visual "ga"|first=|last=anathfMRI|date=18 February 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beauchamp et al. (2010) highlight the critical role of the left STS in audiovisual integration.&lt;ref name="TMS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beauchamp | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Nath | first2 = A. R. | last3 = Pasalar | first3 = S. | year = 2010 | title = fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation reveals that the superior temporal sulcus is a cortical locus of the McGurk effect | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 7| pages = 2414–2417 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.4865-09.2010 | pmid=20164324 | pmc=2844713}}&lt;/ref&gt; They applied single pulses of [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) to the STS of McGurk perceivers during presentation of McGurk stimuli. The perception of the McGurk effect decreased from 94% to 43% and the subjects reported perceiving only the auditory syllable. Following from that, Beauchamp et al. conclude that the left STS is crucial for the audiovisual integration and thus for the perception of the McGurk effect.

Moreover, another study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gurler | first1 = D. | last2 = Doyle | first2 = N. | last3 = Walker | first3 = E. | last4 = Magnotti | first4 = J. | last5 = Beauchamp | first5 = M. | year = 2015 | title = A link between individual differences in multisensory speech perception and eye movements | url = | journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 77 | issue = 4| pages = 1333–1341 | doi=10.3758/s13414-014-0821-1| pmc = 4437244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the basis of the interindividual differences in the perception of McGurk effect lies in the eye movements of the subject when viewing the talker’s face. The experimenters carried out an [[eye tracking]] study and measured the eye movements of the participants while viewing audiovisual speech. They found that people who spent more time fixating the mouth of the talker were the more likely to perceive the McGurk effect than those who rarely fixated on the mouth of the speaker.

===Other auditory illusions===
[[File:Pitch class space.svg|thumb|right|Representation of the [[pitch class]] circle with respect to tone height]]
Interindividual differences have also been researched for the '''[[Tritone paradox]] illusion'''. In this illusion, the subject successively listens to two tones, which are separated by a half [[octave]]. Each tone is made of a set of [[harmonics]] which have an octave relation. The listener has to decide if the two tones have a descending or ascending relation. According to [[Diana Deutsch]],&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1"&gt;Deutsch, D. (1991). The tritone paradox: An influence of language on music perception. Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 8(4), 335-347.&lt;/ref&gt; the perception of the tones is influenced by the language spoken by the listener. The listener has a circular representation of the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of sounds that are common in their culture and based on that develops a pitch range of their speaking voice, which determines the orientation of the [[pitch class]] with respect to the height; when a given tone is in this range, it is taken as the highest position along the circle and depending on the second tone, the person perceives the pattern as ascending or descending. Deutsch&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1"/&gt; found that for people from [[California]], the tone in the highest position of the pitch-class circle is around C# and D whereas for people from southern [[England]] it is around G. According to those results, Deutsch hypothesized that the orientation of the pitch-class circle with respect to the height is similar for individuals from the same linguistic group and varies for individuals from different linguistic groups.

Other illusions found by Deutsch whose interpretation depends on interindividual differences is the '''phantom words illusion'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/psychology/pages.php?i=211|title=Diana Deutsch - Phantom Words|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This illusion consists of the continuous presentation of two meaningless syllables. In order to experience the illusion, it is necessary that the listener sits between two loudspeakers, one to the left and the other to the right. The syllables are presented offset in time, in such a way that while one syllable is coming from the left, the other syllable is coming from the right loudspeaker. It was shown that after a period of time, people start hearing words. According to Deutsch, the perceived words depend on the language spoken by the listener, their knowledge and their expectations. According to Shinn-Cunningham (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shinn-Cunningham | first1 = B.G. | year = 2008 | title = Object-based auditory and visual attention | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 182–186 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.02.003| pmc = 2699558}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the information is incomplete or contradictory, the perceptual system often fills this gaps with plausible interpretations and in that way allows new information to be efficiently processed.

==Effect of Culture on Perception==
[[File:Frame_and_Line_Test.svg|thumb|height=width|right|The framed line test]]
Several studies have shown that differences between individuals play a significant role in determining how a stimulus is perceived. These differences among people, in turn, are greatly influenced by one's own socio-cultural contexts. The research indicates that cultural factors influence the process of perception not just on lower-level (such as [[Cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition|object perception]] and [[attention]] deployment), but also on the higher-order functions (such as [[theory of mind]] and [[emotion recognition]]).&lt;ref name= "Culture_and_self"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=Hazel R.|last2=Kitayama|first2=Shinobu|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1991|volume=98|issue=2|pages=224–253|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name= "holistic vs nalytical"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masuda|first1=Takahiko|last2=Nisbett|first2=Richard E|title=Attending holistically versus analytically: Comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=Nov 2001|volume= 81|issue=5|pages=922–934|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.922|pmid=11708567}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name= "New Look"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitayama|first1=S.|last2=Duffy|first2=S.|last3=Kawamura|first3=T.|last4=Larsen|first4=J. T.|title=Perceiving an Object and Its Context in Different Cultures: A Cultural Look at New Look|journal=Psychological Science|date=1 May 2003|volume=14|issue=3|pages=201–206|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.02432|pmid=12741741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two major cultures analyzed in these studies were mostly [[Western World|Western]] and [[East Asia]]n cultures because of the considerable differences in the social structure and practices. Western culture was referred to as an ''analytical'' culture whereas Eastern culture was referred more as a ''holistic'' culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=JB|last2=Rule|first2=NO|last3=Ambady|first3=N|title=The cultural neuroscience of person perception|journal=Progress in Brain Research|date=2009|volume=178|pages=191–201|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(09)17813-5|pmid=19874970|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444533616}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, [[individualism]] and [[freedom]] are the predominant values in Western societies, which in turn demand interpretation of an object in its absolute terms independent of its context. In contrast, Eastern culture is known for its emphasis on [[collectivism]] and [[interdependence]] on each other, where interpretation of an object is often in relation with its context&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbett|first1=RE|last2=Peng|first2=K|last3=Choi|first3=I|last4=Norenzayan|first4=A|title=Culture and systems of thought: holistic versus analytic cognition.|journal=Psychological Review|date=April 2001|volume=108|issue=2|pages=291–310|pmid=11381831|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.2.291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pioneer study examining these cultural differences in visual perception was conducted by Kitmaya et al. (2003).&lt;ref name="New Look"/&gt; The findings of that study provide behavioural evidence on how cultural factors affect visual perception and attention deployment. For the study, [[United States|Americans]] and [[Japan]]ese were taken as subjects. The visual stimulus shown to the subjects consisted of a square figure with a line hanging from the centre (the framed line test). First was the absolute condition, where the task was to redraw the line on the centre of the square in its absolute length, to a new square box independent of its size. Second was the relative condition, in which the task was to redraw the line on the centre of the square in proportionally similar to context of the new square box. The results show that Americans perform better in the absolute task which requires analytical processing of stimulus independent of it context, whereas the Japanese performed better at the relative task which demands the holistic processing of the stimulus in relation to its context.

In line with these findings, Hedden and colleagues (2009)&lt;ref name="Hedden 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedden|first1=T.|last2=Mormino|first2=E. C.|last3=Amariglio|first3=R. E.|last4=Younger|first4=A. P.|last5=Schultz|first5=A. P.|last6=Becker|first6=J. A.|last7=Buckner|first7=R. L.|last8=Johnson|first8=K. A.|last9=Sperling|first9=R. A.|last10=Rentz|first10=D. M.|title=Cognitive Profile of Amyloid Burden and White Matter Hyperintensities in Cognitively Normal Older Adults|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=14 November 2012|volume=32|issue=46|pages=16233–16242|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2462-12.2012|pmid=23152607|pmc=3523110}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the same visual stimuli to investigate the neural activity with the help of fMRI. Participants of the study were asked to judge the length of a vertical line, either including the contextual information or ignoring it. The results revealed that separate brain regions were employed while performing  the task, either incorporating the contextual information or avoiding it, based on one's own culture. The areas associated with [[attentional control]] in the [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[Parietal lobe|parietal]] region of the brain were highly activated when the subjects performed the task which was incongruent to their cultural pattern. That is, the activity in the fronto-parietal region enhanced when East Asians had to ignore the contextual information, while similar enhancement happened for Americans when they had to incorporate the contextual information. These findings illustrate that the function of the neural mechanisms are also modulated to some extent by one's own culture.&lt;ref name="Hedden 2009"/&gt;

A follow-up fMRI study by Gutchess, Welsh, Boduroglu, and Park (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutchess|first1=AH|last2=Welsh|first2=RC|last3=Boduroglu|first3=A|last4=Park|first4=DC|title=Cultural differences in neural function associated with object processing.|journal=Cognitive, affective &amp; behavioral neuroscience|date=June 2006|volume=6|issue=2|pages=102–9|pmid=17007231|doi=10.3758/cabn.6.2.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed the previous findings by using a rather complex stimulus, which consists of ''only the object'' pictures, ''object with background'' pictures and ''only the background'' pictures without the object. This particular study was done on East-Asian Americans and non-Asian Americans. Though the performance of both subject groups was equally good, the activity of the involved brain areas was significantly different. Non-Asian Americans had a higher activation in the object processing areas in the ventral visual cortex during the object recognition task whereas the East-Asian Americans exhibited higher activity in the left [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] and [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] areas which are associated with perceptual analysis.

The '''Intervasion of the UK''' was a 1994 [[Electronic Civil Disobedience|electronic civil disobedience]] and collective action against [[John Major]]'s [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice Bill]] which sought to outlaw outdoor dance festivals and "music with a repetitive beat". Launched by a group called The [[Zippies]] from [[San Francisco]]'s [[181 Club]] on [[Guy Fawkes Day]], November 5, 1994, it resulted in government websites going down for at least a week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medialternatives.blogetery.com/2010/12/15/intervasion-supports-anonymous Wikileaks Infowar not the first online protest action | Medialternatives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821141633/http://medialternatives.blogetery.com/2010/12/15/intervasion-supports-anonymous/ |date=2011-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised a form of Distributed Denial of Service ([[DDoS]]) known as the [[E-mail bomb|Email bomb]] in order to overload servers as a form of [[online protest]] and [[Internet activism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medialternatives.blogetery.com/2011/02/07/2828/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215024709/http://medialternatives.blogetery.com/2011/02/07/2828/ |archivedate=2011-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first such use of the [[Internet]] and technology as a weapon of struggle and/or civil disobedience, and preceded the [[:it:Netstrike|1995 Italian NetStrike]].

==Campaign against the CJB==
Under the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994]], the definition of music played at a rave was given as: "music includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/ukpga_19940033_en_8#pt5-pb2 |title=Public Order: Collective Trespass or Nuisance on Land - Powers to remove trespassers on land - Powers to remove persons attending or preparing for a rave |work=Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |accessdate=2008-06-09| year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections 63, 64 &amp; 65 of the Act targeted electronic dance music played at [[rave]]s. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when "ten or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave". Section 65 allowed any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; "non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale (£1000)".{{citequote|date=May 2018}}

The Zippies sought to jam the mailboxes of UK politicians associated with the Bill in order to bring their attention to the issue of [[natural justice]] involving basic rights and freedoms. In effect, the collective action was saying: "If you take away our freedom, we have the power to take away something you take for granted, and to do this in a way which deploys the Internet as a weapon".{{citequote|date=May 2018}}

Several hackers not directly associated with the group launched all-out [[penetration testing]] and load testing operations against several UK government websites, resulting in a tit-for-tat battle, as the Zippies mailbox on morph.com went down, along with the entire server of Morph, a well-known Bay Area [[Bulletin board system|BBS]].

==Media Coverage==
The event was broadcast on Radio Free Berkeley.

The protest action occurred during the manhunt for [[Kevin Mitnick]] and was thus partly an underground event. The media also refused to entertain the implications of electronic civil disobedience, with public attention focused on the problem of illegal raves and black-hat hackers, prompting scare stories about "evil hackers" and "young hoodlums" penetrating the British defences while the zippies were written off as nothing more than electrohippies.

==Criticism==
Some criticism of the Intervasion was expressed by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] who complained about the "lack of a cutoff date"{{citequote|date=May 2018}}. Other criticism on the [[Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link]] (WELL) BBS centered on the use of militant language. The online protest action also suffered from conflict between its stated aims: "To clog the servers of the UK government", and its call to send email messages to UK politicians. Thus jamming mailboxes with email and large file attachments defeated the purpose of the exercise which was essentially an early form of hacktivism. The nature of the collective action was also not articulated well enough. For instance, the digital be-in which occurred during the launch of [[Timothy Leary]]'s Chaos and Cyberculture, in which Leary was "kidnapped" without the consent of his publisher, and "forced" to DDoS the UK government, was simply a protest message, sent repeatedly to mail-boxes around the world.

The '''invariant mass''', '''rest mass''', '''intrinsic mass''', '''proper mass,''' or in the case of bound systems simply '''mass,''' is the portion of the total mass of an [[physical body|object]] or [[physical system|system]] of objects that is independent of the overall motion of the system.  More precisely, it is a characteristic of the system's total [[energy]] and [[momentum]] that is the same in all [[frames of reference]] related by [[Lorentz transformation]]s.&lt;ref name="LawrenceS"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&amp;pg=PA1073 Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Volume 2, page 1073] - Lawrence S. Lerner - Science - 1997&lt;/ref&gt; If a [[center of momentum frame]] exists for the system&lt;!-- note there are massless particles --&gt;, then the invariant mass of a system is equal to its total mass in that "rest frame". In other reference frames, where the system's momentum is nonzero, the total mass (a.k.a. [[relativistic mass]]) of the system is greater than the invariant mass, but the invariant mass remains unchanged.

Due to [[mass-energy equivalence]], the '''rest energy''' of the system is simply the invariant mass times the [[speed of light]] squared.  Similarly, the total energy of the system is its total (relativistic) mass times the speed of light squared.

Systems whose [[four-momentum]] is a [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|null vector]] (for example a single photon or many photons moving in exactly the same direction) have [[zero]] invariant mass, and are referred to as [[massless particle|''massless'']]. A physical object or particle moving faster than the speed of light would have space-like four-momenta (such as the hypothesized [[tachyon]]), and these do not appear to exist. Any time-like four-momentum possesses a reference frame where the momentum (3-dimensional) is zero, which is a center of momentum frame. In this case, invariant mass is positive and is referred to as the rest mass.

If objects within a system are in relative motion, then the invariant mass of the whole system will differ from the sum of the objects' rest masses. This is also equal to the total energy of the system divided by [[speed of light|''c'']]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. See [[mass–energy equivalence]] for a discussion of definitions of mass. Since the mass of systems must be measured with a weight or mass scale in a center of momentum frame in which the entire system has zero momentum, such a scale always measures the system's invariant mass. For example, a scale would measure the kinetic energy of the molecules in a bottle of gas to be part of invariant mass of the bottle, and thus also its rest mass. The same is true for massless particles in such system, which add invariant mass and also rest mass to systems, according to their energy.

For an isolated ''massive'' system, the center of mass of the system moves in a straight line with a steady sub-luminal [[velocity]] (with a velocity depending on the [[frame of reference|reference frame]] used to view it). Thus, an observer can always be placed to move along with it. In this frame, which is the [[center of momentum frame]], the total momentum is zero, and the system as a whole may be thought of as being "at rest" if it is a bound system (like a bottle of gas). In this frame, which exists under these assumptions, the invariant mass of the system is equal to the total system energy (in the zero-momentum frame) divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This total energy in the center of momentum frame, is the '''minimum''' energy which the system may be observed to have, when seen by various observers from various inertial frames.

Note that for reasons above, such a rest frame does not exist for single [[photon]]s, or rays of [[light]] moving in one direction. When two or more photons move in different directions, however, a center of mass frame (or "rest frame" if the system is bound) exists. Thus, the mass of a system of several photons moving in different directions is positive, which means that an invariant mass exists for this system even though it does not exist for each photon.

== Sum of rest masses ==
Because the invariant mass includes the mass of any kinetic and potential energies which remain in the center of momentum frame, the invariant mass of a system can be greater than sum of rest masses of its separate constituents.{{clarify|date=January 2013|It an electric field in a hydrogen atom a "separate constituent"? And which is its mass: positive or negative?}} For example, rest mass and invariant mass are zero for individual photons even though they may add mass to the invariant mass of systems. For this reason, invariant mass is in general not an additive quantity (although there are a few rare situations where it may be, as is the case when massive particles in a system without potential or kinetic energy can be added to a total mass).

Consider the simple case of two-body system, where object A is moving towards another object B which is initially at rest (in any particular frame of reference). The magnitude of invariant mass of this two-body system (see definition below) is different from the sum of rest mass (i.e. their respective mass when stationary). Even if we consider the same system from center-of-momentum frame, where net momentum is zero, the magnitude of the system's invariant mass is '''not equal''' to the sum of the rest masses of the particles within it.

The kinetic energy of such particles and the potential energy of the force fields increase the total energy above the sum of the particle rest masses, and both terms contribute to the invariant mass of the system. The sum of the particle kinetic energies as calculated by an observer is smallest in the center of momentum frame (again, called the "rest frame" if the system is bound).

They will often also interact through one or more of the [[fundamental forces]], giving them a potential energy of interaction, possibly [[negative number|negative]].

For an isolated ''massive'' system, the center of mass moves in a straight line with a steady sub-luminal [[velocity]]. Thus, an observer can always be placed to move along with it. In this frame, which is the [[center of momentum frame]], the total momentum is zero, and the system as a whole may be thought of as being "at rest" if it is a bound system (like a bottle of gas). In this frame, which always exists, the invariant mass of the system is equal to the total system energy (in the zero-momentum frame) divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

== As defined in particle physics ==
In [[particle physics]], the '''invariant mass''' {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is equal to the [[mass]] in the rest frame of the particle, and can be calculated by the particle's [[energy]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|E}} and its [[momentum]]&amp;nbsp;{{math|'''p'''}} as measured in ''any'' frame, by the [[energy–momentum relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; m_0^2 c^2 = \left( \frac{E}{c} \right) ^2 - \left\| \mathbf{p} \right\| ^2 &lt;/math&gt;

or in [[natural units]] where {{math|1=''c'' = 1}},

:&lt;math&gt; m_0^2 = E^2 - \left\| \mathbf{p} \right\| ^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

This invariant mass is the same in all [[frame of reference|frames of reference]] (see also [[special relativity]]). This equation says that the invariant mass is the pseudo-Euclidean length of the [[four-vector]] {{math|(''E'', '''p''')}}, calculated using the [[pseudo-Euclidean space|relativistic version of the Pythagorean theorem]] which has a different sign for the space and time dimensions. This length is preserved under any Lorentz boost or rotation in four dimensions, just like the ordinary length of a vector is preserved under rotations. In quantum theory the invariant mass is a parameter in the relativistic [[Dirac equation]] for an elementary particle. The Dirac quantum operator corresponds to the particle four-momentum vector.

Since the invariant mass is determined from quantities which are conserved during a decay, the invariant mass calculated using the energy and momentum of the decay products of a single particle is equal to the mass of the particle that decayed.
The mass of a system of particles can be calculated from the general formula:

: &lt;math&gt; \left( W c^2 \right) ^2= \left( \sum E \right) ^2 - \left\| \sum \mathbf{p} c \right\| ^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the invariant mass of the system of particles, equal to the mass of the decay particle.
: &lt;math&gt;\sum E&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the energies of the particles
: &lt;math&gt;\sum \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector sum of the [[momentum]] of the particles (includes both magnitude and direction of the momenta)

The term invariant mass is also used in inelastic scattering experiments. Given an inelastic reaction with total incoming energy larger than the total detected energy (i.e. not all outgoing particles are detected in the experiment), the invariant mass (also known as the "missing mass") {{mvar|W}} of the reaction is defined as follows (in natural units):

: &lt;math&gt; W^2 = \left( \sum E_\text{in} - \sum E_\text{out} \right) ^2 - \left\| \sum \mathbf{p}_\text{in} - \sum \mathbf{p}_\text{out} \right\| ^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

If there is one dominant particle which was not detected during an experiment, a plot of the invariant mass will show a sharp peak at the mass of the missing particle.

In those cases when the momentum along one direction cannot be measured (i.e. in the case of a neutrino, whose presence is only inferred from the [[missing energy]]) the [[Transverse mass]] is used.

==Example: two-particle collision==

In a two-particle collision (or a two-particle decay) the square of the invariant mass (in [[natural units]]) is
::{|
|&lt;math&gt;M^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = ( E_1 + E_2 ) ^2 - \left\| \textbf{p}_1 + \textbf{p}_2 \right\| ^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= m_1^2 + m_2^2 + 2 \left( E_1 E_2 - \textbf{p}_1 \cdot \textbf{p}_2 \right) .&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Massless particles ===
The invariant mass of a system made of two massless particles whose momenta form an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;
has a convenient expression:
::{|
|&lt;math&gt; M^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = (E_1 + E_2) ^2 - \left\| \textbf{p}_1 + \textbf{p}_2 \right\| ^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = [ ( p_1 , 0 , 0 , p_1 ) + ( p_2 , 0 , p_2 \sin \theta, p_2 \cos \theta ) ] ^2 = ( p_1 + p_2) ^2 - p_2 ^2 \sin^2 \theta - ( p_1 + p_2 \cos \theta ) ^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = 2 p_1 p_2 ( 1 - \cos\theta ) .&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Collider experiments ===
In particle collider experiments, one often defines the angular position of a particle in terms of an azimuthal angle&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; and [[pseudorapidity]] &lt;math&gt; \eta &lt;/math&gt;. Additionally the transverse momentum, &lt;math&gt; p_{T} &lt;/math&gt;, is usually measured. In this case if the particles are massless, or highly relativistic ( &lt;math&gt; E &gt;&gt; m&lt;/math&gt;,) then the invariant mass becomes:
::{|
|&lt;math&gt;M^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 2 p_{T 1} p_{T 2} ( \cosh(\eta_1 - \eta_2) - \cos (\phi_1 - \phi_2) ) .\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Rest energy ==
The '''rest energy''' &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; of a [[Elementary particle|particle]] is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\ E_0=m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light|speed of light in vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/2006/066063.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In general, only differences in [[energy]] have physical significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Modell|first=Michael|author2=Robert C. Reid|title=Thermodynamics and Its Applications |publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]]|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |date=1974 |isbn=0-13-914861-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of rest energy follows from the [[special theory of relativity]] that leads to Einstein's famous conclusion about equivalence of energy and mass. See [[Mass–energy equivalence#Background|background for mass–energy equivalence]].

On the other hand, the concept of the equivalent Dirac invariant rest mass may be defined in terms of the self energy corresponding to the product of a geometric matter current and a generalized potential &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=González-Martín |first= Gustavo R.|date=1994 |title=A geometric definition of mass. |journal=Gen. Rel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4236">In [[topology]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''loop space''' Ω''X'' of a [[pointed space|pointed topological space]] ''X'' is the space of (based) loops in ''X'', maps from the [[circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X'', equipped with the [[compact-open topology]]. Two loops can be multiplied by concatenation. With this operation, the loop space is an [[A-infinity operad|''A''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-space]]. That is, the multiplication is [[homotopy|homotopy coherently]] [[associative property|associative]].

The set of path components of Ω''X'', i.e. the set of based homotopy of based loops in ''X'', is a group, the [[fundamental group]] ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').

The '''iterated loop spaces''' of ''X'' are formed by applying Ω a number of times.

There is an analogous construction for [[topological spaces]] without basepoint. The '''free loop space''' of a [[topological space]] ''X'' is the space of maps from the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X'' with the [[compact-open topology]]. The free loop space of ''X'' is often denoted by &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}X&lt;/math&gt;. 
 
As a functor, the free loop space construction is [[right adjoint]] to [[cartesian product]] with the circle, while the loop space construction is right adjoint to the [[reduced suspension]]. This adjunction accounts for much of the importance of loop spaces in [[stable homotopy theory]]. (A related phenomenon in computer science is [[currying]], where the cartesian product is adjoint to the [[hom functor]].) Informally this is all referred to as [[Eckmann–Hilton duality]].

== Eckmann–Hilton duality ==
The loop space is dual to the [[Suspension (topology)|suspension]] of the same space; this duality is sometimes called [[Eckmann–Hilton duality]]. The basic observation is that
:&lt;math&gt;[\Sigma Z,X] \approxeq [Z, \Omega X]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;[A,B]&lt;/math&gt; is the set of homotopy classes of maps &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;,
and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Suspension (topology)|suspension]] of A, and &lt;math&gt;\approxeq&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[natural transformation|natural]] [[homeomorphism]].  This homeomorphism is essentially that of [[currying]], modulo the quotients needed to convert the products to reduced products.

In general, &lt;math&gt;[A, B]&lt;/math&gt; does not have a group structure for arbitrary spaces &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. However, it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;[\Sigma Z,X]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[Z, \Omega X]&lt;/math&gt; do have natural group structures when &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are [[Pointed space|pointed]], and the aforesaid isomorphism is of those groups. 
&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{citation |last= May |first=J. P. |authorlink=J. Peter May|title=A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology |year=1999 |publisher=U. Chicago Press, Chicago |url=http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/CONCISE/ConciseRevised.pdf |accessdate=2016-08-27}} ''(See chapter 8, section 2)''&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, setting &lt;math&gt;Z = S^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; (the &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; sphere) gives the relationship

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_k(X) \approxeq \pi_{k-1}(\Omega X)&lt;/math&gt;

This follows, since the [[homotopy group]] is defined as &lt;math&gt;\pi_k(X)=[S^k,X]&lt;/math&gt;, and the spheres can be obtained via suspensions of each-other: that is, &lt;math&gt;S^k=\Sigma S^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://topospaces.subwiki.org/wiki/Loop_space_of_a_based_topological_space Topospaces wiki - Loop space of a based topological space]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lysenkoism''' ({{lang-rus|Лысе́нковщина|Lysenkovshchina}}) was a political campaign conducted by [[Trofim Lysenko]], his followers and Soviet authorities against [[genetics]] and science-based [[agriculture]]. Lysenko served as the director of the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[VASKhNIL|Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences]]. Lysenkoism began in the late 1920s and formally ended in 1964.

In modern usage, the term lysenkoism has become distinct from normal pseudoscience. Where pseudoscience pretends to be science, lysenkoism aims at attacking the legitimacy of science itself, usually for political reasons.  It is the rejection of the universality of scientific truth, and the purposeful defamation of the scientific method to the level of politics. 

==In agriculture==
In 1928, Trofim Lysenko, a previously unknown [[Agronomy|agronomist]], claimed to have developed an agricultural technique, termed [[vernalization]], which tripled or quadrupled [[crop yield]] by exposing [[wheat]] seed to high humidity and low temperature. While cold and moisture exposure are a normal part of the life cycle of autumn-seeded winter cereals, the vernalization technique claimed to increase yields by increasing the intensity of exposure, in some cases planting soaked seeds directly into the snow cover of frozen fields. In reality, the technique was neither new (it had been known since 1854, and was extensively studied during the previous twenty years), nor did it produce the yields he promised, although some increase in production did occur.

When Lysenko began his fieldwork in the Soviet Union of the 1930s, the [[Agriculture in the Soviet Union|agriculture of the Soviet Union]] was in a massive crisis due to the forced [[collective farms|collectivisation of farms]], and the extermination of the [[kulak]]s.  The resulting [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|famine]] provoked the people and the government alike to search for any possible solution to the critical lack of food.  Lysenko's vernalization practices yielded marginally greater food production on the farms, and he was quickly accepted as the hero of Soviet agriculture.

Many [[agronomist]]s were educated before the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution]], and even many of those educated afterwards did not agree with the forced collectivization policies. Furthermore, among biologists of the day, the most popular topic was not agriculture at all, but the new genetics that was emerging out of studies of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', commonly known as fruit flies.  [[Drosophilidae|Drosophilid]] flies made experimental verification of genetics theories, such as [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian ratio]]s and [[heritability]], much easier.

[[Isaak Izrailevich Prezent]], a main Lysenko theorist, presented Lysenko in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[mass-media]] as a [[genius]] who had developed a new, revolutionary agricultural technique. In this period, [[Soviet propaganda]] often focused on inspirational stories of [[peasant]]s who, through their own canny ability and intelligence, came up with solutions to practical problems. Lysenko's widespread popularity provided him a platform to denounce theoretical genetics and to promote his own agricultural practices. He was, in turn, supported by the Soviet propaganda machine, which overstated his successes and omitted mention of his failures. This was accompanied by fake experimental data supporting Lysenkoism from scientists seeking favor and the destruction of counter-evidence to Lysenko's theories.  Instead of performing controlled experiments, Lysenko claimed that vernalization increased wheat yields by 15%, solely based upon questionnaires taken of farmers.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Rise==  
Lysenko's political success was mostly due to his appeal to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and [[Soviet ideology]]. Following the disastrous [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization efforts of the late 1920s]], Lysenko's "new" methods were seen by Soviet officials as paving the way to an "agricultural revolution." Lysenko himself was from a peasant family, and was an enthusiastic advocate of [[Leninism]]. During a period which saw a series of man-made agricultural disasters, he was also extremely fast in responding to problems, although not with real solutions. Whenever the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party]] announced plans to plant a new crop or [[Tillage|cultivate]] a new area, Lysenko had immediate practical suggestions on how to proceed.

So quickly did he develop his prescriptions—from the cold treatment of grain, to the plucking of leaves from cotton plants, to the cluster planting of trees, to unusual fertilizer mixes—that academic biologists did not have time to demonstrate that one technique was valueless or harmful before a new one was adopted. The Party-controlled newspapers  applauded Lysenko's "practical" efforts and questioned the motives of his critics. Lysenko's "revolution in agriculture" had a powerful propaganda advantage over the academics, who urged the patience and observation required for science.

Lysenko was admitted into the hierarchy of the Communist Party, and was put in charge of agricultural affairs. He used his position to denounce biologists as "fly-lovers and people haters",&lt;ref&gt;''Epistemology and the Social'', Evandro Agazzi, Javier Echeverría, Amparo Gómez Rodríguez, Rodopi, Jan 1, 2008 - Philosophy - 231 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xBvbQgWtgjsC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=fly-lovers+and+%22people+haters%22+%22Lysenko%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-nMvVcfbMNKyogTn24CICA&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA Google books scanned reference], p 149&lt;/ref&gt; and to decry the "[[wrecking (Soviet crime)|wreckers]]" in biology, who he claimed were trying to purposely disable the Soviet economy and cause it to fail. Furthermore, he denied the distinction between theoretical and applied biology.

Lysenko presented himself as a follower of [[Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin]], a well-known and well-liked Soviet [[horticulture|horticulturist]]. However, unlike Michurin, he advocated a form of [[Lamarckism]], insisting on using only [[Heterosis|hybridization]] and [[grafting]], as  non-genetic techniques. With this came, most importantly, the implication that ''acquired'' characteristics of an organism—for example, the state of being leafless as a result of having been plucked—could be inherited by that organism's descendants.  This is why Lysenko claimed [[vernalization]] would give greater productivity than it did; he believed the ability of his vernalized seeds to flower faster and produce more wheat would be passed on to the next generation of wheat seeds, thus causing vernalization to further amplify the process.

Support from [[Joseph Stalin]] gave Lysenko even more momentum and popularity.  In 1935, Lysenko compared his opponents in biology to the peasants who still resisted the Soviet government's collectivization strategy, saying that by opposing his theories the traditional geneticists were setting themselves against Marxism.  Stalin was in the audience when this speech was made, and he was the first one to stand and applaud, calling out "Bravo, Comrade Lysenko. Bravo."{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}  This event emboldened Lysenko and gave him and his ally Prezent free rein to slander the geneticists who still spoke out against him.  Many of Lysenkoism's opponents, such as his former mentor [[Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov]], were imprisoned or even executed because of Lysenko's and Prezent's denunciations.

On August 7, 1948, the  V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences announced that from that point on Lysenkoism would be taught as "the only correct theory". Soviet scientists were forced to denounce any work that contradicted Lysenko.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela N. Wrinch. "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2008893 Science and Politics in the U.S.S.R.: The Genetics Debate]". ''[[World Politics]]'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (Jul., 1951), pp. 486-519&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of Lysenko was denounced as "bourgeois" or "fascist", and analogous "non-bourgeois" theories also flourished in other fields in the Soviet academy at this time (see [[Japhetic theory]]; [[socialist realism]]). Perhaps the only opponents of Lysenkoism during Stalin's lifetime to escape liquidation were from the small community of Soviet [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicists]]: as [[Tony Judt]] has observed, "It is significant that Stalin left his nuclear physicists alone and never presumed to second guess ''their'' calculations. Stalin may well have been mad but he was not stupid."&lt;ref name="Judt"&gt;Judt, Tony. ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'', (New York: Penguin Books, 2006), p. 174n.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other countries==

Many other countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]] accepted Lysenkoism as the official "new biology" as well; however the acceptance of Lysenkoism was not uniform in communist countries. In Poland, all geneticists except for [[Wacław Gajewski]]&lt;ref name="gaj"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|year=1990|volume=65|issue=4|author=Gajewski W.|title=Lysenkoism in Poland|doi=10.1086/416949|pages=423–34|pmid=2082404}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed Lysenkoism. Even though Gajewski was not allowed contact with students, he was allowed to continue his scientific work at the Warsaw botanical garden. Lysenkoism was then rapidly rejected starting from 1956&lt;ref name="gaj"/&gt; and modern genetics research departments were formed, including the first department of genetics headed by Wacław Gajewski, which was started at the [[Warsaw University]] in 1958.

[[Czechoslovakia]] adopted Lysenkoism in 1949. [[Jaroslav Kříženecký]] (1896–1964) was one of the prominent Czechoslovak geneticists opposing Lysenkoism, and when he criticized Lysenkoism in his lectures, he was dismissed from the Agricultural University in 1949 for "serving the established capitalistic system, considering himself superior to the working class, and being hostile to the democratic order of the people", and imprisoned in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|last=Orel|first=Vitezslav|title=Jaroslav Kříženecký (1896-1964), Tragic Victim of Lysenkoism in Czechoslovakia|volume=67|issue=4|pages=487–494|year=1992|jstor=2832019|doi=10.1086/417797}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, he was appointed head of the newly established [[Gregor Mendel]] department in the [[Moravian Museum]] in [[Brno]], the city in which Gregor Mendel pursued his early experiments on inheritance and formulated the laws of [[Mendelian inheritance]].

In the [[German Democratic Republic]], although Lysenkoism was taught at some of the universities, it had very little impact on science due to the actions of a few scientists (for example, the geneticist and fierce critic of Lysenkoism, [[Hans Stubbe]]) and an open border to [[West Berlin]] research institutions. Nonetheless, Lysenkoist theories were found in schoolbooks until the dismissal of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(02)02677-X|title=How did East German genetics avoid Lysenkoism?|first=Rudolf|last=Hagemann|journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=18|issue=6|year=2002|pages=320–324|pmid=12044362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lysenkoism dominated [[Science in the People's Republic of China|Chinese science]] from 1949 until 1956, particularly during the [[Great Leap Forward]], when, during a genetics symposium opponents of Lysenkoism were permitted to freely criticize it and argue for Mendelian genetics.&lt;ref name="china"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lysenkoism in China|last=Li|first=CC|journal=Journal of Heredity|volume=78|issue=5|page=339|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the proceedings from the symposium, [[Tan Jiazhen]] is quoted as saying "Since [the] USSR started to criticize Lysenko, we have dared to criticize him too".&lt;ref name="china"/&gt; For a while, both schools were permitted to coexist, although the influence of the Lysenkoists remained large for several years.&lt;ref name="china"/&gt;

==Repercussions==

From 1934 to 1940, under Lysenko's admonitions and with Stalin's approval, many geneticists were executed (including [[Isaak Agol]], [[Solomon Levit]], [[Grigorii Levitskii]], [[Georgii Karpechenko]] and [[Georgii Nadson]]) or sent to [[labor camp]]s. The famous Soviet geneticist and president of the Agriculture Academy, [[Nikolai Vavilov]], was arrested in 1940 and died in prison in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Barry Mandel. "Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov: the explorer and plant collector". ''Economic Botany'', ''45'' (1991): 38–46.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Joseph Muller]] (and his teachings about genetics) was criticized as a bourgeois, capitalist, imperialist, and promoting fascism so he left the USSR, to return to the US via Republican Spain. In 1948, genetics was officially declared "a [[bourgeois pseudoscience]]";&lt;ref name=gar57&gt;{{cite book | last = Gardner | first = Martin | year = 1957 | title=Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science | publisher=Dover Books | location = New York | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwP3SGAUsnkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=gardner%20fads%20and%20fallacies&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | isbn = 9780486131627}}&lt;/ref&gt; all geneticists were fired from their jobs (some were also arrested), and all genetic research was discontinued.

Over 3,000 biologists were imprisoned, fired, or executed for attempting to oppose Lysenkoism at one time and overall, scientific research in genetics was effectively destroyed  until the death of Stalin in 1953.&lt;ref name="Perversion of Knowledge" /&gt; Due to Lysenkoism, crop yields in the USSR actually declined as well.&lt;ref name="Perversion of Knowledge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Soyfer Tagedy" /&gt;

At the end of 1952, the situation started changing, possibly due to Stalin taking offense to Lysenko's growing influence. Articles criticizing Lysenkoism were published in newspapers. However, the process of return to regular genetics slowed down in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s times, due to Lysenko showing him the supposed successes of an experimental agricultural complex. It once again became forbidden to criticize Lysenkoism, though it was now possible to express different views, and all geneticists were released or [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated posthumously]]. The ban was only waived in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="aleksandrovvya"&gt;''Александров, В. Я.'' [http://vivovoco.astronet.ru/VV/BOOKS/ALEXANDROV/CONTENT.HTM Трудные годы советской биологии: Записки современника].&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost alone among Western scientists, [[John Desmond Bernal]], Professor of [[Physics]] at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College, University of London]], and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], made an aggressive public defense of Lysenko and some years later gave an obituary of "Stalin as a Scientist". However, despite Bernal's endorsement, other members of Britain's scientific community retreated from open support of the Soviet Union.

== Neo-Lysenkoism ==
The word "Neo-Lysenkoism" has occasionally been used by [[Hereditarianism|hereditarian]] researchers, such as [[Roger Pearson (anthropologist)|Roger Pearson]] and [[Bernard Davis (biologist)|Bernard Davis]], as a pejorative term in the [[race and intelligence controversy|debates over race and intelligence]] and [[sociobiology]] to describe scientists supposedly minimizing the role of genes in shaping human behavior, such as [[Leon Kamin]], [[Richard Lewontin]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Barry Mehler]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Roger. "Activist Lysenkoism: The Case of Barry Mehler." In ''Race, Intelligence and Bias in Academe'' (Washington: Scott-Townsend Publishers, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Davis|first= Bernard|last2= |first2= |year= 1983|title= Neo-Lysenkoism, IQ, and the press|url= https://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/neo-lysenkoism-iq-and-the-press |journal= [[The Public Interest]]|publisher= [[National Affairs]]|volume= |issue= 73|pages= 41–59|doi= |accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The use of the term "neo-Lysenkoism" to describe [[criticism of evolutionary psychology]] have drawn criticism for misapplying the term "Lysenkoism" to things unrelated to actual Lysenkoism. For instance, Lysenko's views on inheritance of acquired characteristics presumed that individuals were born with characteristics acquired by their parents, not [[tabula rasa]]. This was integrated into Stalin's purges by presuming that simply having biological parents who were [[kulak|capitalists]] constituted a risk factor for becoming a dissident due to inheritance of acquired capitalist interest even if the children had not been postnatally raised capitalist. This is argued to show that the definition of [[nature versus nurture|"nature"]] as "anything before birth" that is used by [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] when they classify ideas of hormones before birth on [[prenatal hormones and sexual orientation|sexuality]] and [[empathizing-systemizing theory#Fetal testosterone|empathy]] as "biological" would also classify Lysenkoism as "biological" due to all three being prenatalist but not Mendelian genetic, remarking that accusations of social engineering in "nurture" models can simply transform into accusations of prenatal environment engineering in "womb environment" models. The usage of the term "neo-Lysenkoism" for models of evolution that contradict the Darwinian model of gradual and maximized reproductive success is criticized for missing the point that while it is uncertain whether or not Darwin read about Mendel's genetic discoveries, it is clear that Darwin did not integrate Mendelian genetics into his model of evolution and that Mendel read The Origin of Species and accepted evolution but did not consider his discoveries a solution to any problems with Darwinian evolution, that Mendelian genetics was the primary subject of suppression of modern biology under Lysenkoism, and that Mendelian genetics is actually a source of modern criticism of the maximization of reproductive success model of evolution as Mendelian models show that short term maximized reproductive success of specific genes deplete genetic variation and increase the long term risk of extinction (explaining higher extinction risks in more  [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] species as a functional similarity between  [[Bateman's principle]] and asexual reproduction) during environmental change which could not be predicted by premodern models of genetics such as those of Darwin and Lysenko alike. Contrary to the allegation of [[anti-psychiatry]] being neo-Lysenkoist, it is remarked that [[psychiatric medication]] was not suppressed in the Soviet Union under Lysenkoism, but the use of psychiatric drugs in the Soviet Union actually increased and was approved by the regime during the Lysenko era. It is cited that Communists considered [[biological psychiatry|chemical imbalance models of "mental illnesses"]] including but not limited to [[false consciousness|anti-communism in "working class" people in Communist countries]] more materialistic and in accordance with Marxist [[dialectical materialism]] than the idea of other cultural factors than class interest influencíng behavior that was considered idealist, and that this was used as an argument by officials in the Soviet Union for approving increased psychiatric medication.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Stanchevici (2017).

Each Manvantara is created and ruled by a specific Manu, who in turn is created by [[Brahma]], the Creator himself. Manu creates the world, and all its species during that period of time, each Manvantara lasts the lifetime of a Manu, upon whose death, Brahma creates another Manu to continue the cycle of Creation or Shristi, [[Vishnu]] on his part takes a new [[Avatar]], and also a new [[Indra]] and [[Saptarishi]]s are appointed.

Fourteen Manus and their respective Manvantaras constitute one [[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]], [[Aeon]], or a ‘Day of [[Brahma]]’, according to the [[Hindu Time Cycles]] and also the [[Hindu units of time|Vedic timeline]]. Thereafter, at the end of each Kalpa, there is a period - same as Kalpa - of dissolution or [[Pralaya]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/the/sd/sd2-1-18.htm Pralaya] [[The Secret Doctrine]] by [[H. P. Blavatsky]], Vol. 2, p. 307 THE SEVEN AND FOURTEEN MANUS.&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the world (earth and all life forms, but not the entire universe itself) is destroyed and lies in a state of rest, which is called the, ‘[[Night of Brahma]]’.

After that the creator, [[Brahma]] starts his cycle of creation all over again, in an endless cycle of creation followed by Absorption for which [[Shiva]], Hindu God of Absorption, and also renewal, is invoked towards the end of each such cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu/manu01.htm Manvantara] The Laws of Manu, ([[Manu Smriti]]), [[Sacred Books of the East]] Vol. 25, translated by [[Georg Bühler]], 1886, Chapter I, 79. The before-mentioned age of the gods, (or) twelve thousand (of their years), being multiplied by seventy-one, (constitutes what) is here named the period of a Manu (Manvantara). The Manvantaras, the creations and Absorptions (of the world, are) numberless; sporting, as it were, Brahman repeats this again and again.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 14 appointed Indras for each kalpa are: Visvabhuk, Vipascit, Sukirti, Sibi, Vibhu, Manobhuva, Ojasvin, the powerful Bali, Adbhuta, Santi, Ramya, Devavara, Vrsa Rtadhaman, Divassvamin and Suci. These are the fourteen sakras(indras).

==Duration of a Manvantara==
The actual duration of a Manvantara, according to the [[Vishnu Purana]] is seventy one times the number of years contained in the four [[Yuga]]s, with some additional years, adding up to 852,000 divine years, or 306,720,000 human years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp037.htm Measure of time], [[Vishnu Purana]], translated by [[Horace Hayman Wilson]], 1840, Book I: Chapter III. p.&amp;nbsp;26-28&lt;/ref&gt; Seven Rishis, certain (secondary) divinities, Indra, Manu, the king and his sons, are created and perish in one interval (called a '''Manvantara''') equal to seventy-one times the number of years contained in the four Yugas, with some additional years: this is the duration of the Manu, the (attendant) divinities, and the rest, which is equal to 852,000 divine years, or to 306,720,000 years of mortals, independent of the additional period. Fourteen times this period constitutes a Bráhma day, that is, a day of Brahmá; the term (Bráhma) being the derivative form. The Brahma life span is 100 Brahma varshas. The following table will illustrate clearly the link to our years and Brahma years.

===Sub-divisions===
1 human year (in [[Hindu calendar]]) = 1 [[Deva Ahoratra]] for God (1 day and 1 night)

360 [[Deva Ahoratra]]s = 1 [[Deva Vatsara]]

12,000 [[Deva Vatsara]] = 1 [[Chaturyuga]]

(12,000 [[Deva Vatsara]]s are defined as, 4,800 [[Deva Vatsara]]s of [[satya yuga]], 3,600 [[Deva Vatsara]]s of [[Treta Yuga]], 2,400 [[Deva Vatsara]]s of [[Dvapara Yuga]] and 1,200 [[Deva Vatsara]]s of [[Kali Yuga]] (which is 1,200 * 360 = 432,000 human years); summing up to 12000)

'''71 [[Chaturyuga]]s = 1 Manvantaram''' (1 life span of [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]])

'''14 Manvantaras = 1 [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]''' (1 day of [[Brahma]])

2 Kalpas = 1 day + 1 [[Night of Brahma|Brahma ratra]]

360 days of Brahma = 1 [[Brahma varsha]]

The Rishi are seers who know, and by their knowledge are the makers of [[shastra]] and "see" all mantras. The word comes from the root rish Rishati-prapnoti sarvvang mantrang jnanena pashyati sangsaraparangva, etc. The seven great Rishi or saptarshi of the first manvantara are [[Marichi]], [[Atri]], [[Angiras (sage)|Angiras]], [[Pulaha]], [[Kratu]], [[Pulastya]], and [[Vashista]]. In other manvantara there are other [[saptarshi]]. In the present manvantara the seven are [[Kashyapa]] , [[Atri]], [[Vashista]], [[Vishvamitra]], [[Gautama]], [[Jamadagni]], [[Bharadvaja]].

Svayambhuva Manu, along with his wife, Satarupa, went into the forest to practice austerities on the bank of the River Sunanda. At some point in time, Rakshasas attacked them, but Yajna, accompanied by his sons the Yamas and the demigods, killed them.

===Comparison to the Age of the Universe from Modern Astronomy===

Modern scientific astronomy estimates the [[Age of the universe|Age of the Universe]] as around 13 Billion years (13 * 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years). Conversion of 1 day of [[Brahma]] into human years yields 8.58816 * 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years (derived as 2 kalpas * 14 Manvantaras * 71 Chaturyugas * 12,000 Deva vatsaras * 360 human years). According to Vedas, there are 504 000 Manus manifested during the lifetime of one Brahmā (311,040,000,000,000 human Earthly years), 5040 Manus in one year of Brahma, and 420 Manus in one month of Brahma.

'''Maze generation [[algorithm]]s''' are automated methods for the creation of [[maze]]s.

[[Image:Prim Maze.svg|right|frame|This maze generated by modified version of [[Prim's algorithm]], below.]]

== Graph theory based methods ==

[[File:Graph based maze animation.gif|thumb|Animation of Graph theory based method]]

A maze can be generated by starting with a predetermined arrangement of cells (most commonly a rectangular grid but other arrangements are possible) with wall sites between them. This predetermined arrangement can be considered as a [[connected graph]] with the edges representing possible wall sites and the nodes representing cells. The purpose of the maze generation algorithm can then be considered to be making a subgraph in which it is challenging to find a route between two particular nodes.

If the subgraph is not [[connected graph|connected]], then there are regions of the graph that are wasted because they do not contribute to the search space.  If the graph contains loops, then there may be multiple paths between the chosen nodes.  Because of this, maze generation is often approached as generating a random [[spanning tree (mathematics)|spanning tree]].  Loops, which can confound naive maze solvers, may be introduced by adding random edges to the result during the course of the algorithm.

The animation shows the maze generation steps for a 
graph that is not on a rectangular grid.
First, the computer creates a random [[planar graph]] G
shown in blue, and its [[Dual graph|dual]] F
shown in yellow. Second, computer traverses F using a chosen
algorithm, such as a depth-first search, coloring the path red.
During the traversal, whenever a red edge crosses over a blue edge,
the blue edge is removed.
Finally, when all vertices of F have been visited, F is erased
and two edges from G, one for the entrance and one for the exit, are removed.

=== Depth-first search ===
[[File:Depth-First Search Animation.ogv|thumb|right|Animation of generator's thinking process using Depth-First Search]]

This algorithm is a randomized version of the [[depth-first search]] algorithm. Frequently implemented with a stack, this approach is one of the simplest ways to generate a maze using a computer. Consider the space for a maze being a large grid of cells (like a large chess board), each cell starting with four walls. Starting from a random cell, the computer then selects a random neighbouring cell that has not yet been visited. The computer removes the wall between the two cells and marks the new cell as visited, and adds it to the stack to facilitate backtracking. The computer continues this process, with a cell that has no unvisited neighbours being considered a dead-end. When at a dead-end it backtracks through the path until it reaches a cell with an unvisited neighbour, continuing the path generation by visiting this new, unvisited cell (creating a new junction). This process continues until every cell has been visited, causing the computer to backtrack all the way back to the beginning cell. We can be sure every cell is visited.

As given above this algorithm involves deep recursion which may cause stack overflow issues on some computer architectures. The algorithm can be rearranged into a loop by storing backtracking information in the maze itself. This also provides a quick way to display a solution, by starting at any given point and backtracking to the beginning.

[[File:Horizontally Influenced Depth-First Search Generated Maze.png|thumb|right|Horizontal Passage Bias]]

Mazes generated with a depth-first search have a low branching factor and contain many long corridors, because the algorithm explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

=== Recursive backtracker ===
[[File:Hexamaze.webm|thumb|Recursive backtracker on a hexagonal grid]]
The depth-first search algorithm of maze generation is frequently implemented using [[backtracking]]:

# Make the initial cell the current cell and mark it as visited
# While there are unvisited cells
##  If the current cell has any neighbours which have not been visited
###  Choose randomly one of the unvisited neighbours
###  Push the current cell to the stack
###  Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen cell
###  Make the chosen cell the current cell and mark it as visited
## Else if stack is not empty
###  Pop a cell from the stack
###  Make it the current cell

=== Randomized Kruskal's algorithm ===
[[File:KruskalGeneratedMaze.webm|thumb|An animation of generating a 30 by 20 maze using Kruskal's algorithm.]]
This algorithm is a randomized version of [[Kruskal's algorithm]].

# Create a list of all walls, and create a set for each cell, each containing just that one cell.
# For each wall, in some random order:
## If the cells divided by this wall belong to distinct sets:
### Remove the current wall.
### Join the sets of the formerly divided cells.

There are several data structures that can be used to model the sets of cells.  An efficient implementation using a [[disjoint-set data structure]] can perform each union and find operation on two sets in nearly constant [[amortized time]] (specifically, &lt;math&gt;O(\alpha(V))&lt;/math&gt; time; &lt;math&gt;\alpha(x) &lt; 5&lt;/math&gt; for any plausible value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;), so the running time of this algorithm is essentially proportional to the number of walls available to the maze.

It matters little whether the list of walls is initially randomized or if a wall is randomly chosen from a nonrandom list, either way is just as easy to code.

Because the effect of this algorithm is to produce a minimal spanning tree from a graph with equally weighted edges, it tends to produce regular patterns which are fairly easy to solve.

=== Randomized Prim's algorithm ===
[[File:MAZE 30x20 Prim.ogv|thumb|upright=1.6|An animation of generating a 30 by 20 maze using Prim's algorithm.]]
This algorithm is a randomized version of [[Prim's algorithm]].

# Start with a grid full of walls.
# Pick a cell, mark it as part of the maze. Add the walls of the cell to the wall list.
# While there are walls in the list:
## Pick a random wall from the list. If only one of the two cells that the wall divides is visited, then:
### Make the wall a passage and mark the unvisited cell as part of the maze.
### Add the neighboring walls of the cell to the wall list.
## Remove the wall from the list.

It will usually be relatively easy to find the way to the starting cell, but hard to find the way anywhere else.

Note that simply running classical Prim's on a graph with random edge weights would create mazes stylistically identical to Kruskal's, because they are both minimal spanning tree algorithms.  Instead, this algorithm introduces stylistic variation because the edges closer to the starting point have a lower effective weight.

==== Modified version ====
Although the classical Prim's algorithm keeps a list of edges, for maze generation we could instead maintain a list of adjacent cells.  If the randomly chosen cell has multiple edges that connect it to the existing maze, select one of these edges at random.  This will tend to branch slightly more than the edge-based version above.

=== Wilson's algorithm ===
{{Main|Loop-erased random walk}}

All the above algorithms have biases of various sorts: depth-first search is biased toward long corridors, while Kruskal's/Prim's algorithms are biased toward many short dead ends. Wilson's algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, generates an ''unbiased'' sample from the [[discrete uniform distribution|uniform distribution]] over all mazes, using [[loop-erased random walk]]s.

We begin the algorithm by initializing the maze with one cell chosen arbitrarily. Then we start at a new cell chosen arbitrarily, and perform a random walk until we reach a cell already in the maze—however, if at any point the random walk reaches its own path, forming a loop, we erase the loop from the path before proceeding. When the path reaches the maze, we add it to the maze. Then we perform another loop-erased random walk from another arbitrary starting cell, repeating until all cells have been filled.

This procedure remains unbiased no matter which method we use to arbitrarily choose starting cells. So we could always choose the first unfilled cell in (say) left-to-right, top-to-bottom order for simplicity.

Mazes can be created with ''recursive division'', an algorithm which works as follows: Begin with the maze's space with no walls. Call this a chamber. Divide the chamber with a randomly positioned wall (or multiple walls) where each wall contains a randomly positioned passage opening within it. Then recursively repeat the process on the subchambers until all chambers are minimum sized. This method results in mazes with long straight walls crossing their space, making it easier to see which areas to avoid.

[[File:Recursive maze.gif|thumb|right|Recursive Maze generation]]

For example, in a rectangular maze, build at random points two walls that are perpendicular to each other. These two walls divide the large chamber into four smaller chambers separated by four walls. Choose three of the four walls at random, and open a one cell-wide hole at a random point in each of the three. Continue in this manner recursively, until every chamber has a width of one cell in either of the two directions.

== Simple algorithms ==
[[File:Prim Maze 3D.svg|right|thumb|300px|3D version of Prim's algorithm. Vertical layers are labeled 1 through 4 from bottom to top. Stairs up are indicated with "/"; stairs down with "\", and stairs up-and-down with "x". Source code is included with the image description.]]
Other algorithms exist that require only enough memory to store one line of a 2D maze or one plane of a 3D maze. They prevent loops by storing which cells in the current line are connected through cells in the previous lines, and never remove walls between any two cells already connected.

Most maze generation algorithms require maintaining relationships between cells within it, to ensure the end result will be solvable. Valid simply connected mazes can however be generated by focusing on each cell independently. A binary tree maze is a standard orthogonal maze where each cell always has a passage leading up or leading left, but never both. To create a binary tree maze, for each cell flip a coin to decide whether to add a passage leading up or left. Always pick the same direction for cells on the boundary, and the end result will be a valid simply connected maze that looks like a [[binary tree]], with the upper left corner its root.

A related form of flipping a coin for each cell is to create an image using a random mix of forward slash and backslash characters. This doesn't generate a valid simply connected maze, but rather a selection of closed loops and unicursal passages.  (The manual for the [[Commodore 64]] presents a BASIC program using this algorithm, but using [[PETSCII]] diagonal line graphic characters instead for a smoother graphic appearance.)

== Cellular automaton algorithms ==
Certain types of [[cellular automata]] can be used to generate mazes.&lt;ref name=ca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Maze|title=Maze - LifeWiki |author=[http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Nathaniel Nathaniel Johnston]|date=21 August 2010 |publisher=LifeWiki |accessdate=1 March 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two well-known such cellular automata, Maze and Mazectric, have rulestrings B3/S12345 and B3/S1234.&lt;ref name=ca /&gt; In the former, this means that cells survive from one generation to the next if they have at least one and at most five [[Moore neighbourhood|neighbours]]. In the latter, this means that cells survive if they have one to four neighbours. If a cell has exactly three neighbours, it is born. It is similar to [[Conway's Game of Life]] in that patterns that do not have a living cell adjacent to 1, 4, or 5 other living cells in any generation will behave identically to it.&lt;ref name=ca /&gt; However, for large patterns, it behaves very differently from Life.&lt;ref name=ca /&gt;

For a random starting pattern, these maze-generating cellular automata will evolve into complex mazes with well-defined walls outlining corridors. Mazecetric, which has the rule B3/S1234 has a tendency to generate longer and straighter corridors compared with Maze, with the rule B3/S12345.&lt;ref name=ca /&gt; Since these cellular automaton rules are [[deterministic]], each maze generated is uniquely determined by its random starting pattern. This is a significant drawback since the mazes tend to be relatively predictable.

Like some of the graph-theory based methods described above, these cellular automata typically generate mazes from a single starting pattern; hence it will usually be relatively easy to find the way to the starting cell, but harder to find the way anywhere else.

==Python code example==
Example implementation of a variant of Prim's algorithm in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]/[[NumPy]]. Prim's algorithm above starts with a grid full of walls and grows a single component of pathable tiles. In this example, we start with an open grid and grow multiple components of walls.

This algorithm works by creating n (density) islands of length p (complexity). An island is created by choosing a random starting point with odd coordinates, then a random direction is chosen. If the cell two steps in the direction is free, then a wall is added at both one step and two steps in this direction. The process is iterated for n steps for this island. p islands are created. n and p are expressed as float to adapt them to the size of the maze. With a low complexity, islands are very small and the maze is easy to solve. With low density, the maze has more "big empty rooms".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10630">'''Negative consequentialism''' is a version of the ethical theory [[consequentialism]], which is "one of the major theories of [[normative ethics]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peterson|2013|page=vii}}: "Consequentialism is one of the major theories of normative ethics."&lt;/ref&gt; Like other versions of consequentialism, negative consequentialism holds that moral right and wrong depend only on the value of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=19}}: "The whole family of utilitarian theories is captured by the equation: Utilitarianism = Consequentialism (nothing but the values of outcomes matter for the rightness of actions) + Welfarism (nothing but well-being matters for the value of outcomes)."&lt;/ref&gt; That is, for negative and other versions of consequentialism, questions such as "what should I do?" and "what kind of person should I be?" are answered only based on consequences. Negative consequentialism differs from other versions of consequentialism by giving greater weight in moral deliberations to what is bad (e.g. suffering or injustice) than what is good (e.g. happiness or justice).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “Negative consequentialism is the version of consequentialism that focuses on reducing harms. It has this focus because it assumes that there aren’t things of positive intrinsic value, while there are things of negative intrinsic value. Therefore, in deciding on whether to act in a particular way, a negative consequentialist would consider what harms it would cause, eliminate, increase or decrease.”
{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}: “Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family.”
{{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: “NU [negative utilitarianism] comes in several flavours, which I will outline later, but the basic thrust is that an act is morally right if and only if it leads to less suffering than any available alternative. Unlike Classical Utilitarianism, positive experiences such as pleasure or happiness are either given no weight, or at least a lot less weight. (In what follows, I use the word 'happiness' to stand in for whatever aspects of life might be thought to have positive value).”
&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific type of consequentialism is [[utilitarianism]], which says that the consequences that matter are those that affect well-being.{{sfn|Bykvist|2009|page=19}} Consequentialism is broader than utilitarianism in that consequentialism can say that the value of outcomes depend on other things than well-being; for example, justice, fairness, and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooker|Mason|Miller|2000|page=2}}: “Other consequentialist theories take other things to be valuable, for example justice, fairness, and equality.”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Negative utilitarianism]] is thus a form of negative consequentialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “One form of negative consequentialism is negative utilitarianism.”&lt;/ref&gt; Much more has been written explicitly about [[negative utilitarianism]] than directly about negative consequentialism, although since negative utilitarianism is a form of negative consequentialism, everything that has been written about negative utilitarianism is by definition about a specific (utilitarian) version of negative consequentialism. Similarly to how there are many variations of consequentialism and negative utilitarianism, there are many versions of negative consequentialism, for example negative [[prioritarianism]] and negative consequentialist [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “According to negative consequentialism such as negative prioritarianism, negative utilitarianism, and negative consequentialist egalitarianism...”&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. E. Moore]]'s ethics can be said to be a negative consequentialism (more precisely, a consequentialism with a negative utilitarian component), because he has been labeled a consequentialist,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaw|1995|page=46}}: “Moore is indeed a consequentialist.”&lt;/ref&gt; and he said that "consciousness of intense pain is, by itself, a great evil"{{sfn|Moore|1951 |p=213}} whereas "the mere consciousness of pleasure, however intense, does not, ''by itself'', appear to be a ''great'' good, even if it has some slight intrinsic value. In short, pain (if we understand by this expression, the consciousness of pain) appears to be a far worse evil than pleasure is a good."{{sfn|Moore|1951 |p=212}} Moore wrote in the first half of the 20th century before any of the terms 'consequentialism,' 'negative utilitarianism' or 'negative consequentialism' were coined, and he did not use the term 'negative consequentialism' himself.&lt;ref&gt;Moore died in 1958; the same year that both of the terms 'consequentialism' and 'negative utilitarianism' seem to have been coined. According to {{harvnb|Spielthenner|2005|page=231}}, "It seems that the term 'consequentialism' has been coined by E. Anscombe in her influential article 'Modern Moral Philosophy' (1958)." {{harvnb|Smart|1958}} is widely considered to have coined the term 'negative utilitarianism.'&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Moore, [[Ingemar Hedenius]] defended a consequentialism that could be called negative (or could be said to have a negative utilitarian component) because he assigned more importance to suffering than to happiness. Hedenius saw the worst in life, such as infernalistic suffering, as so evil that calculations of happiness versus suffering becomes unnecessary; he did not see that such evil could be counterbalanced by any good, such as happiness.{{sfn|Petersson|2009}}

Philosophy professor Clark Wolf defends "negative consequentialism as a component of a larger theory of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2009|page=360}}: "For a defence of a negative consequentialism as a component of a larger theory of justice, see Wolf (1999)." That is, see {{harvnb|Wolf|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Sinnott-Armstrong]] interprets [[Bernard Gert]]'s moral system as a "sophisticated form of negative objective universal public rule consequentialism."{{sfn|Sinnott-Armstrong|2002|p=147}} Jamie Mayerfeld argues for a strong duty to relieve suffering, which is consequentialist in form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayerfeld|1999|page=116}}: "The duty to relieve suffering, I have suggested, arises from the badness of suffering." {{harvnb|Mayerfeld|1999|page=117}}: "The duty to relieve suffering is consequentialist in form."&lt;/ref&gt; He says that "suffering is more bad than happiness is good,"{{sfn|Mayerfeld|1999|p=136}} and that "the lifelong bliss of many people, no matter how many, cannot justify our allowing the lifelong torture of one."{{sfn|Mayerfeld|1999|p=178}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2721">[[File:ECEF ENU Longitude Latitude relationships.svg|thumb|The east north up (ENU) local tangent plane is similar to NED, except for swapping 'down' for 'up' and x for y.]]
'''North east down''' ('''NED'''), also known as '''local tangent plane''' ('''LTP'''), is a geographical coordinate system for representing [[State vector (geographical)|state vectors]] that is commonly used in [[aviation]].  It consists of three numbers: one represents the position along the northern axis, one along the eastern axis, and one represents vertical position.  Down is chosen as opposed to up in order to comply with the [[right-hand rule]].  The origin of this coordinate system is usually chosen to be a point on the surface of the geoid below the aircraft's center of gravity. However, care must be taken since, if the aircraft is accelerating (turning or accelerating linearly), then the NED coordinates are no longer inertial coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Unmanned Rotorcraft Systems|last = Cai|first = Guowei|publisher = Springer|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-85729-634-4|location = |pages = 27|last2 = Chen|first2 = Ben M.|last3 = Lee|first3 = Tong Heng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NED coordinates are similar to [[ECEF]] in that they're Cartesian, however they can be more convenient due to the relatively small numbers involved, and also because of the intuitive axes. NED and ECEF coordinates can be related with the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Unmanned Rotorcraft Systems|last = Cai|first = Guowei|publisher = Springer|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-85729-634-4|location = |pages = 32|last2 = Chen|first2 = Ben M.|last3 = Lee|first3 = Tong Heng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf p_{\mathrm{NED}} = R^T (\mathbf p_{\mathrm{ECEF}} - \mathbf p_{\mathrm{Ref}})
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_{\mathrm{NED}}&lt;/math&gt; is a 3D position in a NED system, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_{\mathrm{ECEF}}&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding ECEF position, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_{\mathrm{Ref}}&lt;/math&gt; is the reference ECEF position (where the local tangent plane originates), and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[rotation matrix]] whose columns are the north, east, and down axes. &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; may be defined conveniently from the latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_{\mathrm{Ref}}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
   R = \begin{bmatrix}
      -\sin(\phi) \cos(\lambda) &amp; -\sin(\lambda) &amp; -\cos(\phi) \cos(\lambda) \\
      -\sin(\phi) \sin(\lambda) &amp;  \cos(\lambda) &amp; -\cos(\phi) \sin(\lambda) \\
      \cos(\phi) &amp; 0 &amp; -\sin(\phi)

Keep the Reference/Citation Format. PLEASE! I both need this for my class assignment and it took forever to get it like this. Thank You.
Also when you go down to the Reference list you will see that there are letter markers so that you can just add your reference (please keep it in APA format) wherever it belongs without having to look all over for the area.

In relation to [[psychology]], '''pair by association''' is the action of associating a stimulus with an arbitrary idea or object, eliciting a response, usually emotional. This is done by repeatedly pairing the stimulus with the arbitrary object.

For example, repeatedly pairing images of beautiful women in bathing suits elicits a sexual response in most men. Advertising agencies repeatedly pair products with attractive women in television commercials with the intention of eliciting an emotional or [[sexually aroused]] response in the consumer. This causes the consumer to be more likely to buy the product than when presented with a similar product without such an association.

==Hippocampus==
The [[Hippocampus|hippocampal area]], beyond its importance in [[episodic memory]] is in part responsible in the creation and storage of [[Association (psychology)|associations]] in the memory, especially for item associations.&lt;ref name="Madan et al" /&gt; Furthermore, as stated by Gilbert &amp; Kesner,&lt;ref name="Gilbert &amp; Kesner" /&gt; the associations that are created are those that might be ''“critical”'' in paired-associative learning. Through studies on rats, it has been found that lesions to the hippocampus lead to object-place associative learning impairments.&lt;ref name="Gilbert &amp; Kesner" /&gt; The findings of hippocampal damage that lead to [[Impaired|impairments]] in the association between object-place as Gilbert &amp; Kesner state have been seen in not only rodents but also non-human primates and humans {{harv|2004}}. It should be noted that previously learned associations made before the damage to the hippocampal area were not affected with impairment. Gilbert &amp; Kesner have suggested in their work that this ability to still recall previously stored associations may be due to modified synapses in an ''“auto associative network”''.&lt;ref name="Gilbert &amp; Kesner" /&gt;

==Pair by Association Task==
Paired association learning can be defined as a system of learning in which items (such as words, letters, numbers, symbols etc.) are matched so that presentation of one member of the pair will [[Recall (memory)#Cued recall|cue the recall]] of the other member.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Merriam-Webster's|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this [[learning]] which constitutes the basics in a paired-associate task. These tasks can be divided into the following: visual-visual, verbal-verbal, and visual-verbal. In visual-visual both members of the pair are in a visual form (e.g. the picture of a blue circle paired with that of a picture of a yellow triangle). The verbal-verbal is when the members of the pair are both verbally presented (e.g. listening to the word cat followed by the word hat spoken to a participant). The last form, visual-verbal is when one member of the pair is spoken out loud while the other member is presented in a visual form (e.g. listening to the word box and seeing a picture of a house). It should be noted that visual [[Learning#Associative learning|associative learning]] has a positive association with age. In school age children, their visual association ability grows in conjunction with their age; younger children made more errors while older children made less.&lt;ref name="Harel et al" /&gt;
 
The paired association task broken down to its basics is: a stimuli, response, and the consequence of the cue association. This is best seen in a study where Naya, Sakai, &amp; Miyashita&lt;ref name="Naya et al" /&gt; performed one version of the task on monkeys. In the study a primate was given a visual-visual paired-associate task where they were shown all the pairs in the set. Then after a long delay they displayed one picture of a pair to the primate. When the correct picture was paired by the monkey, showing that the pictures were cueing the response, they were given rewards in the form of food.&lt;ref name="Naya et al" /&gt; What this study shows is that it is possible for associations to occur for two previously unrelated items. The monkeys showed they had actually remembered what was shown to them. In visual associative learning, the efficiency of the participant/subject in making these connections actually will decrease as the “memory load” increases.&lt;ref name="Harel et al" /&gt; The more items/the higher the complexity that one has to keep in their memory leads to poorer performance on paired associative learning tasks.
 
Gluck, Mercado, and Myers&lt;ref name="Gluck et al" /&gt; explain how paired-association is possibly tied to [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]] rather than [[Recall (memory)|retrieval]]. In the study presented by Gluck et al.,&lt;ref name="Gluck et al" /&gt; there was a paired associates test where after studying word pairs the participants were presented with one word from the pair and required to recall the match there was a noticeable difference in accuracy between the young adult and older adults. At the start of the study each pair was shown for 15 seconds, in this the older adults had much worse performance; their recall abilities paled in comparison to the younger adults. This however did change when the time was doubled to that of 30 seconds; here the elderly were able to have a much improved performance level. It is an accepted understanding that in associative learning there is a negative regression, as one ages their performance levels decrease.&lt;ref name="Lee et al" /&gt; The regression remains even after addressing the possible interfering variables such as attention or spatial memory.

===Performance on Task=== 
When the paired association task is performed, there are ways in which the performance in the task can be either negatively or positively affected. Associations suffer when an item is shared between associations; double function pairs such as AB and BC will be harder to recall later than control pairs such as AB and CD.&lt;ref name="Caplan et al" /&gt; As Caplan et al.,&lt;ref name="Caplan et al" /&gt; state double function pairs create what is called association ambiguity, a sharing of a common member in the pair, which leads to interference. The brain has difficulty in processing the pairs to the point that in some cases one pair will be remembered at the expense of the other pair. An example is in the two word pairs CAR-HORN and CAR-DOG. In this word pair a participant would remember 1 pair primarily while forgetting the other pair. Memory for ambiguous pairs will often suffer compared to unambiguous pairs in both situations of e.g. AB and BC or AB and AC.&lt;ref name="Caplan et al" /&gt; One matter that is not affected is a cue recall in either direction, forward (cue A, recall B) or backward (cue B, recall A); either direction will not affect the accuracy of the recall.&lt;ref name="Caplan et al" /&gt; This also holds true for double function pairs.
 
Additionally, there is ongoing research into the effects [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]]/polystimulant use has on paired-associate task/learning. In a study by Gallagher et al.,&lt;ref name="Gallagher et al" /&gt; it was found that those who used ecstasy/polydrugs had in general more false positive responses, clicking yes (in agreement) when asked if a word pair had been previously presented even if the reality was false, compared to non-users. It was proposed that because creating the association between word pairs requires executive resources, which has been known to be hampered in ecstasy users. This is what has prevented the binding of word pairs.&lt;ref name="Gallagher et al" /&gt; However, as stated by the author, it is not possible to fully attribute these deficits in the task, but it bears noting that there are differences occurring.
 
An association can be improved with the aid of the production effect which is a finding where speaking a word out loud leads to enhancements in memory compared to reading a word silently.&lt;ref name="Putnam et al" /&gt; The production effect is not limited to speaking a word aloud; mouthing, writing, whispering, spelling, and typing all lead to an enhanced memory though the level will not be the same as reading aloud. In accordance with Putnam et al.,&lt;ref name="Putnam et al" /&gt; the enhancement in recall in the production effect is because reading aloud creates a more distinctive memory in the encoding process. Moreover, the production effect improved not only pair recognition but also paired-associate recall. These findings hint at a positive link between the production effect and the association between pairs in relation to paired-associate task/learning; using one of the elements in the production effect leads to improved encoding of associations.&lt;ref name="Putnam et al" /&gt;

==Verbal behavior==
[[Behaviorists]] will often use paired association tests to determine the strength of [[verbal behavior]], in particular, [[B.F Skinner]]'s concept of the verbal response class called intraverbals.&lt;ref name="Moran Verplanck" /&gt;

First described in 1976 as "pathological alignment", parental alienation refers to a situation in which a child unreasonably rejects a non-custodial parent.&lt;ref name = Bow2009&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bow | first = JN |author2=Gould JW |author3=Flens JR | year = 2009 | title = Examining Parental Alienation in Child Custody Cases: A Survey of Mental Health and Legal Professionals | journal = The American Journal of Family Therapy | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–145 | doi = 10.1080/01926180801960658|url=http://www.drjamesrflens.com/_Bow_et_al.__2009___Examing_parental_alienation_in_child_custody_case.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Richard A.

A survey of literature suggests that alienating behaviors by both parents are common in high-conflict divorces.&lt;ref name = Bow2009/&gt; Rejected parents tend to lose a sense of warmth and empathy with the child. As a result, the rejected parent may become passive, depressed, anxious, and withdrawn – characteristics that may encourage further rejection. The parent that the child aligns with (the aligned parent) may engage in alienating behaviors, including undermining the other parent. These behaviors may be conscious and deliberate or may reflect a lack of awareness on the effect of the actions on the children.  Direct alienating behaviors occur when one parent actively undermines the other parent, such as making derogatory remarks about the other parent, telling the child that the other parent is responsible for the separation, or telling the child that the other parent is the cause of financial difficulties. Indirect alienation behaviors occur when one parent fails to support access or contact with the other parent or tacitly accepts the child's negative behaviour and comments towards the other parent.&lt;ref name = Bow2009/&gt;&lt;ref name = Bala2007/&gt;

=== Causes ===
The causes of alienation can be divided into two broad categories,
*Realistic estrangement, in which a parent's harmful or abusive behaviors or substance abuse result in the alienation of the child;&lt;ref name=acorn/&gt; and
*Pathological alienation, in which the alienation results from pathological aspects of the child's family relationships, and is not a rational response to the behavior of the alienated parent.
Realistic estrangement is a different phenomenon from "pathological alienation".  The former is an understandable refusal by a child to see an [[child abuse|abusive]] parent, while the latter is emotionally harmful and unjustified.&lt;ref name = Bala2007/&gt;

=== Symptoms ===
Symptoms associated with parental alienation include:
*The child engages in a pattern of "denigration" against a targeted parent for unjustified reasons and uses "frivolous rationalizations" that are "disproportionate" to the circumstances.&lt;ref name=inq/&gt;
*The child may display a "complete lack of ambivalence" wherein the rejected parent is viewed as "all bad" and the favored parent is viewed as "all good."&lt;ref name=echo/&gt; This lack of ambivalence is associated with "[[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]]."&lt;ref name="newsweek2014"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bernet et al.

==Theories==
Some researchers emphasized the role of an alienating parent, termed variously the "programming" parent or "embittered-chaotic parent",&lt;ref name = Bow2009/&gt; while other researchers have focused on the "alienated child", and the relationship dynamics that contribute to the alienation.&lt;ref name="Bala2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Bala|first = N|author2 = Fidler B|author3 = Goldberg D|author4 = Houston C|year = 2007|journal = Queens Law Journal|volume = 33|title = Alienated Children and Parental Separation: Legal Responses from Canada's Family Courts|pages = 79–138|url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/queen33&amp;div=7&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaffe2002&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaffe |first=PG |author2=Lemon NKD |author3=Poisson SE  |title=Child Custody &amp; Domestic Violence |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |year=2002 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bbZmp7ALOq4C&amp;pg=PA52 52–54] |isbn=978-0-7619-1826-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of relationship dynamics, alienation is seen as a breakdown of [[attachment (psychology)|attachment]] between parent and child that may be caused by a variety factors. These researchers have proposed a more complex analysis, in which all family members may play a role in the alienation. This "systems-based" view acknowledges that a child may be alienated from one parent with no alienation programming from the other parent.&lt;ref name = Bow2009/&gt;&lt;ref name = Bala2007/&gt; The behaviors of all family members, including those of the alienated parent, may lead to [[family dysfunction]] and the rejection of a parent.&lt;ref name= Ackerman2001&gt;{{cite book |author=Ackerman MJ |title=Clinician's guide to child custody evaluations |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |location=New York |year=2001 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=q9E_rg94Cs4C&amp;pg=PA73 73–82] |isbn=978-0-471-39260-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waldron1996&gt;{{cite journal |last=Waldron |first=KH |author2=Joanis DE |url= http://fact.on.ca/Info/pas/waldron.htm |title=Understanding and Collaboratively Treating Parental Alienation Syndrome |journal=American Journal of Family Law |volume=10 |pages= 121–133 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this approach, when a child is estranged from a parent it is necessary to evaluate all contributing factors and all possible remedies to the estrangement.&lt;ref name=Bala2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sparta2006&gt;{{cite book |last=Sparta |first=SN |author2=Koocher GP |title=Forensic Mental Health Assessment of Children and Adolescents |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2006 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6bmBtQ2Zl-IC&amp;pg=PA83 83], [https://books.google.com/books?id=6bmBtQ2Zl-IC&amp;pg=PA219 219–221] |isbn=978-0-19-514584-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and insensitive.&lt;ref name=echo/&gt;&lt;ref name=BakerSurviving/&gt; This encouragement to complain manipulates the child into the role of victim without the child's awareness,&lt;ref name=stines2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=BakerSurviving/&gt; allowing the parent to move into the protector role, forcing the other parent into the "inadequate" parent role, and leaving no trace of what happened for bystanders who only see the child acting as a "victim".&lt;ref name=echo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenfield2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek2014/&gt; Over time, the combined effects of growing closer to the alienating parent through this complaining process&lt;ref name=echo/&gt; and growing further from the rejected parent as the result of focusing on negative things about the other parent cause the child to reject their other parent as being inadequate.

===Treatment===
The success of restoring the child's [[Attachment in children|attachment]] to their parent hinges on first protecting the child from harmful parenting.&lt;ref name=acorn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenfield2015/&gt; A study suggests that the child does not experience this protection as being traumatic.&lt;ref name=Greenfield2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kruk2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kruk|first1=Edward|title=Recent Advances in Understanding Parental Alienation: Implications of Parental Alienation Research for Family-Based Intervention|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/co-parenting-after-divorce/201507/recent-advances-in-understanding-parental-alienation|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one theory,&lt;ref name=LudmerIntervention/&gt; when symptoms of alienation are present, structured intervention is likely to be more effective than traditional counseling. Structured intervention involves:
* developing critical thinking to overcome rejection and enmeshment dynamics
* resetting the child's place in the family hierarchy
* addressing the family system
* temporarily protecting the child from the bad parenting practices of the enmeshed parent.

Advocates of structured intervention argue that traditional counseling, based on the therapeutic alliance, is susceptible to:
* delays from a lack of milestones and schedules
* sabotage by a parent with an interest in making it fail
* exclusive focus on a child's feelings and complaints to the exclusion of addressing the family system
* the ineffectiveness of a parent apologizing for fabricated, exaggerated, or distorted complaints.

According to this theoretical formulation, "the pathology traditionally called ‘parental alienation' are manifestations of well-established forms of existing pathologies.”&lt;ref name=Pingitore2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenfield2015/&gt;

== Professional acceptance ==
The history of parental alienation reflects an evolution of its acceptance by professionals involved in custody cases. A 2009 survey of mental health and legal professionals found broad skepticism of the concept of parental alienation syndrome, and caution in relation to the concept of parental alienation.&lt;ref name = Bow2009/&gt;

===Mental health professionals===
Mental health professionals are reluctant to recognize so-called parental alienation syndrome.&lt;ref name = Bow2009/&gt; In the past, the American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on Parental Alienation Syndrome|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2008/01/pas-syndrome.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=7 October 2017|date=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have held a neutral view of parental alienation as a distinct syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;'Parental Alienation, DSM-5, and ICD-11: Response to Critics' William Bernet, MD and Amy J. L. Baker, PhD (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In anticipation of the fifth version of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], which was released in 2013, William Bernet argued for the inclusion of ''parental alienation disorder'', a diagnosis related to parental alienation. His conception makes reference to parental alienation and a variety of other descriptions of behaviors he believes represent the underlying concept of parental alienation disorder.&lt;ref name=Bernet2008&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bernet | first=W| title= Parental Alienation Disorder and DSM-V | journal = The American Journal of Family Therapy | volume = 36 | issue = 5 | year = 2008 | pages = 349–366 | doi = 10.1080/01926180802405513  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite lobbying by proponents,&lt;ref name="Rotstein2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10046/1036018-114.stm|title=Mental health professionals getting update on definitions|last=Rotstein|first=Gary|date=February 15, 2010 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |accessdate=2010-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2012, the proposal was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees Approves DSM-5-Diagnostic manual passes major milestone before May 2013 publication|url=http://dsmfacts.org/materials/american-psychiatric-association-board-of-trustees-approves-dsm-5/|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|date=1 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005021044/http://dsmfacts.org/materials/american-psychiatric-association-board-of-trustees-approves-dsm-5/|archivedate=5 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that elements of parental alienation are covered in the [[DSM-5]] under the diagnosis: "Parent-Child Relational Problem".&lt;ref name="bernetw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernet|first1=William|last2=Wamboldt|first2=Marianne Z.|last3=Narrow|first3=William E.|title=Child Affected by Parental Relationship Distress|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|date=July 2016|volume=55|issue=7|pages=571–579|url=http://www.kenniscentrum-kjp.nl/app/webroot/files/tmpwebsite/Downloadables_trauma_en_kindermishandeling_bijlagen/Bernet_et_al._-_CAPRD_-_2016-07.pdf|accessdate=7 October 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2016.04.018|pmid=27343884}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the child's perception of an alienated parent "may include negative attributions of the other's intentions, hostility toward or scapegoating of the other (parent), and unwarranted feelings of estrangement".&lt;ref&gt;Kay, B.

===Courts===
In a survey at the Association of Family and Conciliation Courts in 2010, 98% of the 300 respondents agreed with the question, "Do you think that some children are manipulated by one parent to irrationally and unjustifiably reject the other parent?".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lorandos, D., W. Bernet and S.R. Sauber (2013). Overview of Parental Alienation. In {{cite book|last1=Lorandos|first1=Demosthenes|last2=Bernet|first2=William|last3=Sauber|first3=S. Richard|title=Parental Alienation: The Handbook for Mental Health and Legal Professionals|date=2013|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=978-0398087500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNfCCAAAQBAJ|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, parental alienation refers not to the acts of manipulation, but rather to the child's rejection of a parent that results from alienating behavior.

Some courts recognize parental alienation as a form of child abuse with long-term effects and serious outcomes for the child. Some jurisdictions, including Brazil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil: Parental Alienation Criminalized|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/brazil-parental-alienation-criminalized/|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=7 October 2017|date=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mexico, have enacted parental alienation as a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Amelia|title=Programme aims to help people affected by 'parental alienation'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/14/programme-aims-to-help-people-affected-by-parental-alienation|accessdate=7 October 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions may suspend child support in cases where parental alienation occurs.  For example, in New York, in ''Matter of Robert Coull v. Pamela Rottman'', No. 2014-01516, 2015 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 6611 (September 2, 2015), where the father was prevented from seeing his son by the child's mother through a "pattern of alienation", child support was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title=Father Not Obligated to Pay Child Support, Panel Finds | author=Denney, Andrew | publisher=New York Law Journal | date=9 September 2015 | url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202736637831/Father-Not-Obligated-to-Pay-Child-Support-Panel-Finds }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some United States courts have also tried to address the issue through mandated reunification therapy; but no federal or state laws regulating parental alienation currently exist in the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wkfamilylaw.com/parental-alienation-crime/], "Should Parental Alienation Be A Crime?" - Wallin &amp; Klarich Family Law&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the nature of allegations of parental alienation, many courts require that a qualified expert witness testify in support of allegations of parental alienation or in association with any allegation that a parent has a mental health disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novotney|first1=Amy|title=Custody collaborations|journal=Monitor on Psychology|date=July 2008|volume=39|issue=7|page=48|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/07-08/child-custody.aspx|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While states have broadly rejected parental alienation syndrome as a concept that may be presented in a child custody case, it remains possible to argue that parental alienation has occurred, and to demonstrate how a parent's alienating behaviors should be considered by a court when evaluating a custody case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Parental Alienation in Child Custody Cases|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/child_custody/parental_alienation.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=7 October 2017|date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors that result in parental alienation may reflect other mental health disorders, both on the part of the alienating parent and the alienated parent, that may be relevant to a custody determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Joan B.|last2=Johnston|first2=Janet R.|title=The Alienated Child: A Reformulation of Parental Alienation Syndrome|journal=Family Court Review|date=July 2001|volume=39|issue=3|pages=249–266|doi=10.1111/j.174-1617.2001.tb00609.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavior of the alienated child may also be a relevant factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Amy J.L.|last2=Eichler|first2=Amy|title=The Linkage Between Parental Alienation Behaviors and Child Alienation|journal=Journal of Divorce and Remarriage|date=2016|volume=57|issue=7|pages=475–484|doi=10.1080/10502556.2016.1220285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41872">'''Parent-Child Interaction Therapy''' ('''PCIT''') is an intervention developed by Sheila Eyberg (1988) to treat children between ages 2 and 7 with disruptive behavior problems.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J019v10n01_04 |title=Parent-Child Interaction Therapy: |journal=Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy |volume=10 |pages=33–46 |year=1988 |last1=Eyberg |first1=Sheila }}&lt;/ref&gt; PCIT is an evidence-based treatment (EBT) for young children with behavioral and emotional disorders that places emphasis on improving the quality of the parent-child relationship and changing parent-child interaction patterns.&lt;ref name="What is PCIT"&gt;{{cite web | title=What is PCIT? | website=PCIT International | url=http://www.pcit.org/what-is-pcit1.html | accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disruptive behavior is the most common reason for referral of young children for mental health services and can vary from relatively minor infractions such as talking back to significant acts of aggression. The most commonly treated Disruptive Behavior Disorders may be classified as [[Oppositional Defiant Disorder]] (ODD) or [[Conduct Disorder]] (CD), depending on the severity of the behavior and the nature of the presenting problems. The disorders often co-occur with [[Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]] (ADHD).&lt;ref name="Zisser"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zisser |first1=A.R. |last2=Eyberg |first2=S.M. |year=2010 |chapter=Parent-child interaction therapy and the treatment of disruptive behavior disorders |editor1-first=A.E. |editor1-last=Kazdin |editor2-first=J.R. |editor2-last=Weisz |title=Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents |edition=2nd |location=New York, NY |publisher=Guilford Press }}{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a unique combination of [[behavioral therapy]], [[play therapy]], and parent training to teach more effective discipline techniques and improve the parent–child relationship.&lt;ref name="Hembree-Kigin"&gt;{{cite book |title=Parent–Child Interaction Therapy |last1=Hembree-Kigin |first1=T. |last2=McNeil |first2=C. |year=1995 |location=Springer, NY }}{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCIT is typically administered once a week, with 1-hour sessions, for 10-14 sessions total and consists of two treatment phases: Child-Directed Interaction (CDI) and Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI). The CDI component focuses on improving the quality of the parent-child relationship, which will help promote changes in behavior. This sets the foundation for the PDI stage, which continues to encourage appropriate play while also focusing on a structured and consistent approach to discipline.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

==History==
PCIT was derived from several theories, including attachment theory, social learning theory, and parenting styles theory. 

===Attachment theory===
According to [[attachment theory]] by Ainsworth,&lt;ref name=”Ainsworth”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ainsworth |first1=M. D. S. |last2=Blehar |first2=M. C. |last3=Waters |first3=E. |last4=Wall |first4=S. N. |year=2015 |title=Patterns of attachment: A psychological study of the strange situation |publisher=Psychology Press }}{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; “sensitive and responsive parenting” during infancy and toddlerhood leads the child to develop an expectation that their needs can be met by the parent. Thus, parents who show their young children greater warmth and are more responsive and sensitive to their needs promote a sense of security that they can later apply to relationships with others. This can also help with more effective emotion regulation.&lt;ref name=”Herschell”&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1077-7229(02)80034-7 |title=Parent-child interaction therapy: New directions in research |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice |volume=9 |pages=9 |year=2002 |last1=Herschell |first1=Amy D |last2=Calzada |first2=Esther J |last3=Eyberg |first3=Sheila M |last4=McNeil |first4=Cheryl B }}&lt;/ref&gt;Children who are referred to clinics for externalizing behaviors are more likely than non-referred children to display distress when separated from the parent and to display indicators of an insecure attachment to their parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mark T. |last1=Greenberg |first2=Matthew L. |last2=Speltz |chapter=Atachment and the Ontogeny of Conduct Problems |pages=177–218 |chapterurl={{Google books|rzjvCgAAQBAJ|page=177|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Jay |editor1-last=Belsky |editor2-first=Teresa M. |editor2-last=Nezworski |year=2015 |title=Clinical Implications of Attachment |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-83812-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Child Directed Interaction (CDI) component of the PCIT applies attachment theory through its goal to “restructure the parent-child relationship and provide a secure attachment for the child”. The CDI component makes use of the idea that parents can have a dramatic effect on their child's behavior, especially during the early preschool years.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt; This is a critical period where children are more responsive to their parent's and less so to other influences such as teachers or peers.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

===Social learning theory===
[[Social learning theory]] suggests that new behaviors can be learned by watching and imitating the behaviors of others.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A., &amp; Walters, R. H. (1977). Social learning theory (Vol. 1). Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-hall.{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patterson (1975)  further expands on this and proposes that child behavior problems are “inadvertently established or maintained by dysfunctional parent-child interactions”.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G. R. (1975). Families: Application of social learning to family life. Champaign, IL: Research Press.{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=”Herschell” /&gt; There can be a “coercive interaction cycle” between parent and child where both try to control the behavior of the other. Behaviors such as arguing and aggression in children are reinforced by parent behaviors (e.g., withdrawal of demands), but negative parent behaviors can subsequently be reinforced by negative child behaviors.&lt;ref name=”Herschell” /&gt; In sum, children can learn many behaviors from their parents’ feedback, but this can result in negative externalizing behaviors, as well. The PDI component targets this cycle specifically by establishing consistent parenting behaviors that encourage the desired behavior in children. 

===Parenting style theory===
According to [[Diana Baumrind]]’s parenting style theory (year link citation) found that the authoritative parenting style leads to the healthiest outcomes for children transitioning into adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=6032134 |year=1967 |author1=Baumrind |first1=D |title=Child care practices anteceding three patterns of preschool behavior |journal=Genetic psychology monographs |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=43–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This style combines responsive and nurturing interactions with clear communication and firm discipline. The influence of this theory can be seen particularly in the PDI treatment phase where parents are taught to use direct commands to increase desired behavior, along with other positive and nurturing behaviors.&lt;ref name=”Herschell” /&gt;

==Structure of the PCIT==
Eyberg’s original paper (1988) thoroughly describes each assessment and treatment phase of the PCIT and includes suggestions for applying the therapy.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

First, parents attend a training session during which the therapist explains each rule and its rationale. Each parent is also taught through one-on-one role play interactions with the therapist. Parents are also given a handout at the end of the session that summarizes the basic directions so they can review it at home.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

After this training session, the sessions that follow will include the child. The sessions are held in a playroom, with the child playing with one parent at a time. Meanwhile, the therapist and the other parent will be observing the play through a one-way mirror or video system. The therapist can provide immediate feedback and suggestions through a “bug-in-ear” device or sit in the room to do the coaching. At the end of the session, the therapist discusses the child's progress, using summary sheets that parents can use to guide their interactions during practice sessions at home. These practice sessions serve as a “homework assignment” for parents, during which they practice the interaction with their child for five minutes a day, using homework sheets to track progress. The treatment begins with the Child-Directed Interaction phase, then is followed by the Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI) phase.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

===Child-Directed Interaction (CDI)===
According to Eyberg (1988), the parent's goal during this stage is to follow the child's lead during play while being sure to follow the “Don’t Rules” and “Do Rules of CDI”. The child should be free to lead the activity and make their own decisions about what and how to play. By letting their children take control of the play, the parents help their child develop autonomy and independence.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

====Don’t rules of CDI====
According to Eyberg (1988), the Don’t rules help parents step back and encourage child-led play by avoiding commands, questions, and criticisms. Commands, or instructions, would take the lead away from the child could also introduce potential disagreements into the play. Parents are also encouraged to not ask questions. This can include questions such as “How about putting the toys away?” which are actually implied commands. The concern about asking questions is that they may come off as accusatory (“Why did you choose that toy?”) or take the conversation to an “adult” level instead of letting the child play freely and naturally. The general idea is that questions provide little information, so they have limited usefulness in therapy. The third “don’t” rule is to avoid criticizing. Though criticisms can range from mild to blatant attacks on the child, criticisms in general can lead to damaging effects on the child's self-esteem. As children learn which behaviors are good or bad, they rely on what their parents say about them and believe it. Criticisms may also frustrate or anger the child and can lead to a counterattack. Taken together, criticisms are not only unproductive in therapy, but also are threats to the positive relationship that the PCIT emphasizes.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

====Do rules of CDI====
According to Eyberg (1988), the Do rules of CDI that promote positive behavior throughout play. The first Do is to describe what the child is doing during the activity. Doing this may seem unnatural at first, but describing serves a few purposes:  it allows the child to (1) lead play, (2) improve attention towards independent activities, (3) clarify the activity and encourage the child to further elaborate the play, and (4) help teach the child different concepts in a positive way. For example, the child learns through positive feedback (“you found the red one”) instead of coercion (“find the red one”).&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

The second Do is imitation. Eyberg recommends that the parents “sit close and do the same thing as the child”. The parent can add to the child's play, or do something similar, but the focus should still remain on the child's style of play. The attention that imitation can demonstrate can show the child that the parent is interested and believes what they are doing is important. Imitation may even lead to the child imitating the parent. The aim is that through the parent-child play, the child can learn cooperative play skills that they can one day use with other children.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

Parents are encouraged to reflect what the child says during play, the third Do of CDI. This helps parents practice listening to their child. For example, when the child says “The car is fast,” the parent might say “Yes, the car is fast”. These reflections show that the parent understands and accepts what the child is saying. Additionally, using reflective statements can improve the child's vocabulary and grammar by providing clarity to the child's thoughts. It also gives the child an opportunity to agree or disagree with the parent's understanding and elaborate if needed.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

Praise is the fourth Do, and is very important because it can make children feel good and increase warmth, an important goal of the CDI. Praise statements such as “Good job!” show the child that their creations and actions are important. This is important because children tend to believe the things parents say to them, whether they be positive or negative. The manual specifies two types of praise. “Labeled praise” statements specify exactly what the parent likes about their behavior. For example, saying “You did a beautiful job of drawing that picture” not only teaches children that they did something the parent liked, but also teaches them what they did to earn that praise.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;Because PCIT can be used from ages 2 through 7, coaching takes into account the developmental differences at each age and teaches parents to be mindful of those differences. Parents are encouraged to praise and reflect all attempts of their child to verbally communicate, as speech skills are concurrently developing.&lt;ref name=”Herschell” /&gt;

===Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI)===
According to Eyberg (1988), during the PDI component, parents continue the skills learned in the CDI, but this time they are taught new skills to lead the play. These skills include giving verbal directions and applying the appropriate consequences to the child in a fair manner that the child can understand clearly. These steps are practiced at the clinic, and parents are not encouraged to practice at home until they feel confident.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

Eyberg (1988) states that he first step is to give clear, direct commands for the desired behavior from the child and to avoid indirect commands, which can be too vague and confusing to the child. For example, “Put this red table in the house” is a direct command. However, an indirect command such as “Will you color the leaves green?” can be interpreted by the child as a genuine question. Another example of an indirect command is “Let’s clean up the toys”, which does not indicate clearly if both the parent and child will be doing the task or how much of the task the child will do themselves. Additionally, phrases that are too general, such as “Be good”, should be avoided, as it does not provide enough information about what exactly is expected of the child. In sum, clear statements should be used towards the child so they can understand easily without getting confused.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

Eyberg (1988) provides some guidelines for parents to teach parents when giving direct commands. First, the commands should be stated positively and should tell the child what to do, rather than what not to do. For example, “Put your hands in your lap” should be used instead of “Stop grabbing the toys”. Secondly, the command should be one that is age-appropriate for the child. For example, telling a 2-year-old “Tie your shoe” would be considered not age-appropriate. Lastly, the command should require only one behavior at a time. This way, children need not remember long strings of orders in a single command.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

The second step of PDI involves labeled praise when the child displays the desired behavior. For example, “I like it when you do what I tell you to do so quickly!” tells the child what specific action pleased the parent and this praise will help increase that desired behavior.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

The third step is to initiate time-out whenever the child is noncompliance. Eyberg states that noncompliance will be reinforced by both parental attention and when the child is able to get out of something they do not want to do. An example may be a warning followed by a three-minute time-out.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

Eventually, as these skills are mastered by the parent, the commands can begin to address relevant behavioral problems the child may be displaying. The approach depends on the treatment goal. For example, if the goal is to increase a certain desired behavior, the parent must break the skill down into simpler parts that can be built on through practice and labeled praise until the child masters it.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

==Assessments==
===Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction System (DPICS)===
DPICS is an observational system originally created for conduct problem families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.49.2.245 |pmid=7217491 |title=The dyadic parent–child interaction coding system: Standardization and validation |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=245–50 |year=1981 |last1=Robinson |first1=Elizabeth A |last2=Eyberg |first2=Sheila M }}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses direct observations of behaviors to assess parent-child interactions. DPICS has undergone two revisions since its first edition published in 1981. The DPICS categories serve as indicators of relationship quality, measured by verbal and physical behaviors during social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Eyberg, S. M., Nelson, M. M., Duke, M., &amp; Boggs, S. R. (2004). Manual for the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System Third Edition.{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of parent behavior categories are direct and indirect commands, behavior descriptions, reflective statements, praise, information descriptions, questions, and negative talk. Child behavior categories include compliance and noncompliance, physical positive and negative, yell, whine, smart talk, laugh, and destructive behavior.&lt;ref name="”Herschell”" /&gt;

===Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI)===
The ECBI is a 36-item behavior scale that is used to track disruptive behaviors in children. It was constructed from data indicating the most typical problem behaviors reported by parents of conduct problem children. The measure includes two scales: Intensity and Problem. Parents report Intensity by rating how frequent each item occurs. The Problem scale asks parents “Is this behavioral  problem for you?” to which parents respond “yes” or “no”. This measure can be used for children aged 2 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15374417809532835 |title=Assessment of child behavior problems: The validation of a new inventory |journal=Journal of Clinical Child Psychology |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=113 |year=2009 |last1=Eyberg |first1=Sheila M |last2=Ross |first2=Arthur W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Behavior problems===
Disruptive behavior problems are the leading reason for children's referrals to mental health professionals.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10566-016-9350-5 |title=Parent–Child Interaction Therapy for Child Disruptive Behaviour Disorders: A Meta-analysis |journal=Child &amp; Youth Care Forum |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=675 |year=2016 |last1=Ward |first1=Michelle A |last2=Theule |first2=Jennifer |last3=Cheung |first3=Kristene }}&lt;/ref&gt; and PCIT was first created to target these behaviors.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt; Results from a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of PCIT on clinic referred children with diagnoses of [[Oppositional Defiant Disorder]] indicated that compared to the waitlist control group, parents interacted more positively with their children and were more successful at gaining compliance.&lt;ref name="Schuhmann"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15374424jccp2701_4 |pmid=9561935 |title=Efficacy of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy: Interim Report of a Randomized Trial with Short-Term Maintenance |journal=Journal of Clinical Child Psychology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=34–45 |year=1998 |last1=Schuhmann |first1=Elena M |last2=Foote |first2=Rebecca C |last3=Eyberg |first3=Sheila M |last4=Boggs |first4=Stephen R |last5=Algina |first5=James }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parents in the treatment group reported decreased parenting stress and more control. Parents also reported significant improvements in their child's behavior following treatment.&lt;ref name="Schuhmann" /&gt;

Similar results have been shown in a quasi-experimental study by Boggs and colleagues (2004) that evaluated families who completed the treatment program compared to families who dropped out of the study before completion. For those who completed treatment, parents reported positive changes 10-30 months following treatment in their child's behavior and their parenting stress. Those who dropped out of treatment early did not show significant changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J019v26n04_01 |title=Outcomes of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy: A Comparison of Treatment Completers and Study Dropouts One to Three Years Later |journal=Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=1 |year=2005 |last1=Boggs |first1=Stephen R |last2=Eyberg |first2=Sheila M |last3=Edwards |first3=Daniel L |last4=Rayfield |first4=Arista |last5=Jacobs |first5=Jenifer |last6=Bagner |first6=Daniel |last7=Hood |first7=Korey K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a meta-analysis that conducted a comprehensive review of PCIT's efficacy with children diagnosed with ADHD, ODD, or CD, PCIT was found to be an “efficacious intervention for improving externalizing behavior in children with disruptive behavior disorders”.&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt; Another meta-analysis that focused on parenting stress in addition to child behaviors as outcomes found PCIT to have a “beneficial impact on parents’ and primary caregivers’ perceptions of all outcomes examined, including child externalizing behaviors, child's temperament and self-regulatory abilities, frequency of behavior problems, the difficulty of parent-child interactions, and parent overall distress”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10522158.2014.888696 |title=Parent–Child Interaction Therapy: A Meta-Analysis of Child Behavior Outcomes and Parent Stress |journal=Journal of Family Social Work |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=191 |year=2014 |last1=Cooley |first1=Morgan E |last2=Veldorale-Griffin |first2=Amanda |last3=Petren |first3=Raymond E |last4=Mullis |first4=Ann K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment effects of PCIT can also be demonstrated in school settings, despite the treatment program being lab- or home-based.&lt;ref name="Funderburk 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J019v20n02_02 |title=Parent-Child Interaction Therapy with Behavior Problem Children: Maintenance of Treatment Effects in the School Setting |journal=Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=17 |year=2009 |last1=Funderburk |first1=Beverly W |last2=Eyberg |first2=Sheila M |last3=Newcomb |first3=Katharine |last4=McNeil |first4=Cheryl B |last5=Hembree-Kigin |first5=Toni |last6=Capage |first6=Laura }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study by Funderburk and colleagues (2009), school assessments were administered at 12 months and 18 months following PCIT. At 12 months, results indicated that children in the treatment group maintained their post-treatment improvements, improving within “normal range of conduct problems” compared to the control group. However, though maintaining improvements with compliance, the 18-month followup indicated some declines into the range of levels before treatment.&lt;ref name="Funderburk 2009" /&gt;

===Child maltreatment===
Studies have examined the effectiveness of PCIT with families at risk or engaged in [[child maltreatment]]. Evidence suggests that factors such as coercive patterns of parent-child interactions, less sensitivity towards the child, and insecure child attachment can be risks for child maltreatmen.t&lt;ref name="Thomas 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1077559512459555 |pmid=22942167 |title=Parent–Child Interaction Therapy |journal=Child Maltreatment |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=253–66 |year=2012 |last1=Thomas |first1=Rae |last2=Zimmer-Gembeck |first2=Melanie J }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a randomized controlled trial composing of 12-session PCIT, mothers reported less internalizing and externalizing behaviors in children in the PCIT group.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2012" /&gt; Additionally, mothers reported less stress, more positive verbalizations and maternal sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01548.x |pmid=21291436 |title=Accumulating Evidence for Parent-Child Interaction Therapy in the Prevention of Child Maltreatment |journal=Child Development |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=177–92 |year=2011 |last1=Thomas |first1=Rae |last2=Zimmer-Gembeck |first2=Melanie J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found similar results, including a reduction of abuse risk post-treatment compared to the waitlist control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10578-011-0226-5 |title=The Effectiveness of Parent–Child Interaction Therapy with Depressive Mothers: The Changing Relationship as the Agent of Individual Change |journal=Child Psychiatry &amp; Human Development |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=406 |year=2011 |last1=Timmer |first1=Susan G |last2=Ho |first2=Lareina K. L |last3=Urquiza |first3=Anthony J |last4=Zebell |first4=Nancy M |last5=Fernandez y Garcia |first5=Erik |last6=Boys |first6=Deanna }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas 2011" /&gt;

====Foster care====
PCIT may also be an effective intervention for maltreated children in foster care settings. Because children with behavioral problems in foster care are more likely to have multiple foster care placements and mental health problems, the interventions that improve foster parents’ skills in managing children's difficult behaviors are needed. Findings from a study comparing foster parents and their foster children to non-abusive biological parents and their children demonstrated PCIT's effectiveness in reducing child behavior problems and caregiver distress following treatment for both groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2005.01.006 |title=Challenging foster caregiver–maltreated child relationships: The effectiveness of parent–child interaction therapy |journal=Children and Youth Services Review |volume=28 |pages=1 |year=2006 |last1=Timmer |first1=Susan G |last2=Urquiza |first2=Anthony J |last3=Zebell |first3=Nancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression===
The PCIT has been adapted to treat [[major depressive disorder]] in preschool-aged children, called the PCIT-ED.&lt;ref name="Lenze"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/da.20770 |pmid=21284068 |pmc=3302425 |title=Parent-child interaction therapy emotion development: A novel treatment for depression in preschool children |journal=Depression and Anxiety |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=153–9 |year=2011 |last1=Lenze |first1=Shannon N |last2=Pautsch |first2=Jennifer |last3=Luby |first3=Joan }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emotional Development module (ED) was added to target emotion development impairments in very young children, specifically.&lt;ref name="Lenze" /&gt; Its goal is to help children regulate and understand their own emotions more effectively. The two phases of PCIT, CDI and PDI, are retained, but are shortened to six session per phase. Parents are taught skills that help their child in identifying and managing their emotions. For example, this may involve recognizing the child's “triggers” and using relaxation techniques to calm them. Often, parents may try to stop the child's expression of negative emotion, but during ED, parents are taught to tolerate these negative emotions so their child can learn to regulate them.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

The pilot study of the PCIT-ED was an open trial study that examined a group of preschool children with depression, assessing symptoms before and after treatment.  This study showed decreased depressive symptoms in children, and most children no longer met [[major depressive disorder]] criteria upon completion of treatment. Additionally, children improved their coping skills, prosocial behaviors, and thought processes.&lt;ref name="Lenze" /&gt; The first randomized controlled trial that compared PCIT-ED to psychoeducation in depressed preschoolers and their caregivers also showed significant improvement two weeks posttreatment for the PCIT-ED group in emotion development, child executive functioning, and parenting stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2011.02483.x |pmid=22040016 |pmc=3640820 |title=A novel early intervention for preschool depression: Findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=313–22 |year=2012 |last1=Luby |first1=Joan |last2=Lenze |first2=Shannon |last3=Tillman |first3=Rebecca }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation anxiety disorder===
[[Separation anxiety disorder]] (SAD) is the most common [[anxiety]] disorder in children which is characterized by an “excessive fear response to real or imagined separation from a caregiver”.&lt;ref name="Pincus"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cbpra.2007.08.002 |title=The Implementation of Modified Parent-Child Interaction Therapy for Youth with Separation Anxiety Disorder |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=118 |year=2008 |last1=Pincus |first1=Donna B |last2=Santucci |first2=Lauren C |last3=Ehrenreich |first3=Jill T |last4=Eyberg |first4=Sheila M }}&lt;/ref&gt; PCIT involves many parenting skills that are important in reducing children's anxiety, such as command training, selective attention, reinforcement, and shaping the child's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1077-7229(05)80047-1 |title=Parent-child interaction therapy for treatment of separation anxiety disorder in young children: A pilot study |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice |volume=12 |pages=126 |year=2005 |last1=Choate |first1=Molly L |last2=Pincus |first2=Donna B |last3=Eyberg |first3=Sheila M |last4=Barlow |first4=David H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilot study results by Pincus and colleagues (2008) evaluating the efficacy of PCIT in 10 young children with SAD showed that did not improve to nonclinical levels posttreatment, however there was improvement in the severity of SAD.&lt;ref name="Pincus" /&gt; Pincus and colleagues (2008) also proposed an adaptation to the PCIT that would include the Bravery-Directed Interaction (BDI) phase.&lt;ref name="Pincus" /&gt; The BDI phase includes a psychoeducational component for the parents about anxiety. It also includes a gradual exposure to the separation situations the child fears. This exposure is key for all anxiety disorders. The BDI focuses on establishing a sense of control in the child by giving them the freedom to choose one exposure activity a week from the “Bravery Ladder” homework assignment, rather than having their parent choose. An initial randomized controlled trial has been conducted to evaluate the modified PCIT, comparing its efficacy to a waitlist control group. It seeks to assess the maintenance of change at 3, 6, and 12 months posttreatment. Preliminary results of study show decreased severity of SAD post-treatment.&lt;ref name="Pincus" /&gt;

===Domestic and interparental violence exposure===
Children are at an especially high risk for externalizing and internalizing problems following interparental violence-exposure or [[domestic violence]]. Borrego and colleagues (2008) have provided rationale for the use of PCIT with domestic violence-exposed women and their children, proposing that the parent training component may be very beneficial for mothers who may have “low levels of confidence in their own parenting capabilities and may also have low self-esteem”.&lt;ref name="Borrego"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10896-008-9177-4 |title=Parent–Child Interaction Therapy with Domestic Violence Populations |journal=Journal of Family Violence |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=495 |year=2008 |last1=Borrego |first1=Joaquin |last2=Gutow |first2=Mindy R |last3=Reicher |first3=Shira |last4=Barker |first4=Chikira H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Borrego and colleagues (2008) emphasized that because PCIT is relationship-based, it may improve the quality of the mother-child relationship, developing a secure attachment between mother and child, and may lead to a decrease in the severity of trauma symptoms experienced by both.&lt;ref name="Borrego" /&gt;

One study by Timmer and colleagues (2010) compared the effectiveness of PCIT in reducing behavior problems in maltreated children exposed to interparental violence (IPV) and similar children with no history of IPV-exposure. Results indicated that there were decreases in behavior problems and caregivers’ distress from pre- to posttreatment in both the IPV-exposed and non-exposed groups. However, there was no significant difference between variations of IPV exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1891/0886-6708.25.4.486 |pmid=20712147 |title=The Effectiveness of Parent–Child Interaction Therapy for Victims of Interparental Violence |journal=Violence and Victims |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=486–503 |year=2010 |last1=Timmer |first1=Susan G |last2=Ware |first2=Lisa M |last3=Urquiza |first3=Anthony J |last4=Zebell |first4=Nancy M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delivery of treatment==
===In-home===
The implementation of PCIT in the home has been examined in order to increase accessibility. Protocol was followed as closely as possible, with the exception that treatment was conducted within the home. Some modifications may be necessary in this setting. For example, the bug-in-ear (a small, wireless earpiece) was used for coaching parents could not be used. Instead, therapists were present in the same room for coaching, typically behind the caregiver, giving discrete feedback.&lt;ref name="Ware"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07317100802060302 |title=Efficacy of In-Home Parent-Child Interaction Therapy |journal=Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=99 |year=2008 |last1=Ware |first1=Lisa M |last2=McNeil |first2=Cheryl B |last3=Masse |first3=Joshua |last4=Stevens |first4=Sarah }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapists were able to conduct DPICS observations, however these observations were coded live.

The in-home administration of PCIT in a single-subject study by Ware and colleagues (2012) has yielded promising results, such as decrease in caregiver use of negative behavior and increase in use of positive behavior and praise posttreatment.&lt;ref name="Ware" /&gt; PCIT has also shown to improve child outcomes as well. PCIT completers were found to have significantly lower risk of child abuse compared to noncompleters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07317107.2012.707079 |title=Effectiveness of Parent–Child Interaction Therapy Delivered to At-Risk Families in the Home Setting |journal=Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=177 |year=2012 |last1=Galanter |first1=Rachel |last2=Self-Brown |first2=Shannon |last3=Valente |first3=Jessica R |last4=Dorsey |first4=Shannon |last5=Whitaker |first5=Daniel J |last6=Bertuglia-Haley |first6=Michelle |last7=Prieto |first7=Metta }}&lt;/ref&gt; decrease in child behavior problems, and increased child compliance posttreatment.&lt;ref name="Ware" /&gt;

There are certain advantages that come with in-home PCIT. For example, therapists are able to take advantage of more authentic, “real life” behaviors that may not be accurately captured within a laboratory or clinic setting. Additionally, in-home PCIT can combat attrition, a problem commonly faced by therapists.&lt;ref name="Masse"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07317100802060310 |title=In-Home Parent-Child Interaction Therapy: Clinical Considerations |journal=Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=127 |year=2008 |last1=Masse |first1=Joshua J |last2=McNeil |first2=Cheryl B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach has potential drawbacks, as well. For example, because homes vary greatly across families, it is much more difficult for therapists control, unlike a laboratory or clinic setting. It may also be more difficult to keep children within the room and within the therapist's sight, as the child has more freedom to “escape” if needed.&lt;ref name="Masse" /&gt; These problems can be avoided by deciding beforehand which room the therapy will take place and by minimizing potential distractions. Availability of resources can be an issue as well, particularly when the treatment requires use of age-appropriate toys that are typically controlled by the therapist in clinical settings. In homes, there may be limited options of activities. However, talking to the parent beforehand about what they might prefer to play with may be helpful, and the therapist can plan to bring the toys needed.&lt;ref name="Masse" /&gt;

===Community-based===
PCIT implemented in the community involves administration in community settings such as in the home, mental health services agencies, or family services agencies. Few studies have examined the effectiveness of PCIT in community settings, however one implementation through community agencies has shown decreases in behavior problems, improved parent-child interactions, reduced parental stress in a four-family clinical case study posttreatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cbpra.2010.12.002 |title=Delivering Parent-Child Interaction Therapy in an Urban Community Clinic |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=502 |year=2011 |last1=Budd |first1=Karen S |last2=Hella |first2=Bryce |last3=Bae |first3=Hyo |last4=Meyerson |first4=David A |last5=Watkin |first5=Sarah C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study by Lanier and colleagues (2014) found PCIT to be effective for maltreatment prevention in a group of families receiving PCIT at posttreatment followup.&lt;ref name="Lanier"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10826-012-9708-8 |pmid=24443637 |pmc=3891779 |title=Preventing Maltreatment with a Community-Based Implementation of Parent–Child Interaction Therapy |journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=449–460 |year=2012 |last1=Lanier |first1=Paul |last2=Kohl |first2=Patricia L |last3=Benz |first3=Joan |last4=Swinger |first4=Dawn |last5=Drake |first5=Brett }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet-based===
In an effort to increase accessibility and address obstacles of receiving treatment, especially in underserved communities, an internet-based delivery of PCIT has been proposed and tested. This method uses video conferencing, webcams, and wireless earpieces, allowing for therapists to continue to provide real-time feedback to caregivers, right from the comfort of their home.&lt;ref name="Comer"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cbpra.2014.07.003 |pmid=26120268 |pmc=4480784 |title=Rationale and Considerations for the Internet-Based Delivery of Parent–Child Interaction Therapy |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=302–316 |year=2015 |last1=Comer |first1=Jonathan S |last2=Furr |first2=Jami M |last3=Cooper-Vince |first3=Christine |last4=Madigan |first4=Ryan J |last5=Chow |first5=Candice |last6=Chan |first6=Priscilla T |last7=Idrobo |first7=Fabio |last8=Chase |first8=Rhea M |last9=McNeil |first9=Cheryl B |last10=Eyberg |first10=Sheila M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages of this method include the ability to generalize findings better because families were treated in natural settings, which are the settings in which child disruptive behaviors are most likely to manifest.

Availability of resources can pose as a problem when implementing this method of PCIT. Success is dependent on families owning, or being provided, microphones, ear pieces, webcams, computers, and Wi-Fi hotspots. In homes that lack Wi-Fi or have suboptimal internet connections, real-time feedback from therapists may be affected. Treatment providers may be able to provide the necessary equipment for families to borrow, however this depends heavily on the availability of grant funds.&lt;ref name="Comer" /&gt;

A randomized trial has been conducted with the Internet-Delivered Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (I-PCIT) and has shown support for its effectiveness in treating children with disruptive behavior disorders. Parents perceived less barriers to treatment when compared to those receiving clinic-based PCIT.&lt;ref name="Comer" /&gt; This study demonstrated decreases in children's symptoms and burden to parents in a randomized clinical trial compared to a waitlist control group, and to traditional in-office PCIT administration.&lt;ref name="Comer" /&gt; Additionally, roughly half of the children in the study no longer met the diagnostic criteria for [[disruptive behavior disorder]].&lt;ref name="Comer" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
In addition to the time-out component, Eyberg (1988) also recommended swatting child's bottom and other physical punishment as a form of discipline&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;, however in a study by Timmer and colleagues (2005), physical punishment was not found to be necessary&lt;ref name="Timmer"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2005.01.003 |title=Parent-Child Interaction Therapy: Application to maltreating parent-child dyads |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=29 |issue=7 |pages=825 |year=2005 |last1=Timmer |first1=Susan G |last2=Urquiza |first2=Anthony J |last3=Zebell |first3=Nancy M |last4=McGrath |first4=Jean M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been removed from the PCIT protocol. Timmer (2005) further suggested that it did not add anything and suggested a more hands-off approach to parenting.&lt;ref name="Timmer" /&gt;

Attrition rates among families receiving PCIT are an ongoing concern.&lt;ref name="Lanier" /&gt; In a meta-analysis by Thomas and Zimmer-Gembeck (2012), attrition rates ranged from 18 to 35% among studies that reported attrition.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2011" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42659">A '''Petri net''', also known as a '''place/transition (PT) net''', is one of several [[mathematical]] [[modeling language]]s for the description of [[distributed systems]].  It is a class of [[discrete event dynamic system]]. A Petri net is a directed [[bipartite graph]], in which the nodes represent transitions (i.e. events that may occur, represented by bars) and places (i.e. conditions, represented by circles). The directed arcs describe which places are pre- and/or postconditions for which transitions (signified by arrows).  Some sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Carl Adam | last1 = Petri | first2 = Wolfgang | last2 = Reisig | date = 2008 | title = Petri net | journal = [[Scholarpedia]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | page = 6477 | url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Petri_net | doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.6477}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that Petri nets were invented in August 1939 by [[Carl Adam Petri]]—at the age of 13—for the purpose of describing chemical processes.

Like industry standards such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[activity diagram]]s, [[Business Process Model and Notation]] and [[Event-driven process chain|EPC]]s, Petri nets offer a [[diagram|graphical notation]] for stepwise processes that include choice, [[iteration]], and [[Concurrent computing|concurrent execution]]. Unlike these standards, Petri nets have an exact mathematical definition of their execution semantics, with a well-developed mathematical theory for process analysis.

== Petri net basics ==
A Petri net consists of ''places'', ''transitions'', and ''[[graph theory|arc]]s''.  Arcs run from a place to a transition or vice versa, never between places or between transitions.  The places from which an arc runs to a transition are called the ''input places'' of the transition; the places to which arcs run from a transition are called the ''output places'' of the transition.

Graphically, places in a Petri net may contain a discrete number of marks called ''tokens''.  Any distribution of tokens over the places will represent a configuration of the net called a ''marking''.  In an abstract sense relating to a Petri net diagram, a transition of a Petri net may ''fire'' if it is ''enabled'', i.e. there are sufficient tokens in all of its input places; when the transition fires, it consumes the required input tokens, and creates tokens in its output places.  A firing is atomic, i.e. a single non-interruptible step.

Unless an ''execution policy'' {{Example needed|date=September 2018}} is defined, the execution of Petri nets is [[Nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterministic]]: when multiple transitions are enabled at the same time, they will fire in any order.

Since firing is nondeterministic, and multiple tokens may be present anywhere in the net (even in the same place),  Petri nets are well suited for modeling the [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] behavior of distributed systems.

== Formal definition and basic terminology ==
Petri nets are [[State transition system|state-transition systems]] that extend a class of nets called elementary nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = G. | last1 = Rozenburg | first2 = J. | last2 = Engelfriet | chapter = Elementary Net Systems | editor1-first = W. | editor1-last = Reisig | editor2-first = G. | editor2-last = Rozenberg | title = Lectures on Petri Nets I: Basic Models – Advances in Petri Nets | volume = 1491 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | publisher = Springer | date = 1998 | pages = 12–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Definition 1.''' A ''net'' is a [[Tuple|triple]] &lt;math&gt;N = (P, T, F)&lt;/math&gt; where:
# &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are ''disjoint'' finite sets of ''places'' and ''transitions'', respectively.
# &lt;math&gt;F \subset (P \times T) \cup (T \times P)&lt;/math&gt; is a set of ''arcs'' (or flow relations).

'''Definition 2.''' Given a net ''N'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''F''), a ''configuration'' is a set ''C'' so that ''C'' &lt;big&gt;⊆&lt;/big&gt; ''P''.

[[File:Petri Net A.jpg|thumb|A Petri net with an enabled transition.]][[File:Petri Net B.jpg|thumb|The Petri net that follows after the transition fires (Initial Petri net in the figure above).]]
'''Definition 3.''' An ''elementary net'' is a net of the form ''EN'' = (''N'', ''C'') where:
# ''N'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''F'') is a net.
# ''C'' is such that ''C'' &lt;big&gt;⊆&lt;/big&gt; ''P'' is a ''configuration''.

'''Definition 4.''' A ''Petri net'' is a net of the form ''PN'' = (''N'', ''M'', ''W''), which extends the elementary net so that:
# ''N'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''F'' ) is a net.
# ''M'' : ''P'' &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; ''Z'' is a place [[multiset]], where ''Z'' is a [[countable set]]. ''M'' extends the concept of ''configuration'' and is commonly described with reference to Petri net diagrams as a ''marking''.
# ''W'' : ''F'' &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; ''Z'' is an arc [[multiset]], so that the count (or weight) for each arc is a measure of the arc ''multiplicity''.

If a Petri net is equivalent to an elementary net, then ''Z'' can be the countable set {0,1} and those elements in ''P'' that map to 1 under ''M'' form a configuration. Similarly, if a Petri net is not an elementary net, then the [[multiset]] ''M'' can be interpreted as representing a non-singleton set of configurations. In this respect, ''M'' extends the concept of configuration for elementary nets to Petri nets.

In the diagram of a Petri net (see top figure right), places are conventionally depicted with circles, transitions with long narrow rectangles and arcs as one-way arrows that show connections of places to transitions or transitions to places. If the diagram were of an elementary net, then those places in a configuration would be conventionally depicted as circles, where each circle encompasses a single dot called a ''token''. In the given diagram of a Petri net (see right), the place circles may encompass more than one token to show the number of times a place appears in a configuration. The configuration of tokens distributed over an entire Petri net diagram is called a ''marking''.

In the top figure (see right), the place ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an input place of transition ''t''; whereas, the place ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an output place to the same transition. Let ''PN&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' (Fig. top) be a Petri net with a marking configured ''M&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''PN&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' (Fig. bottom) be a Petri net with a marking configured ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. The configuration of ''PN&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''enable'' transition ''t'' through the property that all input places have sufficient number of tokens (shown in the figures as dots) "equal to or greater" than the multiplicities on their respective arcs to ''t''. Once and only once a transition is enabled will the transition fire. In this example, the ''firing'' of transition ''t'' generates a map that has the marking configured ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the image of ''M&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and results in Petri net ''PN&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', seen in the bottom figure. In the diagram, the firing rule for a transition can be characterised by subtracting a number of tokens from its input places equal to the multiplicity of the respective input arcs and accumulating a new number of tokens at the output places equal to the multiplicity of the respective output arcs.

'''Remark 1.''' The precise meaning of "equal to or greater" will depend on the precise algebraic properties of addition being applied on ''Z'' in the firing rule, where subtle variations on the algebraic properties can lead to other classes of Petri nets; for example, Algebraic Petri nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reisig | first1 = Wolfgang | date = 1991 | title = Petri Nets and Algebraic Specifications | url = | journal = Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 80 | issue = 1| pages = 1–34 | doi=10.1016/0304-3975(91)90203-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following formal definition is loosely based on {{harv|Peterson|1981}}.  Many alternative definitions exist.

=== Syntax ===

A '''Petri net graph''' (called ''Petri net'' by some, but see below) is a 3-[[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W)&lt;/math&gt;, where
* ''S'' is a [[finite set]] of ''places''
* ''T'' is a finite set of ''transitions''
* ''S'' and ''T'' are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]], i.e. no object can be both a place and a transition
* &lt;math&gt;W: (S \times T) \cup (T \times S) \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[multiset]] of [[directed edge|arc]]s, i.e. it assigns to each arc a non-negative integer ''arc multiplicity'' (or weight); note that no arc may connect two places or two transitions.

The ''flow relation'' is the set of arcs: &lt;math&gt; F = \{ (x,y) \mid W(x,y) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.  In many textbooks, arcs can only have multiplicity 1. These texts often define Petri nets using ''F'' instead of ''W''.  When using this convention, a Petri net graph is a [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] [[multigraph]] &lt;math&gt;(S \cup T, F)&lt;/math&gt; with node partitions ''S'' and ''T''.

The ''preset'' of a transition ''t'' is the set of its ''input places'': &lt;math&gt;{}^{\bullet}t = \{ s \in S \mid W(s,t) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;;
its ''postset'' is the set of its ''output places'': &lt;math&gt;t^{\bullet} = \{ s \in S \mid W(t,s) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. Definitions of pre- and postsets of places are analogous.

A ''marking'' of a Petri net (graph) is a multiset of its places, i.e., a mapping &lt;math&gt;M: S \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.  We say the marking assigns to each place a number of ''tokens''.

A '''Petri net''' (called ''marked Petri net'' by some, see above) is a 4-tuple &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;, where
* &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W)&lt;/math&gt; is a Petri net graph;
* &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is the ''initial marking'', a marking of the Petri net graph.

=== Execution semantics ===

In words:
* firing a transition {{mvar|t}} in a marking {{mvar|M}} consumes &lt;math&gt;W(s,t)&lt;/math&gt; tokens from each of its input places {{mvar|s}}, and produces &lt;math&gt;W(t,s)&lt;/math&gt; tokens in each of its output places {{mvar|s}}
* a transition is ''enabled'' (it may ''fire'') in {{mvar|M}} if there are enough tokens in its input places for the consumptions to be possible, i.e. iff &lt;math&gt;\forall s: M(s) \geq W(s,t)&lt;/math&gt;.

We are generally interested in what may happen when transitions may continually fire in arbitrary order.

We say that a marking {{mvar|M'}} ''is reachable from'' a marking {{mvar|M}} ''in one step'' if &lt;math&gt;M \underset{G}{\longrightarrow} M'&lt;/math&gt;; we say that it ''is reachable from {{mvar|M}}'' if &lt;math&gt;M \overset{*}{\underset{G}{\longrightarrow}} M'&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset{G}{\longrightarrow}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reflexive transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\underset{G}{\longrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;; that is, if it is reachable in 0 or more steps.

For a (marked) Petri net &lt;math&gt;N=(S,T,W,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;, we are interested in the firings that can be performed starting with the initial marking &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;.  Its set of ''reachable markings'' is the set
&lt;math&gt;R(N) \ \stackrel{D}{=}\ \left\{ M' \Bigg| M_0 \xrightarrow[(S,T,W)]{*} M' \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

The ''reachability graph'' of {{mvar|N}} is the transition relation &lt;math&gt;\underset{G}{\longrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; restricted to its reachable markings &lt;math&gt;R(N)&lt;/math&gt;.  It is the [[state space]] of the net.

A ''firing sequence'' for a Petri net with graph {{mvar|G}} and initial marking &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of transitions &lt;math&gt;\vec \sigma = \langle t_{i_1} \cdots t_{i_n} \rangle&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;M_0 \xrightarrow[G,t_{i_1}]{} M_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge M_{n-1} \xrightarrow[G,t_{i_n}]{} M_n&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of firing sequences is denoted as &lt;math&gt;L(N)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Variations on the definition ==

As already remarked, a common variation is to disallow arc multiplicities and replace the [[multiset|bag]] of arcs ''W'' with a simple set, called the ''flow relation'', &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq (S \times T) \cup (T \times S)&lt;/math&gt;.
This doesn't limit [[expressive power (computer science)|expressive power]] as both can represent each other.

Another common variation, e.g. in, Desel and Juhás (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/a6lmwqye66ll5w56/ | last1 = Desel | first1 = Jörg | last2 = Juhás | first2 = Gabriel | chapter = What Is a Petri Net? Informal Answers for the Informed Reader | editor1-first = Hartmut | editor1-last = Ehrig | title = Unifying Petri Nets | series = LNCS | volume = 2128 | pages = 1–25 | date = 2001 |publisher=Springer |accessdate=2014-05-14|display-editors=etal| isbn = 9783540430674 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is to allow ''capacities'' to be defined on places.  This is discussed under ''extensions'' below.

== Formulation in terms of vectors and matrices ==

The markings of a Petri net &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W,M_0)&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as [[Vector (mathematics)|vector]]s of nonnegative integers of length &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt;.

Its transition relation can be described as a pair of &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;|T|&lt;/math&gt; [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]:
* &lt;math&gt;W^-&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;\forall s,t: W^-[s,t] = W(s,t)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;W^+&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;\forall s,t: W^+[s,t] = W(t,s).&lt;/math&gt;
Then their difference
* &lt;math&gt; W^T = W^+ - W^-&lt;/math&gt;
can be used to describe the reachable markings in terms of matrix multiplication, as follows.
For any sequence of transitions {{mvar|w}}, write &lt;math&gt;o(w)&lt;/math&gt; for the vector that maps every transition to its number of occurrences in {{mvar|w}}.  Then, we have
* &lt;math&gt;R(N) = \{ M \mid \exists w: M = M_0 + W^T \cdot o(w) \wedge w \text{ is a firing sequence of } N \}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!-- the \!s make the \{ and \} the same size. --&gt;

Note that it must be required that {{mvar|w}} is a firing sequence; allowing arbitrary sequences of transitions will generally produce a larger set.

[[Image:detailed petri net.png|frame|(b) Petri net Example]] 
:&lt;math&gt;W^{+}=\begin{bmatrix} * &amp; t1 &amp; t2 \\ p1 &amp; 0  &amp; 1 \\ p2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ p3 &amp; 1&amp; 0 \\ p4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}, \ 
W^{-}=\begin{bmatrix} * &amp; t1 &amp; t2 \\ p1 &amp; 1  &amp; 0 \\ p2 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ p3 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ p4 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}, \ 
W^T=\begin{bmatrix} * &amp; t1 &amp; t2 \\ p1 &amp; -1  &amp; 1 \\ p2 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\ p3 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\ p4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{0}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Mathematical properties of Petri nets ==

One thing that makes Petri nets interesting is that they provide a balance between modeling power and analyzability: many things one would like to know about concurrent systems can be automatically determined for Petri nets, although some of those things are very expensive to determine in the general case.  Several subclasses of Petri nets have been studied that can still model interesting classes of concurrent systems, while these problems become easier.

An overview of such [[decision problem]]s, with decidability and complexity results for Petri nets and some subclasses, can be found in
Esparza and Nielsen (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/226920.html | title = Decidability issues for Petri nets – a survey | first1 = Javier | last1 = Esparza | first2 = Mogens | last2 = Nielsen | journal = Bulletin of the EATCS | origyear = 1994 | edition = Revised | date = 1995 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reachability ===
The [[reachability problem]] for Petri nets is to decide, given a Petri net ''N'' and a marking ''M'', whether &lt;math&gt;M \in  R(N)&lt;/math&gt;.

Clearly, this is a matter of walking the reachability graph defined above, until either we reach the requested marking or we know it can no longer be found.  This is harder than it may seem at first: the reachability graph is generally infinite, and it is not easy to determine when it is safe to stop.

In fact, this problem was shown to be [[EXPSPACE]]-hard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lipton | first = R. | url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/contextsummary/115623/0 | title = The Reachability Problem Requires Exponential Space | journal = Technical Report 62 | date = 1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; years before it was shown to be decidable at all (Mayr, 1981).  Papers continue to be published on how to do it efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = P. | last = Küngas | url = http://www.idi.ntnu.no/%7Epeep/papers/SARA2005Kung.ps | title = Petri Net Reachability Checking Is Polynomial with Optimal Abstraction Hierarchies | conference = Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Abstraction, Reformulation and Approximation—SARA 2005 | location = Airth Castle, Scotland, UK | date = July 26–29, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently (2018) Czerwinski et al improved the lower bound and showed that the problem is not [[ELEMENTARY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1809.07115|last1=Czerwinski|first1=Wojciech|title=The Reachability Problem for Petri Nets is Not Elementary (Extended Abstract)|last2=Lasota|first2=Slawomir|last3=Lazic|first3=Ranko|last4=Leroux|first4=Jerome|last5=Mazowiecki|first5=Filip|class=cs.FL|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While reachability seems to be a good tool to find erroneous states, for practical problems the constructed graph usually has far too many states to calculate. To alleviate this problem, [[linear temporal logic]] is usually used in conjunction with the [[Method of analytic tableaux|tableau method]] to prove that such states cannot be reached. LTL uses the [[semi-decision procedure|semi-decision technique]] to find if indeed a state can be reached, by finding a set of necessary conditions for the state to be reached then proving that those conditions cannot be satisfied.

=== Liveness ===

[[Image:liveness-levels.gif|thumb|right|A Petri net in which transition &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is dead, while for all &lt;math&gt;j&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt;-live]]

Petri nets can be described as having different degrees of liveness &lt;math&gt;L_1 - L_4&lt;/math&gt;. A Petri net &lt;math&gt;(N, M_0)&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;L_k&lt;/math&gt;-live [[if and only if|iff]] all of its transitions are &lt;math&gt;L_k&lt;/math&gt;-live, where a transition is
* ''dead'', if it can never fire, i.e. it is not in any firing sequence in &lt;math&gt;L(N,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;-live (''potentially fireable''), iff it may fire, i.e. it is in some firing sequence in &lt;math&gt;L(N,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;-live iff it can fire arbitrarily often, i.e. if for every positive integer {{mvar|k}}, it occurs at least {{mvar|k}} times in some firing sequence in &lt;math&gt;L(N,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;L_3&lt;/math&gt;-live iff it can fire infinitely often, i.e. if for every positive integer {{mvar|k}}, it occurs at least {{mvar|k}} times in {{mvar|V}}, for some prefix-closed set of firing sequences &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textstyle{V \subseteq L(N,M_0)}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;L_4&lt;/math&gt;-live (''live'') iff it may always fire, i.e. it is &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;-live in every reachable marking in &lt;math&gt;R(N,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that these are increasingly stringent requirements: &lt;math&gt;L_{j+1}&lt;/math&gt;-liveness implies &lt;math&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt;-liveness, for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textstyle{j \in {1,2,3}}&lt;/math&gt;.

These definitions are in accordance with Murata's overview,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.cs.uic.edu/bin/view/Murata/Publications | title = Petri Nets: Properties, Analysis and Applications | first = Tadao | last = Murata | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 77 | issue = 4 | pages = 541–558 | date = April 1989 | accessdate = 2014-10-13 | doi=10.1109/5.24143}}&lt;/ref&gt; which additionally uses &lt;math&gt;L_0&lt;/math&gt;''-live'' as a term for ''dead''.

=== Boundedness ===
[[File:Reachability graph for petri net.png|right|frame|width=50px|The reachability graph of ''N2''.]]

A place in a Petri net is called ''k-bounded'' if it does not contain more than ''k'' tokens in all reachable markings, including the initial marking; it is said to be ''safe'' if it is 1-bounded; it is ''[[bounded set|bounded]]'' if it is ''k-bounded'' for some ''k''.

A (marked) Petri net is called ''k''-bounded, ''safe'', or ''bounded'' when all of its places are.
A Petri net (graph) is called ''(structurally) bounded'' if it is bounded for every possible initial marking.

Note that a Petri net is bounded if and only if its reachability graph is finite.

Boundedness is decidable by looking at [[covering problem|covering]], by constructing the [[Richard Karp|Karp]]–Miller Tree.

It can be useful to explicitly impose a bound on places in a given net.
This can be used to model limited system resources.

Some definitions of Petri nets explicitly allow this as a syntactic feature.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~mchen/BioPNML/Intro/pnfaq.html
  |ref=harv
  |title=Petri Nets
  |website = www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Formally, ''Petri nets with place capacities'' can be defined as tuples &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W,C,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W,M_0)&lt;/math&gt; is a Petri net, &lt;math&gt;C: P \rightarrow\!\!\!\shortmid I\!N&lt;/math&gt; an assignment of capacities to (some or all) places, and the transition relation is the usual one restricted to the markings in which each place with a capacity has at most that many tokens.

[[File:Two-boundedness-ub.png|right|frame|An unbounded Petri net, ''N''.]]

For example, if in the net ''N'', both places are assigned capacity 2, we obtain a Petri net with place capacities, say ''N2''; its reachability graph is displayed on the right.

[[File:Two-boundedness-cb.png|right|frame|A two-bounded Petri net, obtained by extending ''N'' with "counter-places".]]

Alternatively, places can be made bounded by extending the net.  To be exact,
a place can be made ''k''-bounded by adding a "counter-place" with flow opposite to that of the place, and adding tokens to make the total in both places ''k''.

==Discrete, continuous, and hybrid Petri nets==

As well as for discrete events, there are Petri nets for continuous and hybrid discrete-continuous processes that are useful in discrete, continuous and hybrid [[control theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VsS0JkMcXGwC | title = Discrete, continuous, and hybrid Petri Nets | first1 = René | last1 = David | first2 = Hassane | last2 = Alla | publisher = Springer | date = 2005 | isbn = 978-3-540-22480-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and related to discrete, continuous and hybrid [[automata theory|automata]].

==Extensions==
There are many extensions to Petri nets. Some of them are completely backwards-compatible (e.g. [[coloured Petri nets]]) with the original Petri net, some add properties that cannot be modelled in the original Petri net formalism (e.g. timed Petri nets). Although backwards-compatible models do not extend the computational power of Petri nets, they may have more succinct representations and may be more convenient for modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jensen|first1=Kurt|title=A brief introduction to colored Petri nets|url=http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~andersmo/petrinet/papers/cpn/brief.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions that cannot be transformed into Petri nets are sometimes very powerful, but usually lack the full range of mathematical tools available to analyse ordinary Petri nets.

The term  [[high-level Petri net]] is used for many Petri net formalisms that extend the basic P/T net formalism; this includes coloured Petri nets, hierarchical Petri nets such as [[Nets within Nets]], and all other extensions sketched in this section.  The term is also used specifically for the type of coloured nets supported by [[CPN Tools]].

A short list of possible extensions:

*Additional types of arcs; two common types are:
**a ''reset arc'' does not impose a precondition on firing, and empties the place when the transition fires; this makes reachability undecidable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = T. | last1 = Araki | first2 = T. | last2 = Kasami | title = Some Decision Problems Related to the Reachability Problem for Petri Nets | journal = Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–104 | date = 1977 | doi=10.1016/0304-3975(76)90067-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some other properties, such as termination, remain decidable;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = C. | last1 = Dufourd | first2 = A. | last2 = Finkel | first3 = Ph. | last3 =Schnoebelen | chapter = Reset Nets Between Decidability and Undecidability | title = Proceedings of the 25th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science|LNCS]] | volume = 1443 | pages = 103–115 | date = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**an ''inhibitor arc'' imposes the precondition that the transition may only fire when the place is empty; this allows arbitrary computations on numbers of tokens to be expressed, which makes the formalism [[Turing complete]] and implies existence of a universal net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zaitsev | first = D. A. | title = Toward the Minimal Universal Petri Net | journal = IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems | date = 2013 | pages = 1–12 | doi = 10.1109/TSMC.2012.2237549 | volume=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a standard Petri net, tokens are indistinguishable.  In a [[Coloured Petri net]], every token has a value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.daimi.au.dk/CPnets/intro/verybrief.html | title = Very Brief Introduction to CP-nets | publisher = Department of Computer Science, University of Aarhus, Denmark }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In popular tools for coloured Petri nets such as [[CPN Tools]], the values of tokens are typed, and can be tested (using ''guard'' expressions) and manipulated with a [[functional programming language]]. A subsidiary of coloured Petri nets are the [[well-formed Petri net]]s, where the arc and guard expressions are restricted to make it easier to analyse the net.
*Another popular extension of Petri nets is hierarchy; this in the form of different views supporting levels of refinement and abstraction was studied by Fehling. Another form of hierarchy is found in so-called object Petri nets or object systems  where a Petri net can contain Petri nets as its tokens inducing a hierarchy of nested Petri nets that communicate by synchronisation of transitions on different levels. See&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://llpn.com/OPNs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103131745/http://www.llpn.com/OPNs.html |archivedate=2005-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for an informal introduction to object Petri nets.
*A [[Vector addition system|vector addition system with states (VASS)]] is an equivalent formalism to Petri nets.  However, it can be superficially viewed as a generalisation of Petri nets. Consider a [[finite state automaton]] where each transition is labelled by a transition from the Petri net. The Petri net is then synchronised with the finite state automaton, i.e., a transition in the automaton is taken at the same time as the corresponding transition in the Petri net. It is only possible to take a transition in the automaton if the corresponding transition in the Petri net is enabled, and it is only possible to fire a transition in the Petri net if there is a transition from the current state in the automaton labelled by it. (The definition of VASS is usually formulated slightly differently.)
*[[Prioritised Petri net]]s add priorities to transitions, whereby a transition cannot fire, if a higher-priority transition is enabled (i.e. can fire). Thus, transitions are in priority groups, and e.g. priority group 3 can only fire if all transitions are disabled in groups 1 and 2. Within a priority group, firing is ''still'' non-deterministic.
*The non-deterministic property has been a very valuable one, as it lets the user abstract a large number of properties (depending on what the net is used for). In certain cases, however, the need arises to also model the timing, not only the structure of a model. For these cases, [[timed Petri nets]] have evolved, where there are transitions that are timed, and possibly transitions which are not timed (if there are, transitions that are not timed have a higher priority than timed ones). A subsidiary of timed Petri nets are the [[stochastic Petri net]]s that add [[nondeterministic time]] through adjustable randomness of the transitions. The [[Exponential distribution|exponential random distribution]] is usually used to 'time' these nets. In this case, the nets' reachability graph can be used as a continuous time [[Markov chain]] (CTMC).
*[[Dualistic Petri Nets]] (dP-Nets) is a Petri Net extension developed by E. Dawis, et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Dawis | first1 = E. P. | first2 = J. F. | last2 = Dawis | first3 = Wei-Pin | last3 = Koo | date = 2001 | title = Architecture of Computer-based Systems using Dualistic Petri Nets | conference = 2001 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics | volume = 3 | pages = 1554–1558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to better represent real-world process.  dP-Nets balance the duality of change/no-change, action/passivity, (transformation) time/space, etc., between the bipartite Petri Net constructs of transformation and place resulting in the unique characteristic of ''transformation marking'', i.e., when the transformation is "working" it is marked.  This allows for the transformation to fire (or be marked) multiple times representing the real-world behavior of process throughput.  Marking of the transformation assumes that transformation time must be greater than zero.  A zero transformation time used in many typical Petri Nets may be mathematically appealing but impractical in representing real-world processes.  dP-Nets also exploit the power of Petri Nets' hierarchical abstraction to depict [[Process architecture]].  Complex process systems are modeled as a series of simpler nets interconnected through various levels of hierarchical abstraction.  The process architecture of a packet switch is demonstrated in,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Dawis | first = E. P. | date = 2001 | title = Architecture of an SS7 Protocol Stack on a Broadband Switch Platform using Dualistic Petri Nets | conference = 2001 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and signal Processing | volume = 1 | pages = 323–326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where development requirements are organized around the structure of the designed system.

There are many more extensions to Petri nets, however, it is important to keep in mind, that as the complexity of the net increases in terms of extended properties, the harder it is to use standard tools to evaluate certain properties of the net. For this reason, it is a good idea to use the most simple net type possible for a given modelling task.

== Restrictions ==
[[Image:petri net types.svg|thumb|Petri net types graphically]]

Instead of extending the Petri net formalism, we can also look at restricting it, and look at particular types of Petri nets, obtained by restricting the syntax in a particular way.  Ordinary Petri nets are the nets where all arc weights are 1.  Restricting further, the following types of ordinary Petri nets are commonly used and studied:

# In a [[state machine]] (SM), every transition has one incoming arc, and one outgoing arc, and all markings have exactly one token. As a consequence, there can ''not'' be ''concurrency'', but there can be ''conflict'' (i.e. [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation|nondeterminism]]). Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\forall t\in T: |t^\bullet|=|{}^\bullet t|=1&lt;/math&gt;
# In a [[marked graph]] (MG), every place has one incoming arc, and one outgoing arc. This means, that there can ''not'' be ''conflict'', but there can be ''concurrency''. Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\forall s\in S: |s^\bullet|=|{}^\bullet s|=1&lt;/math&gt;
# In a ''free choice'' net (FC), – every arc from a place to a transition is either the only arc from that place or the only arc to that transition. I.e. there can be ''both concurrency and conflict, but not at the same time''. Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\forall s\in S: (|s^\bullet|\leq 1) \vee ({}^\bullet (s^\bullet)=\{s\})&lt;/math&gt;
# Extended free choice (EFC) – a Petri net that can be ''transformed into an FC''.
# In an ''asymmetric choice'' net (AC), concurrency and conflict (in sum, ''confusion'') may occur, but ''not symmetrically''. Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\forall s_1,s_2\in S: (s_1{}^\bullet \cap s_2{}^\bullet\neq \emptyset) \to [(s_1{}^\bullet\subseteq s_2{}^\bullet) \vee (s_2{}^\bullet\subseteq s_1{}^\bullet)]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- the next definition needs to be cleaned up by someone who understands what is meant here
# In a ''multiple asymmetric choice'' net (MAC), multiple concurrency and conflict (in sum, ''multiple confusion'') may occur, but no ''confusion''. Mathematically: ''for a set |P|=k,'' &lt;math&gt;\forall t\in T &lt;/math&gt; exist a subset &lt;math&gt; {}^\bullet t,&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; {}^\bullet T &lt;/math&gt; contains all subsets and is the powerset 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; without the empty subset
--&gt;

==Work flow nets==
[[Workflow net]]s (WF-nets) are a subclass of Petri nets intending to model the [[workflow]] of process activities.&lt;ref name="Aalst,1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last = van der Aalst | first = W. M. P. | date = 1998 | url = http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~wvdaalst/publications/p53.pdf | title = The application of Petri nets to workflow management | journal = Journal of Circuits, Systems and Computers | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–66 | doi=10.1142/s0218126698000043| citeseerx = 10.1.1.30.3125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The WF-net transitions are assigned to tasks or activities, and places are assigned to the pre/post conditions.
The WF-nets have additional structural and operational requirements, mainly the addition of a single input (source) place with no previous transitions, and output place (sink) with no following transitions. Accordingly, start and termination markings can be defined that represent the process status.

WF-nets have the '''soundness''' property,&lt;ref name="Aalst,1998" /&gt; indicating that a process with a start marking of k tokens in its source place, can reach the termination state marking with k tokens in its sink place (defined as K-sound WF-net). Additionally, all the transitions in the process could fire (i.e., for each transition there is a reachable state in which the transition is enabled). 
A general sound (G-sound) WF-net is defined as being K-sound for every k&gt;0.&lt;ref name="Hee et al., 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = van Hee | first1 = K. | last2 = Sidorova | first2 = N. | last3 = Voorhoeve | first3 = M. | date = 2003 | chapter-url = http://www.win.tue.nl/~sidorova/03/van_Hee_Sidorova_Voorhoeve.pdf | chapter = Soundness and separability of workflow nets in the stepwise refinement approach | editor1-last = van der Aalst | editor1-first = W. M. P. | editor2-last = Best | editor2-first =E. | title = Application and Theory of Petri Nets 2003 | series = Lect Notes in Comput Sci | volume = 2678 | pages = 337–356 | publisher = Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A directed '''[[Path (graph theory)|path]]''' in the Petri net is defined as the sequence of nodes (places and transitions) linked by the directed arcs. An '''elementary path''' includes every node in the sequence only once.

A '''Well-handled''' Petri net is a net in which there are no fully distinct elementary paths between a place and a transition (or transition and a place), i.e., if there are two paths between the pair of node then these paths share a node.
An acyclic well-handled WF-net is sound (G-sound).&lt;ref name="Ping et al., 2004"&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Ping | first1 = L. | last2 = Hao | first2 = H. | last3 = Jian | first3 =L. | date = 2004 | title = On 1-soundness and soundness of workflow nets | editor-first = Daniel | editor-last = Moldt | conference = Proc of the 3rd Workshop on Modelling of Objects, Components, and Agents | location = Aarhus, Denmark | publisher = DAIMI PB | volume = 571 | pages = 21–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extended WF-net is a Petri net that is composed of a WF-net with additional transition t (feedback transition). The sink place is connected as the input place of transition t and the source place as its output place. Firing of the transition causes iteration of the process (Note: the extended WF-net is not a WF-net).&lt;ref name="Aalst,1998" /&gt; 
 
WRI (Well-handled with Regular Iteration) WF-net, is an extended acyclic well-handled WF-net.  
WRI-WF-net can be built as composition of nets, i.e., replacing a transition within a WRI-WF-net with a subnet which is a WRI-WF-net. The result is also WRI-WF-net. WRI-WF-nets are G-sound,&lt;ref name="Ping et al., 2004" /&gt; therefore by using only WRI-WF-net building blocks, one can get WF-nets that are G-sound by construction.

The [[Design structure matrix]] (DSM) can model process relations, and be utilized for process planning. The '''DSM-nets''' are realization of DSM-based plans into workflow processes by Petri nets, and are equivalent to WRI-WF-nets. The DSM-net construction process ensures the soundness property of the resulting net.

==Other models of concurrency==

Other ways of modelling concurrent computation have been proposed, including [[process algebra]], the [[actor model]], and [[trace theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Antoni | last = Mazurkiewicz | chapter = Introduction to Trace Theory | title = The Book of Traces | editor1-first = V. | editor1-last = Diekert | editor2-first = G. | editor2-last = Rozenberg | publisher = World Scientific | location = Singapore | date = 1995 | pages = 3–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different models provide tradeoffs of concepts such as [[compositionality]], [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]], and locality.

An approach to relating some of these models of concurrency is proposed in the chapter by Winskel and Nielsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = G. | last1 = Winskel | first2 = M. | last2 = Nielsen | chapter-url = http://www.daimi.au.dk/PB/463/PB-463.pdf | chapter = Models for Concurrency | title = Handbook of Logic and the Foundations of Computer Science | volume = 4 | pages = 1–148 | publisher = OUP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pitch''' is a [[perception|perceptual]] property of [[sound]]s that allows their ordering on a [[frequency]]-related [[scale (music)|scale]],&lt;ref&gt;Anssi Klapuri, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=AF30yR41GIAC&amp;pg=PA8 Introduction to Music Transcription]", in ''Signal Processing Methods for Music Transcription'', edited by Anssi Klapuri and Manuel Davy, 1–20 (New York: Springer, 2006): p.&amp;nbsp;8. {{ISBN|978-0-387-30667-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
or more commonly, pitch is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as "higher" and "lower" in the sense associated with musical [[melody|melodies]].&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = For the purposes of this book we decided to take a conservative approach, and to focus on the relationship between pitch and musical melodies.  Following the earlier ASA definition, we define pitch as 'that attribute of sensation whose variation is associated with musical melodies.' Although some might find this too restrictive, an advantage of this definition is that it provides a clear procedure for testing whether or not a stimulus evokes a pitch, and a clear limitation on the range of stimuli that we need to consider in our discussions.

Pitch can be determined only in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from [[noise]].&lt;ref&gt;Harold S.

"Melody: In the most general case, a coherent succession of pitches.  Here pitch means a stretch of sound whose frequency is clear and stable enough to be heard as not noise; succession means that several pitches occur; and coherent means that the succession of pitches is accepted as belonging together" (p. 499).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pitch is a major [[auditory system|auditory]] attribute of [[musical tone]]s, along with [[duration (music)|duration]], [[loudness]], and [[timbre]].&lt;ref&gt;

Pitch may be quantified as a [[frequency]], but pitch is not a purely objective physical property; it is a subjective [[Psychoacoustics|psychoacoustical]] attribute of sound. Historically, the study of pitch and pitch perception has been a central problem in psychoacoustics, and has been instrumental in forming and testing theories of sound representation, processing, and perception in the auditory system.&lt;ref name=hartmann&gt;{{Cite book| title = Signals, Sound, and Sensation | last= Hartmann |first= William Morris| publisher = Springer | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-1-56396-283-7 | pages = 145, 284, 287 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3N72rIoTHiEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=William+M.+Hartmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception of pitch==

===Pitch and frequency===
Pitch is an auditory sensation in which a listener assigns [[musical tone]]s to relative positions on a [[musical scale]] based primarily on their perception of the [[frequency]] of vibration.&lt;ref name=plack&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitch is closely related to frequency, but the two are not equivalent. Frequency is an objective, scientific attribute that can be measured. Pitch is each person's ''subjective perception'' of a sound wave, which cannot be directly measured. However, this does not necessarily mean that most people won't agree on which notes are higher and lower.

The [[oscillations]] of sound waves can often be characterized in terms of ''frequency''. ''Pitches'' are usually &lt;u&gt;associated with&lt;/u&gt;, and thus &lt;u&gt;quantified as&lt;/u&gt;, ''frequencies'' (in cycles per second, or hertz), by comparing the sounds being assessed against sounds with [[pure tone]]s (ones with [[Period (physics)|periodic]], [[sinusoidal]] waveforms). Complex and aperiodic sound waves can often be assigned a ''pitch'' by this method.&lt;ref&gt;

According to the [[American National Standards Institute]], pitch is the auditory attribute of sound according to which sounds can be ordered on a scale from low to high. Since pitch is such a close [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] for frequency, it is almost entirely determined by how quickly the sound wave is making the air vibrate and has almost nothing to do with the intensity, or [[amplitude]], of the wave. That is, "high" pitch means very rapid oscillation, and "low" pitch corresponds to slower oscillation. Despite that, the [[idiom]] relating vertical height to sound pitch is shared by most languages.&lt;ref name="pratt1930"/&gt; At least in English, it is just one of many deep conceptual metaphors that involve up/down. The exact etymological history of the musical sense of high and low pitch is still unclear. There is evidence that humans do actually perceive that the source of a sound is slightly higher or lower in vertical space when the sound frequency is increased or reduced.&lt;ref name="pratt1930"&gt;Carroll C. Pratt, "[http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/pratt30.htm The Spatial Character of High and Low Tones]", ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'' 13 (1930): 278–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, the pitch of complex sounds such as [[Speech communication|speech]] and [[musical note]]s corresponds very nearly to the repetition rate of periodic or nearly-periodic sounds, or to the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the time interval between repeating similar events in the sound waveform.&lt;ref name=goldstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=lyon/&gt;

The pitch of complex tones can be ambiguous, meaning that two or more different pitches can be perceived, depending upon the observer.&lt;ref name=hartmann/&gt; When the actual [[fundamental frequency]] can be precisely determined through physical measurement, it may differ from the perceived pitch because of [[overtones]], also known as upper partials, [[harmonic]] or otherwise. A complex tone composed of two sine waves of 1000 and 1200&amp;nbsp;Hz may sometimes be heard as up to three pitches: two spectral pitches at 1000 and 1200&amp;nbsp;Hz, derived from the physical frequencies of the pure tones, and the [[combination tone]] at 200&amp;nbsp;Hz, corresponding to the repetition rate of the waveform. In a situation like this, the percept at 200&amp;nbsp;Hz is commonly referred to as the [[missing fundamental]], which is often the [[greatest common divisor]] of the frequencies present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=David A.|author2=Dale Purves|title=Pitch Is Determined by Naturally Occurring Periodic Sounds|journal=Hearing Research|date=May 2004|volume=194|issue=1–2|pages=31–46|doi=10.1016/j.heares.2004.01.019|pmid=15276674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitch depends to a lesser degree on the [[sound pressure]] level (loudness, volume) of the tone, especially at frequencies below 1,000&amp;nbsp;Hz and above 2,000&amp;nbsp;Hz. The pitch of lower tones gets lower as sound pressure increases. For instance, a tone of 200&amp;nbsp;Hz that is very loud seems one semitone lower in pitch than if it is just barely audible. Above 2,000&amp;nbsp;Hz, the pitch gets higher as the sound gets louder.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; These results were obtained in the pioneering works by S.Stevens &lt;ref name=stevens1935&gt;Stevens S. S. The relation of pitch to intensity//J. Acoust. Soc. Amer. 1935. Vol. 6. P. 150-154.&lt;/ref&gt; and W.Snow &lt;ref name=snow&gt; Snow W. B. (1936) Change of Pitch with Loudness at Low Frequencies. J. Acoust. Soc. Am/ 8:14-19.&lt;/ref&gt;. Later investigations, i.e. by A.Cohen, had shown that in most cases the apparent pitch shifts were not significantly different from pitch‐matching errors. When averaged, the remaining shifts followed the directions of Stevens' curves but were small (2% or less by frequency, i.e. not more than a semitone)&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;Cohen, A. (1961).

===Theories of pitch perception===

[[Scientific theory|Theories]] of pitch perception try to explain how the physical sound and specific physiology of the auditory system work together to yield the experience of pitch. In general, pitch perception theories can be divided into [[Place theory (hearing)|place coding]] and [[Temporal theory (hearing)|temporal coding]]. Place theory holds that the perception of pitch is determined by the place of maximum excitation on the [[basilar membrane]].

A place code, taking advantage of the [[tonotopy]] in the auditory system, must be in effect for the perception of high frequencies, since neurons have an upper limit on how fast they can phase-lock their [[action potential]]s.&lt;ref name=plack /&gt; However, a purely place-based theory cannot account for the accuracy of pitch perception in the low and middle frequency ranges.

Temporal theories offer an alternative that appeals to the temporal structure of action potentials, mostly the [[Circle map|phase-locking]] and [[Arnold tongue#Mode locking|mode-locking]] of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus. The precise way this temporal structure helps code for pitch at higher levels is still debated, but the processing seems to be based on an [[autocorrelation]] of action potentials in the auditory nerve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cariani|first=P.A.|author2=Delgutte, B. |title=Neural Correlates of the Pitch of Complex Tones.

===Just-noticeable difference===

The ''[[just-noticeable difference|just-noticeable difference (jnd)]]'' (the [[Sensory threshold|threshold]] at which a change is perceived) depends on the tone's frequency content.  Below 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, the jnd is about 3&amp;nbsp;Hz for sine waves, and 1&amp;nbsp;Hz for complex tones; above 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, the jnd for sine waves is about 0.6% (about 10 [[Cent (music)|cents]]).&lt;ref&gt;

The '''jnd''' is typically tested by playing two tones in quick succession with the listener asked if there was a difference in their pitches.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music, Physics and Engineering |last=Olson |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F.

===Aural illusions===

The relative perception of pitch can be fooled, resulting in ''[[aural illusion]]s''. There are several of these, such as the [[tritone paradox]], but most notably the [[Shepard scale]], where a continuous or discrete sequence of specially formed tones can be made to sound as if the sequence continues ascending or descending forever.

==Definite and indefinite pitch== &lt;!--[[Definite pitch]], "Indefinite pitch", and "Indeterminate pitch" all redirect to this section heading--&gt;

Not all musical instruments make notes with a clear pitch. The [[unpitched percussion instrument]] (a class of [[percussion instrument]]) does not produce particular pitches. A sound or note of '''definite pitch''' is one where a listener can possibly (or relatively easily) discern the pitch. Sounds with definite pitch have [[harmonic]] [[frequency spectrum|frequency spectra]] or close to harmonic spectra.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt;

A sound generated on any instrument produces many modes of vibration that occur simultaneously. A listener hears numerous frequencies at once. The vibration with the lowest frequency is called the ''[[fundamental frequency]]''; the other frequencies are ''[[overtones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  | quote = "The one with the slowest vibration rate—the one lowest in pitch—is referred to as the fundamental frequency, and the others are collectively called overtones."}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Harmonics]]'' are an important class of overtones with frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental. Whether or not the higher frequencies are integer multiples, they are collectively called the [[Harmonic series (music)#Partial|partials]], referring to the different parts that make up the total spectrum.

A sound or note of '''indefinite pitch''' is one that a listener finds impossible or relatively difficult to identify as to pitch. Sounds with indefinite pitch do not have harmonic spectra or have altered harmonic spectra—a characteristic known as [[inharmonicity]].

It is still possible for two sounds of indefinite pitch to clearly be higher or lower than one another. For instance, a [[snare drum]] sounds higher pitched than a [[bass drum]] though both have indefinite pitch, because its sound contains higher frequencies. In other words, it is possible and often easy to roughly discern the relative pitches of two sounds of indefinite pitch, but sounds of indefinite pitch do not neatly correspond to any specific pitch.
A special type of pitch often occurs in free nature when sound reaches the ear of an observer directly from the source, and also after reflecting off a sound-reflecting surface. This phenomenon is called ''[[repetition pitch]]'', because the addition of a true repetition of the original sound to itself is the basic prerequisite.

==Pitch standards and Standard pitch==

{{Main|Concert pitch}}

A pitch standard (also [[Concert pitch]]) is the conventional pitch reference a group of [[musical instrument]]s are tuned to for a performance. Concert pitch may vary from ensemble to ensemble, and has varied widely over musical history.

{{listen|filename=Sine wave 440.ogg|title=440&amp;nbsp;Hz}}

Standard pitch is a more widely accepted convention. The '''A''' above [[middle C]] is usually set at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz (often written as "A = [[A440 (pitch standard)|440&amp;nbsp;Hz]]" or sometimes "A440"), although other frequencies, such as 442&amp;nbsp;Hz, are also often used as variants. Another standard pitch, the so-called ''Baroque pitch'', has been set in the 20th century as A = 415&amp;nbsp;Hz—approximately an equal-tempered semitone lower than A440 to facilitate transposition.

[[Transposing instruments]] have their origin in the variety of pitch standards. In modern times, they conventionally have their [[Part (music)|parts]] transposed into different [[key signatures|keys]] from voices and other instruments (and even from each other). As a result, musicians need a way to refer to a particular pitch in an unambiguous manner when talking to each other.

For example, the most common type of [[clarinet]] or [[trumpet]], when playing a note written in their [[Part (music)|part]] as C, sounds a pitch that is called B{{music|flat}} on a non-transposing instrument like a violin (which indicates that at one time these wind instruments played at a standard pitch a tone lower than violin pitch). To refer to that pitch unambiguously, a musician calls it ''concert B{{music|flat}}'', meaning, "...the pitch that someone playing a non-transposing instrument like a violin calls B{{music|flat}}."

==Labeling pitches==

[[File:Music frequency diatonic scale-3.svg|thumb|350px|right|Note frequencies, four-octave C major diatonic scale, starting with [[C (musical note)|C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]].]]
Pitches are labeled using:
* Letters, as in [[Helmholtz pitch notation]]&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Grove Dictionary of Music: ''[http://www.answers.com/topic/hermann-von-helmholtz Hermann von Helmholtz], Oxford University Press (1994), ''Answers.com''. Retrieved 3 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helmholtz|first1=Hermann|title=On the Sensations of Tone (English Translation)|date=1885|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2CiqYQXZjIYC&amp;pg=PA15|isbn=9781602066397}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A combination of letters and numbers—as in [[scientific pitch notation]], where notes are labelled upwards from C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the 16&amp;nbsp;Hz C
* Numbers that represent the frequency in [[hertz]] (Hz), the number of cycles per second
For example, one might refer to the A above middle C as ''a′'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'', or ''440&amp;nbsp;Hz''. In standard Western [[equal temperament]], the notion of pitch is insensitive to "spelling": the description "G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; double sharp" refers to the same pitch as ''A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''; in other temperaments, these may be distinct pitches.
Human perception of musical intervals is approximately logarithmic with respect to [[fundamental frequency]]: the perceived interval between the pitches "A220" and "A440" is the same as the perceived interval between the pitches ''A440'' and ''A880''.  Motivated by this logarithmic perception, music theorists sometimes represent pitches using a numerical scale based on the logarithm of fundamental frequency.  For example, one can adopt the widely used [[MIDI]] standard to map fundamental frequency, ''f'', to a real number, ''p'', as follows
:&lt;math&gt;
p = 69 + 12\times\log_2 { \left(\frac {f}{440 \mbox{ Hz}} \right) }
&lt;/math&gt;
This creates a linear [[pitch space]] in which octaves have size 12, semitones (the distance between adjacent keys on the piano keyboard) have size 1, and A440 is assigned the number 69. (See [[Frequencies of notes]].) Distance in this space corresponds to musical intervals as understood by musicians. An equal-tempered semitone is subdivided into 100 [[Cent (music)|cents]]. The system is flexible enough to include "microtones" not found on standard piano keyboards. For example, the pitch halfway between C (60) and C{{music|sharp}} (61) can be labeled 60.5.

The following table shows frequencies in Hz for notes in various octaves, named according to the [[Helmholtz pitch notation#Staff representation|"German method" of octave nomenclature]]:

==Scales==

The relative pitches of individual notes in a [[scale (music)|scale]] may be determined by one of a number of [[musical tuning|tuning]] systems. In the west, the twelve-note [[chromatic scale]] is the most common method of organization, with [[equal temperament]] now the most widely used method of tuning that scale. In it, the pitch ratio between any two successive notes of the scale is exactly the twelfth root of two (or about 1.05946). In [[well temperament|well-tempered]] systems (as used in the time of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], for example), different methods of [[musical tuning]] were used. Almost all of these systems have one [[interval (music)|interval]] in common, the [[octave]], where the pitch of one note is double the frequency of another. For example, if the A above middle C is 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, the A an octave above that is {{Audio-nohelp|Tone 880Hz.ogg|880&amp;nbsp;Hz}}.

==Other musical meanings of pitch==

In [[atonal]], [[twelve tone technique|twelve tone]], or [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] a "pitch" is a specific frequency while a [[pitch class]] is all the octaves of a frequency. In many analytic discussions of atonal and post-tonal music, pitches are named with [[integer]]s because of octave and enharmonic equivalency (for example, in a serial system, C{{music|sharp}} and D{{music|flat}} are considered the same pitch, while C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; are functionally the same, one octave apart).

Discrete pitches, rather than continuously variable pitches, are virtually universal, with exceptions including "[[Shout-and-fall|tumbling strains]]"&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In ''The Wellsprings of Music'', edited by J. Kunst. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff. Cited in Burns (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and "indeterminate-pitch chants".&lt;ref&gt;Malm, W.P. (1967).

Cited in Burns (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Gliding pitches are used in most cultures, but are related to the discrete pitches they reference or embellish.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Edward M. (1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4174">In philosophy and rhetoric, the '''principle of charity''' or '''charitable interpretation''' requires interpreting a speaker's statements in the most rational way possible and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Normand Baillargeon: ''Intellectual Self-Defense''. Seven Stories Press 2007, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In its narrowest sense, the goal of this methodological principle is to avoid attributing irrationality, [[logical fallacies]], or falsehoods to the others' statements, when a coherent, rational interpretation of the statements is available.

==Application==
Neil L. Wilson gave the principle its name in 1958–59. Its main area of application, by his lights, is determining the referent of a proper name:
&lt;blockquote&gt;How should we set about discovering the significance which a person attaches to a given name? […] Let us suppose that somebody (whom I am calling "Charles") makes just the following five assertions containing the name "Caesar." […]&lt;br/&gt;
(1) Caesar conquered Gaul. (Gc) &lt;br/&gt;
(2) Caesar crossed the Rubicon. (Rc) &lt;br/&gt;
(3) Caesar was murdered on the Ides of March. (Mc) &lt;br/&gt;
(4) Caesar was addicted to the use of the ablative absolute. (Ac)&lt;br/&gt;
(5) Caesar was married to Boadicea. (Bc)&lt;br/&gt;
[…] And so we act on what might be called the Principle of Charity. We select as designatum that individual which will make the largest possible number of Charles' statements true. […] We might say the designatum is that individual which satisfies more of the asserted matrices containing the word "Caesar" than does any other individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide other formulations of the principle of charity. Davidson sometimes referred to it as ''the principle of rational accommodation''. He summarized it: ''We make maximum sense of the words and thoughts of others when we interpret in a way that optimises agreement''. The principle may be invoked to make sense of a speaker's utterances when one is unsure of their meaning. In particular, Quine's use of the principle gives it this latter, wide domain.

Since the time of Quine ''et al.'', other philosophers{{Who|date=August 2011}} have formulated at least four versions of the principle of charity. These alternatives may conflict with one another, so which principle to use may depend on the goal of the conversation. The four principles are:

#The other uses words in the ordinary way;
#The other makes true statements;
#The other makes valid arguments;
#The other says something interesting.

A related principle is the [[principle of humanity]], which states that we must assume that another speaker's beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her "the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances" ([[Daniel Dennett]], "Mid-Term Examination," in ''The Intentional Stance'', p.&amp;nbsp;343).

==Robosquirrels==

===Background===
[[Donald H. Owings|Donald Owings]] observed an interesting phenomenon during research in the field: when a [[California ground squirrel]] comes across a [[rattlesnake]], it often raises its tail and waves it from side to side.&lt;ref name = Kobashi&gt;
{{cite news|last=Kobashi|first=Kerry|title=Robo Squirrel: Your Tax Dollars In Action|url=http://www.kerryonworld.com/government/robo-squirrel-your-tax-dollars-in-action|accessdate=8 February 2013|newspaper=Kerry On World|date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Owings (Department of Psychology and his graduate student at the time, Aaron Rundus, began collaborating with Sanjay Joshi (Department of Mechanical/Aeronautical Engineering) at [[University of California, Davis]]. They used an [[Thermographic camera|infrared camera]] to [[videotape]] how snakes and squirrels behaviorally interact. They found that a squirrel shunts blood to its tail and thereby heats it up when encountering a rattlesnake but not for non-poisonous snakes.&lt;ref name = Kobashi/&gt;&lt;ref name = Rundus&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Rundus|first=Aaron S.|author2=Donald H. Owings |author3=Sanjay S. Joshi |author4=Erin Chinn |author5=Nicolas Giannini |title=Ground squirrels use an infrared signal to deter rattlesnake predation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2007|volume=104|issue=36|pages=14372–14376|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/36/14372|doi=10.1073/pnas.0702599104 |pmid=17704254 |pmc=1950100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rattlesnakes were known to use [[Rattlesnake#Sensory organs|infrared radiation]] to detect prey, but what they discovered suggests that the squirrels evolved the ability to communicate with rattlesnakes by heating up their tails and thereby signalling with infrared radiation.&lt;ref name = Rundus/&gt;

To test this hypothesis, they built a robotic squirrel (robosquirrel) that could behaviorally respond to rattlesnakes when they moved. They found that when robosquirrel waved a heated tail in response to the movement of a rattlesnake, the snake became defensive (i.e., it moved away from the robotic squirrel) rather than predatory. If robosquirrel waved an unheated tail, then the rattlesnake continued its predatory behavior.&lt;ref name = Rundus/&gt;

The next step was to determine whether squirrel behavior when rattlesnakes had not been encountered reduced the predatory behavior of rattlesnakes waiting in ambush. They video-recorded predatory behavior of rattlesnakes when ground squirrels flagged their tails. The researchers found that tail-flagging decreased the likelihood that rattlesnakes would strike and increased the likelihood that they would move away from that area.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Barbour|first=M. A.|author2=Clark R. W. |title=Ground squirrel tail-flag displays alter both predatory strike and ambush site selection behaviours of rattlesnakes|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|year=2012|volume=279|issue=1743|pages=3827–3833|doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.1112|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1743/3827.long|accessdate=10 February 2013|pmid=22787023|pmc=3415919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They found that California ground squirrels are actually performing two types of tail flagging: ''vigilance advertising'' and ''perception advertising''. Vigilance advertising is hypothesized to occur when a squirrel enters an area that may contain rattlesnakes. By tail flagging, a squirrel may be signaling to a snake that it is vigilant and prepared to dodge any attacks. Perception advertising is hypothesized to occur when a squirrel encounters a rattlesnake and its tail flagging functions to signal to the snake that it is prepared to respond to attack and to warn other squirrels of the presence of rattlesnakes.&lt;ref name = NSFa/&gt;

To test these hypotheses about the function of tail flagging, they built robosquirrel to record encounters with rattlesnakes. Robosquirrel was programmed to wag its tail in the presence of a snake and its tail temperature can increase above its body temperature when it encounters snakes. The robosquirrel behaviors presented to rattlesnakes in naturalistic contexts can be precisely controlled. This control of behavior is impossible with living squirrels and so robosquirrel allows researchers to investigate how rattlesnakes respond to specific behaviors.&lt;ref name = NSFa/&gt;

===Versions===

====Laboratory RoboSquirrel====
The first robosquirrel was built using a taxidermically mounted adult female California ground squirrel.&lt;ref name = Rundus/&gt; The tail was moved by a [[servo motor|servo]], which allowed robosquirrel to flag it tail at specified intervals. [[MATLAB]] software via a mini synchronous serial channel [[microcontroller]], controlled the tail-flagging of robosquirrel.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

To control the temperature of the interior of robosquirrel’s body, a coiled [[Nichrome]] 80 resistance wire was inserted and a [[cartridge heater]] was inserted into its tail. The temperature of the Nichrome wire and the cartridge heater were controlled by [[thermostat]]s wired with [[thermocouple]]s that were placed inside its body and tail. Power to the two heaters was regulated via the thermostats by using a [[PID controller|proportional-integral differential]] (PID) control loop to regulate the [[duty cycle]] of the power relays.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

An overhead camera videotaped the arena in which robosquirrel was mounted on a wooden stage beneath which were the theromostats and heater [[relays]]. A Rattlesnake was marked by attaching a small red [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) it. When a snake entered the arena, the images from the arena were analyzed by a [[Computer program|program]] written in MATLAB that determined the distance between the squirrel and the LED. The program then calculated the rate of tail flagging based on the distance between the LED and robosquirrel. As the distance between the squirrel and LED on the rattlesnake decreased, robosquirrel increased its rate of tail flagging. The rates of tail flagging were based on previous field observations.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hennessy|first=D. F. |author2=D. H. Owings |author3=M. P. Rowe |author4=R.

Leger|title=he information afforded by a variable signal: Constraints on snake-elicited tail flagging by California ground squirrels|journal=Behaviour|year=1981|volume=78|issue=3/4|pages=188–226|doi=10.1163/156853981X00329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Field RoboSquirrels====

=====First Version=====
The first version of the field robosquirrel was a modification of the laboratory robosquirrel. The heating system of laboratory robosquirrel was repackaged in a toolbox for easy transportation and a [[Duracell]] Power-pack [[Power inverter|inverter]] provided power for the heaters and thermostats. Instead of using a desktop computer to process images and control tail flagging, an 8-b radio controller allowed a remote control to be used instead.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

Testing of robosquirrel was conducted at the Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve (SMER) near [[Fallbrook, California|Fallbrook]], [[California]], operated by [[San Diego State University]]. Six [[Crotalus ruber|red diamond rattlesnakes]] (''Crotalus ruber'') were radio tagged for the study. For test trials, one observer positioned robosquirrel and controlled its tail flagging, while another observer monitored the rattlesnake’s response to robosquirrel.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

The researchers, however, ran into problems. First, the outdoor robosquirrel was heavy and difficult to transport, requiring two or three people to carry it. Robosquirrel had to be moved across rough terrain and, at the same time, the researchers had to watch out for [[venomous snake]]s, [[tarantula]]s, and [[Cougar|mountain lions]]. Second, rattlesnakes located themselves in a variety of ambush sites. Each site presented different challenges in setting up robosquirrel. The researchers concluded that they had to redesign robosquirrel to be less complicated to set up for each new habitat.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

=====Second Version=====
To redesign a more field-usable robosquirrel, custom electronics were developed to reduce bulk and weight. In addition to previous features, new features were added such as onboard cameras and [[Data logger|data logging]]. To reduce weight, all power sources were placed in a small box underneath robosquirrel.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

The new robosquirrel design used an ATmega128 [[microprocessor]] with 4 kB of data memory and 128 kB of program memory. The microprocessor was mounted on a custom designed, two-layer [[printed circuit board]] with a DB9 [[serial port]] for [[RS-232]] communication and an [[Secure Digital|SD]] card slot for data storage. The circuit board also had a [[Joint Test Action Group]] port for programming and [[radio control]] hardware. The main program ran in a loop that repeatedly checked for input from the remote control.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

Nichrome heating elements were controlled by [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) of [[transistor]]s. Tail flagging was controlled by a 16-b counter in fast-PWM compare-match mode connected to the same [[Hitec]] servo. For this version of robosquirrel, the tail servo was mounted inside robosquirrel, allowing more realistic tail-flagging. A premade receiver–transmitter kit Radio allowed user control of robosquirrel. A camera allowed for positioning of robosquirrel relative to a rattlesnake and for monitoring of a snake.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

Robosquirrel was deployed at Camp Ohlone in the [[Sunol Regional Wilderness|Sunol Regional Park]] in [[Sunol, California|Sunol]], California. This site was selected because it has large populations of ground squirrels and rattlesnakes. Seventeen snakes were captured and [[Radio-frequency identification|radio tagged]] so that they could be tracked. Initial results with the new robosquirrel indicated that rattlesnakes abandon their ambush sites more quickly when robosquirrel tail-flagged than when it did not as predicted.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

==Controversy==

===Wastebook===

In 2008, Senator Tom Coburn began releasing reports of what he considers wasteful federal spending. The first report was released on December 11, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Room|url=http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/index.cfm?p=pressreleases&amp;ContentType_id=d741b7a7-7863-4223-9904-8cb9378aa03a&amp;Group_id=7a55cb96-4639-4dac-8c0c-99a4a227bd3a&amp;MonthDisplay=0&amp;YearDisplay=2008|publisher=senate.gove|accessdate=8 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104232140/http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/index.cfm?p=pressreleases&amp;ContentType_id=d741b7a7-7863-4223-9904-8cb9378aa03a&amp;Group_id=7a55cb96-4639-4dac-8c0c-99a4a227bd3a&amp;MonthDisplay=0&amp;YearDisplay=2008|archivedate=4 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 12, 2010, Senator Coburn released the first report entitled "Wastebook 2010: A Guide to Some of the Most Wasteful Government Spending of 2010.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Room 2010|url=http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/index.cfm?p=pressreleases&amp;ContentType_id=d741b7a7-7863-4223-9904-8cb9378aa03a&amp;Group_id=7a55cb96-4639-4dac-8c0c-99a4a227bd3a&amp;MonthDisplay=0&amp;YearDisplay=2010|publisher=Senate.gov|accessdate=8 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104232138/http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/index.cfm?p=pressreleases&amp;ContentType_id=d741b7a7-7863-4223-9904-8cb9378aa03a&amp;Group_id=7a55cb96-4639-4dac-8c0c-99a4a227bd3a&amp;MonthDisplay=0&amp;YearDisplay=2010|archivedate=4 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 16, 2012, ''Wastebook 2012'' was released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coburn|first=Tom|title=Press Room: Wastebook 2012|url=http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ContentRecord_id=5c83f5a3-f92e-4002-b6f1-362a92feab61&amp;ContentType_id=d741b7a7-7863-4223-9904-8cb9378aa03a&amp;Group_id=7a55cb96-4639-4dac-8c0c-99a4a227bd3a&amp;YearDisplay=2012|accessdate=10 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104224535/http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ContentRecord_id=5c83f5a3-f92e-4002-b6f1-362a92feab61&amp;ContentType_id=d741b7a7-7863-4223-9904-8cb9378aa03a&amp;Group_id=7a55cb96-4639-4dac-8c0c-99a4a227bd3a&amp;YearDisplay=2012|archivedate=4 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; listing 100 instances in which over spending is claimed (note the table of contents only lists 10). The Robosquirrel project is seventh on the list.&lt;ref name ="Wastebook 2012"/&gt;

Senator Coburn's ''Wastebook'' series has been lauded as important tool for detecting wasteful federal spending and as guide for how to cut the [[United States public debt|U.S. deficit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Lauren|title=Sen.

===When robot squirrels attack – (CA) $325,000===
Senator Tom Colburn's ''Wastebook 2012'' listed robosquirrel as an example of wasteful government spending:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In this corner with a triangular-shaped head, a rattle on its tail, with a venomous bite is the rattlesnake.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
And in the other corner, whistling and chirping, covered in fur with a bushy tail, is the squirrel.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
These two critters are long-time adversaries. Squirrels are frequently preyed upon by the rattlesnakes, but the snakes rarely attack squirrels who are wagging their tales. When they do, they usually miss the fast moving squirrel.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
But what happens when a snake is confronted by a robot squirrel, built to look, act, and even smell like the real thing?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Researchers at San Diego State University and the University of California (Davis) spent a portion of a $325,000 National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to construct a robotic squirrel named “RoboSquirrel” to answer that question….
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
During these difficult fiscal times of massive deficits, paying $325,000 for a robot squirrel seems a bit squirrelly. (pp. 20–21)&lt;ref name ="Wastebook 2012"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The robosquirrel project was one of 10 projects listed in his October 15, 2012 press release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coburn|first=Tom|title=Coburn Releases Annual Report Highlighting Some of the Most Wasteful Government Spending in 2012|url=http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ContentRecord_id=3b872d11-b6b5-4f72-9a0f-f95c79c99b6f&amp;ContentType_id=d741b7a7-7863-4223-9904-8cb9378aa03a&amp;Group_id=7a55cb96-4639-4dac-8c0c-99a4a227bd3a|accessdate=9 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226064830/http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ContentRecord_id=3b872d11-b6b5-4f72-9a0f-f95c79c99b6f&amp;ContentType_id=d741b7a7-7863-4223-9904-8cb9378aa03a&amp;Group_id=7a55cb96-4639-4dac-8c0c-99a4a227bd3a|archivedate=26 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was singled out by many major news outlets as illustrated by the titles of news articles (e.g., "Robo-squirrel, video game on government pork list" in [[USA Today]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robo-squirrel, video game on government pork list|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/onpolitics/2012/10/16/tom-coburn-wasteful-government-spending/1636067/|accessdate=9 February 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name = CNNc/&gt;&lt;ref name = abcnewsc/&gt;&lt;ref name =foxnewsc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradford|first=Harry|title=Wastebook 2012: 'Robosquirrel,' Mars Menu Among Ways The Government Is Wasting Money|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/17/wastebook-2012-robosquirrel-goverment-waste_n_1973800.html|accessdate=9 February 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to criticism===
The main response to Senator Coburn's criticism that "During these difficult fiscal times of massive deficits, paying $325,000 for a robot squirrel seems a bit squirrelly" is that the robosquirrel (i.e., second field version) in question cost only a few hundred dollars.&lt;ref name = Kreuger/&gt; Most of the funding has gone toward the education of future scientists and engineers.&lt;ref name = facts/&gt;&lt;ref name = Kobashi/&gt;&lt;ref name = Clark/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Caitlin|title=Robotic squirrel is investment in education, not waste|url=http://www.thedailyaztec.com/2012/10/robotic-squirrel-is-investment-in-education-not-waste/|accessdate=15 March 2013|newspaper=The Daily Aztec|date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The science and engineering in the project furthers the advancement of biorobotics and the study of [[ethology|animal behavior]] and its evolution by building on previous research using biorobotics in animal behavior research.&lt;ref name = NSFa/&gt;&lt;ref name =WSJ/&gt;

====Use of federal funds====
On July 1, 2010 (the estimated end date is June 30, 2014), the National Science Foundation began funding a research proposal by Rulon Clark (San Diego State University) and Sanjay Joshi (University of California, Davis) entitled "Understanding predator-prey signaling interactions: the dynamics of antisnake displays in ground squirrels and [[kangaroo rat]]s." They proposed to investigate the function and evolution of [[animal communication]] between predators and prey using robots that can interact with predators. They also stated in their proposal that their research project would support and provide training for future scientists and engineers.&lt;ref name =NSFfunding/&gt;

====Accounting of federal funds====
The researchers reported that they were awarded $390,000 for a 4-year study in 2010 by NSF. Their universities take about one third of the funds in [[indirect costs]], which go for [[Overhead (business)|overhead]], for example, to building maintenance, energy costs, and scholarships for students. This leaves approximately $260,000 over four years for the research project itself. Most of these funds go towards supporting biology and engineering students who help conduct the proposed research. They estimate that of the direct and indirect budget categories in their NSF grant, nearly $273,000 or 70% of the total funds go to training and support for students. They report that 34 students have received training so far in this research project. They also report that of the funds awarded by NSF, $13,700 has or will be spent on [[biorobotics]] over the four years of this study, which is 3.5% of the total funds.&lt;ref name =facts/&gt;&lt;ref name = Clark&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Rulon|title=Funding|url=http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/clark/Site_3/Funding.html|publisher=SDSU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-healing''' refers to the process of recovery (generally from [[Psychology|psychological]] disturbances, [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], etc.), motivated by and directed by the patient, guided often only by [[instinct]]. Such a process encounters mixed fortunes due to its amateur nature, although self-motivation is a major asset. The value of self-healing lies in its ability to be tailored to the unique experience and requirements of the individual. The process can be helped and accelerated with introspection techniques such as [[Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;https://nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Self Healing as a Way to Overcome Racial Trauma ==


Historically, communities of Color in the United States and around the World have attempted to use different modes (i.e. scholarship, art, and community gathering) to create self-healing as a way to combat the daily trauma of living in a racialized society.

[[Frantz Fanon]] wrote about the subjectivity and objectivity paradox inherent in [[Race (human categorization)|Blackness]] in his book [[Black Skin, White Masks|&lt;u&gt;Black Skin, White Masks&lt;/u&gt;.]] He describes feeling "infinite" but being subjected to the standards reserved for someone who is crippled. At the end of the fifth chapter, he writes that he weeps at the "crossroads between Nothingness and Infinity." His scholarship is meant to provide a lesson to White readers: Black people are also human beings. However, his intention in writing the fifth chapter was no doubt a hope to heal himself in offering up his struggle so that those who mistreated him and his people could reach a place of understanding. In sharing his personal trauma, he offered a way for Black people to connect over shared struggle and commiserate, but also brought his plight to the attentions of a White audience, who, if they could empathize, could lighten the racial load of the Black people around them and could hopefully, someday, ease Fanon's own mental load.

[[Langston Hughes]] is an example of how Black people have used art to self-heal from racial trauma. His poem, [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47880/theme-for-english-b "Theme for English B"] details his struggle with completing a writing assignment about truth for a class. He is only able to complete the assignment when he acknowledges the stratified differences between him, his other classmates, and his professor. As he writes, "I am the only colored student in my class." His poem is a way to package his trauma so that he can use it for something constructive in the hopes that it will ultimately heal some of his pain.

[http://www.harrietsapothecary.com/ Harriet's Apothecary] is a NYC-based organization that seeks to create self-healing for communities of color through different healing based events. Their work takes place across the US. They host vendors, and offer reiki-healing, massages, food, and yoga among many other different "stations" as a way to combat racial trauma. They do community building work to address poverty (because [[racism in the United States]] has left communities of color in disproportionate levels of poverty compared to their White counterparts). To gain entrance to most, if not all of their events, their policy is pay-what-you-can.{{Citation needed|reason=Self Healing as a Way to Overcome Racial Trauma section has no ref|date=December 2017}}

== The Different Meanings of Self-Healing ==


Self-healing is the ultimate phase of [[Gestalt Therapy]].

Self-healing may refer to automatic, [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] processes of the body that are controlled by physiological mechanisms inherent in the organism. Disorders of the [[Gifts of healing|spirit]] and the absence of faith can be self-healed.

In a figurative sense, self-healing properties can be ascribed to systems or processes, which by nature or design tend to correct any disturbances brought into them. Such as the regeneration of the skin after a cut or scrape, or of an entire limb. The injured party (the living body) repairs the damaged part by itself.

Beyond the innate restorative capacities of the physical body, there are many factors of psychological nature that can influence self-healing. [[Hippocrates]], considered by many to be the father of medical treatment, observed: "The physician must be ready, not only to do his duty himself, but also to secure the co-operation of the patient, of the attendants and of externals."
— Hippocrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hippocrates|title=Aphorisms|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/aphorisms.1.i.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-healing may also be achieved through deliberately applied psychological mechanisms. These approaches may improve the psychological and physical conditions of a person. Research confirms that this can be achieved through numerous mechanisms, including relaxation, breathing exercises, fitness exercises, imagery, [[Meditation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=Michael|last2=Donovan|first2=Steven|last3=Taylor|first3=Eugene|title=The Physical and Psychological Effects of Meditation: A Review of Contemporary Research With a Comprehensive Bibliography|date=1997|publisher=Inst of Noetic Sciences|isbn=9780943951362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Searchable meditation bibliography: http://biblio.noetic.org/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoga]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthandyoga.com/html/research_papers/yt.asp&lt;/ref&gt; [[qigong]], t'ai chi, [[biofeedback]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cliving.org/biblobiof.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and various forms of [[psychotherapy]], among other approaches.

Varieties of mechanisms for self-healing have been proposed, including:

# Decreases in stress hormones that may impair physiological functions when there is [[Psychological stress|chronic stress]].&lt;ref name="General Adaptive Syndrome"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitterer|first1=Jon|last2=Coon|first2=Dennis|title=Introduction to Psychology|date=2013|publisher=Jon-David Hague|pages=446–447}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Decreases in muscle tension, which can worsen or produce pains in muscles, tendons and joints when there is chronic muscle tension due to stress.
# Improved sleep that can be achieved through relaxation, which improves physiological functions.
# Improvements in emotional tensions, depression, anger and other emotions that can otherwise impair social relationships and functioning in the workplace, leading to vicious circles of increased psychological symptoms.

Another phrase that often includes self-healing is [[self-help]]. In 2013 [[Kathryn Schulz]] examined it as "an $11 billion industry".&lt;ref&gt;

'''Sharp power''' is the use of manipulative diplomatic policies by one country to influence and undermine the political system of a target country.  Sharp power can include attempts by one country to manipulate and manage information about itself in the news media and educational systems of another country, for the purpose of misleading or dividing public opinion in a target country, or for masking or diverting attention away from negative information about itself.  

Sharp power is distinguished from [[soft power]], which are attractive policies that project a positive impression of one country and promote greater understanding with another country, ultimately to influence the decisions of another country through persuasion.  Soft power policies can include [[student exchange program|student exchanges]] and the sponsoring of [[Cultural diplomacy | cultural and sporting events]].  Sharp power is also distinct from [[hard power]], which are coercive policies by one country to compel another country into taking action or changing its decisions.  Hard power can include [[war | military force]], [[economic sanctions]], and [[coercive diplomacy|diplomatic threats]].  

The term "sharp power" was coined in November of 2017 by the [[National Endowment for Democracy]], and published in an article in [[Foreign Affairs | Foreign Affairs Magazine]], to describe aggressive and subversive policies employed by authoritarian governments as a projection of state power in democratic countries, policies that cannot be described as either hard power or soft power.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Meaning of Sharp Power:  How Authoritarian States Project Influence|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2017-11-16/meaning-sharp-power|publisher=Foreign Affairs|author=Christopher Walker and Jessica Ludwig|date=Nov 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NED article specifically names the Russian state-funded [[RT (TV network) | RT News Network]] and the Chinese state-sponsored [[Confucius Institute | Confucius Institute educational partnerships]] as examples of sharp power.  According NED, autocratic states "are not necessarily seeking to 'win hearts and minds,' the common frame of reference for soft power efforts, but they are surely seeking to manipulate their target audiences by distorting the information that reaches them."  

Since 2018, the term "sharp power" has been used in news articles, scholarly discussions, and Congressional hearings.  Even representatives of the Chinese Communist Party have used the term, dismissing Western claims that their country has engaged in sharp power practices.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference spokesman addresses Western charges of China using 'sharp power'.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLe5ZF6qeX8|publisher=China Global Television Network|date=Mar 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Actor–network theory|Actor-network theory]] has developed this concept as the object around which [[social networks]] form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network Theory|last=Latour|first=Bruno|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version was applied to social media netwotks by [[Jyri Engeström]] in 2005 as part of the explanation of why some social media networks succeed and some fail. Engeström maintained that "Social network theory fails to recognise such real-world dynamics because its notion of sociality is limited to just people." Instead, he proposed what he called "object centered sociality," citing the work of the sociologist [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]]. For example, Engeström maintained that much of the success of the popular photo-sharing site [[Flickr]] was because photographs serve as social objects around which conversations of social networks form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engeström|first=Jyri|title=Why some social network services work and others don’t — Or: the case for object-centered sociality|url=http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2005/04/why-some-social-network-services-work-and-others-dont-or-the-case-for-object-centered-sociality.html|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was popularized by Hugh MacLeod, cartoonist and social observer in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacLeod|first=Hugh|title=Social Objects for Beginners|url=http://gapingvoid.com/2007/12/31/social-objects-for-beginners/|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4034">[[Image:Solar heater dsc00632.jpg|thumb|Solar energy technologies, such as [[solar water heater]]s, located on or near the buildings which they supply with energy, are a prime example of a soft energy technology.]]
'''Soft energy technologies''' may be seen as ''appropriate'' renewable technologies.&lt;ref name="The soft energy path"&gt;[http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid292.php The soft energy path] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222005324/http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid292.php |date=2007-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soft energy technologies are not simply renewable energy technologies, as there are many [[renewable energy]] technologies which are not regarded as "soft".

== Definition ==
More specifically, soft energy technologies have five defining characteristics.&lt;ref name=en&gt;Lovins, 1977, pp.38-39&lt;/ref&gt;  They rely on [[renewable energy]] resources, are diverse and designed for maximum effectiveness in particular circumstances, are flexible and relatively simple to understand, are matched to end-use needs in terms of scale, and are matched to end-use needs in terms of quality. An energy technology must satisfy all five of these criteria to be soft.&lt;ref name=en/&gt;

Residential [[solar energy]] technologies are prime examples of soft energy technologies and rapid deployment of simple, [[energy conservation|energy conserving]], [[residential solar]] energy technologies is fundamental to a soft energy strategy.  ''Active'' residential solar technologies use special devices to collect and convert the sun's rays to useful energy and are located near the users they supply.  '''''Passive''''' residential solar technologies ([[passive house]]) involve the natural transfer (by radiation, convection and conduction) of solar energy without the use of mechanical devices.

== Sociological definition ==
The term soft is not meant to be vague, speculative, or ephemeral, but rather sustainable, flexible, resilient, and benign.&lt;ref&gt;see Lovins, 1977, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;  Soft technology impacts are generally seen to be more "gentle, pleasant and manageable" than high technology impacts. These impacts range from the individual and household level to those affecting the very fabric of society at the national and international level.&lt;ref&gt;see Lovins, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, favourable socio-political impacts include:&lt;ref&gt;Morrison &amp; Lodwick, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;
* reduction in social conflicts and inequalities;
* reduction in population concentration;
* increase in employment, especially for the lower social classes;
* increase in the satisfaction of basic human needs;
* increase in consumer self-sufficiency; and
* increase in social participation and democratic processes.

The use of soft energy technologies, in conjunction with [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], and the transitional use of [[fossil fuel]] technology, comprise the [[soft energy path]].&lt;ref name="The soft energy path"/&gt;

It was dedicated to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and is largely a treatise on how to properly train statesmen. It also discusses ethical dilemmas in the education system of the time. ''The Book of the Governor'' is evidence of the impact that [[Renaissance humanism]] had on prose writing.

== Thomas Elyot ==
[[File:Sir Thomas Elyot by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|Holbein Sir Thomas Elyot]]
Thomas Elyot was born before 1490 and died in 1546.  He was the son of Sir Richard Elyot and Alice Fynderne.  His father was a prominent lawyer, so Thomas received a quality education.  Both [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] claim him as an alumnus, but there is no sufficient evidence either way. He studied mostly liberal arts and philosophy, but also some medicine. In 1510 he married Margaret Aborough. In 1530 he was [[knight]]ed. In 1531, he was made ambassador to the Emperor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].  In 1538 he published the first Latin-English dictionary. As a writer, he is clear, precise, measured, and practically monotonous. His major works include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlton-cambridgeshire.org.uk/History/People/sir_thomas_elyot.htm |title=Sir Thomas Elyot |publisher=Carlton-cambridgeshire.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Boke named the Governour'' (1531)
*''Of the Knowledge which maketh a Wise Man'' (1533)
*''The Education of Children, translated out of Plutarch'' (1535)
*''Dictionary'' (1538)
*''The Castle of Helth'' (1539)
*''The Defence of Good Women'' (1540)

''The Boke named the Governour'' is considered to be the first educational treatise in English.  It sets out the way of life for member of the English governing class.  Between 1531 and 1580, the book went through seven different editions. According to Biblio.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ELYOT, Sir Thomas [1490?-1546] |url=http://www.biblio.com/books/276879441.html |title=The Boke Named The Governour By Sir Thomas [1490?-1546&amp;#93; ELYOT - Used Books - 1557 - from D &amp; E Lake Ltd. (ABAC, ILAB) and |publisher=Biblio.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Book of the Governor "went through edition after edition all through the sixteenth century. It achieved this fame for many reasons. It is the first work in recognizably modern English [[prose]], to which Elyot added many new words. It provided influential advocacy for the study of the classics, from which he quotes extensively. the principal cause of its popularity was the current vogue for its subject – it is a treatise on moral philosophy, laying down the lines on which the education of those destined to govern should be directed, and inculcating the high moral principles which should rule them in the performance of their duties. There was nothing very original or revolutionary in the thoughts expressed: Elyot acknowledges his debt to the ''Institutio Principis Christiani'' of Erasmus and Castiglione’s ''Il Cortegiano'', though not that to Francesco Patrizzi, Bishop of Gaeta at the end of the fifteenth century, whose ''De Rego et Regis Institutione'' was certainly the model for ''The Governour''. Nevertheless it remained a textbook for behaviour for generations and had a lasting effect on the writing of English."

== Humanism ==
Elyot wrote his book at the beginning of English Renaissance humanism. During this time, "humanists were distinguished from other scholars not by exclusive focus on human or secular texts, but rather by their focus on secular writings, particularly classical ones, ''as well as'' on religious texts and thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;Black, Joseph. The Renaissance and the Early Seventeenth Century. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. Peterborough, Ont.: Broadview, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was during this time that the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] classics were finally coming back. This is the time when [[Plato]] played a significant role in philosophical history.  Renaissance humanism also introduced a new richness in the English language – writers began to use rhetoric, and language was viewed as a worthy subject to study. This is why Elyot's book became so popular not only with the people, but also the King.

'''''The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and The Will of the People''''' is a book on the power of [[nonviolence]] by [[Jonathan Schell]] published in 2003.

Schell starts by discussing the cultural embeddedness of men, patriotism and death in battle (going back to the Athenian - [[Pericles]]). From this classic root political morality has held onto the need for 'standing up for principles with force', which in practice quickly descends to "plunder, exploitation and massacre".

In the 5th century, [[St. Augustine]] conjoined this with Christian love... by theorising 'separate realms' for political and religious morality. Politics has thus long been wedded to violence... it is hard to conceptualise a political ideology that does not have a resort to violence clause. As Schell says there has been, "an age old reliance of politics on violent means". (p.&amp;nbsp;4)

Schell then puts forward his main thesis that "violence has now become dysfunctional as a political instrument" (p.&amp;nbsp;7) and that "forms of non-violent action can serve effectively in the place of violence at every level of political affairs". (p.&amp;nbsp;8)

The key political progress has been the idea of democracy - even the worst democracy - carries within it the principle of equality which is a deeply seated contradiction to an also deeply embedded practice of inequality - see [[Tocqueville]]. Ironically modern national democracy allowed for a new kind of army, in which it was possible to mobilise masses of men prepared to die - apparently in defence of their own national interest and the principle of democracy. The disaster of the modern war system was fed by an unholy confluence of democracy, science, industrial revolution, and [[imperialism]] which developed through the 19th century.

==Power==

Power came to be widely defined by the ability to wage war. He describes imperialism as  "a monotonous record of one sided slaughter" (p.&amp;nbsp;75) He argues that there was an end of limited war between 'great powers' after 1870 (p.&amp;nbsp;44). After that we had 1914 and the period of total or world war until 1946. Then the period of [[Cold War]] in which the public appearances of a strategic balance of power became more important than the reality of a balance of actual power. The [[A-bomb]] made a balance of actual power obsolete (p.&amp;nbsp;62).

==People's war - wars of national self-determination==

The first modern [[people's war]] was the Spanish resistance to the French invasion 1807-14 (p.&amp;nbsp;68). A people's war that showed how a superior force can be worn down by lesser military strength contrary to the classic rules of conventional warfare. The main need was to endure, and an armed population. [[George Washington]] also understood this need to endure. "Washington was always aware that his most important task was to insure the survival of his own forces - not strictly for military purposes but to personify the unconquerable will of the American people" (p.&amp;nbsp;157).

The big downside of people's war is that the whole people then become subject to retaliation (p.&amp;nbsp;81). In the Japanese retaliation against the Chinese communists, the population dropped from 45 million to 25 million. With this level of violence, political ideals are what buoys the resistance up. It also allowed humanitarian treatment of prisoners by the communist forces to be maintained. 

In a people's war it is important that war is kept subordinate to politics. This is the first stage of extracting politics from the war machine. Politics here means the creation of a civil administration from the ground up. For [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] the most important goal and foundation of this politics was the redistribution of land from rich to poor.

A militarised politics can easily segue into a totalitarian politics as it did in China via [[conventional warfare]] against the American-backed [[Kuomintang]]. 

People's war became the principal instrument of self-determination and social change in the third world from around the 1950s. If a population is united, an imperial war against it is difficult to win. [[Charles de Gaulle]] understood this in relation to [[Algeria]] in 1958. Even when he had achieved a military victory it did not lead to a political one.

==Cold war==

The nuclear standoff produced a stalemate in the war system. The last resort was unusable. '"In both (nuclear deterrence and people war) violence became not so much an instrument for producing physical effects as a kind of bloody system of communication, through which the antagonists produced messages to one another about will." (p.&amp;nbsp;97) Nuclear deterrence became a conflict waged by appearances to produce intangible effects on leaderships and populations. People's war also came to be decided by intangible effects on hearts and minds of both sides. In both situations the capacity of violence for achieving political ends is thrown into doubt.

==Revolution==

A similar mindset of belief in violence pervaded western theories of revolution. Right, left and centre theorists and leaders agreed that that revolution had to be violent. Power was only understood as an effect of violent coercive rule. (except for a few voices, e.g., [[Tolstoy]])

Two expressly political theorists thought consistently about [[nonviolence]]: Mahatma Gandhi and Hannah Arendt.

==Mohandas K. Gandhi==

[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] believed that courage was a more important attribute of those seeking liberation than a desire for nonviolence or [[Satyagraha]]. At one point he even acted as conscription agent for the British military in South Africa. (date?) Gandhi appealed to the 'spiritual' strength of Indian peoples to oppose the Western Imperial (war) system.

The assumption here is that tyrants and ruling classes alike only have the power that we invest in them. Give them nothing and they are naked and have no power. "The  central role of consent in all government meant that non-cooperation - the withdrawal of consent - was something more than a morally satisfying activity; it was a powerful weapon in the real world." (p.&amp;nbsp;129) "Non-cooperation is not a passive state, it is an intensely active state - more active than physical resistance or violence."' (p.&amp;nbsp;130) Schell quoting from ''Gandhi's Essential Writings'' (p.&amp;nbsp;99)

The Gandhi programme of Satyagraha ("the quiet and irresistible pursuit of truth") was accompanied by 'the constructive programme'. This campaigned and organised to achieve concrete goals such as justice for workers, peace between factions, village hygiene and diet, the condition of women, etc. The idea is to do anything that obstructed the solidarity of the nation and that facilitates the production of a democratic political culture. "Constructive effort is political power" ''Gandhi's Essential Writings'' (p.&amp;nbsp;259)

==Revolutions and violence==

Schell looks for the nonviolent actions that are part of what are often represented as broadly violent revolutions. (p.&amp;nbsp;143) He defines violence: "Violence is the method by which the ruthless few can subdue the passive many. Non-violence is a means by which the active many can overcome the ruthless few." (p.&amp;nbsp;144). He discusses [[The Glorious Revolution]] of 1689 in England and the American, French and Russian Revolutions. He makes the interesting observation that revolutions are typified as violent and the subsequent establishment of a new regime is assumed to be peaceful, whereas the reverse has "more often been the case". (p.&amp;nbsp;144) in the French revolution, the American, even the Russian...(p.&amp;nbsp;175) (p.&amp;nbsp;178). More people died making Potemkin the film than in the actual storming of the Winter Palace! [[The Russian Revolution]] was more of a victory of a 'mass minority' ... than a real people's revolution as happened in France or America (p.&amp;nbsp;183).

The English 'Glorious Revolution' of 1689 "London was in fact the first of many modern capitals whose rebellious spirit was to infect and destroy the allegiance of an army of an [[ancien regime]]". This was [[William III of England|William of Orange]] versus [[James II of England|King James]], with defections at the non-battle at Salisbury.

There has been a near universal failure of theorists to predict the non-violent fall of powers. He quotes [[Thomas Paine]]: "Tis not in numbers but in unity that our great strength lies". In the American Revolution [[Committees of Correspondence]] were formed for "mutually fostering and co-ordinating activity". These were the basic political units.

[[Edmund Burke]] realised that it is only by cultivating the love and admiration of the people that a ruler can raise taxes or an army or get voted in. This love "infuses into (army and navy) that liberal obedience without which your army would be base rabble and you navy nothing but rotten timber" (p.&amp;nbsp;159).

==East Europe==

Schell's sources here are [[Adam Michnik]], [[Václav Havel]] and [[György Konrád]] as sources to explain the 'unsuspected' weakness of the Soviet empire. In their beginnings they "did not aim at state power" (p.&amp;nbsp;191) but aimed at "achieving immediate changes in daily life" within what was called 'civil society' a term that goes back to Paine. (p.&amp;nbsp;194)

The setting up of institutions independent from the state or the ruling classes... is the key activity in preparing for a peoples revolution. In Eastern Europe this took the form of civic and cultural activity (p.&amp;nbsp;195), e.g., [[Workers' Defence Committee]] provided concrete assistance to those in trouble with the authorities, and their families. Other terms for similar activity:

* flying university
* parallel structures
* second culture
* revolutionary councils' (Arendt)

[[Václav Havel]] suggested there should be no discourse with the centre of power but that activists should "fight only for those concrete causes, and fight for them unswervingly to the end" (p.&amp;nbsp;196). Compare this with Gandhi's earlier call for courage . Chosen well these independent institutions will rattle the establishment. The idea of cultivating 'a predisposition to truth' (Havel/ Gandhi) is seen as key (p.&amp;nbsp;197).  

The final [[collapse of the USSR]] is not like the rest of Eastern Europe as it was a mainly top down operation rather than one of peoples power. There was still a remarkable and unexpected lack of violence.

The main thesis is reiterated: "The professionals of power, in or out of government, were consistently caught off-guard by the failures of superior force and the successes of nonviolence" (p.&amp;nbsp;216). Contemporary political theory could 'neither foresee nor explain' the successes of non-violent [[people power]].

==Hannah Arendt's ideas of power==

[[Hannah Arendt]]'s redefinition of the word 'power' &lt;ref&gt;On Violence, paperback edition, 
Hannah Arendt, 1970, {{ISBN|0-15-669500-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a strong echo from Paine. She says: "Power corresponds to the human ability not just to act but to act in concert."&lt;ref&gt;On Violence, paperback edition, Hannah Arendt, 1970, {{ISBN|0-15-669500-6}}, page 44&lt;/ref&gt; (Schell p.&amp;nbsp;218). She goes so far as to deny ascription of 'power' to individual action.

[[Max Weber]] is probably more realistic in asserting that power is the assertion of will in a social relationship. (p.&amp;nbsp;220) But this does mean that in limiting its meaning [[Hannah Arendt]] can discuss political power in more detail. The assertion of the will of the tyrant is ultimately an illusion, the tyrant is dependent on his supporters.
Violence can never create real political power in Arendt's sense: "To substitute violence for power can bring victory, but the price is very high; for it is not only paid by the vanquished, it is also paid by the victor in terms of his own power." &lt;ref&gt;On Violence, paperback edition, Hannah Arendt, 1970, {{ISBN|0-15-669500-6}}, page 53&lt;/ref&gt; (Schell p.&amp;nbsp;222). According to [[John Stuart Mill]] public opinion guides will&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/mill/john_stuart/m645r/chapter1.html Representative Government by John Stuart Mill]&lt;/ref&gt; and "a great part of all power consists in... willing allegiance" (Schell p.&amp;nbsp;229).

==Nonviolent change in liberal democracy?==

Schell sees the 'taming of violence' being written into liberalisms 'genetic code'. His example is the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the USA. Although he sees nonviolent action being only 'curative' or reforming of a liberal democratic system.

The traditional Chinese time systems refers to the [[time standard|time standards]] for divisions of the day used in [[China]] until the introduction of the [[Chongzhen calendar|Shixian calendar]] in 1628 at the beginning of the [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kiyoshi Yabuuchi |title=Astronomical tables in China, from the Wutai to the Ch'ing dynasties |journal=Japanese Studies in the History of Science |volume=2 |date=1963 |pages=94–100 |issn=0090-0176}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Units" /&gt; 

==Han-era system==
The third chapter of the [[Huainanzi]] outlines 15 hours during daylight. These are dawn ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|晨明}}}}), morning light ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|朏明}}}}), daybreak ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|旦明}}}}), early meal ({{zh|labels=no|s={{linktext|早食}}|t={{linktext|蚤食}}}}), feast meal ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|宴食}}}}), before noon ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|隅中}}}}), noon ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|正中}}}}), short shadow ({{zh|labels=no|s={{linktext|少还}}|t={{linktext|小還}}}}), evening ({{zh|labels=no|s={{linktext|𫗦时}}|t={{linktext|餔時}}|l=evening mealtime}}), long shadow ({{zh|labels=no|s={{linktext|大还}}|t={{linktext|大還}}}}), high setting ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|高舂}}}}), lower setting({{zh|labels=no|s={{linktext|下舂}}}}), sunset ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|县东}} |t={{linktext|縣車}}}}), twilight ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|黃昏}}|s={{linktext|黄昏}}}}), rest time ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|定昏}}}}).&lt;ref name="Huainanzi"&gt; {{cite book |title=[[Huainanzi]] |chapter=Tiānwén xùn |trans-chapter=Patterns of Heaven |script-chapter=zh:天文訓  |chapter-url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%B7%AE%E5%8D%97%E5%AD%90/%E5%A4%A9%E6%96%87%E8%A8%93 |quote={{zh|labels=no|c=日出于暘谷，浴于咸池，拂于扶桑，是謂晨明。&lt;br /&gt;登于扶桑，爰始將行，是謂朏明。&lt;br /&gt;至于曲阿，是謂旦明。&lt;br /&gt;至于曾泉，是謂蚤食。&lt;br /&gt;至于桑野，是謂晏食。&lt;br /&gt;至于衡陽，是謂隅中。&lt;br /&gt;至于昆吾，是謂正中。&lt;br /&gt;至于鳥次，是謂小還。&lt;br /&gt;至于悲谷，是謂餔時。&lt;br /&gt;至于女紀，是謂大還。&lt;br /&gt;至于淵虞，是謂高舂。&lt;br /&gt;至于連石，是謂下舂。&lt;br /&gt;至于悲泉，爰止其女，爰息其馬，是謂縣車。&lt;br /&gt;至于虞淵，是謂黃昏。&lt;br /&gt;至于蒙谷，是謂定昏。}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are correlated to each hour from 06:00 to 20:00 on the [[24-hour clock]].

==East Han to Ming system==
This system used two standards to measure the time in a [[Day#Apparent and mean solar day|solar day]]. Times during daylight were measured in the ''Shí-kè'' standard, and at night were measured using the ''Gēng-diǎn'' standard.

===During daylight: ''Shí-kè''===
The ''Shí-kè'' ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|時}}}} - {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|刻}}}}) system is derived from [[solar time|the position of the sun]]. 

====Dual hour: Shí====
Each ''shí'' ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|時}}|s={{linktext|时}}}}) was {{frac|12}} of the time between one midnight and the next,&lt;ref name="Units" /&gt; making it roughly double the modern hour. These dual hours are named after the [[earthly branches]] in order, with midnight in the first ''shí''. This first ''shí'' traditionally occurred from 23:00 to 01:00 on the 24-hour clock, but was changed during the [[Song dynasty]] so that it fell from 00:00 to 02:00.&lt;ref name="Units" /&gt;

Starting from the end of the [[Tang Dynasty]] into the [[Song Dynasty]], each ''shí'' was divided into two, with the first half of each ''shí'' called the initial hour ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|初}}}}) and the second called the central hour ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|正}}}}).&lt;ref name="Units" /&gt; Using the change of the midnight hour and the first ''shí'' above, you could say that during the Song Dynasty midnight went from the central hour of the first ''shí'' ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|子|正}}}}) to the initial hour of the first ''shí'' ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|子|初}}}}).

====One-hundredth of a day: Kè ====
Days were also divided into smaller units, called ''kè'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|刻}}}}). One ''kè'' was usually defined as {{frac|100}} of a day until 1628, though there were short periods before then where days had 96, 108 or 120 ''kè''.&lt;ref name="Units"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sôma|first=Mitsuru|last2=Kawabata|first2=Kin-aki|last3=Tanikawa|first3=Kiyotaka|date=2004-10-25|title=Units of Time in Ancient China and Japan|url=http://pasj.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/5/887|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan|language=en|volume=56|issue=5|pages=887–904|doi=10.1093/pasj/56.5.887|issn=0004-6264|bibcode=2004PASJ...56..887S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Kè'' literally means "mark" or "engraving", referring to the marks placed on sundials&lt;ref name="Stephenson"&gt;{{cite book |first1=F. Richard |last1=Stephenson |author-link1=F. Richard Stephenson |last2=Green |first2=David A. |author-link2=Dave Green (astrophysicist) |title=Historical supernovae and their remnants |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2002 |pages=15-16 |ISBN=0-19-850766-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or water clocks&lt;ref name="Shuowen Jiezi"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Shuowen Jiezi]] |editor=[[Xu Shen]], |chapter=Volume eleven |chapter-url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E8%AA%AA%E6%96%87%E8%A7%A3%E5%AD%97/11 |quote={{zh|labels=no|c=漏：以銅受水，刻節，晝夜百刻。}} Translation: ''The water clock holds the water in the copper pot, and marks the scale on the rule. There are 100 marks which represent a day.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help keep time. 

Using the definition of ''kè'' as {{frac|100}} of a day, each ''kè'' is equal to 0.24 hours, 14.4 minutes, or 14 minutes 24 seconds. Every ''shí'' will contain 8{{frac|3}} ''kè'', with 7 or 8 full ''kè'' and partial beginning and/or ending ''kè''. These fractional ''kè'' are multiples of {{frac|6}} ''kè'', or 2 minutes 24 seconds.{{efn|600 is the [[Least common multiple|LCM]] of 100 and 24, so the time between ''kè'' and ''shí'' scale may be {{frac|6}}, {{frac|3}}, {{frac|2}}, {{frac|2|3}}, or {{frac|5|6}} major ''kè''. The {{frac|6}} major ''kè'' is the common factor}} The 7 or 8 full ''kè'' within each ''shí'' were referred to as "major ''kè''" ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|大刻}}}}). Each {{frac|6}} of a ''kè'' was called a "minor ''kè''" ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|小刻}}}}).&lt;ref name="Gujin Tushu Jicheng"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]] |script-chapter=曆象彙編/曆法典/第099卷 |trans-chapter=Calendar compilations/Calendar quotations/Volume 99 |chapter-url=https://zh.wikisource.org/zh/%E6%AC%BD%E5%AE%9A%E5%8F%A4%E4%BB%8A%E5%9C%96%E6%9B%B8%E9%9B%86%E6%88%90/%E6%9B%86%E8%B1%A1%E5%BD%99%E7%B7%A8/%E6%9B%86%E6%B3%95%E5%85%B8/%E7%AC%AC099%E5%8D%B7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Describing the time during daylight====
Both ''shí'' and ''kè'' would be used to describe the time accurately. There are two ways of doing this.
#Eight ''kè'' mode. Before the Tang dynasty, the ''shí'' were noted first, then each of the major ''kè'' were counted up to 8.&lt;ref name="Gujin Tushu Jicheng" /&gt; 
##As an example, counting by major ''kè'' from the first ''shí'' to the second would look like this: &lt;code&gt;''zǐ''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 1 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子一刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 2 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子二刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 3 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子三刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 4 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子四刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 5 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子五刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 6 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子六刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 7 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c= 子七刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''zǐ 8 kè''&lt;/code&gt; ({{zh |labels=no|c=子八刻}}), &lt;code&gt;''chǒu''&lt;/code&gt;. ({{zh |labels=no|c=丑}}). 
##Given the time ''&lt;code&gt;xū 1 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=戌一刻}}), this would be read as "1 ''kè'' after xū ''shí''", making the time 20:09:36.
#Four ''kè'' mode. After the Tang dynasty's introduction of "initial" and "central" parts of the ''shí'', the ''shí'' was still noted first, but with an added description of which half of the ''shí'' the ''kè'' was taking place in. Since this narrowed the range of the possible major ''kè'' down to four, it was only necessary to specify the major ''kè'' between one and four.&lt;ref name="Gujin Tushu Jicheng" /&gt; 
## This would change our first example above to look like this: ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ initial&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子初}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ initial 1 kè &lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子初一刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ initial 2 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子初二刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ initial 3 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子初三刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ initial 4 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子初四刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ central&lt;/code&gt;''{{efn|Note that the beginning of the central hour doesn't occur at the same time as the fourth major ''kè''. The difference between the start of the central hour and the fourth major ''kè'' is always between 1 and 5 minor ''kè''.}} ({{zh |labels=no|c=子正}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ central 1 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子正一刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ central 2 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子正二刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ central 3 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子正三刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;zǐ central 4 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=子正四刻}}), ''&lt;code&gt;chǒu initial&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh |labels=no|c=丑初}}).
##Given the time ''&lt;code&gt;sì central 3 kè&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=巳正三刻}}), this would be read as "the third ''kè'' in the second half of ''sì''", making the time 11:31:12.

====Smaller time units====
=====Fēn=====
''Kè'' were subdivided into smaller units, called ''fēn'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|分}}}}). The number of ''fēn'' in each ''kè'' varied over the centuries,&lt;ref name="Units" /&gt; but a ''fēn'' was generally defined as {{frac|6000}} of a day.&lt;ref name="Gujin Tushu Jicheng" /&gt; Using this definition, one ''fēn'' is equal to 14.4 seconds. This also means that a ''fēn'' is {{frac|60}} of a major ''kè'', and a minor ''kè'' has only 10 ''fēn''.

In 1280, [[Guo Shoujing]]'s Shòushí Calendar ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|授时曆}}}}) had each ''fēn'' subdivided into 100 ''miǎo'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|秒}}}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Jean-Claude |last=Martzloff |title=Chinese mathematical astronomy |editor-link=Helaine Selin |editor-first=Helaine |editor-last=Selin |encyclopedia=Mathematics across cultures |location=Dordrecht |publisher=Kluwer |date=2000 |pages=373–407 |ISBN=0-7923-6481-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the definition of ''fēn'' as 14.4 seconds, each ''miǎo'' was 144 milliseconds long. 

=====Shùn and niàn=====
{{Expand Chinese|刹那|date=May 2018}}

Each ''fen'' was subdivided into ''shùn'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|瞬}}}}), and ''shùn'' were subdivided into ''niàn'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|念}}}}).

The [[Mahāsāṃghika]], translated into Chinese as the ''Móhēsēngzhī Lǜ'' ([[Taishō Tripiṭaka]] 1425) describes several units of time, including ''shùn'' or ''shùnqǐng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|瞬頃}}|l=blink moment}}) and ''niàn''. According to this text, ''niàn'' is the smallest unit of time at 18 milliseconds and a ''shùn'' is 360 milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |script-title=zh:摩訶僧祗律 |title=Móhēsēngzhī Lǜ |trans-title=[[Mahāsāṃghika]]|chapter=Taishō Tripiṭaka 1425 |chapter-url=http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/en/T22n1425_017 |quote={{zh|labels=no|c=須臾者，二十念名一瞬頃，二十瞬名一彈指，二十彈指名一羅豫，二十羅豫名一須臾。日極長時有十八須臾，夜極短時有十二須臾，夜極長時有十八須臾，日極短時有十二須臾。}} Rough translation: ''Definition of ''xūyú'': 20 ''niàn'' is 1 ''shùnqǐng''. 20 ''shùn'' is 1 ''tánzhǐ''. 20 ''tánzhǐ'' is one ''luóyù''. 20 ''luóyù'' is one ''xūyú''. In the longest day there are 18 ''xūyú'', and in the shortest night there are 12 ''xūyú''. In the shortest day there are 12 ''xūyú'' and in the longest night there are 18 ''xūyú''.''}} &lt;/ref&gt;  It also describes larger units of time, including a ''tánzhǐ'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|彈指}}}}) which is 7.2 seconds long, a ''luóyù'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|羅豫}}}}) which is 2 minutes 24 seconds long, and a ''xūyú'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|須臾}}}}), which is {{frac|30}} of a day at 48 minutes long.{{efn| This 30-part day is identical to the [[Hindu units of time|Hindu muhūrta]].}}

===During night: ''Gēng-diǎn'' system===
The ''Gēng-diǎn'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|更}}}} - {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|點}}}}) system uses predetermined signals to define the time during the night. 

====One-tenth of a day: ''Gēng''====

''Gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|更}}}}) is a time signal given by drum or gong. The drum was sounded by the [[Drum tower (Asia)|drum tower]] in city centers, and by night watchman hitting a gong in other areas.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The character for ''gēng'' {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|更}}}}, literally meaning "rotation" or "watch", comes from the rotation of watchmen sounding these signals.

The first ''gēng'' theoretically comes at sundown, but was standardized to fall at &lt;code&gt;yǒu shí central 1 kè &lt;/code&gt;, or 19:12. The time between each ''gēng'' is {{frac|10}} of a day, making a ''gēng'' 2.4 hours—or 2 hours 24 minutes—long.

The 5 ''gēngs'' in the night are numbered from one to five: ''yī gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|一|更}}}}) (alternately ''chū gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|初更}}}}) for "initial watch"); ''èr gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|二更}}}});  ''sān gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|三更}}}}); ''sì gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|四更}}}}); and  ''wǔ gēng'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|五更}}}}). The 5 gēngs in daytime are named after times of day listed in the [[Book of Sui]], which describes the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]] dividing the day and night into ten equal parts. They are morning ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|朝}}}});  midmorning, ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|禺}}}}); noon, ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|中}}}});  afternoon ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|晡}}}});  and evening ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|夕}}}}).&lt;ref name="Sui"&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Book of Sui]] |chapter=Zhì dì 14 tiānwén shàng |trans-chapter=Treatise 14, On Astronomy |script-chapter=志第14 天文上 |chapter-url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/zh:%E9%9A%8B%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B719 |at="Water clocks" ({{zh|labels=no|c=漏刻}})|quote={{zh|labels=no|c=晝有朝，有禺，有中，有晡，有夕。夜有甲、乙、丙、丁、戊。}} Rough translation: ''Daytime has morning, midmorning, noon, late afternoon, evening. Night has first, second, third, fourth, fifth.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a 10-part system, the ''gēng'' are strongly associated with the 10 [[Celestial stem|celestial stems]], especially since the stems are used to count off the ''gēng'' during the night in Chinese literature.&lt;ref name="Sui" /&gt;

====One-sixtieth of a day: ''Diǎn''====
''Diǎn'' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|點}}|s={{linktext|点}}}}), or point, marked when the bell time signal was rung. The time signal was released by the drum tower or local temples.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} 

Each ''diǎn'' or point is {{frac|60}} of a day, making them 0.4 hours, or 24 minutes, long. Every sixth ''diǎn'' falls on the ''gēng'', with the rest evenly dividing every ''gēng'' into 6 equal parts.

====Describing the time during the night====
Gēng and diǎn were used together to precisely describe the time at night.

:Counting from the first ''gēng'' to the next would look like this: ''&lt;code&gt;yīgēng&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=一更}}), ''&lt;code&gt;yīgēng 1 diǎn&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=一更一點|s=一更一点}}), ''&lt;code&gt;yīgēng 2 diǎn&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=一更二點|s=一更二点}}), ''&lt;code&gt;yīgēng 3 diǎn&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=一更三點|s=一更三点}}), ''&lt;code&gt;yīgēng 4 diǎn&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=一更四點|s=一更四点}}), ''&lt;code&gt;yīgēng 5 diǎn&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=一更五點|s=一更五点}}), ''&lt;code&gt;èrgēng&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=二更}}).
:Given the time ''&lt;code&gt;sāngēng 2 diǎn&lt;/code&gt;'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=三更二點|s=三更二点}}), you would read it as "two ''diǎn'' after ''sāngēng''", and find the time to be 00:48.{{efn|This assumes that the ''diǎn'' haven't moved; or if they have, that ''sāngēng'' still falls at exactly midnight.}} 

The night length is inconsistent during a year. The nineteenth volume of the [[Book of Sui]] says that at the winter solstice, a day was measured to be 60% night, and at the summer solstice, only 40% night.&lt;ref name="Petersen" /&gt; The official start of night thus had a variation from 0 to 1 ''gēng''. 

This variation was handled in different ways. From the start of the [[Han dynasty#Western Han|Western Han dynasty]] in 206 BC until 102 AD, ''yīgēng'' was moved back one ''kè'' every 9th day from the winter solstice to the summer solstice, and moved forward one ''kè'' every 9th day from summer solstice to the winter solstice.&lt;ref name="Petersen"&gt; {{cite journal |last=Petersen |first=Jens Østergård |year=1992 |title=The Taiping Jing and the A.D. 102 Clepsydra Reform |journal=Acta Orientalia |volume=53 |location=Copenhagen |pages=122–158 |url=https://www.academia.edu/12945035/The_Taiping_Jing_%E5%A4%AA%E5%B9%B3%E7%B6%93_and_the_A.D._102_Clepsydra_Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xia Calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|夏曆}}|s={{linktext|夏历}}}}), introduced in 102 AD, added or subtracted a ''kè'' to the start of night whenever the sun moved 2.5° north or south from its previous position.&lt;ref name="Petersen" /&gt;

==Modern applications==

Chinese still uses characters from these systems to describe time, even though China has changed to the [[UTC]] standards of hours, minutes, and seconds. 

''Shí'' is still used to describe the hour. Because of the potential for confusion, ''xiǎoshí'' ({{zh |labels=no|s={{linktext|小时}}|t={{linktext|小時}}}}, literally "small hour") is sometimes used for the hour as part of a 24-hour cycle, and ''shíchen'' ({{zh |labels=no|t={{linktext|時辰}}|s={{linktext|时辰}}}}) is used for the hour as part of the old 12-hour cycle. 

''Diǎn'' is also used interchangeably with ''shí'' for the hour. It can also be used to talk about the time on the hour—for example, 8 o' clock is written as 8 ''diǎn'' ({{zh |labels=no|t={{linktext|八點}}|s={{linktext|八点}}}}). 

''Fēn'' is also used for minutes. To avoid confusion, sometimes the word ''fēnzhōng'' ({{zh |labels=no|s={{linktext|分钟}}|t={{linktext|分鐘}}}}, literally "clock minute") is used to clarify that one is talking about modern minutes. The time 09:45 can thus be written as "9 ''shí'', 45 ''fēn''" ({{zh |labels=no|t={{linktext|九時|四十五|分}}|s={{linktext|九时|四十五|分}}}}) or "9 ''diǎn'', 45 ''fēn''" ({{zh |labels=no|c={{linktext|九点|四十五|分}}|t={{linktext|九點|四十五|分}}}}).

''Kè'' has been defined as {{frac|96}} of a day since 1628, so the modern ''kè'' equals 15 minutes and each double hour contains exactly 8 ''kè''.&lt;ref name="Units" /&gt; Since then, ''kè'' has been used as shorthand to talk about time in {{frac|8}} of a double hour or {{frac|4}} of a single hour. Their usage is similar to using "quarter hour" for 15 minutes or "half an hour" for 30 minutes in English.  For example, 6:45 can be written as "6 ''diǎn'', 3 ''kè''" ({{zh |labels=no|t={{linktext|六點|三|刻}}|s={{linktext|六点|三|刻}}}}).

''Miǎo'' is now the standard term for a second. Like ''fēn'', it is sometimes written as ''miǎozhōng'' ({{zh |labels=no|t={{linktext|秒鐘}}|s={{linktext|秒钟}}}}, literally "clock second") to clarify that someone is talking about modern seconds.

[[File:Typical North India Food Prepared for Rongmei Naga.jpg|thumb|A partially-eaten plate of Indian food. The food on the plate is called Uchchhishta (noun). The plate is said to be Uchchhishta (adjective).]]
'''Uchchhishta''' ({{lang-sa|उच्छिष्ट}}, Ucchiṣṭa),{{need-IPA|Sanskrit}} known by various regional terms, is an Indian and a Hindu concept related to food. Though the term has various meanings and has no exact parallel in English,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Roy p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; it is generally translated in English as "leftovers"&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp"&gt;Olivelle pp. 354-5&lt;/ref&gt; or "leavings",&lt;ref&gt;Khare p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; but with a denigratory aspect. Uchchhishta frequently denotes food scraps after a person has eaten. In a broader sense, it refers to the contamination by food or hand that has come in contact with saliva or the inside of someone's mouth. A person or plate is also said to be Uchchhishta, when he/it comes in contact with Uchchhishta food.&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp"/&gt; Uchchhishta food as well as the Uchchhishta eater/utensil are considered ritually impure. The eater is purified by washing his hand (Hindus traditionally eat with their fingers) and mouth.

It is highly disrespectful to offer Uchchhishta to someone in general, however it is acceptable to eat Uchchhishta of socially superior individuals, among other exceptions. While an offering of Uchchhishta food or by a person in the Uchchhishta state to Hindu divinities is forbidden in classical Hinduism, some heterodox [[Tantra|Tantric]] deities are worshipped with the taboo offering.

==Concept==
[[File:Leftovers.JPG|thumb|Leftovers of an Indian curry on a plate. The leftovers are called Uchchhishta (noun); the plate is described as Uchchhishta (adjective)]] 

The Monier-Williams Sanskrit dictionary defines Uchchhishta as: "left, rejected, stale, spit out of the mouth (as remnants of food); one who has still the remains of food in the mouth or hands, one who has not washed his hands and mouth and therefore is considered impure, impure; leavings, fragments, remainder (especially of a sacrifice or of food)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=173|title=MW Cologne Scan|website=www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de|access-date=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=174|title=MW Cologne Scan|website=www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de|access-date=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medhātithi|Medhatithi]] (c. 850–1050 CE), one of the oldest and most famous commentators of the Hindu law book ''[[Manusmriti]]'' lists the meanings of Uchchhishta:&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp"/&gt; 
* Primary meaning: contamination by food or hand that has come in contact the inside of someone's mouth
* Pollution due to contact with "the eater, the eaten food" or the plate on which someone has eaten
* leftover food on someone's plate, after he has eaten
* leftover food in the serving vessel after everyone is served
* a person who has passed human waste, before purification

While Uchchhishta is related to leftovers and contact with saliva, Uchchhishta should be differentiated from other terms also translated in English as "impure": ''Amedhya'' ("unfit for sacrifice") refers to contamination by contact to human waste, corpses, decomposition etc. and ''malina'' ("stained") refers to pollution by physical dirt.&lt;ref name="Davis220"&gt;Olivelle &amp; Davis Jr, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other bodily substances like sweat, saliva is considered to be part of body and also not part of it, that is, of "uncertain status". Thus, contact with saliva, Uchchhishta, is regarded as impure.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Manusmriti'' however does not regard saliva defiling in general, but only in the food context. Drops of saliva, which transmit from one person to another while speaking, are not treated impure.&lt;ref name="Davis225"&gt;Olivelle &amp; Davis Jr, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

The precept of not contaminating all the food or a drink with bacteria or viruses in one's saliva is of particular concern as the health of someone could be threatened through cross contamination.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Gadia p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

A medieval [[Siddhar]] mocks the concept of Uchchhishta. He questions how are the flowers offered to Hindu deities or honey not defiled by saliva of bees and the cow's milk by the saliva of the calf.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Uchchhista is generally regarded as highly polluting and impure in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp"/&gt; Hindus view Uchchhista with revulsion.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Dundes p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Eating Uchchhista is considered as humiliating;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; a Kannada proverb says that he is a dog who eats Uchchhista.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Offering Uchchhista to a higher [[Caste system in India|caste]] member is considered as his insult.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dundes p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; 

People usually do not dip, serve or accept food with the fingers or cutlery that has touched someone's mouth. While cooking also, the cook does not taste food and use the same utensil to stir the food. Once food is tasted with a utensil, it is put away to wash. Food which has been dipped with fingers and cutlery used for eating is considered Uchchhista.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; While sharing or eating dry food or fruits, the food is portioned so that it does not become contaminated by someone's saliva.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For the same reason, Hindus do not generally drink from each other's water glasses.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dundes p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 20th century, use of spoons or forks and metal plates were not used by orthodox Hindus as they had come in contact with one's mouth and thus could not be reused as they remained Uchchhista, even though cleaned. One-use leaf plates were preferred; Hindus traditionally eat with their fingers, without cutlery.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes pp. 110–1&lt;/ref&gt;

Uchchhishta is acceptable to be eaten by socially inferior individuals: one's servants, lower caste persons, beggars and animals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Khare p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Dalit|Untouchables]]" including [[Manual scavenging|Castes handling human waste]] historically used to live on leftovers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Eating someone's Uchchhista is seen as a sign of submission and acceptance of the person's superiority.&lt;ref name="Davis439" /&gt;

In modern India, the rules of Uchchhista are relaxed in the cases of intimacy of a couple or a family.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Eating the Uchchhishta food of a young child by his parents is also acceptable, as the child is not regarded a fully-grown separate individual.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Parents usually feed young children from their own plate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In contrast of the general negative connotations associated with it, eating some types of Uchchhista like of a husband by a wife, of a guru by the student and of a sacrifice or divine offering by all, is highly regarded.&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp" /&gt; [[Prasad]], food offered to a deity and having "eaten" by the deity, is sometimes considered the Uchchhista of the gods, as in some parts of North India; however other times as in parts of South India, the comparison of the sacred prasad to Uchchhista, is frowned upon.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis439"&gt;Olivelle &amp; Davis Jr, pp. 439–40&lt;/ref&gt;

A husband is considered equivalent to God for a Hindu wife. As such, wife can eat his Uchchhista as a sign of her love and submission.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The wife may eat in the same leaf as the husband's, after he finishes. The husband will leave some food in his plate for her to eat, as a symbol of his love.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The custom is ritually performed first at the time of marriage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  This act is said to signify her integration in her new family. It is also acceptable if the wife eats the Uchchhista of her in-laws or her husband's brothers.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

[[File:Shukracharya and Kacha.jpg|thumb|upright|A student bows to his guru. The student is prescribed to eat the guru's Uchchhishta, which is described variously as sacred and medicinal.]]
The ''[[Apastamba Dharmasutra]]'' (1st-millennium BCE), while describing the code of conduct for a student, refers to the concept of Uchchhishta. In ancient times, a student would stay with a teacher ([[guru]]) in the latter's house ([[Gurukula]]) and learn. In this period, a student should ask for alms for his livelihood, which he should not consider as Uchchhishta. A student is prescribed to not leave any food uneaten in his plate, that is, leave no Uchchhishta. However, if any Uchchhishta remains, he should bury it, throw it in the water or give it away to a [[Shudra]] (a member from the lower social strata). The student is prescribed to eat the Uchchhishta of his guru, which are regarded as sacred as a sacrificial oblation. Eating Uchchhishta of one's father or brother is also acceptable.&lt;ref name="Olivelle11pp"&gt;Olivelle pp. 11-2&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Vasishtha|Vasishtha Dharmasutra]]'' regards the Uchchhista of the guru, equivalent to medicine that an ill student should have.&lt;ref name="Olivelle311pp"&gt;Olivelle pp. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions to Uchchhishta are given in the ''Vasishtha Dharmasutra''. Food remnants stuck in teeth or food currently in the mouth are not considered impure, as they are treated part of the mouth like teeth. Swallowing the same cleanses the individual. While pouring water for someone to drink, if drops of water fall on the person's feet; the drops are not Uchchhista, but considered part of the ground.&lt;ref name="Davis225" /&gt;

The concept of Uchchhishta focuses on purification by washing one's hands and mouth after eating.&lt;ref name="Davis220" /&gt; The cleansing is extended to the kitchen so that so no trace of Uchchhishta or cooking of the meal before, is left.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Association with Hindu deities ==
[[File:Kalighat Matangi.jpg|thumb|The Hindu goddess Matangi is offered the taboo Uchchhishta food by the devotee in the ritually impure Uchchhishta state, with unwashed mouth and hands.]]
Offering Uchchhishta food to Hindu deities or worship by an Uchchhishta person is prohibited in mainstream Hinduism. However, the esoteric [[Tantra|Tantric]] goddess [[Matangi]] is recommended to be offered Uchchhishta food, in the polluted Uchchhishta state, with the remains of food in the mouth and hands; Matangi is associated with pollution and the outcaste and embodies the forbidden transgression of social norms.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley pp. 214–6&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess in a legend from the ''Shaktisamgama-tantram'' is also said to be born from Uchchhishta. The deity couples of [[Shiva]]-[[Parvati]] and [[Vishnu]]-[[Lakshmi]] dropped specks of food on the ground while eating. A divine maiden rose from the Uchchhishta and asked for their Uchchhishta. The deities blessed her and gave her the name Uchchhishta-Matangini (Matangi).&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Tantric deity worshipped in the impure Uchchhishta state is [[Uchchhishta Ganapati]] – a Tantric form of the elephant-headed god [[Ganesha]] – who also derives his name from Uchchhishta.&lt;ref name="grewal"&gt;Grewal pp. 122–3&lt;/ref&gt;

While Matangi is offered human Uchchhishta, the goddess [[Vimala Temple|Vimala]] is offered divine Uchchhishta of the god [[Jagannath]], a form of Vishnu. Vimala is the Tantric consort of Jagannath and the guardian goddess of the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]], [[Puri]] – the principal temple of the god. Vimala is said to be survive of the Uchchhishta of Jagannath; vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, after which they are sanctified as [[Mahaprasad (Jagannath Temple)|Mahaprasad]] (prasad). A legend justifies this tradition. Once, Shiva ate a food grain, the Uchchhishta of Vishnu as the latter's prasad. Half the grain stuck in Shiva's bread; however the sage [[Narada]] noticed it and ate it. Parvati, was upset that her rightful share of Vishnu's prasad had been eaten by Narada. In a peeved mood, she went to Vishnu and complained. Vishnu pacified her saying that in the [[Kali Yuga]] (the present era as per Hindu beliefs), she would live at Puri as Vimala, and would daily eat the remnants of his food.&lt;ref name="Bimala"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tripathy|first=Shrinibas|date=September 2009|title=Goddess Bimala at Puri|url=http://Odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Odishareview/2009/September/engpdf/66-69.pdf|journal=Odisha Review|publisher=Government of Odisha e-Magazine|pages=66–69|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later versions of the [[Hindu Epic|Hindu epic]] ''[[Ramayana]]'', [[Shabari]], a forest dweller woman, is instructed by her guru to wait for the arrival of the god [[Rama]] in her hermitage. She daily collects wild berries tasting them once for sourness, keeping only the sweet ones and discarding the bitter ones so that she could offer the god [[Rama]] only sweet berries, when he visits her. Unknowingly, the berries become Uchchhishta. Over time, she ages to an elderly woman. When Rama finally visits her hermitage, Shabari offers him the Uchchhishta berries. [[Lakshmana]], Rama's brother, objects to the impurity of the Uchchhishta berries, unworthy to be eaten. However, Rama accepts the Uchchhishta berries, as they offered it with great love and devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Khare p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keshavadas pp. 121–5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5245">In [[game theory]], the '''unscrupulous diner's dilemma''' (or just '''diner's dilemma''') is an [[n-player game|''n''-player]] [[prisoner's dilemma]]. The situation imagined is that several individuals go out to eat, and prior to ordering, they agree to split the check equally between all of them. Each individual must now choose whether to order the expensive or inexpensive dish. It is presupposed that the expensive dish is better than the cheaper, but not by enough to warrant paying the difference when eating alone. Each individual reasons that the expense s/he adds to their bill by ordering the more expensive item is very small, and thus the improved dining experience is worth the money. However, having all reasoned thus, they all end up paying for the cost of the more expensive meal, which by assumption, is worse for everyone than having ordered and paid for the cheaper meal.

==Formal definition and equilibrium analysis==
Let ''a'' represent the joy of eating the expensive meal, ''b'' the joy of eating the cheap meal, ''k'' is the cost of the expensive meal, ''l'' the cost of the cheap meal, and ''n'' the number of players.  From the description above we have the following ordering &lt;math&gt;k-l&gt;a-b&lt;/math&gt;.  Also, in order to make the game sufficiently similar to the [[Prisoner's dilemma]] we presume that one would prefer to order the expensive meal given others will help defray the cost, &lt;math&gt;a - \frac{1}{n}k &gt; b - \frac{1}{n}l&lt;/math&gt;

Consider an arbitrary set of strategies by a player's opponent.  Let the total cost of the other players' meals be ''x''.  The cost of ordering the cheap meal is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}x + \frac{1}{n}l&lt;/math&gt; and the cost of ordering the expensive meal is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}x + \frac{1}{n}k&lt;/math&gt;.  So the utilities for each meal are &lt;math&gt;a - \frac{1}{n}x - \frac{1}{n}k&lt;/math&gt; for the expensive meal and &lt;math&gt;b - \frac{1}{n}x - \frac{1}{n}l&lt;/math&gt; for the cheaper meal.  By assumption, the utility of ordering the expensive meal is higher.  Remember that the choice of opponents' strategies was arbitrary and that the situation is symmetric.  This proves that the expensive meal is [[dominance (game theory)|strictly dominant]] and thus the unique [[Nash equilibrium]].

If everyone orders the expensive meal all of the diners pay ''k'' and their total utility is &lt;math&gt;a-k&lt;/math&gt;.  On the other hand, if all the individuals had ordered the cheap meal, their utility would have been &lt;math&gt;b-l&lt;/math&gt;. Since by assumption &lt;math&gt;b-l&gt;a-k&lt;/math&gt;, everyone would be better off.  This demonstrates the similarity between the diner's dilemma and the prisoner's dilemma.  Like the prisoner's dilemma, everyone is worse off by playing the unique equilibrium than they would have been if they collectively pursued another strategy.&lt;ref name="glance"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Glance |first=Natalie S. |last2=Huberman |first2=Bernardo A. |date=March 1994 |title=The dynamics of social dilemmas |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=F76F506E-1A94-4FC6-A44B-C0F31E0F091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental evidence==
Gneezy, Haruvy, and Yafe (2004) tested these results in a field experiment. Groups of six diners faced different billing arrangements. In one arrangement the diners pay individually, in the second they split the bill evenly between themselves and in the third the meal is paid entirely by the experimenter. As predicted, the consumption is the smallest when the payment is individually made, the largest when the meal is free and in-between for the even split. In a fourth arrangement, each participant pays only one sixth of their individual meal and the experimenter pay the rest, to account for possible unselfishness and social considerations. There was no difference between the amount consumed by these groups and those splitting the total cost of the meal equally. As the private cost of increased consumption is the same for both treatments but splitting the cost imposes a burden on other group members, this indicates that participants did not take the welfare of others into account when making their choices. This contrasts to a large number of laboratory experiments where subjects face analytically similar choices but the context is more abstract.&lt;ref name="gneezy"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gneezy |first=Uri |first2=Ernan |last2=Haruvy |first3=Hadas |last3=Yafe |date=April 2004 |title=The inefficiency of splitting the bill |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=114 |issue=495 |pages=265–280 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00209.x |url=http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/gneezy/pub/docs/splitting-bill.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Z8SQSbql?url=http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/gneezy/pub/docs/splitting-bill.pdf |archive-date=2015-06-08 |access-date=2015-06-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yuanmou Man''' ({{zh|s=元谋人|t=元謀人|p=Yuánmóu Rén}}), ''[[Homo erectus]] yuanmouensis'', refers to a member of the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' whose remnants, two [[incisors]], were discovered near Danawu Village in [[Yuanmou County]] in [[Southwest China|southwestern]] province of [[Yunnan]], [[China]]. Later, stone artifacts, pieces of animal bone showing signs of human work and [[wood ash|ash]] from [[campfires]] were also dug up from the site. The fossils are on display at the [[National Museum of China]], [[Beijing]].

==Discovery==
The remnants of Yuanmou Man were discovered on May 1, 1965, by the [[geologist]] Fang Qian, who was working for the Geological Mechanics Research Institute. Based on the [[palaeomagnetic]] dating of the rock they were found in, it was initially estimated that the fossils were about 1.7 [[Megaannum|Ma]] and thus represented the earliest fossils of human ancestors found in [[China]] and [[East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Pu | last1 = Li | first2 = Fang | last2 = Chien | first3 = Hsing-Hua | last3 = Ma | first4 = Ching-Yu | last4 = Pu | first5 = Li-Sheng | last5 = Hsing | first6 = Shih-Chiang | last6 = Chu | title = Preliminary study on the age of Yuanmou man by palaeomagnetic technique | journal = Scientia Sinica | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 645–64 | year = 1977 | pmid = 339347 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22799956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once thought to be possibly predated by "[[Wushan Man]]", but that has turned out to be a stem-[[orangutan]] ([[Ponginae]]).&lt;ref name="Ciochon"&gt;Ciochon RL. (2009). The mystery ape of Pleistocene Asia. Nature. 459: 910-911. {{doi|10.1038/459910a}}. This piece in Nature is based on a contribution to the forthcoming book ''Out of Africa I: Who, When and Where?'' (eds,
Fleagle, J. G. et al. Springer, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
The dating has been indirectly questioned by Geoffrey Pope who argued that evidence does not support the appearance of hominidae in Asia prior to 1 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey G. Pope. [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/16/4988 Evidence on the Age of the Asian Hominidae Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (1983)] 80:4988-92&lt;/ref&gt; (this skepticism has since lifted, with additional findings in the last 25 years). There are still, however, conflicting opinions regarding the age of the Yuanmou Fm. and Yuanmou Man. You et al. (1978) suggested that Member 4 in the upper part of the formation is [[middle Pleistocene]] and should be designated the Shangnabang Fm., while the sediments exposed at Shagou containing ''Enhydriodon'' cf. ''falconeri'' should be designated the Shagou Fm. with an age
of [[Pliocene]].&lt;ref name="Qian_et_al_1991"&gt;Qian F, Li Q, Wu P, Yuan S, Xing R, Chen H, and Zhang H (1991). [http://www.nau.edu/~qsp/will_downs/100.pdf Lower Pleistocene, Yuanmou Formation: Quaternary Geology and Paleoanthropology of Yuanmou], Yunnan, China. Beijing: Science Press, pp. 17-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Liu et al. (1983) believed the age of Yuanmou Man was [[Middle Pleistocene]], did not exceed 0.73 [[Megaannum|Ma]], and was probably contemporaneous with [[Peking Man]]. Subsequently, Qian (1985) conducted further studies of the age of Yuanmou Man, but still obtained an age of 1.7 [[Megaannum|Ma]], or [[Early Pleistocene]]. These investigations initiated beneficial discussion, although further conflicting opinions persist regarding depositional environment, paleoclimatology, glaciation, and other aspects.&lt;ref name="Qian_et_al_1991"/&gt;

According to Qian et al. (1991), palaeomagnetic dates from near where the teeth were recovered average 1.7 [[Megaannum|Ma]]. Older research by Liu and Ding (1984) noted that the faunal sequence at the site was inverted, with more extinct species in the upper levels than deeper in the deposit, and based on this evidence they suggest to put the age of the Yuanmou man into the [[Middle Pleistocene]], that is about 0.5 - 0.6 [[Megaannum|Ma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.une.edu.au/~pbrown3/yuanmou.html Inverted strata]&lt;/ref&gt;
