      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33835">{{about|the concept of abstraction in general|specific types of abstraction and other uses of the term|}}

'''Abstraction''' in its main sense is a conceptual process where general [[rule of inference|rules]] and [[concept]]s are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal ("real" or "[[Abstract and concrete|concrete]]") signifiers, [[first principle]]s, or other methods.  

"An abstraction" is the outcome of this process—a concept that acts as a super-categorical noun for all subordinate concepts, and connects any related concepts as a ''group'', ''field'', or ''category''.&lt;ref name=Langer&gt;[[Suzanne K. Langer]] (1953), ''Feeling and Form: a theory of art developed from Philosophy in a New Key'' p. 90: "[[Sculpture|Sculptural form]] is a powerful abstraction from actual objects and the three-dimensional space which we construe ... through [[sensory system|touch and sight]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptual abstractions may be formed by filtering the [[information]] content of a [[concept]] or an observable [[phenomenon]],  selecting only the aspects which are relevant for a particular subjectively valued purpose. For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a [[ball]] selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, excluding, but not eliminating, the other phenomenal and cognitive characteristics of that particular ball.&lt;ref name=Langer/&gt; In a [[type–token distinction]], a type (e.g., a 'ball') is more abstract than its tokens (e.g., 'that leather soccer ball').

Abstraction in its secondary use is a [[#Material process|material process]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Alfred Sohn-Rethel, ''Intellectual and manual labour: A critique of epistemology'', Humanities Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; discussed in the [[#Themes|themes below]].

==Origins==
Thinking in abstractions is considered by [[anthropologist]]s, [[archaeologist]]s, and [[sociologist]]s to be one of the key traits in [[modern human behaviour]], which is believed to have developed between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. Its development is likely to have been closely connected with the development of human  [[language]], which (whether spoken or written) appears to both involve and facilitate abstract thinking.

===History===
''Abstraction'' involves induction of ideas or the synthesis of particular facts into one general theory about something. It is the opposite of ''specification'', which is the analysis or breaking-down of a general idea or abstraction into concrete facts. Abstraction can be illustrated with [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620), a book of modern scientific philosophy written in the late [[Elizabethan era]]&lt;ref name="Hesse"&gt;Hesse, M. B. (1964), "Francis Bacon's Philosophy of Science", in A Critical History of Western Philosophy, ed. D. J. O'Connor, New York, pp. 141–52.&lt;/ref&gt; of England to encourage modern thinkers to collect specific facts before making any generalizations.

Bacon used and promoted [[inductive reasoning|induction]] as an abstraction tool, and it countered the ancient [[deductive]]-thinking approach that had dominated the intellectual world since the times of Greek philosophers like [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Aristotle]]. Thales (c. 624–546 BCE) believed that everything in the universe comes from one main substance, water. He deduced or specified from a general idea, "everything is water", to the specific forms of water such as ice, snow, fog, and rivers.

Modern scientists can also use the opposite approach of abstraction, or going from particular facts collected into one general idea, such as the motion of the planets ([[Isaac Newton|Newton]] (1642–1727)). When determining that the sun is the center of our solar system ([[Copernicus]] (1473–1543)), scientists  had to utilize thousands of measurements to finally conclude that Mars moves in an elliptical orbit about the sun ([[Kepler]] (1571–1630)), or to assemble multiple specific facts into the law of falling bodies ([[Galileo]] (1564–1642)).

===Compression===
&lt;!--Is this section common knowledge or original research? --&gt;
An abstraction can be seen as a [[data compression|compression]] process,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Gregory |last=Chaitin |authorlink=Gregory Chaitin | url=http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165230/http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf | archivedate=2015-05-09 |title=The Limits Of Reason |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; mapping multiple different pieces of [[wikt:constituent|constituent]] data to a single piece of abstract data;&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Gell-Mann]] (1995) "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.6130010105/pdf What is complexity? Remarks on simplicity and complexity by the Nobel Prize-winning author of The Quark and the Jaguar]" ''Complexity'' states the 'algorithmic information complexity' (AIC) of some string of bits is the shortest length computer program which can print out that string of bits.&lt;/ref&gt; based on similarities in the constituent data, for example, many different physical cats map to the abstraction "CAT". This conceptual scheme emphasizes the inherent equality of both constituent and abstract data, thus avoiding problems arising from the distinction between "abstract" and "[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]]". In this sense the process of abstraction entails the identification of similarities between objects, and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction (which is [[#Physicality|itself an object]]).
:For example, ''[[#Simplification and ordering|picture 1 below]]''  illustrates the concrete relationship "Cat sits on Mat".
Chains of abstractions can  be [[construe]]d,&lt;ref name = Ross&gt;Ross, L. (1987). The Problem of Construal in Social Inference and Social Psychology. In N. Grunberg, R.E. Nisbett, J. Singer (eds), ''A Distinctive Approach to psychological research: the influence of Stanley Schacter''. Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; moving from neural impulses arising from sensory [[perception]] to basic abstractions such as color or [[shape]], to experiential abstractions such as a specific cat, to [[semantic]] abstractions such as the "idea" of a CAT, to classes of objects such as "mammals" and even categories such as "[[#Physicality|object]]" as opposed to "action".
:For example, ''[[#Simplification and ordering|graph 1 below]]''  expresses the abstraction "agent sits on location". This conceptual scheme entails no specific [[hierarchical]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] (such as the one mentioned involving cats and mammals), only a progressive [[#Simplification and ordering|exclusion of detail]].

===Instantiation===

Non-existent things in any particular place and time are often seen as abstract. By contrast, instances, or members, of such an abstract thing might exist in many different places and times. 

Those abstract things are then said to be ''multiply instantiated'', in the sense of ''picture 1'', ''picture 2'', etc., shown [[#Simplification and ordering|below]]. It is not sufficient, however, to define ''abstract'' ideas as those that can be instantiated and to define ''abstraction'' as the movement in the opposite direction to instantiation. Doing so would make the concepts "cat" and "telephone" abstract ideas since despite their varying appearances, a particular cat or a particular telephone is an instance of the concept "cat" or the concept "telephone". Although the concepts "cat" and "telephone" are ''abstractions'', they are not ''abstract'' in the sense of the objects in ''graph 1''  [[#Simplification and ordering|below]]. We might look at other graphs, in a progression from ''cat'' to ''mammal'' to ''animal'', and see that ''animal'' is more abstract than ''mammal''; but on the other hand ''mammal'' is a harder idea to express, certainly in relation to ''[[marsupial]]'' or ''[[monotreme]]''.

Perhaps confusingly, some [[philosophy|philosophies]] refer to ''[[trope (philosophy)|tropes]]'' (instances of properties) as ''[[abstract particular]]s''—e.g., the particular  [[red]]ness of a particular [[apple]] is an ''abstract particular''. This is similar to [[qualia]] and [[sumbebekos]].

===Material process===
Still retaining the primary meaning of 'abstrere' or 'to draw away from', the abstraction of money, for example, works by drawing away from the particular value of things allowing completely incommensurate objects to be compared (see the section on 'Physicality' below). [[Karl Marx]]'s writing on the [[commodity]] abstraction recognizes a parallel process.

The [[state (polity)]] as both concept and material practice exemplifies the two sides of this process of abstraction. Conceptually, 'the current concept of the state is an abstraction from the much more concrete early-modern use as the standing or status of the prince, his visible estates'. At the same time, materially, the 'practice of statehood is now constitutively and materially more abstract than at the time when princes ruled as the embodiment of extended power'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In – Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London }}, pp. 318–19.&lt;/ref&gt; {{further information|Power projection|Display behavior}}

===Ontological status===
The way that physical objects, like rocks and trees, have [[category of being|being]] differs from the way that properties of abstract concepts or relations have being, for example the way the [[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]], [[particular]], [[individual]]s pictured in ''[[#Simplification and ordering|picture 1]]'' exist differs from the way the concepts illustrated in ''[[#Simplification and ordering|graph 1]]'' exist. That difference accounts for the [[ontological]] usefulness of the word "abstract". The word applies to properties and relations to mark the fact that, if they exist, they do not exist in space or time, but that instances of them can exist, potentially in many different places and times.

===Physicality===
{{Further information|History of accounting#Ancient history}}
A physical object (a possible referent of a concept or word) is considered ''concrete'' (not abstract) if it is a ''particular individual'' that occupies a particular place and time. However, in the secondary sense of the term 'abstraction', this physical object can carry materially abstracting processes. For example, record-keeping aids throughout the [[Fertile Crescent]] included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in containers. According to {{harvnb|Schmandt-Besserat|(1981)}}, these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a [[bill of lading]] or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers for the count, marks were placed on the outside of the containers. These physical marks, in other words, acted as material abstractions of a materially abstract process of accounting, using conceptual abstractions (numbers) to communicate its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Eventually ([http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html Schmandt-Besserat estimates it took 4000 years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130084757/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html |date=January 30, 2012 }}) the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|author-link=Eleanor Robson|year=2008|title=Mathematics in Ancient Iraq|isbn=978-0-691-09182-2}}. p. 5: these calculi were in use in Iraq for primitive accounting systems as early as 3200–3000 BCE, with commodity-specific counting representation systems. Balanced accounting was in use by 3000–2350 BCE, and a [[sexagesimal number system]] was in use 2350–2000 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract things are sometimes defined as those things that do not exist in [[reality]] or exist only as sensory experiences, like the color [[red]]. That definition, however, suffers from the difficulty of deciding which things are real (i.e. which things exist in reality). For example, it is difficult to agree to whether concepts like ''God'', ''the number three'', and ''goodness'' are real, abstract, or both.

An approach to resolving such difficulty is to use ''[[predicate (grammar)|predicates]]'' as a general term for whether things are variously real, abstract, concrete, or of a particular property (e.g., ''good''). Questions about the properties of things are then [[proposition]]s about predicates, which propositions remain to be evaluated by the investigator. In the ''graph 1''  [[#Simplification and ordering|below]], the graphical relationships like the arrows joining boxes and ellipses might denote predicates.

===Referencing and referring===
Abstractions sometimes have ambiguous [[referent]]s; for example, "[[happiness]]" (when used as an abstraction) can refer to as many things as there are people and events or [[being|states of being]] which make them happy. Likewise, "[[architecture]]" refers not only to the design of safe, functional buildings, but also to elements of creation and [[innovation]] which aim at elegant solutions to [[construction]] problems, to the use of space, and to the attempt to evoke an [[emotion|emotional response]] in the builders, owners, viewers and users of the building.&lt;!--See discussion pages 3 to 12 in Eugene Raskin, ''Architecturally Speaking, 2nd edition'', a Delta book, Dell (1966), trade paperback, 129 pages--&gt;

===Simplification and ordering===
Abstraction uses a [[strategy]] of simplification, wherein formerly concrete details are left ambiguous, vague, or undefined; thus effective [[communication]] about things in the abstract requires an [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient. This is true for all verbal/abstract communication.

[[File:Cat-on-mat.svg|thumb|250px|[[Conceptual graph]] for A Cat sitting on the Mat ''(graph 1)'']]
[[File:JerryFelix.JPG|right|thumb|125px|Cat on Mat ''(picture 1)'']]
For example, many different things can be [[red]]. Likewise, many things sit on surfaces (as in ''picture 1'', to the right). The property of ''[[red]]ness'' and the [[Relation of Ideas|relation]] ''[[sitting|sitting-on]]'' are therefore abstractions of those objects. Specifically, the conceptual diagram ''graph 1'' identifies only three boxes, two ellipses, and four arrows (and their five labels), whereas the ''picture 1'' shows much more pictorial detail, with the scores of implied relationships as implicit in the picture rather than with the nine explicit details in the graph.

''Graph 1'' details some explicit relationships between the objects of the diagram. For example, the arrow between the ''agent'' and ''CAT:Elsie'' depicts an example of an ''[[is-a]]'' relationship, as does the arrow between the ''location'' and the ''MAT''. The arrows between the [[gerund]]/[[present participle]] ''SITTING'' and the [[noun]]s ''agent'' and ''location'' express the [[diagram]]'s basic relationship; ''"agent is SITTING on location"''; ''Elsie'' is an instance of ''CAT''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John F. Sowa|Sowa, John F.]] (1984). ''Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine''. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|978-0-201-14472-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the description ''sitting-on'' (graph 1) is more abstract than the graphic image of a cat sitting on a mat (picture 1), the delineation of abstract things from concrete things is somewhat ambiguous; this ambiguity or vagueness is characteristic of abstraction. Thus something as simple as a newspaper might be specified to six levels, as in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s illustration of that ambiguity, with a progression from abstract to concrete in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (1979):&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter]] (1979) ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

::(2) a newspaper
:::(3) ''The San Francisco Chronicle''
::::(4) the May 18 edition of ''The San Francisco Chronicle''
:::::(5) my copy of the May 18 edition of ''The San Francisco Chronicle''
::::::(6) my copy of the May 18 edition of ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' as it was when I first picked it up (as contrasted with my copy as it was a few days later: in my fireplace, burning)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An abstraction can thus encapsulate each of these levels of detail with no [[loss of generality]]. But perhaps a detective or philosopher/scientist/engineer might seek to learn about something, at progressively deeper levels of detail, to solve a crime or a puzzle.

===Thought processes===
In [[philosophy|philosophical terminology]], ''abstraction'' is the [[thinking|thought process]] wherein [[idea]]s&lt;ref&gt;But an idea can be [[symbol]]ized. "A symbol is any device whereby we are enabled to make an abstraction." -- p.xi and chapter 20 of [[Suzanne K. Langer]] (1953), ''Feeling and Form: a theory of art developed from '''Philosophy in a New Key''''': New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 431 pages, index.&lt;/ref&gt; are distanced from [[object (philosophy)|objects]].

==As used in different disciplines==

===In art===
{{Main article|Abstraction (art)}}
Typically, ''abstraction'' is used in the arts as a [[synonym]] for [[abstract art]] in general. Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world—it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003405/abstract-art|title=abstract art|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. NY/New Haven: The Drawing Center/Yale University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-300-10826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freedom from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm National Gallery of Art: Abstraction.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608000000/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In computer science===
{{Main article|Abstraction (software engineering)}}
[[Computer scientists]] use abstraction to make models that can be used and re-used without having to re-write all the program code for each new application on every different type of computer. They [[communication|communicate]] their solutions with the computer by writing [[source code]] in some particular [[computer language]] which can be translated into [[machine code]] for different types of computers to execute. Abstraction allows program designers to separate categories and concepts related to computing problems from specific instances of implementation. This means that the program code can be written so that it does not depend on the specific details of supporting applications, [[operating system]] software or hardware, but on an abstract concept of the solution to the problem that can then be integrated with the system with minimal additional work.

=== In general semantics ===
Abstractions and levels of abstraction play an important role in the theory of [[general semantics]] originated by [[Alfred Korzybski]]. [[Anatol Rapoport]] wrote: "Abstracting is a mechanism by which an infinite variety of experiences can be mapped on short noises (words)."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===In linguistics===
{{Main article|Abstraction (linguistics)}}
Researchers in [[linguistics]] frequently apply abstraction so as to allow analysis of the phenomena of language at the desired level of detail. A commonly used abstraction, the ''[[phoneme]]'', abstracts [[speech sound]]s in such a way as to neglect details that cannot serve to differentiate meaning. Other analogous kinds of abstractions (sometimes called "[[emic unit]]s") considered by linguists include [[morpheme]]s, [[grapheme]]s, and [[lexeme]]s.

Abstraction also arises in the relation between [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]]. Pragmatics involves considerations that make reference to the user of the language; semantics considers expressions and what they denote (the [[designata]]) abstracted from the language user; and syntax considers only the expressions themselves, abstracted from the designata.

===In mathematics===
{{Main article|Abstraction (mathematics)}}
Abstraction in [[mathematics]] is the process of extracting the underlying essence of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.

The advantages of abstraction in mathematics are:
* It reveals deep connections between different areas of mathematics
* Known results in one area can suggest [[conjecture]]s in a related area
* Techniques and methods from one area can be applied to prove results in a related area

The main disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts are more difficult to learn, and require a degree of [[mathematical maturity]] and experience before they can be assimilated.

===In music===
In music, the term ''abstraction'' can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of [[tonality]]. [[Atonal]] music has no key signature, and is characterized by the exploration of internal numeric relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ABSTRACT.HTM Washington State University: Glossary of Abstraction.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911121123/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ABSTRACT.HTM |date=September 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In neurology===
{{Further information|Intelligence|Mental rotation|Mental operations}}
A recent meta-analysis suggests that the verbal system has greater engagement for abstract concepts when the perceptual system is more engaged for processing of concrete concepts. This is because abstract concepts elicit greater brain activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus compared to concrete concepts which elicit greater activity in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Jing | last2 = Conder | first2 = Julie A. | last3 = Blitzer | first3 = David N. | last4 = Shinkareva | first4 = Svetlana V. | year = 2010 | title = Neural Representation of Abstract and Concrete Concepts: A Meta-Analysis of Neuroimaging Studies | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 31| issue = 10| pages = 1459–1468| doi = 10.1002/hbm.20950 | pmid = 20108224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research into the [[human brain]] suggests that the left and right hemispheres differ in their handling of abstraction. For example, one meta-analysis reviewing human brain lesions has shown a left hemisphere bias during tool usage.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Lewis "Cortical Networks Related to Human Use of Tools" '''12''' (3): 211–231 ''The Neuroscientist'' (June 1, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In philosophy===
Abstraction in [[philosophy]] is the process (or, to some, the alleged process) in [[concept]] formation of recognizing some set of common features in [[individual]]s, and on that basis forming a concept of that feature. The notion of abstraction is important to understanding some philosophical controversies surrounding [[empiricism]] and the [[problem of universals]]. It has also recently become popular in formal logic under [[predicate abstraction]]. Another philosophical tool for discussion of abstraction is [[thought space]].

===In psychology===
[[Carl Jung]]'s definition of abstraction broadened its scope beyond the thinking process to include exactly four mutually exclusive, different complementary psychological functions: sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking. Together they form a structural totality of the differentiating abstraction process. Abstraction operates in one of these functions when it excludes the simultaneous influence of the other functions and other irrelevancies, such as emotion. Abstraction requires selective use of this structural split of abilities in the psyche. The opposite of abstraction is [[concretism (psychology)|concretism]]. ''Abstraction'' is one of Jung's 57 definitions in Chapter XI of ''[[Psychological Types]]''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is an abstract ''thinking'', just as there is abstract ''feeling'', ''sensation'' and ''intuition''. Abstract thinking singles out the rational, logical qualities ... Abstract feeling does the same with ... its feeling-values. ... I put abstract feelings on the same level as abstract thoughts. ... Abstract sensation would be aesthetic as opposed to sensuous ''sensation'' and abstract intuition would be symbolic as opposed to fantastic ''intuition''. (Jung, [1921] (1971): par. 678).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In social theory===
In social theory, abstraction is used as both an ideational and material process. [[Alfred Sohn-Rethel]], asked "Can there be abstraction other than by thought?"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He used the example of commodity abstraction to show that abstraction occurs in practice as people create systems of abstract exchange that extend beyond the immediate physicality of the object and yet have real and immediate consequences. This work was extended through the 'Constitutive Abstraction' approach of writers associated with the Journal [[Arena (Australian publishing co-operative)|''Arena'']]. Two books that have taken this theme of the abstraction of social relations as an organizing process in human history are {{Cite book |  title= Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community | url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0761950737}}(1996) and the second volume of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community, published in 2006: {{Cite book | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In – Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214 }} These books argue that the nation is an abstract community bringing together strangers who will never meet as such; thus constituting materially real and substantial, but abstracted and mediated relations. The books suggest that contemporary processes of globalization and mediatization have contributed to materially abstracting relations between people, with major consequences for how we live our lives.

It can be easily argued that abstraction is an elementary methodological tool in several disciplines of social science. These disciplines have definite and different man concepts that highlight those aspects of man and his behaviour by idealization that are relevant for the given human science. For example, homo sociologicus is the man as sociology abstracts and idealizes it, depicting man as a social being. Moreover, we could talk about homo cyber sapiens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steels |first=Luc |title=The Homo Cyber Sapiens, the Robot Homonidus Intelligens, and the 'Artificial Life' Approach to Artificial Intelligence |location=Brussel |publisher=Vrije Universiteit, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the man who can extend his biologically determined intelligence thanks to new technologies), or homo creativus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Inkinen | first = Sam | year = 2009 | title = Homo Creativus – Creativity and Serendipity Management in Third Generation Science and Technology Parks | url = | journal = Science and Public Policy | volume = 36| issue = 7 | pages = 537–548| doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (who is simply creative).

Abstraction (combined with Weberian [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealization]]) plays a crucial role in [[economics]]. Breaking away from directly experienced reality was a common trend in 19th century sciences (especially [[physics]]), and this was the effort which was fundamentally determined the way economics tried and still tries to approach the economic aspects of social life. It is abstraction we meet in the case of both Newton’s physics and the neoclassical theory, since the goal was to grasp the unchangeable and timeless essence of phenomena. For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] created the concept of the material point by following the abstraction method so that he abstracted from the dimension and shape of any perceptible object, preserving only inertial and translational motion. Material point is the ultimate and common feature of all bodies. [[Neoclassical economists]] created the indefinitely abstract notion of [[homo economicus]] by following the same procedure. Economists abstract from all individual and personal qualities in order to get to those characteristics that embody the essence of economic activity. Eventually, it is the substance of the economic man that they try to grasp. Any characteristic beyond it only disturbs the functioning of this essential core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbács |first=Peter |chapter=Methodological Principles and an Epistemological Introduction|pages=1–52|title= The Theory of New Classical Macroeconomics.

'''Abstractionism''' is the [[theory]] that the [[mind]] obtains some or all of its [[concept]]s by [[abstraction|abstracting]] them from concepts it already has, or from [[experience]].&lt;ref name="Geach1957"&gt;Geach, Peter (1957) Mental Acts - Their Contents and Their Objects. Routledge Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; One may, for example, abstract 'green' from a set of experiences which involve green along with other [[property (philosophy)|properties]]. Also, for example, one may abstract a generic concept like 'vegetable' from the already possessed concepts of its instances (carrot, broccoli, onion, etc.). This view was criticized by [[George Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_philosophy/summary/v024/24.4flage.html | title=Berkeley on Abstraction | journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy | year=1986 | volume=24 | issue=4 | pages=483–501 | doi=10.1353/hph.1986.0073 | last=Flage | first=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Geach]].&lt;ref name="Geach1957"/&gt;

== Development ==
Abstractionism has its roots in [[Aristotle]]'s writings, particularly those rejecting the [[Plato|Platonic]] [[Theory of forms|theory of Forms]]. They were adopted and developed further by the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] so that the doctrine became entrenched in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Berkeley's Philosophy of Mathematics|last=Jesseph|first=Douglas|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2010|isbn=0226398978|location=Chicago|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] also developed his own theory of abstract ideas although it was against the Scholastic theory of essences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Causality and Mind: Essays on Early Modern Philosophy|last=Jolley|first=Nicholas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199669554|location=Oxford|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, ideas originate through the senses and the materials or the sensory data provided by these become the basis of the way we form general ideas of classes of things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Philosophy of Human Learning|last=Winch|first=Christopher|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0415161908|location=London|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory contradicts the [[Empiricism|empiricist]] standpoint due to its focus on intuitive and demonstrative knowledge as demonstrated in Locke's recognition that pure mathematics and pure morals are founded on intuition and demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Phenomenology|last=Sinha|first=D|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=1969|isbn=9789024702664|location=The Hague|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several modern versions of abstractionism and these include those developed by theorists such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jerry Fodor]], who proposed that concepts are preformed at birth and that we learn to match the words of our language onto the pre-existing concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Education: The Key Concepts|last=Gingell|first=John|last2=Winch|first2=Christopher|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=9780415428927|location=New York|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky, for instance, explained the "deep structure" of the [[Internet]] or the grammar of meaning hidden beneath the surface of words by citing that "linguists isolate from an essentially heterogeneous linguistic reality a standard and homogeneous system, thus grounding abstraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Interlock: Art, Conspiracy, and the Shadow Worlds of Mark Lombardi|last=Goldstone|first=Patricia|publisher=Counterpoint|year=2015|isbn=9781619025653|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Berkeley's opposition to abstractionism is considered to be primarily directed at Locke's claim that words are made general through the mediation of general ideas. This is due to the view that Locke's argument is tantamount to claiming that the word "triangle" can be applied to many different triangles because the abstract general idea of the form is used as a template or standard when identifying new instances as being of the same sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on the Philosophy of George Berkeley|last=Sosa|first=Ernest|publisher=D.

The '''administration of justice''' is the process by which the [[legal system]] of a government is executed. The presumed goal of such administration is to provide [[justice]] for all those accessing the legal system. The phrase is also used commonly to describe a University degree (as in: a BA in Administration of Justice), which can be a prerequisite for a job in law enforcement or government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohlone.edu/instr/adminjustice/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807231503/http://ohlone.edu/instr/adminjustice/ |archivedate=2016-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In ''Attorney General for New South Wales v Love'', the appellant argued that section 24 of the Act 9 Geo 4 c 83 did not have the effect applying the [[Nullum Tempus Act]] (9 Geo 3 c 16) (1768) to [[New South Wales]]. Counsel for the appellant said that ''Whicker v Hume''&lt;ref&gt;Whicker v Hume (1858) 7 HL 124&lt;/ref&gt; decided that section 24 referred not to laws generally, but only to laws as to modes of procedure, and that the Nullum Tempus Act did not deal merely with procedure. The Lord Chancellor said that the Act 9 Geo 4 c 83 ''prima facie'' "applied the Nullum Tempus Act to the Colony in question as much as if it had re-enacted it for that Colony." He then said:

{{Blockquote|Sect. 24 of that Act provides "that all the laws and statutes in force within the realm of England at the passing of this Act" (that is to say, the year 1828) "shall be applied in the administration of justice in the courts of New South Wales," and it is sought by construction to limit the words "all laws and statutes" by introducing into the section the words "having relation to procedure" or some equivalent expression. At least that is the only intelligible mode in which the argument can be supported, because the words which do occur in the section - "in the administration of justice" - would certainly include a limitation of the time within which actions can be brought, and their Lordships are of the opinion that the language of the section cannot be limited so as to exclude the statute, which for the reasons pointed out by the learned judges were and are so important in the administration of justice in the Colony.&lt;ref&gt;Attorney General for New South Wales v Love [1898] AC 679 at 685, [[Privy Council|PC]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Canada==
[[Section 92(14) of the Constitution Act, 1867]], also known as the administration of justice power, grants the provincial legislatures of Canada the authority to legislate on:
:14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.

===Ontario===
Section 1 of the Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1990 c A6) provides:

{{Blockquote|In this Act, "administration of justice" means the provision, maintenance and operation of,
:(a) the courts of justice of the Province of Ontario,
:(b) land registry offices,
:(c) jails, and
:(d) the offices of coroners and Crown Attorneys,
for the performance of their functions, including any functions delegated to such courts, institutions or offices or any official thereof by or under any Act; (“administration de la justice”)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90a06 Digitised copy]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This provision was previously section 1 of the Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1980 c 6),&lt;ref&gt;(1982) 37 Ontario Reports 246 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xj9SAQAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was previously section 1 of Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1970 c 6),&lt;ref&gt;(1995) Ontario Reports 387 and 389 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kEJSAQAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was previously section 1 of Administration of Justice Act 1968 (SO 1968 c 1) (17 Eliz 2 c 1).&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Law Reform Commission.

==Republic of Ireland==
"Offence against the administration of justice" is defined by [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0027/sec0007.html section 7] of the [[Criminal Procedure Act 2010]].

==United Kingdom==
In England, the administration of justice is a [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|prerogative]] of the [[Crown of the United Kingdom|Crown]]. It may be exercised only through duly-appointed [[Judiciary of England and Wales|judges]] and [[Courts of England and Wales|courts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]]. ''[[A First Book of English Law]]''. Fourth Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1960. Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following matters and things pertain to the administration of justice: the organisation of the courts; the prerogative of justice, the [[prerogative of mercy]], and any prerogative power to create new courts; [[nolle prosequi]]; the appointment, tenure and immunity of judges; the immunity of other participants in legal proceedings; [[contempt of court]]; the composition and availability of juries, any requirement that their verdict be unanimous, and the allowances they receive; the branches of the legal profession; and the provision of [[legal aid]] and advice.&lt;ref&gt;O. Hood Phillips. ''A First Book of English Law''. Fourth Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1960. Chapter 2. (These matters and things are discussed by the author  in a chapter titled "The Administration of Justice").&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration of justice is an act which is normally associated with the carrying on of the business of government. When a government does that act, it is thereby exercising its sovereignty. It would accordingly be a violation of British sovereignty for a foreign government to do that act in British territory without authorisation.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, Sir Arnold Duncan. Legal Effects of War. Second Edition. Cambridge University Press. 1944. Page 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2 of the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]] authorises foreign service courts to exercise their jurisdiction in the United Kingdom.

There are [[offences against the administration of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Card, Richard. [[Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law]]. Twelfth Edition. Butterworths. 1992. {{ISBN|0 406 00086 7}}. Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone's Statutes on Criminal Law: 2004-2005. Fourteenth Edition. Part XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of section 54 of the [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]], the following are administration of justice offences:
*The offence of [[perverting the course of justice]]
*The offence under section 51(1) of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]
*An offence of aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring, suborning or inciting another person to commit an offence under section 1 of the [[Perjury Act 1911]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/25/section/54 section 54(6)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The offence of perverting the course of justice has been referred to as "interfering with the administration of justice" and as "obstructing the administration of justice".&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Offences relating to the Administration of Justice. Working Paper No 62. HMSO. 1975. Paragraph 10 at page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 6(c) of the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]] provides that nothing in the foregoing provisions of that Act restricts liability for contempt of court in respect of conduct intended to impede or prejudice the administration of justice.

An [[arrestable offence]], other than one specified in Schedule 5 to the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], was [[serious arrestable offence|serious]] for the purposes of that Act if it led to, or was intended or likely to lead to, amongst other things, serious interference with the administration of justice. An arrestable offence which consisted of making a threat was serious for the purposes of that Act if carrying out the threat would be likely to lead to, amongst other things, serious interference with the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/116/enacted sections 116(1) to (4) and (6)(b)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal proceedings held in public, the court may, where it appears to be necessary for avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in those proceedings, or in any other proceedings pending or imminent, order that the publication of any report of the proceedings, or any part of the proceedings, be postponed for such period as the court thinks necessary for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]], section 4(2). Where in proceedings for any offence which is an administration of justice offence for the purposes of section 54 of the [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]] it appears to the court that there is a possibility that (by virtue of that section) proceedings may be taken against a person for an offence of which he has been acquitted, section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 applies as if those proceedings were pending or imminent: The Contempt of Court Act 1981, section 4(2A).&lt;/ref&gt;

Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 30 of the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] is exempt information if its disclosure under that Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/section/31 section 31(1)(c)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Amargosa River [[pupfish]]''' (''Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae'') is a member of a pupfish [[Cyprinodon nevadensis|species complex]] which inhabits the watershed of ancient [[Lake Manly]] (present day [[Death Valley]] in [[California]], USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=657|title=Cyprinodon nevadensis|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the species inhabits two disjunct perennial reaches of the lower Amargosa River.  The upstream portion is near Tecopa and passes through the Amargosa Canyon.  The lower portion is northwest of [[Saratoga Springs (Death Valley)|Saratoga Springs]], just at the head (southern inlet) of Death Valley, where the Amargosa River turns north to enter the valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=104269|title=Amargosa River Pupfish - Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae (Miller)|publisher=California Department of Fish and Game|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These dimunitive fish subsist on cyanobacteria and algae.  They have a life history adapted to the vagaries of the intermittent nature of their environment.  They have a very short generation time (&lt;1 year and usually just a few months), which allows for rapid exploitation of flooded portions of the streambed in years of high flow.

'''Antinomy''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀντί, ''antí'', "against, in opposition to", and νόμος, ''nómos'', "law") refers to a real or apparent mutual incompatibility of two laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/antinomy Antinomy], Encyclopædia Britannica Online, accessed 8/27/2016&lt;/ref&gt; It is a term used in [[logic]] and [[epistemology]], particularly in the philosophy of [[Kant]].

There are many examples of antinomy. A self-contradictory phrase such as "There is no absolute truth" can be considered an antinomy because this statement is suggesting in itself to be an absolute truth, and therefore denies itself any truth in its statement. A [[paradox]] such as "[[this sentence is false]]" can also be considered to be an antinomy; for the sentence to be true, it must be false, and vice versa.

==Kant's use==
{{see|Kant's antinomies}}
The term acquired a special significance in the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), who used it to describe the equally rational but contradictory results of applying to the universe of pure thought the categories or criteria of reason that are proper to the universe of sensible perception or [[experience]] (phenomena).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Antinomy|volume=2|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empirical]] reason cannot here play the role of establishing rational truths because it goes beyond possible experience and is applied to the sphere of that which [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcends]] it.

For Kant there are [[Kant's antinomies|four antinomies]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Al-Azm, The Origins of Kant's Argument in the Antinomies, Oxford University Press 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Grier, Kant's Doctrine of Transcendental Illusion, Cambridge University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Grier, "The Logic of Illusion and the Antinomies," in Bird (ed.), Blackwell, Oxford 2006, pp. 192-207.&lt;/ref&gt; connected with:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/antinomy|title=antinomy {{!}} philosophy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the limitation of the universe in respect to [[space]] and [[time]]
*the theory that the whole consists of indivisible [[atom]]s (whereas, in fact, none such exist)
*the problem of [[free will]] in relation to universal [[causality]]
*the existence of a universal being&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In each antinomy, a thesis is contradicted by an antithesis. For example: in the first antinomy, Kant proves the thesis that time must have a beginning by showing that if time had no beginning, then an infinity would have elapsed up until the present moment. This is a manifest contradiction because infinity cannot, by definition, be completed by "successive synthesis"—yet just such a finalizing synthesis would be required by the view that time is infinite; so the thesis is proven. Then he proves the antithesis, that time has no beginning, by showing that if time had a beginning, then there must have been "empty time" out of which time arose. This is incoherent (for Kant) for the following reason: Since, necessarily, no time elapses in this pretemporal void, then there could be no alteration, and therefore nothing (including time) would ever come to be: so the antithesis is proven. Reason makes equal claim to each proof, since they are both correct, so the question of the limits of time must be regarded as meaningless.

This was part of Kant's critical program of determining limits to [[science]] and philosophical inquiry. These contradictions are inherent in reason when it is applied to the world as it is in itself, independently of any perception of it (this has to do with the distinction between [[phenomena]] and [[noumena]]). Kant's goal in his critical philosophy was to identify what claims are and are not justified, and the antinomies are a particularly illustrative example of his larger project.

==Marx's use==

Kant is not the only philosopher to employ the term, however. Another famous use of antinomy is by Karl Marx, in Capital Volume One, in the chapter entitled 'The Working Day'. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me23/me23_245.htm], K. Marx. Das Kapital &lt;/ref&gt; On Marx's account, capitalist production sustains 'the assertion of a right to an unlimited working day, and the assertion of a right to a limited working day, both with equal justification'. &lt;ref&gt;J. Furner, Marx on Capitalism: The Interaction-Recognition-Antinomy Thesis, Brill Press 2018, p.405.&lt;/ref&gt; Furner emphasizes that the thesis and antithesis of this antinomy are not contradictory opposites, but rather 'consist in the assertion of rights to states of affairs that are contradictory opposites'. &lt;ref&gt;J. Furner, Marx on Capitalism: The Interaction-Recognition-Antinomy Thesis, Brill Press 2018, p.125.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Black sheep-1.jpg|thumb|A black sheep stands out from the flock.]]
[[File:The Black sheep illustrated by William Wallace Denslow.jpg|thumb|The Black Sheep from a 1901 edition of ''Mother Goose'' by [[William Wallace Denslow]]]]
In the [[English language]], '''black sheep''' is an [[idiom]] used to describe an odd or disreputable member of a group, especially within a [[family]]. The term stems from the genetic effect in [[sheep]] whereby a [[recessive gene]] occasionally manifests in the birth of a sheep with black rather than white coloring; these sheep stand out in the flock and their wool was traditionally considered less valuable.

The term has typically been given negative implications, implying waywardness.&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{ cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9re1vfFh04sC&amp;pg=PA64 | title = American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms |accessdate=2007-11-13 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=978-0-395-72774-4 |author1=Ammer, Christine | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]], the ''black sheep effect'' refers to the tendency of group members to judge likeable ingroup members more positively and deviant [[ingroup]] member more negatively than comparable [[ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] members.&lt;ref name="Marques et al. (1988)"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Marques | first = J. M. |author2=Yzerbyt, V. Y.|author3=Leyens, J. | title = The 'Black Sheep Effect': Extremity of judgments towards ingroup members as a function of group identification | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | year = 1988 | volume = 18 | pages = 1–16 | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2420180102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
In most [[sheep]], a white fleece is not [[albinism]] but a [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] gene that switches color production off, thus obscuring any other color that may be present.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} As a result, a black fleece in most sheep is [[recessive gene|recessive]], so if a white ram and a white ewe are each [[heterozygous]] for black, in about 25 percent of cases they will produce a black lamb. In fact in most white sheep breeds only a few white sheep are heterozygous for black, so black lambs are usually much rarer than this.

==Idiomatic usage==
The term originated from the occasional black [[sheep]] which are born into a flock of white sheep due to a [[Genetics|genetic]] process of [[recessive trait]]s. Black wool was considered commercially undesirable because it could not be dyed.&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt; In 18th and 19th century England, the black color of the sheep was seen as the mark of the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Sykes | first = Christopher Simon | title = Black Sheep | publisher = [[Viking Press]] | location = New York | year = 1983 |page=11 |isbn=978-0-670-17276-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, the expression has lost some of its negative connotations, though the term is usually given to the member of a group who has certain characteristics or lack thereof deemed undesirable by that group.&lt;ref name="black sheep"&gt;{{ cite book | title = The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | year = 1992 |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/black-sheep |accessdate=2008-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Mitford]] described herself as "the red sheep of the family", a [[communist]] in a family of aristocratic [[fascist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/16/061016crbo_books1?currentPage=all "Red Sheep: How Jessica Mitford found her voice" by Thomas Mallon 16 Oct 2007 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The idiom is also found in other languages, e.g. [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. During the [[Second Spanish Republic]] a weekly magazine named ''[[El Be Negre]]'', meaning 'The Black Sheep', was published in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciberniz.com/benegre.htm El be negre (1931-1936) - La Ciberniz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211051525/http://www.ciberniz.com/benegre.htm |date=2013-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same concept is illustrated in some other languages by the phrase "white crow": for example ''belaya vorona'' (белая ворона) in [[Russian language|Russian]] and ''kalāg-e sefīd'' (کلاغ سفید) in [[Persian language|Persian]].

==In psychology==
In 1988, Marques, Yzerbyt and Leyens conducted an experiment where Belgian students rated the following groups according to trait-descriptors (e.g. sociable, polite, violent, cold): unlikeable Belgian students, unlikeable North African students, likeable Belgian students, and likeable North African students. The results provided support that the favorability is the highest for likeable ingroup members and the lowest for unlikeable ingroup members, whereas the favorability of unlikeable and likeable outgroup members is between the both former ones.&lt;ref name="Marques et al. (1988)" /&gt; These extreme judgements of likeable and unlikeable (i.e., deviant) ingroup members, relatively to comparable outgroup members is called "black sheep effect". This effect has been shown in various [[intergroup]] contexts and under a variety of conditions, and in many experiments manipulating likeability and norm deviance.&lt;ref name="Branscombe et al.

===Explanations===
[[File:Mirosław Bałka - Czarny papież i czarna owca (1987)01.jpg|thumb|''Black Pope and Black Sheep'', a sculpture by [[Mirosław Bałka]], 1987]]
A prominent explanation of the black sheep effect derives from the social identity approach ([[social identity theory]]&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)"&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Worchel, S. |author2=Austin, W. G. | title = The Social psychology of intergroup relations. | year = 1979 | publisher = Brooks-Cole | location = Monterey, CA }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[self-categorization theory]]&lt;ref name="Turner et al. (1987)"&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Turner, J. C. |author2=Hogg, M. A. |author3=Oakes, P. J. |author4=Reicher, S. D. |author5= Wetherell, M. S. | title = Rediscovering the Social group: A self-categorization theory. | year = 1987 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Group members are motivated to sustain a positive and distinctive [[social identity]] and, as a consequence, group members emphasize likeable members and evaluate them more positive than outgroup members, bolstering the positive image of their ingroup ([[ingroup bias]]). Furthermore, the positive social identity may be threatened by group members who deviate from a relevant group norm. To protect the positive group image, ingroup members derogate ingroup deviants more harshly than deviants of an outgroup (Marques, Abrams, Páez, &amp; Hogg, 2001).&lt;ref name="Marques et al. (2001)"&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Hogg, M. A. |author2= Tindale, S. | title = Blackwell handbook of social psychology: group processes. | year = 2001 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Mass }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Eidelman and Biernat showed in 2003 that personal identities are also threatened through deviant ingroup members. They argue that devaluation of deviant members is an individual response of ''interpersonal'' differentiation.&lt;ref name="Eidelman &amp; Biernat (2003)"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Eidelman | first = S. |author2=Biernat, M. | title = Derogating black sheep: Individual or group protection? | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | year = 2003 | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 602–609 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-1031(03)00042-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan and Lambert suggested in 1998 that [[cognitive process]]es such as assimilation and contrast, which may underline the effect, should be examined.&lt;ref name="Khan &amp; Lambert (1998)" /&gt;

===Limitations===
Even though there is widely support for the black sheep effect, the opposite pattern has been found, for example, that White participants judge unqualified Black targets more negative than comparable White targets (e.g. Feldman, 1972;&lt;ref name="Feldman (1972)"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Feldman | first = J. M. | title = Stimulus characteristics and subject prejudice as determinants of stereotype attribution | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | year = 1972 | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 333–340 | doi = 10.1037/h0032313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linville &amp; Jones, 1980).&lt;ref name="Linville &amp; Jones (1980)"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Linville | first = P. W. |author2=Jones, E. E. | title = Polarized appraisals of out-group members | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | year = 1980 | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | pages = 689–703 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.38.5.689 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, there are several factors which influence the black sheep effect. For instance, the higher the [[Identification (psychology)|identification]] with the ingroup, and the higher the [[entitativity]] of the ingroup, the more the black sheep effect emerges.&lt;ref name="Castano et al. (2002)"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Castano | first = E. |author2=Paladino, M.|author3=Coull, A.|author4=Yzerbyt, V.

{{Redirect|Blaming|the Elizabeth Taylor novel|Blaming (novel)}}
'''Blame''' is the act of [[censuring]], holding responsible, making negative statements about an individual or group that their action or actions are socially or morally irresponsible, the opposite of [[praise]].  When someone is [[morally responsible]] for doing something wrong their action is blameworthy. By contrast, when someone is morally responsible for doing something right, we may say that his or her action is [[praise]]worthy. There are other senses of praise and blame that are not ethically relevant. One may praise someone's good dress sense, and blame their own sense of style for their own dress sense.

Blaming appears to relate to include brain activity in the [[temporoparietal junction]] (TPJ).&lt;ref&gt;

==Sociology and psychology==
Humans - consciously and unconsciously - constantly make [[judgments]] about other people. The psychological criteria for judging others may be partly ingrained,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} negative and rigid indicating some degree of [[grandiosity]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Blaming provides a way of devaluing others, with the end result that the blamer feels superior, seeing others as less worthwhile making the blamer "perfect". Off-loading blame means putting the other person down by emphasizing his or her flaws.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, N.W., ''Coping With Infuriating, Mean, Critical People – The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern'' (2006)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] and [[abuse]] frequently feel responsible for causing negative feelings in the manipulator/abuser towards them and the resultant [[anxiety]] in themselves. This self-blame often becomes a major feature of [[victim mentality|victim status]].

The victim gets trapped into a [[self-image]] of [[victimization]]. The psychological profile of victimization includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, pessimism, negative thinking, strong feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[remorse]], self-blame and [[depression (mood)|depression]]. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;
Braiker, H.B., ''Who's Pulling Your Strings? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation'' (2006)
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-blame===
Two main types of [[self-blame (psychology)|self-blame]] exist:

# '''behavioral self-blame'''&amp;nbsp;– undeserved blame based on actions. Victims who experience behavioral self-blame feel that they should have done something differently, and therefore feel at fault.
# '''characterological self-blame'''&amp;nbsp;– undeserved blame based on character. Victims who experience characterological self-blame feel there is something inherently wrong with them which has caused them to deserve to be victimized.

Behavioral self-blame is associated with feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] within the victim. While the belief that one had control during the abuse (past control) is associated with greater psychological distress, the belief that one has more control during the recovery process (present control) is associated with less distress, less withdrawal, and more cognitive reprocessing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frazier | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Mortensen | first2 = H. | last3 = Steward | first3 = J. | year = 2005 | title = Coping Strategies as Mediators of the Relations Among Perceived Control and Distress in Sexual Assault Survivors | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 267–78 | doi=10.1037/0022-0167.52.3.267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counseling responses found helpful in reducing self-blame include:&lt;ref&gt;

* supportive responses
* psychoeducational responses (learning about [[rape trauma syndrome]] for example)
* responses addressing the issue of blame.

A helpful type of therapy for self-blame is [[cognitive restructuring]] or [[cognitive–behavioral therapy]]. Cognitive reprocessing is the process of taking the facts and forming a logical conclusion from them that is less influenced by shame or guilt.&lt;ref&gt;

===Victim blaming===
{{main article|Victim blaming}}
Victim blaming is holding the victims of a [[crime]], an [[accident]], or any type of [[abusive]] maltreatment to be entirely or partially [[moral responsibility|responsible]] for the incident that has occurred.

===Individual blame versus system blame===
In sociology [[individual blame]] is the tendency of a group or society to hold the individual responsible for his or her situation, whereas [[system blame]] is the tendency to focus on social factors that contribute to one's fate. 

===Blame shifting===
{{See also|Buck passing}}
Blaming others can lead to a "[[kick the dog]]" effect where individuals in a [[hierarchy]] blame their immediate subordinate, and this propagates down a hierarchy until the lowest rung (the "dog"). A 2009 experimental study has shown that blaming can be contagious even for uninvolved onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;
Jeanna Bryner: [http://livescience.com/culture/blame-contagious-100119.html Workplace Blame Is Contagious and Detrimental], [[LiveScience]], 2010-01-19, citing the January 2010 issue of the ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]''.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a propaganda technique===
[[Labeling theory]] accounts for blame by postulating that when intentional actors act out to continuously blame an individual for nonexistent psychological traits and for nonexistent variables, those actors aim to induce irrational [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] at an unconscious level. Blame in this case becomes a [[propaganda]] tactic, using repetitive blaming behaviors, [[innuendos]], and [[hyperbole]] in order to assign negative status to normative humans. When innocent people are blamed fraudulently for nonexistent psychological states and nonexistent behaviors, and there is no qualifying deviance for the blaming behaviors, the intention is to create a negative valuation of innocent humans to induce fear, by using [[fear mongering]]. For centuries, governments have used blaming in the form of [[demonization]] to influence public perceptions of various other governments, to induce feelings of [[nationalism]] in the public. Blame can [[objectify]] people, groups, and nations, typically negatively influencing the intended subjects of propaganda, compromising their objectivity.{{Citation needed|reason=Cannot determine the source of objectification in a propaganda context|date=July 2018}} Blame is utilized as a [[social control|social-control]] technique.{{Citation needed|reason=Blame is not mentioned in the linked article, cannot determine source|date=July 2018}}

=== In organizations ===
{{See also|Kiss up kick down}}
Some [[systems theory|systems theorists]] and [[management consultant]]s, such as [[Gerald Weinberg]], see the flow of blame in an [[organization]] as one of the most important indicators of that organization's robustness and integrity. Blame flowing upwards in a [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchy]], Weinberg argues, proves that superiors can take [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for their orders to their inferiors, and supply them with the resources required to do their jobs. But blame flowing downwards, from management to staff, or laterally between professionals, indicate organizational failure. In a blame culture, problem-solving is replaced by blame-avoidance. Weinberg emphasizes that blame coming from the top generates "fear, malaise, errors, accidents, and [[passive-aggressive]] responses from the bottom", with those at the bottom feeling powerless and lacking emotional safety.&lt;ref&gt;
Gerald M. Weinberg: [http://www.ayeconference.com/beyondblaming/ ''Beyond Blaming''], March 5, 2006, AYE Conference&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''no-blame culture'' has been widely{{quantify|date=May 2014}} considered as a means to increase [[safety]], in particular in areas where the consideration of possible [[human error]] is important, for instance in hospitals and in aviation. Together with questions of [[accountability]], this has also been subsumed under the concept of creating a ''Just culture''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [https://www.academia.edu/1035403/Medical_regulation_spectacular_transparency_and_the_blame_business research] conducted by [[King's College London]] found that increasing transparency and regulation in health care had unintended consequences of increasing defensive practice.  Linked to rare but high-profile scandals, a self-interested blame business was found to be increasing a presumption of "guilty until proven innocent"&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Brewing Justice: Fair Trade Coffee, Sustainability and Survival''''' is a [[book]] by American academic Daniel Jaffee.

The book, by studying [[coffee]] farmers in Mexico, offers an investigation of the social, economic, and environmental benefits of [[fair trade]]. Based on research in [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] indigenous communities in the state of Oaxaca, Brewing Justice follows the members of the cooperative Michiza, whose organic coffee is sold on the international fair trade market. It compares these families to conventional farming families in the same region, who depend on local middlemen and are vulnerable to the fluctuations of the world coffee market.

The book carries readers into the lives of these coffee producer households and their communities, offering a nuanced analysis of both the effects of fair trade on everyday life and the limits of its impact. Brewing Justice paints a clear picture of the complex dynamics of the fair trade market and its relationship to the global economy. Drawing on interviews with dozens of fair trade leaders, the book also explores the changing politics of this international movement, including the challenges posed by the entry of transnational corporations into the fair trade system. It concludes by offering recommendations for strengthening and protecting the integrity of fair trade.

{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}
In [[medicine]], '''decompensation''' is the functional deterioration of a structure or system that had been previously working with the help of [[allostasis|allostatic]] compensation. Decompensation may occur due to [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]], illness, or old age. When a system is "compensated", it is able to function despite stressors or defects. Decompensation describes an inability to compensate for these deficiencies. It is a general term commonly used in medicine to describe a variety of situations.

== Physiology ==
For example, ''cardiac decompensation'' may refer to the failure of the heart to maintain adequate blood [[Circulation (physiology)|circulation]], after long-standing (previously compensated) [[vascular disease]] (see [[heart failure]]). Short-term treatment of cardiac decompensation can be achieved through administration of [[dobutamine]], resulting in an increase in heart contractility via an [[inotropic]] effect.&lt;ref name=acute&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acute Decompensated Heart Failure|pmc=2801958 |year=2009|journal=Texas Heart Institute Journal|last1=Joseph|display-authors=etal|pmid=20069075|volume=36|pages=510–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kidney failure]] can also occur following a slow degradation of kidney function due to an underlying untreated illness; the symptoms of the latter can then become much more severe due to the lack of efficient compensation by the kidney.

[[File:Blacks-Law-Dictionary.jpg|thumb|right|340px|A definition states the meaning of a word using other words. This is sometimes challenging. Common dictionaries contain lexical descriptive definitions but there are various types of definition - all with different purposes and focuses.]]

A '''definition''' is a statement of the meaning of a term (a [[word]], [[phrase]], or other set of [[symbol]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Bickenbach, Jerome E., and Jacqueline M. Davies. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mAjMaRr9d5gC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=definition&amp;f=false Good reasons for better arguments: An introduction to the skills and values of critical thinking]. Broadview Press, 1996. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions can be classified into two large categories, [[intensional definition]]s (which try to give the essence of a term) and [[extensional definition]]s (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes).&lt;ref name=Lyons&gt;Lyons, John. "Semantics, vol. I." Cambridge: Cambridge (1977). p.158 and on.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important category of definitions is the class of [[ostensive definition]]s, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Dooly, Melinda. [https://books.google.com/books?id=C5TdV8LgtaQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Semantics and Pragmatics of English: Teaching English as a Foreign Language]. Univ. Autònoma de Barcelona, 2006. p.48 and on&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Terms with the same pronunciation and spelling but unrelated meanings are called [[homonyms]], while terms with the same spelling and pronunciation and related meanings are  called [[polysemes]].}}

In [[mathematics]], a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, instead of describing a pre-existing term. Definitions and [[axioms]] are the basis on which all of modern mathematics is constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Rossi
 (2011) Theorems, Corollaries, Lemmas, and Methods of Proof. John Wiley &amp; Sons p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic terminology==
{{redirect|definiens|the company|Definiens (company)}}
In modern usage, a ''definition'' is something, typically expressed in words, that attaches a meaning to a word or group of words. The word or group of words that is to be defined is called the ''definiendum'', and the word, group of words, or action that defines it is called the ''definiens''. In the definition ''"An elephant is a large gray animal native to Asia and Africa"'', the word "elephant" is the ''definiendum'', and everything after the word "is" is the ''definiens''.&lt;ref name="hurley9"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hurley |first1=Patrick J. |title=A Concise Introduction to Logic |chapter=Language: Meaning and Definition |edition=9 |publisher=Wadsworth |year=2006 |pages=86–91 |accessdate=2016-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''definiens'' is not ''the meaning'' of the word defined, but is instead something that ''conveys the same meaning'' as that word.&lt;ref name="hurley9"/&gt;

There are many sub-types of definitions, often specific to a given field of knowledge or study. These include, among many others, '''lexical definitions''', or the common dictionary definitions of words already in a language; '''demonstrative definitions''', which define something by pointing to an example of it (''"This," [said while pointing to a large grey animal], "is an Asian elephant."''); and '''precising definitions''', which reduce the vagueness of a word, typically in some special sense (''"'Large', among female Asian elephants, is any individual weighing over 5,500 pounds."'').&lt;ref name="hurley9"/&gt;

==Intensional definitions vs extensional definitions==
{{Main article|Intension|Extension (semantics)}}

An ''[[intensional definition]]'', also called a ''connotative'' definition, specifies the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for a thing being a member of a specific [[Set (mathematics)|set]].&lt;ref name=Lyons/&gt; Any definition that attempts to set out the essence of something, such as that by [[Genus-differentia definition|genus and differentia]], is an intensional definition.

An ''[[extensional definition]]'', also called a ''denotative'' definition, of a concept or term specifies its ''[[extension (semantics)|extension]]''. It is a list naming every [[object (philosophy)|object]] that is a member of a specific [[Set (mathematics)|set]].&lt;ref name=Lyons/&gt;

Thus, the "[[seven deadly sins]]" can be defined ''intensionally'' as those singled out by [[Pope Gregory I]] as particularly destructive of the life of grace and charity within a person, thus creating the threat of eternal damnation. An ''extensional'' definition would be the list of wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony. In contrast, while an intensional definition of "[[Prime Minister]]" might be "the most senior minister of a cabinet in the executive branch of government in a parliamentary system", an extensional definition is not possible since it is not known who future prime ministers will be.

===Classes of intensional definitions===
{{Main article|Genus–differentia definition}}
A '''genus–differentia definition''' is a type of [[intensional definition]] that takes a large category (the '''genus''') and narrows it down to a smaller category by a distinguishing characteristic (i.e. the differentia).&lt;ref&gt;Bussler, Christoph, and Dieter Fensel, eds. Artificial Intelligence: Methodology, Systems and Applications: 11th International Conference, AIMSA 2004: Proceedings. Springer-Verlag, 2004. p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, a genus-differentia definition consists of:
# '''a [[genus]]''' (or family): An existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition; all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus.
# '''the differentia''': The portion of the new definition that is not provided by the genus.

For example, consider the following genus-differentia definitions:
* ''a [[triangle]]'': A plane figure that has three straight bounding sides.
* ''a [[quadrilateral]]'': A plane figure that has four straight bounding sides.

Those definitions can be expressed as a genus ("a plane figure") and two differentiae ("that has three straight bounding sides" and "that has four straight bounding sides", respectively).

It is possible to have two different genus-differentia definitions that describe the same term, especially when the term describes the overlap of two large categories. For instance, both of these genus-differentia definitions of "square" are equally acceptable:
* ''a square'': a [[rectangle]] that is a [[rhombus]].
* ''a square'': a [[rhombus]] that is a [[rectangle]].

Thus, a "square" is a member of both the genus "rectangle" and the genus "rhombus".

===Classes of extensional definitions===
One important form of the extensional definition is ''[[ostensive definition]]''. This gives the meaning of a term by pointing, in the case of an individual, to the thing itself, or in the case of a class, to examples of the right kind. So one can explain who ''Alice'' (an individual) is by pointing her out to another; or what a ''rabbit'' (a class) is by pointing at several and expecting another to understand. The process of ostensive definition itself was critically appraised by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical investigations'', Part 1 §27–34&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[enumerative definition]]'' of a concept or term is an ''[[extensional definition]]'' that gives an explicit and exhaustive listing of all the [[object (philosophy)|objects]] that fall under the concept or term in question. Enumerative definitions are only possible for finite sets and only practical for relatively small sets.

===''Divisio'' and ''partitio''===
''Divisio'' and ''partitio'' are [[Classics|classical]] terms for definitions. A ''partitio'' is simply an intensional definition. A ''divisio'' is not an extensional definition, but an exhaustive list of [[subset]]s of a set, in the sense that every member of the "divided" set is a member of one of the subsets. An extreme form of ''divisio'' lists all sets whose only member is a member of the "divided" set. The difference between this and an extensional definition is that extensional definitions list ''members'', and not subsets.&lt;ref&gt;Katerina Ierodiakonou, "The Stoic Division of Philosophy", in ''Phronesis: A Journal for Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 38, Number 1, 1993, pp. 57–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominal definitions vs real definitions===
{{Main article|Essence}}
In classical thought, a definition was taken to be a statement of the essence of a thing. [[Aristotle]] had it that an object's essential attributes form its "essential nature", and that a definition of the object must include these essential attributes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Posterior Analytics]], Bk 1 c. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that a definition should state the essence of a thing led to the distinction between ''nominal'' and ''real'' essence, originating with Aristotle. In a passage from the [[Posterior Analytics]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Posterior Analytics]] Bk 2 c. 7&lt;/ref&gt; he says that the meaning of a made-up name can be known (he gives the example "goat stag"), without knowing what he calls the "essential nature" of the thing that the name would denote, if there were such a thing. This led medieval logicians to distinguish between what they called the ''quid nominis'' or "whatness of the name", and the underlying nature common to all the things it names, which they called the ''quid rei'' or "whatness of the thing". (Early modern philosophers like Locke used the corresponding English terms "nominal essence" and "real essence"). The name "[[hobbit]]", for example, is perfectly meaningful. It has a ''quid nominis''. But one could not know the real nature of hobbits, and so the real nature or ''quid rei'' of hobbits cannot be known. By contrast, the name "man" denotes real things (men) that have a certain ''quid rei''. The meaning of a name is distinct from the nature that thing must have in order that the name apply to it.

This leads to a corresponding distinction between ''nominal'' and ''real'' definitions. A nominal definition is the definition explaining what a word means, i.e. which says what the "nominal essence" is, and is definition in the classical sense as given above. A real definition, by contrast, is one expressing the real nature or ''quid rei'' of the thing.

This preoccupation with essence dissipated in much of modern philosophy. [[Analytic philosophy]] in particular is critical of attempts to elucidate the essence of a thing. [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] described essence as "a hopelessly muddle-headed notion".&lt;ref&gt;''A history of Western Philosophy'', p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently [[Kripke semantics|Kripke's]] formalisation of [[possible world]] semantics in [[modal logic]] led to a new approach to [[essentialism]]. Insofar as the essential properties of a thing are ''necessary'' to it, they are those things it possesses in all possible worlds. Kripke refers to names used in this way as [[rigid designator]]s.

==Operational Versus Theoretical Definitions==
A definition may also be classified as an [[operational definition]] or [[theoretical definition]].

==Terms with multiple definitions==

===Homonyms===
{{main article|Homonym}}
A [[homonym]] is, in the strict sense, one of a group of words that share the same spelling and pronunciation but have different  meanings.&lt;ref name="RHUD"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/homonym homonym], ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'' at dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus homonyms are simultaneously [[homograph]]s (words that share the same spelling, regardless of their pronunciation) ''and'' [[homophone]]s (words that share the same pronunciation, regardless of their spelling).  The state of being a homonym is called '''''homonymy'''''. Examples of homonyms are the pair ''stalk'' (part of a plant) and ''stalk'' (follow/harass a person) and the pair ''left'' (past tense of leave) and ''left'' (opposite of right).  A distinction is sometimes made between "true" homonyms, which are unrelated in origin, such as ''skate'' (glide on ice) and ''skate'' (the fish), and polysemous homonyms, or [[Polysemy|polysemes]], which have a shared origin, such as ''mouth'' (of a river) and ''mouth'' (of an animal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pandora.cii.wwu.edu/vajda/ling201/test3materials/semanticsHANDOUT.htm |title=Linguistics 201: Study Sheet for Semantics |publisher=Pandora.cii.wwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AefSOW9MW5UC&amp;pg=PA123 Semantics: a coursebook, p. 123], James R. Hurford and Brendan Heasley, Cambridge University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polysemes===
{{main article|Polysemy}}
[[Polysemy]]  is the capacity for a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] (such as a [[word]], [[phrase]], or [[symbol]]) to have multiple meanings (that is, multiple [[seme (semantics)|semes]] or [[sememe]]s and thus multiple [[word sense|senses]]), usually related by contiguity of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] within a [[semantic field]]. It is thus usually regarded as distinct from [[homonymy]], in which the multiple meanings of a word may be unconnected or unrelated.

==In logic and mathematics==
In mathematics, definitions are generally not used to describe existing terms, but to give meaning to a new term.&lt;ref&gt;David Hunter (2010) Essentials of Discrete Mathematics. Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers, Section 14.1&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of a mathematical statement changes if definitions change. The precise meaning of a term given by a mathematical definition is often different than the English definition of the word used,&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Houston
 (2009) How to Think Like a Mathematician: A Companion to Undergraduate Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; which can lead to confusion for students who do not pay close attention to the definitions given.

===Classification of mathematical definitions===
Authors have used different terms to classify definitions used in formal languages like mathematics.  [[Norman Swartz]] classifies a definition as "stipulative" if it is intended to guide a specific discussion.   A stipulative definition might be considered a temporary, working definition, and can only be disproved by showing a logical contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/swartz/definitions.htm#part5.1|title=Norman Swartz - Biography|work=sfu.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a "descriptive" definition can be shown to be "right" or "wrong" with reference to general usage.

Swartz defines a ''[[precising definition]]'' as one that extends the descriptive dictionary definition (lexical definition) for a specific purpose by including additional criteria. A precising definition narrows the set of things that meet the definition.

[[Charles Stevenson|C.L. Stevenson]] has identified ''[[persuasive definition]]'' as a form of stipulative definition which purports to state the "true" or "commonly accepted" meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an altered use (perhaps as an argument for some specific belief). Stevenson has also noted that some definitions are "legal" or "coercive"&amp;nbsp;– their object is to create or alter rights, duties, or crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, C.L., ''Ethics and Language'', Connecticut 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recursive definitions===
A [[recursive definition]], sometimes also called an ''inductive'' definition, is one that defines a word in terms of itself, so to speak, albeit in a useful way. Normally this consists of three steps:
# At least one thing is stated to be a member of the set being defined; this is sometimes called a "base set".
# All things bearing a certain relation to other members of the set are also to count as members of the set. It is this step that makes the definition [[Recursion|recursive]].
# All other things are excluded from the set

For instance, we could define a [[natural number]] as follows (after [[Peano axioms|Peano]]): 
# "0" is a natural number.
# Each natural number has a unique successor, such that:
#* the successor of a natural number is also a natural number;
#* distinct natural numbers have distinct successors;
#* no natural number is succeeded by "0".
# Nothing else is a natural number.

So "0" will have exactly one successor, which for convenience can be called "1". In turn, "1" will have exactly one successor, which could be called "2", and so on. Notice that the second condition in the definition itself refers to natural numbers, and hence involves [[self-reference]]. Although this sort of definition involves a form of [[Circular definition|circularity]], it is not [[Vicious circle principle|vicious]], and the definition has been quite successful.

In the same way, we can define [[ancestor]] as follows:
#A parent is an ancestor.
#A parent of an ancestor is an ancestor.
#Nothing else is an ancestor.
Or simply: an ancestor is a parent or a parent of an ancestor.

==In medicine==
In [[medical dictionaries]], definitions should to the greatest extent possible be:

==Issues with definitions==

===Fallacies of definition===
{{Main article|Fallacies of definition}}
Certain rules have traditionally been given for definitions (in particular, genus-differentia definitions).&lt;ref&gt;Copi 1982 pp 165–169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joyce, Ch. X"&gt;Joyce, Ch. X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Ch. V&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macagno &amp; Walton 2014, Ch. III&lt;/ref&gt;
#A definition must set out the essential attributes of the thing defined.
#Definitions should avoid circularity. To define a horse as "a member of the species ''equus''" would convey no information whatsoever. For this reason, Locking{{specify|date=November 2010}} adds that a definition of a term must not consist of terms which are synonymous with it. This would be a circular definition, a ''circulus in definiendo''. Note, however, that it is acceptable to define two relative terms in respect of each other. Clearly, we cannot define "antecedent" without using the term "consequent", nor conversely.
#The definition must not be too wide or too narrow. It must be applicable to everything to which the defined term applies (i.e. not miss anything out), and to nothing else (i.e. not include any things to which the defined term would not truly apply).
#The definition must not be obscure. The purpose of a definition is to explain the meaning of a term which may be obscure or difficult, by the use of terms that are commonly understood and whose meaning is clear. The violation of this rule is known by the Latin term ''obscurum per obscurius''. However, sometimes scientific and philosophical terms are difficult to define without obscurity.
#A definition should not be negative where it can be positive. We should not define "wisdom" as the absence of folly, or a healthy thing as whatever is not sick. Sometimes this is unavoidable, however. For example, it appears difficult to define blindness in positive terms rather than as "the absence of sight in a creature that is normally sighted".

===Limitations of definition===
Given that a [[natural language]] such as [[English language|English]] contains, at any given time, a finite number of words, any comprehensive list of definitions must either be circular or rely upon [[primitive notion]]s. If every term of every ''definiens'' must itself be defined, "where at last should we stop?"&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Essay'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=0OoNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22where+at+last+should+we+stop%22+inauthor:locke&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 Bk. III, Ch. iv, 5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This problem parallels the [[diallelus]], but leads to scepticism about meaning rather than knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt; A dictionary, for instance, insofar as it is a comprehensive list of [[lexical definition]]s, must resort to [[Symbol grounding|circularity]].&lt;ref&gt;Generally [[Lexicography|lexicographers]] seek to avoid circularity wherever possible, but the definitions of words such as "the" and "a" use those words and are therefore circular. [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/the] [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/a] Lexicographer [[Sidney I. Landau]]'s essay "''Sexual Intercourse in American College Dictionaries''" provides other examples of circularity in dictionary definitions. (McKean, p. 73–77)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An exercise suggested by [[J. L. Austin]] involved taking up a dictionary and finding a selection of terms relating to the key concept, then looking up each of the words in the explanation of their meaning. Then, iterating this process until the list of words begins to repeat, closing in a "family circle" of words relating to the key concept.&lt;br&gt;(''[http://www.ditext.com/austin/plea.html A plea for excuses]'' in Philosophical Papers. Ed. [[J. O. Urmson]] and [[Geoffrey Warnock|G. J. Warnock]]. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1961. 1979.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the game of [[Vish (game)|Vish]], players compete to find circularity in a dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many philosophers have chosen instead to leave some terms undefined. The [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]] claimed that the highest genera (the so-called ten ''generalissima'') cannot be defined, since a higher genus cannot be assigned under which they may fall. Thus [[being]], unity and similar concepts cannot be defined.&lt;ref name="Joyce, Ch. X"/&gt; [[John Locke|Locke]] supposes in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Essay'', Bk. III, Ch. iv&lt;/ref&gt; that the names of simple concepts do not admit of any definition. More recently [[Bertrand Russell]] sought to develop a formal language based on [[Logical atomism|logical atoms]]. Other philosophers, notably [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], rejected the need for any undefined simples. Wittgenstein pointed out in his ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' that what counts as a "simple" in one circumstance might not do so in another.&lt;ref&gt;See especially ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' Part 1 §48&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the very idea that every explanation of the meaning of a term needed itself to be explained: "As though an explanation hung in the air unless supported by another one",&lt;ref&gt;He continues: "Whereas an explanation may indeed rest on another one that has been given, but none stands in need of another&amp;nbsp;– unless ''we'' require it to prevent a misunderstanding. One might say: an explanation serves to remove or to avert a misunderstanding&amp;nbsp;– one, that is, that would occur but for the explanation; not every one I can imagine." [[Philosophical Investigations]], Part 1 §87, italics in original&lt;/ref&gt; claiming instead that explanation of a term is only needed to avoid misunderstanding.

Locke and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] also argued that [[Principle of individuation|individuals]] cannot be defined. Names are learned by connecting an idea with a sound, so that speaker and hearer have the same idea when the same word is used.&lt;ref&gt;This theory of meaning is one of the targets of the [[private language argument]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is not possible when no one else is acquainted with the particular thing that has "fallen under our notice".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Essay'', Bk. III, Ch. iii, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Russell offered his [[theory of descriptions]] in part as a way of defining a proper name, the definition being given by a [[definite description]] that "picks out" exactly one individual. [[Saul Kripke]] pointed to difficulties with this approach, especially in relation to [[modal logic|modality]], in his book ''Naming and Necessity''.

There is a presumption in the classic example of a definition that the ''definiens'' can be stated. Wittgenstein argued that for some terms this is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Investigations&lt;/ref&gt; The examples he used include ''game'', ''number'' and ''family''. In such cases, he argued, there is no fixed boundary that can be used to provide a definition. Rather, the items are grouped together because of a [[family resemblance]]. For terms such as these it is not possible and indeed not necessary to state a definition; rather, one simply comes to understand the ''use'' of the term.{{efn|Note that one learns inductively, from [[ostensive definition]], in the same way, as in the [[Ramsey–Lewis method]].}}

In [[psychology]], '''desensitization''' is defined as the diminished [[Emotion|emotional]] responsiveness to a negative, aversive or positive stimulus after repeated exposure to it. It also occurs when an emotional response is repeatedly evoked in situations in which the action tendency that is associated with the emotion proves irrelevant or unnecessary. The process of desensitization was developed by [[psychologist]] [[Mary Cover Jones]], and is primarily used to assist individuals in unlearning [[Phobia|phobias]] and [[Anxiety|anxieties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stolerman|first=Ian|title=Encyclopedia of Psychopharmacology|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. "[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/TLBrink_PSYCH06.pdf Unit 6: Learning]." pp. 101&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Wolpe]] (1958) developed a method of a hierarchal list of anxiety evoking stimuli in order of intensity, which allows individuals to undergo adaption.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coon|title=Psychology: A Journey|year=2008|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth Corporation|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although medication is available for individuals suffering from anxiety, [[fear]] or phobias, [[empirical evidence]] supports desensitization with high rates of cure, particularly in clients suffering from depression or [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nemeroff|first=C.B.|title=The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science|year=2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Steps ==
The hierarchical list is constructed between client and therapist in rank ordered series of steps from the least disturbing to the most disturbing fears or phobias. Secondly the client is taught techniques that produce deep relaxation. It is impossible to feel both anxiety and relaxation at the same time{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}, so easing the client into deep relaxation helps inhibit any feelings of anxiety. [[Systematic desensitization]] (a guided reduction in fear, anxiety or aversion) can then be achieved by gradually approaching the feared stimulus while maintaining relaxation. Desensitization works best when individuals are directly exposed to the stimuli and situations they fear so anxiety-evoking stimuli are paired with inhibitory responses. This is carried out either by clients performing in real life situations (known as vivo desensitization), or, if it is not practical to directly act out the steps of hierarchy, by clients observing models performing the feared behaviour (known as vicarious desensitization). Clients slowly move up the hierarchy, repeating performances if necessary, until the last item on the list is performed without fear or anxiety.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Effects on animals ==

[[File:Horsemanship for Women 056.png|thumb|Horses have a natural fear of unpredictable movement. Pictured is a horse being desensitized to accept the fluttering skirt of a lady's [[riding habit]].]]
{{Main|Sacking out}}
Animals can also be desensitized to their rational or irrational fears. A [[race horse]] who fears the [[starting gate]] can be desensitized to the fearful elements (the creak of the gate, the starting bell, the enclosed space) one at a time, in small doses or at a distance. Clay et al. (2009) conducted an experiment whereby he allocated rhesus macaques to either a desensitization group or a control group, finding that those in the desensitization group showed a significant reduction in both the rate and duration of fearful behavior. This supports the use of [[PRT training]]. Desensitization is commonly used with simple phobias like [[Entomophobia|insect phobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0100057|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/6/2/109.pdf|title=Spider phobic therapy toy|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=6|issue=2|pages=109|year=2005|last1=Chamove|first1=Arnold S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carnagey|first1=Nicholas L.|last2=Anderson|first2=Craig A.|last3=Bushman|first3=Brad J.|date=1 May 2007|title=The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to real-life violence|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=43|issue=3|pages=489–496|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2006.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, desensitization therapy has been shown to be a useful tool in training domesticated dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Rynae|last2=Sargisson|first2=Rebecca J.|last3=Elliffe|first3=Douglas|title=The efficacy of systematic desensitization for treating the separation-related problem behaviour of domestic dogs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2010.11.001|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=129|issue=2–4|pages=136–145|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2010.11.001|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic desensitization used in conjunction with counter-conditioning was shown to reduce problem behaviours in dogs, such as vocalization and property destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Rynae|last2=Sargisson|first2=Rebecca J.|last3=Elliffe|first3=Douglas|title=The efficacy of systematic desensitization for treating the separation-related problem behaviour of domestic dogs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2010.11.001|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=129|issue=2–4|pages=136–145|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2010.11.001|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Effects on violence ==

Desensitization also refers to the potential for reduced responsiveness to actual violence [[Research_on_the_effects_of_violence_in_mass_media|caused by exposure to violence in the media]], although this topic is debated in the scientific literature on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=J.L.|title=Media Violence and its effect on aggression: assessing the scientific evidence|year=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press Incorporated.|location=Canada|jstor=10.3138/j.ctt1287sxj}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desensitization may arise from different sources of media, including TV, video games and movies. Some scholars suggest that violence may prime thoughts of hostility, with the possibility of affecting the way we perceive others and interpret their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paludi|first=M.A.|title=The Psychology of Teen Violence and Victimization|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO, LLC.|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gubler|first1=Joshua R.||last2=Kalmoe|first2=Nathan P.|last3=Wood|first3=David A.|title=Them's Fightin' Words: The Effects of Violent Rhetoric on Ethical Decision Making in Business|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=September 2015|volume=130|issue=3|pages=705|doi=10.1007/s10551-014-2256-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gubler|first1=Joshua R.||last2=Herrick|first2=Skye H. |last3=Price|first3=Richard P.|last4=Wood|first4=David A.|title=Violence, Aggression, and Ethics: The Link Between Exposure to Human Violence and Unethical Behavior|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=October 2015|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2926-4|volume=147|pages=25–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is hypothesized that initial exposure to violence in the media may produce a number of aversive responses such as increased heart rate, fear, discomfort, perspiration and disgust. However, prolonged and repeated exposure to violence in the media may reduce or habituate the initial psychological impact until violent images do not elicit these negative responses. Eventually the observer may become emotionally and [[Cognition|cognitively]] desensitized to media violence. In one experiment, participants who played violent video games showed lower heart rate and [[Electrodermal activity|galvanic skin response]] readings, which the authors interpreted as displaying a physiological desensitization to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gentile|first=D.A.|title=Media Violence and children: a complete guide for parents and professionals|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group Inc.|location=U.S.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies have failed to replicate this finding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0068382|pmid=23844191|title=Failure to Demonstrate That Playing Violent Video Games Diminishes Prosocial Behavior|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=7|pages=e68382|year=2013|last1=Tear|first1=Morgan J.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Mark|pmc=3700923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0030119|title=Comfortably numb or just yet another movie?

'''Doxa''' ([[ancient Greek]] δόξα; from verb δοκεῖν ''dokein'', "to appear", "to seem", "to think" and "to accept"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddoke%2Fw δοκέω] in Liddell and Scott&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning common [[belief]] or popular [[opinion]]. Used by the Greek [[rhetorics|rhetoricians]] as a tool for the formation of argument by using common opinions, the ''doxa'' was often manipulated by [[sophist]]s to [[persuasion|persuade]] the [[people]], leading to [[Plato]]'s condemnation of [[Athenian democracy]].

The word ''doxa'' picked up a new meaning between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC when the [[Septuagint]] translated the Hebrew word for "glory" (כבוד, ''kavod'') as ''doxa''. This translation of the Hebrew Scriptures was used by the [[early church]] and is quoted frequently by the New Testament authors. The effects of this new meaning of ''doxa'' as "glory" is made evident by the [[ubiquitous]] use of the word throughout the New Testament and in the worship services of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], where the glorification of God in true worship is also seen as true belief. In that context, doxa reflects behavior or practice in worship, and the belief of the whole church rather than personal opinion. It is the unification of these multiple meanings of doxa that is reflected in the modern terms of [[orthodoxy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=orthodox |title="Orthodox" Etymology |accessdate=2008-07-01 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[heterodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heterodox |title="Heterodox" Etymology |accessdate=2008-07-01 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ware |first1=Bishop Kallistos (Timothy) |authorlink1=Kallistos Ware |title=The Orthodox Church |edition=new |pages=8,266 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Penguin Books |date=29 Apr 1993 |isbn=978-0-14-014656-1 |ref=none }}&lt;/ref&gt; This semantic merging in the word ''doxa'' is also seen in Russian word слава (''slava''), which means ''glory'', but is used with the meaning of ''belief'', ''opinion'' in words like православие (''pravoslavie'', meaning ''orthodoxy'', or, literally, ''true belief'').

==Doxa, a philosopheme==
In Plato's [[Gorgias (dialogue)]], Plato presents the Sophists, rhetors who taught people how to speak for the promise of commercial success, as wordsmiths that ensnare and use the malleable doxa of the "multitude" to their advantage without shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/gorgias.html |title='Gorgias |last=Plato |date= 380 B.C.E.  |trans-title=Benjamin Jowett |publisher=[[Internet Classics Archive]] |accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this and other writings, Plato relegated doxa as being a belief, unrelated to reason, that resided in the unreasoning, lower-parts of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sorabji |first1=Richard|editor-last=Nussbaum |editor-first=Martha C.|date= March 26, 1992 |title= Essays on Aristotle's De Anima |publisher= Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint extended into the concept of doxasta in Plato's [[Theory of Forms]], which states that physical objects are manifestations of doxa and are thus not in their true form.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last= Szaif |first= Jan |date= 2007 |title= Doxa and Episteme as Modes of Acquaintance in Republic V |url= http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/jmszaif/jan-szaifs-home-page/talks-and-final-drafts/doxa-and-episteme-as-modes-of-acquaintance-in-republic-v/view |journal= Les Etudes Platoniciennes |publisher= Les Belles Lettres |volume= IV |pages= 253–272 |accessdate= 2 March 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140306030717/http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/jmszaif/jan-szaifs-home-page/talks-and-final-drafts/doxa-and-episteme-as-modes-of-acquaintance-in-republic-v/view |archivedate= 6 March 2014 |df=  }} &lt;/ref&gt; Plato's framing of ''doxa'' as the opponent of [[knowledge]] led to the classical opposition of [[error]] to [[truth]], which has since become a major concern in [[Western philosophy]]. (However, in the ''Theaetetus'' and in the ''Meno'', Plato has [[Socrates]] suggest that knowledge is ''orthos doxa'' for which one can provide a ''logos'', thus initiating the traditional definition of knowledge as "[[justified true belief]]".) Thus, error is considered in [[Western world|Occident]] as pure negativity, which can take various forms, among them the form of [[illusion]]. As such, ''doxa'' may ironically be defined as the "philosopher's sin" {{citation needed|reason=interesting idea, but needs evidence|date=January 2016}}. In classical rhetoric, it is contrasted with ''[[episteme]]''.

Plato's student [[Aristotle]] objected to Plato's theory of doxa. Aristotle perceived that doxa's value was in practicality and common usage, in contrast with Plato's philosophical purity relegating doxa to deception. Further, Aristotle held doxa as the first step in finding knowledge, as doxa had found applications in the physical world and those who held it had a great number of tests done to prove it and thus reason to believe it.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url= http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/sageukcst/doxa/0 |title= Doxa |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2005  |website= Credo Reference |publisher= Sage UK |accessdate=March 2, 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle clarifies this by categorizing the accepted truths of the physical world that are passed down from generation to generation as ''endoxa''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=Eggs |first= Ekkehard |last2= McElholm |first2= Dermot |date= 2002 |title= Doxa in Poetry: A Study of Aristotle's Poetics |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/poetics_today/v023/23.3eggs.pdf |journal= Poetics Today  |publisher= Duke University Press |volume= 23 |pages= 395-426 |accessdate= March 1, 2014 |doi=10.1215/03335372-23-3-395}} &lt;/ref&gt; Endoxa is a more stable belief than ''doxa'', because it has been "tested" in argumentative struggles in the ''[[Polis]]'' by prior interlocutors. The use of ''endoxa'' in the Stagirite's ''[[Organon]]'' can be found in Aristotle's ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'' and ''[[Rhetoric]]''.

==Use in sociology and anthropology&lt;!--linked from 'Pierre Bourdieu'--&gt;==

[[Pierre Bourdieu]], in his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'',&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1977 [1972]. Outline of a Theory of Practice. R. Nice, transl. Volume 16. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; used the term ''doxa'' to denote what is taken for granted in any particular society. The ''doxa'', in his view, is the experience by which "the natural and social world appears as self-evident".&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu (1972); p.164&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses what falls within the limits of the thinkable and the sayable ("the universe of possible discourse"), that which "goes without saying because it comes without saying".&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu (1972); pp. 167, 169&lt;/ref&gt; The humanist instances of Bourdieu's application of notion of ''doxa'' are to be traced in ''Distinction'' where ''doxa'' sets limits on social mobility within the social space through limits imposed on the characteristic consumption of each social individual: certain cultural artifacts are recognized by ''doxa'' as being inappropriate to actual social position, hence ''doxa'' helps to petrify social limits, the "sense of one's place", and one's sense of belonging, which is closely connected with the idea that "this is not for us" (''ce n'est pas pour nous''). Thus individuals become voluntary subjects of those incorporated mental structures that deprive them of more deliberate consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1979. La Distinction. Critique Sociale du Jugement. Paris: Les éditions de minuit. Page 549&lt;/ref&gt;

Doxa and opinion denote, respectively, a society's taken-for-granted, unquestioned truths, and the sphere of that which may be openly contested and discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/pers/bourdieu_pierre.htm Pierre Bourdieu - AnthroBase - Dictionary of Anthropology: A searchable database of anthropological texts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu explains the term "doxa" in his interview with theorist [[Terry Eagleton]]. To explain the term, he uses an example about the common beliefs in school. He asked students what qualifies as achievement in school. In response, the students on the lower end of the academic spectrum viewed themselves as being inferior or not as smart as the students who excelled. The responses are where doxa comes into play, because that was the common belief and attitude that the students had based on what society pushed them to believe. Bourdieu believes that doxa derived from socialization, because socialization also deals with beliefs deriving from society, and as we grow up in the environment, we tend to believe what society tells us is correct.

It is a socially accepted misconception, that if you do not score as high as someone else then you are obviously not as smart as they are. Scores do not prove that one is smarter, because there are many different factors that play into what you score on a test. People may excel within a certain topic and fail at another. However, even though it is a misconception, people tend to partake in common practices to make themselves feel better. For example, the students who feel inferior due to popular belief that they are not as smart as the students who score higher than them, may experiment with drugs to ease the insecurities they face. Bourdieu believes that doxa is more than common belief. He believes that it also has the potential to give rise to common action.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. and Eagleton, T. "Doxa and common life". New Left Review, 1992, p. 199, 111-121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, Phillip E. "Intelligence and Cultural Environment". London: Methuen, 1969, p 215. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in democracy==

While doxa is used as a tool for the formation of [[argument]], it should be noted that it is also formed by argument. The former can be understood as told by [[James A. Herrick]] in ''The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction'': "The Sophists in Gorgias hold that rhetoric creates truth that is useful for the moment out of doxa, or the opinions of the people, through the process of argument and counterargument. Socrates will have no part of this sort of 'truth' which, nevertheless, is essential to a democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herrick|first=James, A.|title=The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction, 3rd ed.|year=2005|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly noted, democracy, which by definition is the manifestation of public opinion, is dependent upon, and therefore also constrained by, the same limits imposed upon the individuals responsible for its establishment. Due to compromised opinions within a society, as well as opinions not counted for due to inaccessibility and apathy, doxa is not [[homogeneous]], nor is it created agreeably. Rather, it is pliable and imperfect—the outcome of an ongoing power struggle between clashing "truths".
 
To expand upon the quote from his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'' in the above section, "Use in sociology and anthropology", Bourdieu writes, "When there is a quasi-perfect correspondence between the objective order and the subjective principles of organization (as in ancient societies) the natural and social world appears as self-evident. This experience we shall call doxa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Smith of the [[University of Chicago]] observes in his article "The limitations of doxa: agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view": "Bourdieu consigns the practices of the denizens of ancient societies to the realm of doxa, their lives cast as routines predicated upon the mis-recognition of social orders as natural ways of life, rather than political products."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Adam T.|title=The Limitations of Doxa: Agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view|journal=Journal of Social Archaeology|year=2001|volume=1|issue=2|page=156|doi=10.1177/146960530100100201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This calls to attention that the notion of social order as naturally occurring is misperceived, disregarding its creation by political argumentation.
 
Doxa, then, can be understood as created by argument as well as used in the formation of argument, essential for the establishment of democratic policies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24736">{{short description|A legal obligation to provide a standard of reasonable care when performing an activity that could foreseeably harm others }}
{{Tort law}} 
In [[Tort|tort law]], a '''duty of care''' is a [[Law|legal]] [[Law of obligations|obligation]] which is imposed on an individual requiring adherence to a [[standard of care|standard]] of [[Reasonable person|reasonable]] care while performing any acts that could foreseeably harm others. It is the first element that must be established to proceed with an action in [[negligence]]. The claimant must [[Cause of action|be able to show]] a duty of care imposed by law which the defendant has breached. In turn, breaching a [[duty]] may subject an individual to liability. The duty of care may be imposed ''by [[operation of law]]'' between individuals with no ''current'' direct relationship (familial or contractual or otherwise), but eventually become related in some manner, as defined by [[common law]] (meaning case law).

Duty of care may be considered a formalisation of the [[social contract]], the implicit responsibilities held by individuals towards others within [[society]]. It is not a requirement that a duty of care be defined by law, though it will often develop through the [[jurisprudence]] of [[common law]].

==Development of the ''general'' duty of care==
At common law, duties were formerly limited to those with whom one was in [[privity]] one way or another, as exemplified by cases like ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'' (1842). In the early 20th century, judges began to recognize that the cold realities of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] (in which end users were frequently several parties removed from the original manufacturer) implied that enforcing the privity requirement against hapless consumers had harsh results in many [[product liability]] cases.  The idea of a general duty of care that runs to all who could be foreseeably affected by one's conduct (accompanied by the demolishing of the privity barrier) first appeared in the judgment of [[William Brett, 1st Viscount Esher|William Brett (later Lord Esher)]], [[Master of the Rolls]], in ''[[Heaven v Pender]]'' (1883). Although Brett's formulation was rejected by the rest of the court, similar formulations later appeared in the landmark U.S. case of ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'' (1916) and, in the UK, in ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' (1932).  Both ''MacPherson'' and ''Donoghue'' were product liability cases, and both expressly acknowledged and cited Brett's analysis as their inspiration.

==Scope==
Although the duty of care is easiest to understand in contexts like simple [[blunt trauma]], it is important to understand that the duty can be still found in situations where plaintiffs and defendants may be separated by vast distances of space and time.

For instance, an engineer or construction company involved in erecting a building may be reasonably responsible to tenants inhabiting the building many years in the future. This point is illustrated by the decision of the [[South Carolina Supreme Court]] in ''Terlinde v. Neely'' 275 S.C. 395, 271 S.E.2d 768 (1980), later cited by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''Winnipeg Condominium Corporation No. 36 v. Bird Construction Co.'' [1995] 1 S.C.R. 85:
{{bquote|The plaintiffs, being a member of the class for which the home was constructed, are entitled to a duty of care in construction commensurate with industry standards. In the light of the fact that the home was constructed as speculative, the home builder cannot reasonably argue he envisioned anything but a class of purchasers. By placing this product into the stream of commerce, the builder owes a duty of care to those who will use his product, so as to render him accountable for negligent workmanship.}}

==Responsibility==
Although the idea of a general duty of care is now widely accepted, there are significant differences among the [[common law]] jurisdictions concerning the specific circumstances under which that duty of care exists. Obviously, courts cannot impose unlimited liability and hold everyone liable for everyone else's problems; as [[Benjamin Cardozo|Justice Cardozo]] put it, to rule otherwise would be to expose defendants "to a liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ultramares Corporation v. Touche]]'', 255 N.Y. 170, 174 N.E. 441 (1931).&lt;/ref&gt;  There must be some reasonable limit to the duty of care; the problem is where to set that limit.

===England===
{{main article|Duty of care in English law}}

The question whether a duty of care exists depends firstly on whether there is an analogous case in which the Courts have previously held there to exist (or not exist) a duty of care; and, if there is no analogous case, what the particular court deciding the case at issue itself thinks about whether a duty of care exists. Situations in which a duty of care have previously been held to exist include doctor and patient, manufacturer and consumer &lt;ref&gt; Donoghue, infra &lt;/ref&gt;, and surveyor and mortgagor &lt;ref&gt; Smith v. Eric S Bush, [1990] 1 AC 831 &lt;/ref&gt;.

Accordingly, if there is an analogous case on duty of care, the court will simply apply that case to the facts of the new case without asking itself any normative question &lt;ref&gt; Robinson v. Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police, [2018] UKSC 4 &lt;/ref&gt; . It is only if there is no similar case that the court will then go onto apply the normative criteria which Lord Bridge of Harwich sets out in ''[[Caparo Industries plc v Dickman]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Caparo Industries plc v Dickman'' [1990] 2 AC 605&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[House of Lords]] set out the following three-part test:

* A relationship of "proximity" must exist between the defendant and the claimant;
* It must be "fair, just and reasonable" to impose liability.

===Australia===
The High Court of Australia has deviated from the British approach, which still recognises a proximity element. Rather, Australian law first determines whether the case at hand fits within an established category of case where a duty of care has been found.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1999|litigants=Perre v Apand |parallelcite= (1999) 198 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 180 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 217}} For example, occupiers of a premises automatically owe a duty of care to any person on their premises.&lt;ref name="Safeway Stores v Zaluzna"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|7|1987|litigants=Safeway Stores v Zaluzna |parallelcite= (1987) 162 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 479 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If this is not the case, then the plaintiff must prove that it was reasonably foreseeable that harm could result from the defendant's actions. If so, the Court then applies a 'salient features' test to determine whether the plaintiff is owed a duty of care.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt; Some of the salient features which the Court considers in making this inquiry include:
# Whether imposition of a duty of care would lead to 'indeterminate liability' – that is, it would interfere with the legitimate protection or pursuit of an individual's social or business interests.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt;{{rp|p 219-20}}
# Whether imposition of a duty would constitute an unreasonable burden on individual autonomy.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt;{{rp|p 223-5}}
# The degree of vulnerability of the plaintiff to the defendant's actions – their ability to guard against the harm.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt;{{rp|p 225-6}}
# The degree of knowledge which the defendant had about the probability and likely magnitude of harm to the plaintiff.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt;{{rp|p 230-1}}
Special rules exist for the establishment of duty of care where the plaintiff suffered mental harm, or where the defendant is a public authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act||Civil Liability Act 2002}} sections 27–33; 41–45.&lt;/ref&gt; 

To establish a duty of care, the plaintiff has to satisfy the requirement of CLA Act ss 27-33. In light of this, a large number of individuals cannot claim injuries as well. Meanwhile, compared to the ‘No-Fault Compensation’ system in New Zealand, the cost to claim injuries is much higher. In light of this, individuals especially the victims who lack knowledge or capability may choose not claim private nuisance after balancing the burden and outcomes. This view affirmed by Regina Graycar, he states that the courts in Australia are reluctant to award damages for personal injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Regina Graycar, ‘Love’s Labour’s Cost: The High Court Decision in Van Gervan v Fenton’ (1993) 1 Torts Law Journal 122,136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New South Wales, a plaintiff is able to recover for non-economic loss, including pain and suffering, loss of amenities/expectation of life and disfigurement, upon the severity of the loss being at least 15% of 'most extreme case'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act||Civil Liability Act 2002|16}}(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
As of October 2016, NSW Attorney General, Gabrielle Upton, has updated the maximum amount of damages for non-economic loss from $594,000 to $605,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Civil Liability (Non-economic Loss) Amendment Order'' 2016 (NSW) |url=https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/regulation/2010/606/whole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
On 27 March 2017, the French [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] adopted a law entitled “Devoir de vigilance des entreprises donneuses d'ordre”, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/dossiers/devoir_vigilance_entreprises_donneuses_ordre.asp Entreprises : devoir de vigilance des entreprises donneuses d'ordre], published 28 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; whose title has been translated into English as a "duty of vigilance" or "duty of care".&lt;ref&gt;Ethical Trading Initiative, [http://www.ethicaltrade.org/blog/france-adopts-new-corporate-duty-care-law France adopts new corporate “duty of care” law], 1 March 2017, accessed 7 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The law will oblige large [[French companies]] (companies with at least 5,000 staff in France or 10,000 staff within their combined French and foreign offices over two consecutive years) &lt;ref&gt;Norton Rose Fulbright, [http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/147606/a-new-duty-of-care-for-the-most-significant-companies-in-france A new duty of care for the most significant companies in France], accessed 7 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; to:

===United States===
Because each of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s is a separate [[States' rights|sovereign]] free to develop its own tort law under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], there are several tests for finding a duty of care in [[United States tort law]].

====Foreseeability test====
In several states, like [[Florida]] and [[Massachusetts]], the sole test is whether the harm to the plaintiff from the defendant's actions was foreseeable.&lt;ref&gt;''McCain v. Florida Power Corp.'', 593 So. 2d 500, 503 (Fla. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jupin v. Kask'', 849 N.E.2d 829, 835 (Mass. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multi-factor test====
The [[Supreme Court of California]], in a [[majority opinion]] by Justice [[David Eagleson]], criticized the idea that foreseeability, standing alone, constitutes an adequate basis on which to rest the duty of care: "Experience has shown that . . . there are clear judicial days on which a court can foresee forever and thus determine liability but none on which that foresight alone provides a socially and judicially acceptable limit on recovery of damages."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Thing v. La Chusa]]'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C3/48C3d644.htm 48 Cal. 3d 644, 667] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing upon the work of scholars such as Fowler V. Harper, Fleming James Jr., and [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]], [[California]] has developed a complicated [[balancing test]] consisting of multiple factors which must be carefully weighed against one another to determine whether a duty of care exists in a negligence action.

[[California Civil Code]] section 1714 imposes a general duty of ordinary care, which by default requires all persons to take reasonable measures to prevent harm to others.&lt;ref name="51 Cal.4th 764"&gt;Cabral v. Ralphs [http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/cabral-v-ralphs-grocery-33956 51 Cal.4th 764] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1968 case of ''[[Rowland v. Christian]]'', the court held that judicial exceptions to this general duty of care should only be created if clearly justified based on the following public-policy factors:

*the foreseeability of harm to the injured party;
*the degree of certainty he or she suffered injury;
*the closeness of the connection between the defendant’s conduct and the injury suffered;
*the moral blame attached to the defendant’s conduct;
*the policy of preventing future harm;
*the extent of the burden to the defendant and the consequences to the community of imposing a duty of care with resulting liability for breach;
*and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.&lt;ref name="69 Cal. 2d 108"&gt;''Rowland v. Christian'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/69C2d108.htm 69 Cal. 2d 108] (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1997 case added to this:

*the social utility of the defendant's conduct from which the injury arose.&lt;ref&gt;''Parsons v. Crown Disposal Co.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/15C4t456.htm 15 Cal. 4th 456] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary California appellate decisions treat the ''Rowland'' decision as the "gold standard" for determining the existence of a legal duty of care, and generally refer to the criteria for determining the existence of a legal duty of care as the ''Rowland'' factors.&lt;ref&gt;''Romero v. Superior Court'', [http://law.justia.com/cases/california/caapp4th/89/1068.html 89 Cal.App.4th 1068] (2001), quoting, "Juarez v. Boy Scouts of America, Inc." [http://law.justia.com/cases/california/caapp4th/81/377.html 81 Cal. App. 4th 377] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, the duty inquiry focuses on the general category of conduct at issue and the range of foreseeable harm it creates, rather than the specific actions or injuries in each case.&lt;ref&gt;''Ballard v. Aribe'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/41C3d564.htm#MA000696 41 Cal. 3d 564, 572 n.6] (1986).
In this oft-cited footnote, the Court stated: "[A] court's task — in determining 'duty' — is not to decide whether a particular plaintiff's injury was reasonably foreseeable in light of a particular defendant's conduct, but rather to evaluate more generally whether the category of negligent conduct at issue is sufficiently likely to result in the kind of harm experienced that liability may appropriately be imposed on the negligent party."&lt;/ref&gt; Appellate lawyer [[Jeffrey Ehrlich]] persuaded the California Supreme Court to clarify the central importance of this distinction with its 2011 decision in ''Cabral v. Ralphs Grocery Co''. which requires "no duty" rulings to be based on categorical public-policy rules that can be applied to a range of cases, without reference to detailed facts.&lt;ref&gt;"Chavez v. Glock, Inc." [http://www.leagle.com/xmlresult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20CACO%2020120724024.xml 207 Cal.App.4th 1283, 1314] (2012), ''citing'', "Cabral v. Ralphs" [http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/cabral-v-ralphs-grocery-33956 51 Cal.4th 764, 772] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;    By requiring courts to apply the ''Rowland'' factors at this high level of factual generality, the ''Cabral'' decision preserved the role of juries in determining whether the defendant breached its duty of care based on the unique circumstances of each case.&lt;ref name="51 Cal.4th 764"/&gt;

A majority of U.S. states have adopted some kind of multi-factor analysis based on the work of Prosser and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Adams v. City of Fremont'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/68CA4t243.htm 68 Cal.App.4th 243] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some states simply copied California's factors but modified them, like [[Michigan]] (which deleted the insurance factor and never picked up the social utility factor),&lt;ref&gt;''Buczkowski v. McKay'', 441 Mich. 96, 1100-1101; 490 N.W.2d 330 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; while others developed different lists of factors, such as this one from [[Tennessee]]:

*the foreseeability of the harm or injury;
*the possible magnitude of the potential harm or injury;
*the importance or social value of the activity engaged in by the defendant;
*the usefulness of the conduct to the defendant;
*the feasibility of alternative conduct;
*the costs and burdens associated with the alternative conduct;
*the relative usefulness of the alternative conduct;
*and the relative safety of the alternative conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''McCall v. Wilder'', 913 S.W.2d 150, 153 (Tenn. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 law review article identified 43 states that use a multifactor analysis in 23 various incarnations; consolidating them together results in a list of 42 different factors used by U.S. courts to determine whether a duty of care exists.&lt;ref&gt;W. Jonathan Cardi, ''The Hidden Legacy of Palsgraf: Modern Duty Law in Microcosm'', 91 B.U.L. Rev. 1873 (Dec. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tennessee Court of Appeal has also recently followed the California Supreme Court's lead by citing ''Cabral'' for the proposition that duty determinations must be made at the highest level of factual generality.&lt;ref&gt;"Gregory v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville", [http://judicialview.com/State-Cases/tennessee/Government__Politics/Gregory-v-Metropolitan-Government-of-Nashville-and-Davidson-County/28/565916 2012 WL 5306196, *10] (Tenn. Ct. App., 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{main article|Standard of care|Reasonable person}}

Once a duty exists, the plaintiff must show that the defendant ''breached'' it. This is generally treated as the second element of negligence in the United States. Breach involves testing the defendant's actions against the standard of a ''reasonable person'', which varies depending on the facts of the case. For example, [[physician]]s will be held to reasonable standards for members of their profession, rather than those of the general public, in negligence actions for [[medical malpractice]].

In turn, once the appropriate standard has been found, the ''breach'' is proven when the plaintiff shows that the defendant's conduct fell below or did not reach the relevant standard of reasonable care.&lt;ref&gt;''Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/19C4t26.htm 19 Cal.4th 26] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is possible that the defendant took every possible precaution and ''exceeded'' what would have been done by any reasonable person, yet the plaintiff was injured. If that is the case, then as a matter of law, the duty of care has not been breached and the plaintiff cannot recover in negligence.&lt;ref&gt;''Gilson v. Metropolitan Opera'', 5 N.Y.3d 574 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bozzi v. Nordstrom, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/186CA4t755.htm 186 Cal. App. 4th 755] (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; This is the key difference between negligence and [[strict liability]]; if strict liability attaches to the defendant's conduct, then the plaintiff can recover under that theory regardless of whatever precautions were taken by the defendant.

==Examples==

=== Products ===
Product liability was the context in which the general duty of care first developed. Manufacturers owe a duty of care to consumers who ultimately purchase and use the products. In the case of ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 562 of the House of Lords, [[James Atkin, Baron Atkin|Lord Atkin]] stated:

{{bquote|My Lords, if your Lordships accept the view that this pleading discloses a relevant cause of action you will be affirming the proposition that by Scots and English law alike a manufacturer of products, which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumer's life or property, owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care.}}

===Land===
{{main article|Premises liability}}
[[File:Occupiers Liability Warning Notice Ireland.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A notice informing potential entrants of limits to the duty of care]]
At common law, in the case of landowners, the extent of their duty of care to those who came on their premises varied depending on whether a person was classified as a [[trespasser]], [[licensee]], or [[invitee]]. This rule was eventually abolished in some common law jurisdictions.  For example, England enacted the [[Occupiers Liability Act 1957]]. Similarly, in the 1968 landmark case of ''[[Rowland v. Christian]]'',&lt;ref name="69 Cal. 2d 108"/&gt; the [[Supreme Court of California]] replaced the old classifications with a general duty of care to ''all'' persons on one's land, regardless of their status. After several highly publicized and controversial cases, the [[California Legislature]] enacted a statute in 1985 that partially restored immunity to landowners from some types of lawsuits from trespassers.&lt;ref&gt;''Calvillo-Silva v. Home Grocery'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/19C4t714.htm 19 Cal. 4th 714] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorado's highest court adopted the ''Rowland'' unified duty of care analysis in 1971. The resulting explosion of lawsuits against Colorado landowners caused the state legislature to enact the Colorado Premises Liability Act in 1986, which enacted a cleaned-up statutory version of the common law classifications ''and'' simultaneously expressly displaced all common law remedies against landowners in order to prevent state courts from again expanding their liability.

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], under the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995, the duty of care to trespassers, visitors and "recreational users" can be restricted by the occupier; provided reasonable notice is given, for which a prominent notice at the usual entrance to the premises usually suffices.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0010/print.html|title=Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995|date=17 June 1995|work=Irish Statute Book|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=2009-10-16}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===
{{See also|Business judgment rule}}

In business, "the duty of care addresses the attentiveness and prudence of managers in performing their decision-making and supervisory functions."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"&gt;Alan R. Palmiter, ''Corporations: Examples and Explanations'', 5th ed. (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2006), 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The "business judgment rule presumes that directors (and officers) carry out their functions in [[good faith]], after sufficient investigation, and for acceptable reasons. Unless this presumption is overcome, courts abstain from second-guessing well-meaning business decisions even when they are flops. This is a risk that shareholders take when they make a corporate investment."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"/&gt;

The Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard (DoCRA) provides principles and practices for evaluating risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docra.org/|title=The Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard|last=|first=|date=|website=DoCRA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers all parties that could be affected by those risks. DoCRA evaluates safeguards if they are appropriate in protecting others from harm while presenting a reasonable burden.

'''Electrical injury''' is a physiological reaction caused by [[electric current]] passing through the (human) body.&lt;ref name="Boon"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Boon| first1=Elizabeth| last2=Parr| first2=Rebecca| last3=20,000Dayananda| first3=Samarawickrama| title=Oxford Handbook of Dental Nursing| publisher=Oxford University Press| date=2012| location=| pages=132| language=| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dx9FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22electric+shock| doi=| id=| isbn=0191629863| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306102959/https://books.google.com/books?id=dx9FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22electric+shock| archivedate=2017-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electric shock occurs upon contact of a (human) body part with any source of [[electricity]] that causes a sufficient magnitude of current to pass through the victim's [[flesh]], [[viscera]] or [[hair]].  Physical contact with energized [[electrical wiring|wiring]] or devices is the most common cause of an electric shock. In cases of exposure to high [[voltage]]s, such as on a [[power transmission tower]], physical contact with energized wiring or objects may not be necessary to cause electric shock, as the voltage may be sufficient to "jump" the air gap between the electrical device and the victim.

The injury related to electric shock depends on the magnitude of the current. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reilly|1998|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Very small currents may be imperceptible or produce a light tingling sensation. A shock caused by low current that would normally be harmless could startle an individual and cause injury due to suddenly jerking away from the source of electricity, resulting in one striking a stationary object, dropping an object being held or falling. Stronger currents may cause some degree of discomfort or pain, while more intense currents may induce involuntary muscle contractions, preventing the victim from breaking free of the source of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Alexander Geddes, Rebecca A. Roeder ,''Handbook of Electrical Hazards and Accidents'' Lawyers &amp; Judges Publishing Company, 2006 {{ISBN|0913875449}},  page 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Still larger currents usually result in tissue damage and may trigger [[fibrillation#Cardiology|fibrillation]] of the heart or [[cardiac arrest]], any of which may ultimately be [[death|fatal]].  If death results from an electric shock the [[cause of death]] is generally referred to as [[electrocution]].

==Signs and symptoms==

===Burns===
[[File:Verbrennung Grad 2b.jpg|thumb|Second-degree burn after a [[high tension line]] accident]]
Heating due to [[electrical resistance|resistance]] can cause extensive and deep [[burn]]s. Voltage levels of 500 to 1000 volts tend to cause internal burns due to the large energy (which is proportional to the duration multiplied by the square of the voltage divided by resistance) available from the source. Damage due to current is through tissue heating. For most cases of high-energy electrical trauma, the Joule heating in the deeper tissues along the extremity will reach damaging temperatures in a few seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8245107|year=1993|author1=Lee|first1=R. C.|title=Transient and stable ionic permeabilization of isolated skeletal muscle cells after electrical shock|journal=The Journal of burn care &amp; rehabilitation|volume=14|issue=5|pages=528–40|last2=Canaday|first2=D. J.|last3=Hammer|first3=S. M.|doi=10.1097/00004630-199309000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ventricular fibrillation===
A domestic power supply voltage (110 or 230&amp;nbsp;V), 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz alternating current (AC) through the chest for a fraction of a second may induce [[ventricular fibrillation]] at currents as low as {{nowrap|30 mA}}.&lt;ref name=ucsb/&gt; With direct current (DC), 300 to 500&amp;nbsp;mA is required.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt; If the current has a direct pathway to the heart (e.g., via a [[Catheter|cardiac catheter]] or other kind of [[electrode]]), a much lower current of less than 1&amp;nbsp;mA (AC or DC) can cause fibrillation. If not immediately treated by [[defibrillation]], fibrillation is usually lethal because all of the heart muscle fibres move independently instead of in the coordinated pulses needed to pump blood and maintain circulation. Above 200&amp;nbsp;mA, muscle contractions are so strong that the heart muscles cannot move at all, but these conditions prevent fibrillation.

===Neurological effects===
Current can cause interference with nervous control, especially over the heart and lungs.  Repeated or severe electric shock which does not lead to death has been shown to cause [[neuropathy]]. Recent research has found that functional differences in [[neural]] activation during spatial working memory and implicit learning [[oculomotor]] tasks have been identified in electrical shock victims.&lt;ref&gt;Mechanism of Electrical Injury [http://www.cetri.org/mechanism Chicago Electrical Trauma Research Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503033705/http://www.cetri.org/mechanism |date=May 3, 2015 }} Accessed April 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the current path is through the head, it appears that, with sufficient current applied, loss of consciousness almost always occurs swiftly. (This is borne out by some limited [[self-experimentation]] by early designers of the [[electric chair]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and by research from the field of [[animal husbandry]], where [[electric stunning]] has been extensively studied).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandin.com/humane/elec.stun.html Electric Stunning of Pigs and Sheep] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306103752/http://www.grandin.com/humane/elec.stun.html |date=2016-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arc blast produced by vaporizing metallic components can break bones and damage internal organs.  The degree of hazard present at a particular location can be determined by a detailed analysis of the electrical system, and appropriate protection worn if the electrical work must be performed with the electricity on.

==Pathophysiology==

The minimum current a human can feel depends on the current type ([[alternating current|AC]] or [[direct current|DC]]) as well as [[frequency]] for AC. A person can feel at least 1 [[ampere|mA]] ([[Root mean square#Average electrical power|rms]]) of AC at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, while at least 5 mA for DC. At around 10 milliamperes, AC current passing through the arm of a {{convert|68|kg|adj=on}} human can cause powerful muscle contractions; the victim is unable to voluntarily control muscles and cannot release an electrified object.&lt;ref&gt;John Cadick et. al (ed.) ''Electrical Safety Handbook Third Edition'', McGraw Hill,2005 {{ISBN|0-07-145772-0}}  page 1-4&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the "let go threshold" and is a criterion for shock hazard in electrical regulations.

The current may, if it is high enough and is delivered at sufficient voltage, cause tissue damage or [[fibrillation]] which can cause cardiac arrest; {{nowrap|more than 30 mA}}&lt;ref name=ucsb&gt;[http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~phys13CH/electrical_safety.pdf ucsb.edu - Electrical Safety Information - Physics Department, UCSB] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060415/http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~phys13CH/electrical_safety.pdf |date=2013-10-23 }}, 2012-01-09&lt;/ref&gt; of AC (rms, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) or {{nowrap|300 – 500 mA}} of DC at high voltage can cause fibrillation.&lt;ref name=whitaker&gt;Clifford D.

However, the potential seriousness of the shock depends on paths through the body that the currents take.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt; If the [[voltage]] is less than 200&amp;nbsp;V, then the human skin, more precisely the [[stratum corneum]], is the main contributor to the impedance of the body in the case of a [[macroshock]]—the passing of current between two contact points on the skin. The characteristics of the skin are non-linear however. If the voltage is above 450–600&amp;nbsp;V, then [[dielectric breakdown]] of the skin occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reilly|1998|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protection offered by the skin is lowered by [[perspiration]], and this is accelerated if electricity causes muscles to contract 
above the let-go threshold for a sustained period of time.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt;

If an electrical circuit is established by electrodes introduced in the body, bypassing the skin, then the potential for lethality is much higher if a circuit through the heart is established. This is known as a [[microshock]]. Currents of only 10&amp;nbsp;[[micro-|µ]]A can be sufficient to cause fibrillation in this case with a probability of 0.2%.&lt;ref name="Leitgeb2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Norbert Leitgeb|title=Safety of Electromedical Devices: Law - Risks - Opportunities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FpSH-VM5TYkC&amp;pg=PA122|date=6 May 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-211-99683-6|page=122|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401235716/https://books.google.com/books?id=FpSH-VM5TYkC&amp;pg=PA122|archivedate=1 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body resistance===
The voltage necessary for electrocution depends on the current through the body and the duration of the current. [[Ohm's law]] states that the current drawn depends on the resistance of the body. The resistance of human skin varies from person to person and fluctuates between different times of day. The [[NIOSH]] states "Under dry conditions, the resistance offered by the human body may be as high as 100,000 ohms. Wet or broken skin may drop the body's resistance to 1,000&amp;nbsp;ohms," adding that "high-voltage electrical energy quickly breaks down human skin, reducing the human body's resistance to 500&amp;nbsp;ohms".&lt;ref name=niosh&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-131/pdfs/98-131.pdf|accessdate=2008-08-16|title=Publication No. 98-131: Worker Deaths by Electrocution|publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011191854/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-131/pdfs/98-131.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voltage-current characteristic of skin===

The voltage-current characteristic of human skin is non-linear and depends on many factors such as intensity, duration, history, and frequency of the electrical stimulus. Sweat gland activity, temperature, and individual variation also influence the voltage-current characteristic of skin. In addition to non-linearity, skin impedance exhibits asymmetric and time varying properties. These properties can be modeled with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref name=Lochner&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/28072/dissertation.pdf?sequence=1|title=The Voltage Current Characteristic of the Human Skin|publisher=[[University of Pretoria]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017084822/http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/28072/dissertation.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=2015-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance measurements made at low voltage using a standard [[ohmmeter]] do not accurately represent the impedance of human skin over a significant range of conditions.

For sinusoidal electrical stimulation less than 10 volts, the skin voltage-current characteristic is quasilinear. Over time, electrical characteristics can become non-linear. The time required varies from seconds to minutes, depending on stimulus, electrode placement, and individual characteristics.

Between 10 volts and about 30 volts, skin exhibits non-linear but symmetric electrical characteristics. Above 20 volts, electrical characteristics are both non-linear and symmetric. Skin conductance can increase by several orders of magnitude in milliseconds. This should not be confused with [[dielectric breakdown]], which occurs at hundreds of volts. For these reasons, current flow cannot be accurately calculated by simply applying [[Ohm's law]] using a fixed resistance model.

===Point of entry===
* [[Macroshock]]: Current across intact skin and through the body. Current from arm to arm, or between an arm and a foot, is likely to traverse the heart, therefore it is much more dangerous than current between a leg and the ground.  This type of shock by definition must pass into the body through the skin.
* [[Microshock]]: Very small current source with a pathway directly connected to the heart tissue. The shock is required to be administered from inside the skin, directly to the heart i.e. a pacemaker lead, or a guide wire, conductive catheter etc. connected to a source of current. This is a largely theoretical hazard as modern devices used in these situations include protections against such currents.

=== Lethality ===
{{original research|section|date=December 2010}}

==== Electrocution ====
The term "electrocution," coined about the time of the first use of the [[electric chair]] in 1890,{{cn|date=September 2017}} originally referred only to ''electr''ical exe''cution'' and not to accidental or suicidal electrical deaths.{{cn|date=September 2017}} However, since no English word was available for non-judicial deaths due to electric shock, the word "electrocution" eventually took over as a description of all circumstances of electrical [[death]] judicial punishment or not.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==== Factors in lethality of electric shock ====

&lt;br /&gt;AC-1: imperceptible
&lt;br /&gt;AC-2: perceptible but no muscle reaction
&lt;br /&gt;AC-3: muscle contraction with reversible effects
&lt;br /&gt;AC-4: possible irreversible effects

&lt;br /&gt;AC-4.2: 5-50% probability of fibrillation
&lt;br /&gt;AC-4.3: over 50% probability of fibrillation]]

The lethality of an electric shock is dependent on several variables:

* Current. The higher the current, the more likely it is lethal. Since current is proportional to voltage when resistance is fixed ([[ohm's law]]), high voltage is an indirect risk for producing higher currents.
* Duration. The longer the duration, the more likely it is lethal&amp;mdash;safety switches may limit time of current flow
* Pathway. If current flows through the heart muscle, it is more likely to be lethal.
* [[High voltage]] (over about 600 volts). In addition to greater current flow, high voltage may cause dielectric breakdown at the skin, thus lowering skin resistance and allowing further increased current flow.
* [[Implant (medicine)|Medical implants]]. [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker]]s or [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]]s (ICD) are sensitive to very small currents.&lt;ref name="Blandford2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire M.

Other issues affecting lethality are [[frequency]], which is an issue in causing cardiac arrest or muscular spasms. Very high frequency electric current causes tissue burning, but does not penetrate the body far enough to cause cardiac arrest (see [[electrosurgery]]). Also important is the pathway: if the current passes through the chest or head, there is an increased chance of death. From a main circuit or power distribution panel the damage is more likely to be internal, leading to [[cardiac arrest]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Another factor is that cardiac tissue has a [[chronaxie]] (response time) of about 3 milliseconds, so electricity at frequencies of higher than about 333&amp;nbsp;Hz requires more current to cause fibrillation than is required at lower frequencies.

The comparison between the dangers of [[alternating current]] at typical power transmission frequences (i.e., 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz), and [[direct current]] has been a subject of debate ever since the [[War of Currents]] in the 1880s. Animal experiments conducted during this time suggested that alternating current was about twice as dangerous as direct current per unit of current flow (or per unit of applied voltage).

It is sometimes suggested that human lethality is most common with [[alternating current]] at 100–250&amp;nbsp;volts; however, death has occurred below this range, with supplies as low as 42 volts.&lt;ref name="OSU Physics - The Fatal Current"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fatal Current|url=https://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~p616/safety/fatal_current.html|website=OSU Physics|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=4 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121721091400/http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~p616/safety/fatal_current.html|archivedate=2 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming a steady current flow (as opposed to a shock from a capacitor or from [[static electricity]]), shocks above 2,700&amp;nbsp;volts are often fatal, with those above 11,000&amp;nbsp;volts being usually fatal, though exceptional cases have been noted.  According to a [[Guinness Book of World Records]] comic, seventeen-year-old Brian Latasa survived a 230,000&amp;nbsp;volt shock on the tower of an ultra-high voltage line in [[Griffith Park]], Los Angeles on November 9, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19780428&amp;id=qAtPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aAIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3583,2551486&amp;hl=en|publisher=Toledo Blade|date=1978-04-28|title=According to Guinness (comic)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A news report of the event stated that he was "jolted through the air, and landed across the line", and though rescued by firemen, he suffered burns over 40% of his body and was completely paralyzed except for his eyelids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19671124&amp;id=JIdPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UAUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3519,5256084&amp;hl=en|publisher=Ocala Star-Banner|date=1967-11-24|title=Firemen risk death to save teenager}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shock with the highest voltage reported survived was that of Harry F.

== Deliberate uses ==

===Medical uses===
Electric shock is also used as a medical therapy, under carefully controlled conditions:
* [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] or ECT is a psychiatric therapy for [[mental illness]]. The objective of the therapy is to induce a seizure for therapeutic effect. There is no [[Consciousness|conscious]] sensation of the electric shock because of the anesthesia used beforehand.  Convulsive therapy was introduced in 1934 by Hungarian neuropsychiatrist [[Ladislas J. Meduna]] who, believing mistakenly that [[schizophrenia]] and [[epilepsy]] were antagonistic disorders, induced seizures first with [[camphor]] and then [[metrazol]] (cardiazol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0957154X9700802908 | last1 = Berrios | first1 = G E | year = 1997 | title = The scientific origins of electroconvulsive therapy | url = | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 8 | issue = 29 pt 1| pages = 105–119 | pmid = 11619203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fink-history"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fink | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = The origins of convulsive therapy | doi = 10.1176/ajp.141.9.1034 | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 141 | issue = 9| pages = 1034–41 | pmid = 6147103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first patient was treated by Lucio Bini and Ugo Cerlettiin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYdLS6qyTwUC&amp;lpg=PA129 |title=Coercion as Cure: A Critical History of Psychiatry |first=Thomas |last=Szasz |year=2007 |isbn=978-1412810500 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102234454/https://books.google.com/books?id=hYdLS6qyTwUC&amp;lpg=PA129 |archivedate=2018-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ECT is generally administered three times a week for about 8-12 treatments.
* As a surgical tool for cutting or coagulation. An "Electrosurgical Unit" (or ESU) uses high currents (e.g. 10 amperes) at high frequency (e.g. 500&amp;nbsp;kHz) with various schemes of amplitude modulation to achieve the desired result - cut or coagulate - or both. These devices are safe when used correctly.
* As a treatment for fibrillation or irregular heart rhythms: see [[defibrillator]] and [[cardioversion]].
* As a method of [[pain relief]]: see [[Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator]] (more commonly referred to as a TENS unit).
* As an [[aversive]] punishment for conditioning of developmentally delayed individuals with severe behavioral problems. This controversial skin-shock method is employed only at the [[Judge Rotenberg Educational Center]], a special needs school in Massachusetts.
* As a treatment for Hyperhidrosis with the device called [[iontophoresis]]
* As part of [[electrodiagnosis]] diagnostic tests including [[nerve conduction studies]] and [[electromyography]].
* For genetic engineering and gene delivery using a non-viral vector system [[electroporation]]

===Entertainment===

Betti Industries, Inc.|author=|date=|website=www.arcade-museum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Mild electric shocks are also used for entertainment, especially as a [[practical joke]] for example in such devices as a shocking pen or a [[shocking gum]]. However devices such as a [[joy buzzer]] and most other machines in [[amusement park]]s today only use vibration that feels somewhat like an electric shock to someone not expecting it.

[[Electroshock weapon]]s are [[Less-lethal weapon|incapacitant]] [[weapon]]s used for subduing a person by administering electric shock to disrupt superficial [[muscle]] functions. One type is a conductive energy device (CED), an electroshock gun popularly known by the brand name "[[Taser]]", which fires projectiles that administer the shock through a thin, flexible wire. Although they are illegal for personal use in many jurisdictions, Tasers have been marketed to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;International Association of Chiefs of Police, ''[http://www.theiacp.org/research/CuttingEdge/EMDT9Steps.pdf Electro Muscular Disruption Technology: A Nine-Step Strategy for Effective Deployment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210211811/http://www.theiacp.org/research/CuttingEdge/EMDT9Steps.pdf |date=December 10, 2013 }}'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Other electroshock weapons such as stun guns, stun batons ("cattle prods"), and [[electroshock belt]]s administer an electric shock by direct contact.

[[Electric fence]]s are barriers that uses electric shocks to deter animals or people from crossing a boundary.  The voltage of the shock may have effects ranging from uncomfortable, to painful or even lethal.  Most electric fencing is used today for [[agricultural fencing]] and other forms of animal control purposes, though it is frequently used to enhance security of restricted areas, and there exist places where lethal voltages are used.

=== Torture ===&lt;!-- [[Electric shock torture]] redirects here --&gt;
Electric shocks are used as a method of [[torture]], since the received voltage and current can be controlled with precision and used to cause pain and fear without always visibly harming the victim's body.

Such torture uses electrodes attached to parts of the victim's body: most typically, while wires are wound around the fingers, toes, or tongue; attached to the genitals; or inserted in the vagina to provide a return circuit; the voltage source (typically some sort of prod) of precisely controllable pressure is applied to other sensitive parts of the body, such as the genitals, breasts, or head. The [[Parrilla (torture)|parrilla]] is an example of this technique. Other methods of electrical torture (such as the [[picana]]) do not use a fixed wire but the prod has two electrodes of different polarity a short distance apart so as to make a circuit through the flesh between them when it is placed on the body, thus making it easy for the operator to target the shocks accurately in the places that cause the victim most pain and distress. When the voltage and current is controlled (most typically, high voltage and low current) the victim feels the pain of electric shock but is not physically harmed. Repeated shocks to the genitals will result in the victim losing control of his or her bladder and unintentionally urinating, while extensive passage of the current through the buttocks will cause the victim to unintentionally defecate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Capital punishment===
{{Main|Electric chair}}
[[File:Singchair.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Electric chair]] in [[Sing Sing]]]]
Electric shock delivered by an [[electric chair]] is sometimes used as an official means of [[capital punishment]] in the United States, although its use has become rare in recent times. Although some original proponents of the electric chair considered it to be a more humane execution method than hanging, shooting, poison gassing, etc., it has now generally been replaced by [[lethal injection]]s in states that practice capital punishment.  Modern reporting has claimed that it sometimes takes several shocks to be lethal, and that the condemned person may actually catch fire before the process is complete.

Other than in parts of the [[United States]], only [[the Philippines]] reportedly has used this method, from 1926 to 1976. It was intermittently replaced by the [[firing squad]], until the death penalty was abolished in that country. Electrocution remains legal in at least 5 states (Virginia, Florida, Alabama, North Carolina and Kentucky) of the United States.{{when|date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state/ Death Penalty Information Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143211/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state/ |date=May 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9955">'''Fair trade bananas''' are bananas produced in partnership with an [[alternative trade organization]] which focuses on increasing the price paid to small banana growers and the wages of agricultural workers. This is not a commercial brand, but a marketing strategy.  Fair trade is based on higher prices paid by consumers that allow an equitable distribution of gains from trade over the chain partners.&lt;ref&gt;La Cruz, G. "The Contribution of Fair Trade Towards Market Access by Smallholder Banana Producers." Agro-Food Chains and Networks for Development, 14 (2006): 69-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many of organizations involved in producing fair trade bananas; for example, an organization called Banafair began importing uncertified/unlabeled fair trade bananas into Germany in the mid-1980s (from 500 to 1 000 tonnes annually). In 1997 Fair Trade Labeling Organizations International (FLO) was established in Bonn, Germany to consolidate various [[Fair trade#Rise of labeling initiatives|labeling initiatives]] and establish worldwide standards for fair trade bananas. The first fair trade labelled bananas imported to Germany were by TransFair in April 1998.

[[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|Fair Trade Labeling Organizations International]], (now renamed Fair Trade International), is a large importer whose bananas bear the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|International FairTrade Certification Mark]]. FLO-CERT is the international body that inspects the farms to ensure they meet the proper social and environmental according to Fair Trade international standards.

==Global banana industry==
Five companies control about 80% of the conventional banana trade.  This situation, plus the intervention of various governments, has kept the price paid to banana growers and wages to workers a small percentage of the supermarket price.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, James. The Banana: Empires, Trade Wars, and Globalization. Lincoln: University of Nebraska, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Macdara. "Busting Banana Unions In Belize." Multinational Monitor 17.9 (1996): 27. MasterFILE Premier. Web. 11 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of this effect are the [[Banana Wars|banana wars]]; the formation of the [[United Fruit Company]] (now Chiquita Brands Intl.); the [[Bananagate]] bribery scandal; military coups to establish and maintain [[banana republics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/march99/clinton11.htm Washingtonpost.com: Clinton: Support for Guatemala Was Wrong&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article23211.htm Honduras: Military Coup Engineered By Two US Companies : Information Clearing House - ICH&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is ongoing industry conflict with unions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://usleap.org/banana-unions-launch-initiative-against-chiquita Banana Unions Launch Initiative Against Chiquita | USLEAP&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/producers/bananas/winfa_2/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fair trade certification ==

FLO has different standards for small banana farms and larger banana plantations. To be eligible to display a Fair Trade Certification Mark, small farmers must create a panel of both workers and management to determine the best use of the fair trade premiums.  Revenues to banana farmers must be equally shared between the working members of the cooperative or association.

On larger plantations, the premiums can only be used for improving working and living conditions. Forced labor and labor of children under 16 years of age is prohibited, as is dangerous work.  Young adults 16 years of age or older must not work so many hours that they have no time for education. Workers must be allowed to join a union, and be paid at least regional industry average or minimum wage.

Although fair trade banana workers’ wages are not significantly above industry averages, they receive wage related benefits which increase their overall livelihood. However, many small banana farmers barely make living wages themselves, and the restriction of premiums to community development projects may prevent them from covering basic living expenses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2011/F/Fairtrade%20in%20the%20Banana%20Sector_IDS%20Final%20Report%20December%202011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fair trade price and premium ==

Monetary premiums are paid for fair trade banana growers to improve their communities. In 2013, FairTrade Certified banana producers receive a FairTrade Minimum Premium of $1 US dollar per 18.14 kilogram box of bananas to invest in community projects.  FairTrade farmers are guaranteed a minimum price to help cover the costs of sustainable production, but the price differs between regions and is subject to market fluctuations in the sustainable cost of agricultural production. Although FairTrade minimum prices vary, FairTrade Minimum premiums do not. Both FairTrade prices and premiums are set at the same level for FairTrade certified [[plantation]]s and small farms.

== Environmental impacts ==

The agricultural production of bananas on a large scale often uses more pesticides (and fungicides, fertilizers) than any other fresh fruit commodity.&lt;ref&gt;Koeppel, Dan.Banana: The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World. New York: Hudson Street, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Fair Trade banana production promotes sustainable farming practices,&lt;ref&gt;Frundt, HenryJ. November 20–30, 2000. Toward a Hegemonic Resolution in the Banana Trade, International Political Science Review / Revue internationale de science politique, Vol. 26, No. 2 (Apr., 2005), pp. 215-237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shreck, A. "Resistance, Redistribution, and Power in the Fair Trade Banana Initiative." Agriculture and Human Values, 22.1 (2005): 17-29&lt;/ref&gt; but these result in a higher supermarket price which some consumers are willing to pay for ethical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Thøgersen, J. (2000), "Promoting green consumer behavior with eco-labels", paper presented at National Academy of Sciences/national Research Council Committee on the Human Dimensions of Global Change, Washington, DC, November 20–30, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strong, C.

"Are Stated Preferences Confirmed by Purchasing Behaviours? the Case of Fair Trade-certified Bananas in Switzerland." Journal of Business Ethics, 92.Suppl 2 (2010): 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and discussion==
Because the banana trade is a large world-wide business, a number of studies have been carried out on various aspects of the fair trade banana market, including political ecology,&lt;ref&gt;GROSSMAN, LS. "The Political Ecology of Banana Exports and Local Food-production in St-vincent, Eastern Caribbean." Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 83.2 (1993): 347-367.&lt;/ref&gt; tariffs and quotas,&lt;ref&gt;Desombre, http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol4_1/desombre.htm&lt;/ref&gt; price competition,&lt;ref&gt;Moberg, M.

Fair trade certification programs have been criticized on several grounds. Griffiths has challenged the ethics of fair trade labels in the [[fair trade debate]], and, in the Journal of Business Ethics, has pointed out instances in which negative research is not published and academics  choose only successful coops or fair trade organizations for study.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;   In the Dominican Republic, Shreck found minimum pricing,&lt;ref&gt;Shreck, A. (2002b) Just bananas? A Fair Trade alternative for small-scale producers in the Dominican Republic. PhD Dissertation, Colorado State University&lt;/ref&gt; and exclusivity of certification worsened socioeconomic disparity within farming communities, and limited access for non-certified farmers to the market.&lt;ref&gt;Shreck, A. "Just bananas? Fair Trade banana production in the Dominican Republic." International Journal of Sociology of Agriculture and Food, 10 (2002) 11–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Shrek found that the standards of certification programs prioritized market interests over farmer rights and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrek|first=Aimee|title=What Organic and Fair Trade Labels do not tell us: Towards a place based understanding of certification|journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies|year=2006|volume=30|issue=5|pages=498}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank has argued that fair trade initiatives do not generally foster an empowering partnership between consumers and farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, D. (2003) Where are the workers in consumer-worker alliances? Class dynamics and the history of consumer- labor campaigns. Politics and Society, 31, 363–379.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federation of Egalitarian Communities''' ('''FEC''') is a group of [[egalitarian communities]]&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Ellen. [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6385943_ITM Some communes have survived -- and prospered -- beyond the '60s.] ''Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service.'' 23 Sept. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; which have joined together with the common purpose of creating a lifestyle based on equality, cooperation, and harmony with the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://wiki.ic.org/wiki/Federation_of_Egalitarian_Communities ic.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK Diggers"&gt;[http://www.diggersanddreamers.org.uk/index.php?one=lin&amp;two=lin&amp;sel=3 Diggers and Dreamers]&lt;/ref&gt; A central principal of these communities is that in exchange for a members working quota (typically between 35 and 42 hours per week) the community pays for all aspects of their life style.  Members do not typically get salaries, instead they have small allowances (typically between $75 and $150 per month) with which they may buy luxury items.  They live, work and socialize within the community but are free to leave whenever they would like.

There are six full-member communities in the FEC, all of which share the primary values of [[egalitarianism]], [[non-violence]] and income-sharing. Approximately 200 people live in the various communities. The organization offers various programs to its member communities, including outreach, labor exchange and catastrophic health care coverage.&lt;ref name="reference"&gt;[http://www.ocfvillage.org/federation-egalitarian-communities/ OFC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="book"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fr20KegfE8gC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=%22federation+of+egalitarian+communities%22&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA130,M1 Utopias and Utopians By R. C. S. Trahair]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the full membership, the FEC has lower levels of membership, such as "Allied" or "Community in Dialog".  These are for communities that may share some, but not all of the FEC values, or who are not prepared for full membership.&lt;ref name="our"&gt;[http://thefec.org/taxonomy/term/4 FEC Communities]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
Each of the full-member FEC communities holds the following values:&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;[http://thefec.org/taxonomy/term/3 FEC Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12544">'''Feeling rules''' are socially shared [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] that influence how people want to try to feel [[emotion]]s in given [[Interpersonal relationship|social relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Nomura | first = Tatsuya | contribution = A proposal of computational approach for sociology for emotions and group dynamics | editor-last1 = Hatano | editor-first1 = G. | editor-last2 = Okada | editor-first2 = N. | editor-last3 = Tanabe | editor-first3 = H. | title = Affective minds: a collection of papers based on presentations at the 13th Toyota Conference, Shizuoka, Japan, 29 November to 2 December 1999 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780444504180 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.rikou.ryukoku.ac.jp/~nomura/docs/AM_Toyota.html Available from the Faculty of Science and Technology at Ryukoku University.]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was introduced by sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] in 1979. Hochschild's 1983 book, "The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling," discusses feeling rules in greater depth, especially in the occupational worlds of flight attendants and bill collectors. Hochschild draws on the work of sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] as well as labor scholar [[Harry Braverman]] to discuss the dramaturgical demands and emotional labor entailed by jobs in the service sector, in which workers must "perform" certain roles that entail abiding by certain feeling rules (e.g. "friendly and dependable"). She notes that women are more likely to have such jobs than men, and that analysis of feeling rules may therefore be especially relevant to understanding the gendered dimensions of labor. This work foreshadows themes from her later analyses of women's work, both paid and unpaid, e.g. in "The Commercialization of Intimate Life" (2003).

This work is part of the broader [[sociology of emotions]], which notes that [[socialization]] plays an important role in how people experience, interpret, and express emotions, including the situations that evoke a range of feelings. All human beings learn certain feeling rules, but these feeling rules may differ widely depending on the society in which one grows up and one's social position and [[Identity (social science)|social identity]], including gender and ethnic identity and socio-economic status. Feeling rules are flexible and the ways in which they impinge on one's experience in different settings influences one's personality, both in specific contexts (e.g. at work, home, school, or in different social groups) and over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Russell Hochschild | first = Arlie | author-link = Arlie Russell Hochschild | contribution = Section IX Transitions and challenges: symbolic interactionism: Airlie Russell Hochschild (1940- ) | editor-last1 = Adams | editor-first1 = Bert | editor-last2 = Sydie | editor-first2 = R.A. | title = Sociological theory | pages = 517–523 | publisher = Pine Forge Press | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780761985570 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://leroy.cc.uregina.ca/~gingrich/n1302.htm Available from the University of Regina.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects  ==

===Race and the workplace===

[[Race (human categorization)|Race]] not only plays an important role in the way that employees act with each other, but also how employees act toward customers based on what race they are associated with. People expect others to behave in a certain manner due to what race they identify or associate with. Race influences and changes the way we see and view others.

Roxana Harlow, a sociologist, conducted extensive research on black colleges and professors. Harlow's research showed that white college students viewed their professors as "unintelligent" and "inferior" simply because of the color of their skin and not the measurement of their knowledge. In a classroom setting, white students were shown to give black professors a hard time and question every statement that their professor made. Whereas, if they were in a classroom with a white professor that had made the same statement that a black professor had made previously, the white professor was not questioned and was viewed as knowledgeable. In spite of this baseless challenge to their authority, the black professor maintained their composure and adhered to the feeling rules demanded by the setting.

In a workplace, feeling rules are established and are expected to be followed, but there is a double standard on the feeling rules applied to the white workers versus black workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wingfield|first=Adia Harvey|date=2010-05-01|title=Are Some Emotions Marked "Whites Only"? Racialized Feeling Rules in Professional Workplaces|url=http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/2/251|journal=Social Problems|language=en|volume=57|issue=2|pages=251–268|doi=10.1525/sp.2010.57.2.251|issn=0037-7791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status===

Due to feeling rules, people of lower status or standing are expected to behave in an ashamed or emotional manner versus a cold or angry manner. By showing that they are ashamed of their current standing, the people of higher status are more likely to help them out and have pity on them versus those who do not show shame or pity for their current state. People respond better to seeing people on the streets asking for money or rambling through trash to find items. People of higher standings respond back by giving that individual of lower status clothes, food, and money. Our generosity is dependent on the manner of the poor individual. A poor individual who acted in an indifferent or prissy manner would not receive any response from the financially stable individual, not because his or her current situation had changed, in fact that person is still the poor individual you saw a few minutes ago, but in fact your demeanor had changed due to feeling rules.

Feeling rules gives people the expectancy that individuals of lower status should act in a pitiful and ashamed manner just because of their standing. Feeling rules affect our status because it dictates how one should act just because of their economic/ financial standing.

An experiment was conducted to show how people would react if they saw an ad with a person who was angry about being poor and another person who was shameful about being in poverty. After viewing the ad, people were more willingly to give money to the person who ashamed about being poor versus the person who was angry about being poor. Since the individual who was angry about being in poverty broke the feeling rule of what is expected our people of lower class, little to none donations were received in their favor. People of lower status that displayed no sense of self-pity or dissatisfaction gave people of higher status a harder time to sympathize with them thus proving that expressing shame was more effective and when anger was expressed there was little to no help being provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/0959353510384125 |title=Poor women and the expression of shame and anger: The price of breaking social class feeling rules |journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=179 |year=2010 |last1=Power |first1=C. A. |last2=Cole |first2=E. R. |last3=Fredrickson |first3=B. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
Around the world, males get paid more than females. Feeling rules require men and women to act a certain way, and in fear of breaking that norm, these rules stay in place. Women are associated with being sweet and innocent, whereas men are associated with being tough and strong. People are assigned jobs based on their gender. Since women are usually seen as beings that can control their anger, they are most likely enlisted in jobs that require them to use their looks or charms. Men, who are seen as tough, are usually in jobs that require them to use that toughness or anger in order to deliver some type of means.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caringlabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/the-managed-heart-arlie-russell-hochschild.pdf|title=The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling|last=Hochschild|first=Arlie Russell|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in traditional and middle-class families rely on men to make or give them money. In response to the men providing, the women in a sense feel as if they have to repay the men back by hugging, kissing or celebrating the man. Since the women do not have the financial capability of repaying the man, the women use emotional means in order to thank or repay the man for what he has provided for them. If the man had provided the money for the woman and she in return did not act by hugging or kissing him, she would be seen an ungrateful because the feeling rules calls for her to feel joy or happiness for what the man has done for her.

Children learn their habits and emotional skills from their parents. Men are seen as beings that are not capable of controlling their feelings or emotions because they were not taught or required to as a child. Males obtain jobs such as bill collector, taxi driver, and construction worker because many of those jobs do not rely heavily on emotional labor. Hochschild showed that male flight attendants showed more power and tolerated less abuse from passengers than female flight attendants. Since people generally associate males with being tough and associate females with being sweet, feeling rules makes them feel appalled when a women behaves in a tough manner, but when a male behaves in the same way, it is seen as acceptable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Exploitation  ==
A large portion of workers have jobs or careers that requires them to use their feelings, or "emotional labor" as Hochschild calls it, in the workplace. Their reactions and actions are based on the way they see how other people react or express their feelings. Companies and corporations see this and use it to exploit workers in order to maximize profits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hochschild gives a clear example on how companies maximize their profits through the use of feeling rules by viewing the job of a flight attendant. A flight attendant's job requires emotional labor. The flight attendance uplifts the customer through his or her demeanor and expression of feelings. A flight attendant who is constantly smiling or asking the customer how they are doing is more comforting to a customer versus if a flight attendant who rolls their eyes and rarely smiles. The feeling rules for a flight attendant calls for them to be happy, calm, and to suppress their negative feelings. Customers who see the way the flight attendant upholds themselves are more likely to come back if the experience was pleasant. Which is why many airlines like Delta, which was rated as one of the top airlines calls and requires these feeling rules at the workplace. In a way, this is beneficial to the companies and the customer because the customer is satisfied and keeps coming back, which makes the company more money. However, at the same time, it can be harmful to the flight attendant because they are not able to express their feelings, but rather suppress their feelings for the benefit of others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32036">'''Found footage''' is a [[film genre|film subgenre]] in which all or a substantial part of the work is presented as if it were discovered [[film]] or [[Videocassette recorder|video recordings]]. The events on screen are typically seen through the camera of one or more of the characters involved, often accompanied by their [[real time (media)|real-time]], [[voice-over|off-camera commentary]]. For added [[realism (arts)|realism]], the [[cinematography]] may be done by the actors themselves as they perform, and [[shaky camera]] work and [[naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] acting are routinely employed. The footage may be presented as if it were "[[footage|raw]]" and complete or as if it had been [[film editing|edited]] into a [[narrative structure|narrative]] by those who "found" it.

The most common use of the technique is in [[horror film]]s (''e.g.'', ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'', ''[[REC (film)|[REC]]]'', ''[[Cloverfield]]''), where the footage is purported to be the only surviving record of the events, with the participants now missing or dead. It has also been used in [[science-fiction film|science-fiction]] (''e.g.'', ''[[Chronicle (film)|Chronicle]]'', ''[[Project Almanac]]'', ''[[Europa Report]]''), [[drama film|drama]] (''e.g.'', ''[[Zero Day (film)|Zero Day]]'', ''[[Exhibit A (film)|Exhibit A]]''), [[comedy film|comedy]] (''e.g.'', ''[[Project X (2012 film)|Project X]]'') and [[family film|family]] (''e.g.'', ''[[Earth to Echo]]'') films.

Although ''[[Found footage (appropriation)|found footage]]'' was originally the name of an entirely different genre, it is now frequently used to describe [[pseudo-documentary|pseudo-documentaries]] crafted with this narrative technique. The film magazine ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' has, for example, used the term "faux found-footage film" to describe the 2012 film ''[[Grave Encounters 2]]''. [[film studies|Film scholar]] [[David Bordwell]] criticizes this recent usage, arguing that it sows confusion, and instead prefers the term "discovered footage" for the narrative [[gimmick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bordwell|first=David|authorlink=David Bordwell|date=13 November 2012|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/11/13/return-to-paranormalcy/|title=Return to Paranormalcy|work=davidbordwell.net|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Found-footage films typically employ one or more of four [[cinematic techniques]]—[[first-person perspective]], [[pseudo-documentary]] or [[mockumentary]], [[news]] footage, or [[surveillance footage]]—according to an analysis of 500 found-footage films conducted by Found Footage Critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Found Footage Film Genre&amp;nbsp;– Found Footage Critic|url= http://foundfootagecritic.com/found-footage-film-genre/|website= Found Footage Critic|publisher= Found Footage Critic [Michael Steinberg]|access-date= 2016-01-14|language= en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The technique has precedents in literature, particularly in the [[epistolary novel]], which typically consists of either [[letter (message)|correspondence]] or [[diary]] entries, purportedly written by a character central to the events. Like found footage, the epistolary technique has often been employed in [[horror fiction]]: both ''[[Dracula]]'' and ''[[Frankenstein]]'' are epistolary novels, as is ''[[The Call of Cthulhu]]'' by [[H. P. Lovecraft]].

[[File:Ruggero Deodato 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Italian director [[Ruggero Deodato]] revolutionized the found footage style of narrative filmmaking with his film ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' (1980)]]
In [[filmmaking]], it dates back at least as far as 1980 with ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' but was popularised by ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name="Hitflixhist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eggertsen|first1=Chris|title=From 'Blair Witch' to 'Project Almanac': A history of the found footage genre|url=http://www.hitfix.com/news/from-cannibal-holocaust-to-project-almanac-a-history-of-the-found-footage-genre|website=Hitflix|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing ''[[V/H/S]]'' for [[The A.V. Club]], Scott Tobia notes that  the genre "has since become to the ’00s and ’10s what [[Slasher film|slasher movies]] were to the ’80s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tobias|first1=Scott|title=V/H/S|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/vhs-86207|website=AV Club|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The format has been subsequently used in such well-known films as ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' &lt;!--Do NOT change to 2009. Paranormal Activity was originally released in 2007.--&gt;(2007), ''[[REC (film)|REC]]'' (2007), ''[[Cloverfield]]'' (2008) and ''[[Chronicle (film)|Chronicle]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial: An Apologist's Rant: In Defense of Found Footage|publisher=Dread Central|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33208/editorial-an-apologist-s-rant-in-defense-of-found-footage/|accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre appeals to [[film producer|producers]] because of its lower cost, as it is believed the illusion of [[amateur film|amateur]] documentary style allows lower production values than would be accepted on a conventional film.

Writer-director [[Christopher B. Landon|Christopher Landon]], who has made several found-footage horror films, posits that the genre is likely to extend in the future outside horror.&lt;ref name="Christopher Landon interview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Topel|first1=Fred|title=Christopher Landon interview|url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/625449-exclusive-interview-christopher-landon-on-paranormal-activity-the-marked-ones|website=Crave|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}

'''Frustration of purpose''', in [[law]], is a defense to enforcement of a [[contract]]. Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event undermines a party's principal purpose for entering into a contract such that the performance of the contract is radically different from performance of the contract that was originally contemplated by both parties, and both parties knew of the principal purpose at the time the contract was made.&lt;ref name="1982 HCA 24"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1992|litigants=[[Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW]] |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |date=11 May 1982 |courtname=auto}}.austlii&lt;/ref&gt; Despite frequently arising as a result of government action, any third party or even nature can frustrate a contracting party's primary purpose for entering into the contract. The concept is also called commercial frustration.

For example, if Joe gets a mortgage for a new home, suppose after three years, the home is destroyed, through no fault of Joe's. Without a [[hell or high water clause]], Joe might be exempt from the remainder of the mortgage, as the principal purpose of the contract, to have a home to live in, has been compromised. However, he might still have a [[foreclosure]] on his [[credit rating]].

Frustration of purpose is often confused with the closely related doctrine of [[impossibility]]. The distinction is that impossibility concerns the duties specified in the contract, but frustration of purpose concerns the reason a party entered into the contract. An example is if entrepreneur Emily leases space from landlord Larry so that she can open a restaurant that serves only Tibetan Speckled Lizard meat. If the city rezones the property to forbid commercial uses or if the property is destroyed by a tornado, both Larry and Emily are excused from performing the contract by impossibility.

However, if the Tibetan Speckled Lizard suddenly goes extinct, Emily may be excused from performing the contract because Larry knew her primary purpose for entering into the lease was to serve Tibetan Speckled Lizard, and the purpose has been frustrated. In the second scenario, the parties could still carry out their obligations under the lease, but one of them no longer has a reason to.

The ''[[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]]'', Section 265, defines frustration of purpose:
{{quote|Where, after a contract is made, a party's principal purpose is substantially frustrated without his fault by the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, his remaining duties to render performance are discharged, unless the language or circumstances [of the contract] indicate the contrary.}}

A circumstance is not deemed to be a "basic assumption on which the contract is made" unless the change in circumstances could not have been reasonably foreseen at the time the contract was made. As a result, it is rarely invoked successfully. Successful invocations usually come in waves during times of substantial tumult, such as after the passage of [[Prohibition]], when bars and taverns no longer had a reason for their leases, or during major wars, when demand for many consumer goods and services drops far below what is normal.

If the defense is successfully invoked, the contract is terminated, and the parties are left as they are at the time of the litigation.

==In English law==
{{main|Frustration in English law}}
{{see also|Coronation cases}}

The [[English law| English]] case of ''[[Taylor v Caldwell]]'' established the doctrine of frustration, alleviating the potential harshness of "[[sanctity of contract]]".&lt;ref&gt;Beale (2002) p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; Here, two parties contracted on the hire of a [[Royal Surrey Gardens|music hall]], for the performance of concerts. Subsequent to contracting, but prior to the dates of hire, the music hall burned down. Since the contract was impossible to perform, [[Colin Blackburn, Baron Blackburn|Judge Blackburn]] held that the absolute liability set forth in ''[[Paradine v Jane]]'' would not apply here, as there was an [[Implied terms in English law|implied term]] that the music hall would be in existence at the date of the planned concerts.&lt;ref name=km1&gt;Koffman, Macdonald, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; 

The requirement of "impossibility" in ''Taylor v Caldwell'' was modified in the 1903 case of ''[[Krell v Henry]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Krell v Henry]]'' [1903] 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 740.&lt;/ref&gt; which concerned a party who had rented a room for the purpose of watching the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation procession]] of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]. The king fell ill and the coronation was indefinitely postponed. The hirer refused to pay for the room, so the owner sued for [[breach of contract]]; and the hirer then countersued for the return of his £25 deposit. The court determined that the cancellation of the coronation was unforeseeable by the parties, and discharged the contract, leaving the parties as they were: the hirer lost his one-third deposit, and the owner lost the rest of the rent. The court reasoned that the doctrine of "impossibility" could not be applied in this case because it was technically been possible for the hirer to take possession of the flat and sit on the balcony. However, the owner knew the only reason the hirer would want to rent the flat was to watch the procession; had the hirer actually gone to the flat and sat on the balcony, he would have seen nothing of interest. Thus the purpose of the contract had been frustrated by an outside event (the King's illness and consequent cancellation of the parade), justifying termination (but not rescission) of the contract.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4536">A '''''generic''''' or '''''universal''''' '''role-playing game system''' is a [[role-playing game system]] designed to be independent of [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] and [[genre]]. Its rules should, in theory, work the same way for any setting, world, environment or genre in which one would want to play.

==History==
The term "generic" has been used since the earliest days of gaming to describe a system that can be used for any type or style of game. There is some dispute among role-playing enthusiasts on when the concept of a generic system originated and which was the first one published.

According to Shannon Appelcline, [[Chaosium]]'s ''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'' (''BRP'', 1980), was the first generic role-playing system.&lt;ref name="bhotg3"&gt;{{cite web 
 | url=http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory3.phtml 
 | title=Brief History of the Game #3
 | accessdate=2007-09-14 
 | author=Shannon Appelcline 
 | date=2006-09-04 
 | publisher=[[RPGnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''BRP'' was a "cut-down" version of Chaosium's ''[[RuneQuest]]'' role-playing game and formed the foundation for the ''[[Stormbringer (role-playing game)|Stormbringer]]'' RPG, and was also adopted for ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', the first horror role-playing game.&lt;ref name="bhotg3"/&gt;  The publication of ''[[GURPS]]'' (''Generic Universal Role-Playing System'', 1986) as a completely setting-independent game and its commercial and creative success added credence to the movement. The development of the ''[[Hero System]]'' (1989) from the [[superhero]] role-playing game ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]''&lt;ref name="bhotg3"/&gt; also had a profound influence in popularizing the concept. 

It truly became a dominant subject in RPG design with the release of the Third Edition of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (2000) and the ''[[d20 System]]'' along with the creation of the [[Open Gaming License]] (OGL).

== Definition ==
The ''[[Fuzion]]'' 5.02 rules uses the term "generic" to describe its basic ruleset as separate from its ''Champions'' and ''[[Interlock System|Interlock]]'' forerunners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the second paragraph of the introduction to ''GURPS'' 3rd Edition the authors define "generic" as a means to satisfy players and game masters of many styles of play and feel for rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40353">The '''Gettier problem''', in the field of [[epistemology]], is a landmark [[philosophy|philosophical]] problem concerning our understanding of [[descriptive knowledge]]. Attributed to American philosopher [[Edmund Gettier]], Gettier-type counterexamples (called "Gettier-cases") challenge the long-held [[justified true belief]] (JTB) account of knowledge. The JTB account holds that knowledge is equivalent to justified true belief; if all three conditions (justification, truth, and belief) are met of a given claim, then we have knowledge of that claim. In his 1963 three-page paper titled "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?", Gettier attempts to illustrate by means of two counterexamples that there are cases where individuals can have a justified, true belief regarding a claim but still fail to know it because the reasons for the belief, while justified, turn out to be false. Thus, Gettier claims to have shown that the JTB account is inadequate; that it does not account for all of the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge.

The term "Gettier problem", "Gettier case", or even the adjective "Gettiered", is sometimes used to describe any case in the field of epistemology that purports to repudiate the JTB account of knowledge.

Responses to Gettier's paper have been numerous; some reject Gettier's examples, while others seek to adjust the JTB account of knowledge and blunt the force of these counterexamples. Gettier problems have even found their way into sociological experiments, where the intuitive responses from people of varying demographics to Gettier cases have been studied.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==History==
The question of what constitutes "knowledge" is as old as philosophy itself. Early instances are found in Plato's dialogues, notably ''[[Meno]]'' (97a–98b) and ''[[Theaetetus_(dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.  Gettier himself was not actually the first to raise the problem named after him; its existence was acknowledged by both [[Alexius Meinong]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], the latter of which discussed the problem in his book ''Human knowledge: Its scope and limits''.

Russell's case, called the stopped clock case, goes as follows:&lt;ref&gt;'Conditions of Knowledge' (1965). Chicago: Scott, Foresman&lt;/ref&gt; Alice sees a clock that reads two o'clock and believes that the time is two o'clock.  It is, in fact, two o'clock. There's a problem, however: unknown to Alice, the clock she's looking at stopped twelve hours ago.  Alice thus has an accidentally true, justified belief. Russell provides an answer of his own to the problem. Edmund Gettier's formulation of the problem was important as it coincided with the rise of the sort of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|philosophical naturalism]] promoted by [[W. V. O. Quine]] and others, and was used as a justification for a shift towards [[Internalism and externalism|externalist]] theories of justification.&lt;ref name="McGrews_on_Gettier"&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Routledge |publication-place = Abingdon, Oxon |author = Timothy McGrew |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24647810M/Internalism_and_Externalism |title = Internalism and Externalism |publication-date = 2007 }}, chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John L. Pollock]] and Joseph Cruz have stated that the Gettier problem has "fundamentally altered the character of contemporary epistemology" and has become "a central problem of epistemology since it poses a clear barrier to analyzing knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |isbn = 0-8476-8936-0 |publication-place = Lanham, Md |title = Contemporary theories of knowledge |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL31726M/Contemporary_theories_of_knowledge |author1 = John L. Pollock |author2 = Joseph Cruz |publication-date = 1999 |id = 0847689360 |pages= 13–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alvin Plantinga]] rejects the historical analysis:
{{Quote|According to the inherited lore of the epistemological tribe, the JTB [justified true belief] account enjoyed the status of epistemological orthodoxy until 1963, when it was shattered by Edmund Gettier...  Of course, there is an interesting historical irony here: it isn't easy to find many really explicit statements of a JTB analysis of knowledge prior to Gettier.  It is almost as if a distinguished critic created a tradition in the very act of destroying it.&lt;ref name="PlantingaWCD"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Alvin Plantinga|title=Warrant: The Current Debate|publication-date=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-507862-4|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite this, Plantinga ''does'' accept that some philosophers before Gettier have advanced a JTB account of knowledge, specifically [[C. I. Lewis]] and [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref name="PlantingaWCD" /&gt;

==Knowledge as justified true belief (JTB)==

The JTB account of knowledge is the claim that knowledge can be conceptually analyzed as justified true belief, which is to say that the ''meaning'' of sentences such as "Smith knows that it rained today" can be given with the following set of conditions, which are [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient]] for knowledge to obtain:

:A subject &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; ''knows'' that a proposition &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; is true [[if and only if]]:

:# &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; is true, and
:# &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; believes that &lt;var&gt;P &lt;/var&gt; is true, and
:# &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; is [[theory of justification|justified]] in believing that &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; is true

The JTB account was first credited to [[Plato]], though Plato argued against this very account of knowledge in the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' (210a). This account of knowledge is what Gettier subjected to criticism.

==Gettier's two original counterexamples==

Gettier's paper used counterexamples (see also [[thought experiment]]) to argue that there are cases of beliefs that are both true and justified—therefore satisfying all three conditions for knowledge on the JTB account—but that do not appear to be genuine cases of knowledge. Therefore, Gettier argued, his counterexamples show that the JTB account of knowledge is false, and thus that a different conceptual analysis is needed to correctly track what we mean by "knowledge".

Gettier's case is based on two counterexamples to the JTB analysis. Each relies on two claims. Firstly, that justification is preserved by [[entailment]], and secondly that this applies coherently to Smith's putative "belief". That is, that if Smith is justified in believing P, and Smith realizes that the truth of P entails the truth of Q, then Smith would ''also'' be justified in believing Q. Gettier calls these counterexamples "Case I" and "Case II":

===Case I===
: Suppose that Smith and Jones have applied for a certain job. And suppose that Smith has strong evidence for the following conjunctive proposition: (d) Jones is the man who will get the job, and Jones has ten coins in his pocket.

: Smith's evidence for (d) might be that the president of the company assured him that Jones would, in the end, be selected and that he, Smith, had counted the coins in Jones's pocket ten minutes ago. Proposition (d) entails: (e) The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.

: Let us suppose that Smith sees the entailment from (d) to (e), and accepts (e) on the grounds of (d), for which he has strong evidence. In this case, Smith is clearly justified in believing that (e) is true.

: But imagine, further, that unknown to Smith, he himself, not Jones, will get the job. And, also, unknown to Smith, he himself has ten coins in his pocket. Proposition (e) is true, though proposition (d), from which Smith inferred (e), is false. In our example, then, all of the following are true: (i) (e) is true, (ii) Smith believes that (e) is true, and (iii) Smith is justified in believing that (e) is true. But it is equally clear that Smith does not ''know'' that (e) is true; for (e) is true in virtue of the number of coins in Smith's pocket, while Smith does not know how many coins are in Smith's pocket, and bases his belief in (e) on a count of the coins in Jones's pocket, whom he falsely believes to be the man who will get the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gettier|first1=Edmund L.|title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?|journal=Analysis|date=1 June 1963|volume=23|issue=6|pages=121–123|doi=10.1093/analys/23.6.121|url=https://academic.oup.com/analysis/article-abstract/23/6/121/109949?redirectedFrom=fulltext|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case II===
: Smith, it is claimed by the hidden [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]], has a justified belief that "Jones owns a Ford". Smith therefore (justifiably) concludes (by the rule of [[disjunction introduction]]) that "Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Barcelona", even though Smith has no information whatsoever about the location of Brown.

: In fact, Jones does not own a Ford, but by sheer coincidence, Brown really is in Barcelona. Again, Smith had a belief that was true and justified, but not knowledge.

==False premises==
In both of Gettier's actual examples (see also [[counterfactual conditional]]), the justified true belief came about, if Smith's purported claims are disputable, as the result of entailment (but see also [[material conditional]]) from justified false beliefs that "Jones will get the job" (in case I), and that "Jones owns a Ford" (in case II). This led some early responses to Gettier to conclude that the definition of knowledge could be easily adjusted, so that knowledge was justified true belief that does not depend on [[false premise]]s.

==More general Gettier-style problems==

{{anchor|The sheep in the field}}In a 1966 scenario known as "The sheep in the field", [[Roderick Chisholm]] asks us to imagine that someone is standing outside a field looking at something that looks like a sheep (although in fact, it is a dog disguised as a sheep). They believe there is a sheep in the field, and in fact, they are right because there is a sheep behind the hill in the middle of the field. Hence, they have a justified true belief that there is a sheep in the field. But is that belief knowledge? {{anchor|Cow in the Field}}A similar problem which seeks to be more plausible called the "Cow in the Field" appears in [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]]'s book ''[[101 Philosophy Problems]]'', where it is supposed that a farmer checking up on his favourite cow confuses a piece of black and white paper caught up in a distant bush for his cow. However, since the animal actually is in the field, but hidden in a hollow, again, the farmer has a justified, true belief which seems nonetheless not to qualify as "knowledge". 

{{anchor|The Pyromaniac}}Another scenario by [[Brian Skyrms]] is "The Pyromaniac",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skyrms|first1=Brian|title=The Explication of 'X knows that p'|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=22 June 1967|volume=64|issue=12|pages=373–389|doi=10.2307/2024269|jstor=2024269}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a struck match lights not for the reasons the pyromaniac imagines but because of some unknown "Q radiation". 

{{anchor|Fake barns}}A different perspective on the issue is given by [[Alvin Goldman]] in the "fake barns" scenario (crediting [[Carl Ginet]] with the example).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldman|first1=Alvin I.|title=Discrimination and Perceptual Knowledge|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=18 November 1976|volume=73|issue=20|pages=771–791|doi=10.2307/2025679|jstor=2025679}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this one, a man is driving in the countryside, and sees what looks exactly like a barn. Accordingly, he thinks that he is seeing a barn. In fact, that is what he is doing. But what he does not know is that the neighborhood generally consists of many fake barns — [[Potemkin village|barn facades]] designed to look exactly like real barns when viewed from the road, as in the case of a visit in the countryside by [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of Russia, just to please her. Since if he had been looking at one of them, he would have been unable to tell the difference, his "knowledge" that he was looking at a barn would seem to be poorly founded. A similar process appears in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' as an example of [[Stranger in a Strange Land#Fair Witness|Fair Witness]] behavior.

The "no false premises" (or "no false lemmas") solution which was proposed early in the discussion proved to be somewhat problematic, as more general Gettier-style problems were then constructed or contrived in which the justified true belief does not seem to be the result of a chain of reasoning from a justified false belief.

For example:

: After arranging to meet with Mark for help with homework, Luke arrives at the appointed time and place. Walking into Mark's office Luke clearly sees Mark at his desk; Luke immediately forms the belief "Mark is in the room. He can help me with my logic homework". Luke is justified in his belief; he clearly sees Mark at his desk. In fact, it's ''not'' Mark that Luke saw; it was a marvelous hologram, perfect in every respect, giving the appearance of Mark diligently grading papers at his desk. Nevertheless, Mark ''is'' in the room; he is crouched under his desk reading [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]. Luke's belief that Mark is in the room is true (he is in the room, under his desk) and justified (Mark's hologram is giving the appearance of Mark hard at work).

Again, it seems as though Luke does not "know" that Mark is in the room, even though it is claimed he has a justified true belief that Mark is in the room, but it is not nearly so clear that the ''perceptual belief'' that "Mark is in the room" was inferred from any premises at all, let alone any false ones, nor led to significant conclusions on its own; Luke did not seem to be reasoning about anything; "Mark is in the room" seems to have been part of what he ''seemed to see''.

To save the "no false lemmas" solution, one must logically say that Luke's inference from sensory data does not count as a justified belief unless he consciously or unconsciously considers the possibilities of deception and self-deception. A justified version of Luke's thought process, by that logic, might go like this:
#That looks to me like Mark in the room.
#No factor, right now, could deceive me on this point.
#Therefore, I can safely ignore that possibility.
#"Mark is in the room" (or, "I can safely treat that as Mark").

The second line counts as a false premise. However, by the previous argument, this suggests we have fewer justified beliefs than we think we do.

==Constructing arbitrary Gettier problems==

The main idea behind Gettier's examples is that the justification for the belief is flawed or incorrect, but the belief turns out to be true by sheer luck. Thus, a general scenario can be constructed as such:

Bob believes A is true because of B. Argument B is flawed, but A turns out to be true by a different argument C. Since A is true, Bob believes A is true, and Bob has justification B, all of the conditions (JTB) are satisfied. However, Bob had no knowledge of A.

==Responses to Gettier==

The Gettier problem is formally a problem in first-order logic, but the introduction by Gettier of terms such as ''believes'' and ''knows'' moves the discussion into the field of epistemology. Here, the sound (true) arguments ascribed to Smith then need also to be valid (believed) and convincing (justified) if they are to issue in the real-world discussion about ''justified true belief''.
&lt;ref&gt;James Pryor. [http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/courses/epist2004/notes/gettier.html Theory of Knowledge - The Gettier Problem] (archive)&lt;/ref&gt;

Responses to Gettier problems have fallen into one of three categories:

* '''Affirmations of the JTB account:''' This response affirms the JTB account of knowledge, but rejects Gettier cases. Typically, the proponent of this response rejects Gettier cases because, they say, Gettier cases involve insufficient levels of justification. Knowledge actually requires higher levels of justification than Gettier cases involve.
* '''Fourth condition responses:''' This response accepts the problem raised by Gettier cases, and affirms that JTB is ''necessary'' (but not ''sufficient'') for knowledge. A proper account of knowledge, according to this type of view, will contain some fourth condition (JTB + ?). With the fourth condition in place, Gettier counterexamples (and other similar counterexamples) will not work, and we will have an adequate set of criteria that are both necessary and sufficient for knowledge.
* '''Justification replacement response:''' This response also accepts the problem raised by Gettier cases. However, instead of invoking a fourth condition, it seeks to replace Justification itself for some other third condition (?TB) (or remove it entirely) that will make counterexamples obsolete.

One response, therefore, is that in none of the above cases was the belief justified because it is impossible to justify anything that is not true.  Conversely, the fact that a proposition turns out to be untrue is proof that it was not sufficiently justified in the first place.  Under this interpretation, the JTB definition of knowledge survives. This shifts the problem to a definition of justification, rather than knowledge.  Another view is that justification and non-justification are not in [[binary opposition]].  Instead, justification is a matter of degree, with an idea being more or less justified.  This account of justification is supported by mainstream philosophers such as Paul Boghossian &lt;ref name="Boghossian on Justification"&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Clarendon Press |publication-place = Oxford, UK |author = Paul Boghossian |url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/fear-of-knowledge-9780199230419?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; |title = Fear of Knowledge: Against relativism and constructivism |publication-date = 2007 }}, Chapter 7, p 95-101.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTYzyzRt70&amp;feature=youtu.be] and [[Stephen Hicks]][https://web.archive.org/web/20141222000209/http://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/hicks-ep-full.pdf][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhK6XOT3uAA].  In common sense usage, an idea can not only be more justified or less justified, but it can also partially justified (Smith's boss told him X) and partially unjustified (Smith's boss is a liar).  Gettier's cases involve propositions that were true, believed, but which had weak justification.  In case 1, the premise that the testimony of Smith's boss is "strong evidence" is rejected.  The case itself depends on the boss being either wrong or deceitful (Jones did not get the job) and therefore unreliable.  In case 2, Smith again has accepted a questionable idea (Jones owns a Ford) with unspecified justification.  Without justification, both cases do not undermine the JTB account of knowledge.

Other epistemologists accept Gettier's conclusion. Their responses to the Gettier problem, therefore, consist of trying to find alternative analyses of knowledge. They have struggled to discover and agree upon as a beginning any single notion of truth, or belief, or justifying which is wholly and obviously accepted. Truth, belief, and justifying have not yet been satisfactorily defined{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}, so that JTB (justified true belief) may be defined satisfactorily is still problematical, on account or otherwise of Gettier's examples. Gettier, for many years a professor at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] later also was interested in the [[epistemic logic]] of [[Jaako Hintikka|Hintikka]], a Finnish philosopher at [[Boston University]], who published ''Knowledge and Belief'' in 1962.
[http://www.umass.edu/chronicle/archives/00/08-25/philosopher41.html]

===Fourth condition (JTB+G) approaches===
The most common direction for this sort of response to take is what might be called a "JTB+G" analysis: that is, an analysis based on finding some ''fourth'' condition—a "no-Gettier-problem" condition—which, when added to the conditions of justification, truth, and belief, will yield a set of necessary and jointly sufficient conditions.

====Goldman's causal theory====
One such response is that of [[Alvin Goldman]] (1967), who suggested the addition of a ''causal'' condition: a subject's belief is justified, for Goldman, only if the truth of a belief has ''caused'' the subject to have that belief (in the appropriate way); and for a justified true belief to count as knowledge, the subject must ''also'' be able to "correctly reconstruct" (mentally) that causal chain. Goldman's analysis would rule out Gettier cases in that Smith's beliefs are not caused by the truths of those beliefs; it is merely ''accidental'' that Smith's beliefs in the Gettier cases happen to be true, or that the prediction made by Smith: " The winner of the job will have 10 coins", on the basis of his putative belief, (see also [[Bundle theory|bundling]]) came true in this one case. This theory is challenged by the difficulty of giving a principled explanation of how an appropriate causal relationship differs from an inappropriate one (without the circular response of saying that the appropriate sort of causal relationship is the knowledge-producing one); or retreating to a position in which justified true belief is weakly defined as the consensus of learned opinion. The latter would be useful, but not as useful nor desirable as the unchanging definitions of scientific concepts such as momentum. Thus, adopting a causal response to the Gettier problem usually requires one to adopt (as Goldman gladly does) some form of [[reliabilism]] about justification. See ''Goldman''s [[Theory of justification]].

====Lehrer–Paxson's defeasibility condition====
[[Keith Lehrer]] and [[Thomas Paxson]] (1969) proposed another response, by adding a ''[[defeasibility]] condition'' to the JTB analysis. On their account, knowledge is '''''undefeated''' justified true belief'' — which is to say that a justified true belief counts as knowledge if and only if it is also the case that there is no further truth that, had the subject known it, would have defeated her present justification for the belief. (Thus, for example, Smith's justification for [[Epistemic modality|believing]] that the person who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket is his justified belief that Jones will get the job, combined with his justified belief that Jones has ten coins in his pocket. But if Smith had known the truth that Jones will ''not'' get the job, that would have defeated the justification for his belief.) However, many critics (such as Marshall Swain [1974]) have argued that the notion of a ''defeater'' fact cannot be made precise enough to rule out the Gettier cases without also ruling out ''a priori'' cases of knowledge {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.

====Pragmatism====
[[Pragmatism]] was developed as a philosophical doctrine by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S.Peirce]] and [[William James]] (1842–1910). In Peirce's view, the truth is nominally defined as a sign's correspondence to its object and pragmatically defined as the ideal final opinion to which sufficient investigation ''would'' lead sooner or later. James' [[William James#Epistemology|epistemological]] model of truth was that which ''works'' in the way of belief, and a belief was true if in the long run it ''worked'' for all of us, and guided us expeditiously through our semihospitable world.
Peirce argued that [[metaphysics]] could be cleaned up by a pragmatic approach.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Consider what effects that might ''conceivably'' have practical bearings you ''conceive'' the objects of your ''conception'' to have.  Then, your ''conception'' of those effects is the whole of your ''conception'' of the object.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 481 in Peirce, C.&amp;nbsp;S. (1905), "Issues of Pragmaticism", The ''Monist'', vol. 15, pp. 481–499, ''Google Book Search Beta'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;jtp=501 Eprint], ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/details/monistquart15hegeuoft Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' v. 5 paragraphs 438–463, see 438, and in ''Charles S. Peirce: Selected Writings'', pp. 203–226)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From a pragmatic viewpoint of the kind often ascribed to James, defining on a particular occasion whether a particular belief can rightly be said to be both true and justified is seen as no more than an exercise in [[pedant]]ry, but being able to [[Decision making|discern]] whether that belief led to fruitful outcomes is a fruitful [[action (philosophy)|enterprise]]. Peirce emphasized [[fallibilism]], considered the assertion of absolute certainty a barrier to inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1899), "F.R.L." &amp;#91;First Rule of Logic&amp;#93;, unpaginated manuscript, c. 1899, CP 1.135–140. [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm Eprint] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106071421/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm |date=January 6, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1901 defined truth as follows: "Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1901), "Truth and Falsity and Error" (in part), pp. 718–720 in J.M. Baldwin. ed., ''[[James Mark Baldwin#dpp|Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]]'', vol. 2. Reprinted, CP 5.565–573.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, any unqualified assertion is likely to be at least a little wrong or, if right, still right for not entirely the right reasons. Therefore one is more veracious by being Socratic, including a recognition of one's own ignorance and knowing one may be proved wrong. This is the case, even though in practical matters one sometimes must act, if one is to act at all, with decision and complete confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1898), "Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' v. 1, paragraphs 616–48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., commentary), 105–22, reprinted in ''The Essential Peirce'', v. 2, 27–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revisions of JTB approaches===
The difficulties involved in producing a viable fourth condition have led to claims that attempting to repair the JTB account is a deficient strategy. For example, one might argue that what the Gettier problem shows is not the need for a fourth independent condition in addition to the original three, but rather that the attempt to build up an account of knowledging by conjoining a set of independent conditions was misguided from the outset. Those who have adopted this approach generally argue that epistemological terms like [[Theory of justification|justification]], [[evidence]], [[certainty]], etc. should be analyzed in terms of a primitive notion of ''knowledge,'' rather than vice versa. Knowledge is understood as ''factive,'' that is, as embodying a sort of epistemological "tie" between a truth and a belief. The JTB account is then criticized for trying to get and encapsulate the factivity of knowledge "on the cheap," as it were, or via a circular argument, by replacing an irreducible notion of factivity with the conjunction of some of the properties that accompany it (in particular, truth and justification). Of course, the introduction of irreducible primitives into a philosophical theory is always problematical (some would say a sign of desperation), and such anti-reductionist accounts are unlikely to please those who have other reasons to hold fast to the method behind JTB+G accounts.

==== Fred Dretske's conclusive reasons and Robert Nozick's truth-tracking ====
[[Fred Dretske]] (1971) developed an account of knowledge which he called "conclusive reasons", revived by [[Robert Nozick]] as what he called the ''subjunctive'' or truth-tracking account (1981). Nozick's formulation posits that proposition P is an instance of knowledge when:

#p is true
#S believes that p
#if p were true, S would believe that p
#if p weren't true, S wouldn't believe that p

Nozick's definition is intended to preserve Goldman's intuition that Gettier cases should be ruled out by disacknowledging  "accidentally" true justified beliefs, but without risking the potentially onerous consequences of building a causal requirement into the analysis. This  tactic though, invites the riposte that Nozick's account merely hides the problem and does not solve it, for it leaves open the question of ''why'' Smith would not have had his belief if it had been false. The most promising answer seems to be that it is because Smith's belief was ''caused'' by the truth of what he believes; but that puts us back in the causalist camp.

Criticisms and counter examples (notably the ''Grandma case'') prompted a revision, which resulted in the alteration of (3) and (4) to limit themselves to the same method (i.e. vision):

#p is true
#S believes that p
#if p were true, S ''(using M)'' would believe that p
#if p weren't true, S ''(using method M)'' wouldn't believe that p

[[Saul Kripke]] has pointed out that this view remains problematic and uses a counterexample called the ''Fake Barn Country example'', which describes a certain locality containing a number of fake barns or facades of barns.  In the midst of these fake barns is one real barn, which is painted red.  There is one more piece of crucial information for this example: the fake barns cannot be painted red.

Jones is driving along the highway, looks up and happens to see the real barn, and so forms the belief

*I see a barn

Though Jones has gotten lucky, he could have just as easily been deceived and not have known it.  Therefore it doesn't fulfill premise 4, for if Jones saw a fake barn he wouldn't have any idea it was a fake barn.  So this is not knowledge.

An alternate example is if Jones looks up and forms the belief

*I see a red barn.

According to Nozick's view this fulfills all four premises.  Therefore this is knowledge, since Jones couldn't have been wrong, since the fake barns cannot be painted red.  This is a troubling account however, since it seems the first statement ''I see a barn'' can be inferred from ''I see a red barn''; however by Nozick's view the first belief is ''not'' knowledge and the second is knowledge.

===Robert Fogelin's perspectival account===
In the first chapter of his book ''Pyrronian Reflexions on Truth and Justification''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.example Oxford, Oxford University Press], 1994&lt;/ref&gt;,  [[Robert Fogelin]] gives a diagnosis that leads to a dialogical solution to Gettier's problem. The problem always arises when the given justification has nothing to do with what really makes the proposition true. Now, he notes that in such cases there is always a mismatch between the information disponible to the person who makes the knowledge-claim of some proposition p and the information disponible to the evaluator of this knowledge-claim (even if the evaluator is the same person in a later time). A Gettierian counterexample arises when the justification given by the person who makes the knowledge-claim cannot be accepted by the knowledge evaluator because it does not fit with his wider informational setting. For instance, in the case of the fake barn the evaluator knows that a superficial inspection from someone who does not know the peculiar circumstances involved isn't a justification aceptable as making the proposition p (that it is a real barn) true.&lt;ref&gt;For a precise formulation of Fogelin's view, see Claudio Costa [http://www.example ''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''], CSP, 2014, ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
====Richard Kirkham's skepticism====
[[Richard Kirkham]] has proposed that it is best to start with a definition of knowledge so strong that giving a counterexample to it is logically impossible. Whether it can be weakened without becoming subject to a counterexample should then be checked. He concludes that there will always be a counterexample to any definition of knowledge in which the believer's evidence does not logically necessitate the belief. Since in most cases the believer's evidence does not necessitate a belief, Kirkham embraces skepticism about knowledge. He notes that a belief can still be rational even if it is not an item of knowledge. (see also: [[fallibilism]])

===Attempts to dissolve the problem===

One might respond to Gettier by finding a way to avoid his conclusion(s) in the first place. However, it can hardly be argued that knowledge is justified true belief if there are cases that are justified true belief without being knowledge; thus, those who want to avoid Gettier's conclusions have to find some way to defuse Gettier's counterexamples. In order to do so, within the parameters of the particular counter-example or [[wikt:exemplar|exemplar]], they must then either accept that

# Gettier's cases are not really cases of justified true belief, or
# Gettier's cases really are cases of knowledge after all,

or, demonstrate a case in which it is possible to circumvent surrender to the exemplar by eliminating any necessity for it to be considered that JTB apply in just those areas that Gettier has rendered obscure, without thereby lessening the force of JTB to apply in those cases where it actually is crucial.
Then, though Gettier's cases ''stipulate'' that Smith has a certain belief and that his belief is true, it seems that in order to propose (1), one must argue that Gettier, (or, that is, the writer responsible for the particular form of words on this present occasion known as case (1), and who makes assertion's about Smith's "putative" beliefs), goes wrong because he has the wrong notion of ''justification.'' Such an argument often depends on an [[externalism|externalist]] account on which "justification" is understood in such a way that whether or not a belief is "justified" depends not just on the internal state of the believer, but also on how that internal state is related to the outside world. Externalist accounts typically are constructed such that Smith's putative beliefs in Case I and Case II are not really justified (even though it seems to Smith that they are), because his beliefs are not lined up with the world in the right way, or that it is possible to show that it is invalid to assert that "Smith" has any significant "particular" belief at all, in terms of JTB or otherwise. Such accounts, of course, face the same burden as causalist responses to Gettier: they have to explain what sort of relationship between the world and the believer counts as a justificatory relationship.

Those who accept (2) are by far in the minority in analytic philosophy; generally those who are willing to accept it are those who have independent reasons to say that more things count as knowledge than the intuitions that led to the JTB account would acknowledge. Chief among these are [[epistemic minimalism|epistemic minimalists]] such as [[Crispin Sartwell]], who hold that all true belief, including both Gettier's cases and lucky guesses, counts as knowledge.

===Experimental research===

Some early work in the field of [[experimental philosophy]] suggested that traditional intuitions about Gettier cases might vary cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinberg|first1=Jonathan M.|last2=Nichols|first2=Shaun|last3=Stich|first3=Stephen|title=Normativity and Epistemic Intuitions|journal=Philosophical Topics|date=Spring–Fall 2001|volume=29|issue=1–2|pages=429–460|doi=10.5840/philtopics2001291/217}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent studies have consistently failed to replicate these results, instead finding that participants from different cultures do share the traditional intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Minsun|last2=Yuan|first2=Yuan|title=No cross-cultural differences in the Gettier car case intuition: A replication study of Weinberg et al. 2001|journal=Episteme|date=2015|volume=12|issue=3|pages=355–361|doi=10.1017/epi.2015.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seyedsayamdost|first1=Hamid|title=On Normativity and Epistemic Intuitions: Failure of Replication|journal=Episteme|date=2014|volume=12|issue=1|pages=95–116|doi=10.1017/epi.2014.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nagel|first1=Jennifer|title=Intuitions and Experiments: A Defense of the Case Method in Epistemology|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=November 2012|volume=85|issue=3|pages=495–527|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2012.00634.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, more recent studies have actually been providing evidence for the opposite hypothesis, that people from a variety of different cultures have surprisingly similar intuitions in these cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Machery|first1=Edouard|last2=Stich|first2=Stephen|last3=Rose|first3=David|last4=Chatterjee|first4=Amita|last5=Karasawa|first5=Kaori|last6=Struchiner|first6=Noel|last7=Sirker|first7=Smita|last8=Usui|first8=Naoki|last9=Hashimoto|first9=Takaaki|title=Gettier Across Cultures|journal=Noûs|date=August 2015|doi=10.1111/nous.12110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''health management system''' (HMS) is an [[evolutionary medicine]] regulative process proposed by [[Nicholas Humphrey]]&lt;ref name="Great"&gt;{{cite book |author=Humphrey, Nicholas |chapter=19. Great Expectations: The Evolutionary Psychology of Faith-Healing and the Placebo Effect |chapterurl=http://www.humphrey.org.uk/papers/2002GreatExpectations.pdf |title=The Mind Made Flesh: Essays from the Frontiers of Psychology and Evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2002 |pages=255–85 |isbn=0-19-280227-5 }} reprinted from {{cite book |author=Hofsten, Claes von |title=Psychology at the Turn of the Millennium: Social, Developmental and Clinical Perspectives |publisher=Psychology Press |location=East Sussex |year=2002 |pages=225–46 |isbn=1-84169-199-2 |volume=2}}

This incorporation of cost–benefit calculations into body regulation provides a science grounded approach to [[Mind-body connection|mind–body]] phenomena such as [[placebos]] that are otherwise not explainable by low level, noneconomic, and purely feedback based [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] or [[allostasis|allostatic]] theories.

* Many medical [[symptoms]] such as [[inflammation]], [[fever]], pain, [[sickness behavior]], or [[morning sickness]] have an [[evolutionary medicine]] function of enabling the body to protect, heal or restore itself from [[injury]], [[infection]] or other physiological disruption.
* The deployment of self-treatments have [[Deployment cost–benefit selection in physiology|costs]] as well as benefits with the result that evolution has selected management processes in the brain such that self-treatments are used only when they provide an overall [[cost–benefit]] advantage. The brain controls such physiological process through [[Neural top–down control of physiology|top–down regulation]].
* External treatment and the availability of support is factored into the health management system’s cost–benefit assessment as to whether to deploy or not an evolved self-treatment.

[[Placebos]] are explained as the result of false information about the availability of external treatment and support that mislead the health management system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=Selvanski Monsu |title=Healthcare Management Systems |date=December 2012 |url=http://www.nintec.com/healthcare}}&lt;/ref&gt; into not deploying evolved self-treatments. This results in the placebo suppression of medical symptoms.

==Evolutionary medicine==

Since [[Hippocrates]], it has been recognized that the body has self-healing powers ([[vis medicatrix naturae]]). Modern [[evolutionary medicine]] identifies them with physiologically based self-treatments that provide the body with [[prophylactic]], healing, or restorative capabilities against injuries, infections and physiological disruption.  Examples include:

* [[Immunity (medical)|Immune responses]]
* [[Fever]]
* [[Sickness behavior]]
* [[Nausea]]
* [[Morning sickness]]
* [[Diarrhea]]
* [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|Hypoferremia]]
* [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]]
* [[pain#Evolutionary and behavioral role|Pain]]

These evolved self-treatments deployed by the body are experienced by humans as unpleasant and unwanted illness [[symptoms]].

==Deployment==

Such self-treatments according to evolutionary medicine are deployed to increase an individual’s  [[biological fitness]].

Two factors affect their deployment.

First, it is usually advantageous to deploy them on a [[precautionary principle|precautionary basis]].&lt;ref  name="Nesse"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03472.x |author=Nesse RM |authorlink=Randolph M. Nesse |title=The smoke detector principle. Natural selection and the regulation of defensive responses |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=935 |issue= |pages=75–85 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11411177 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0077-8923&amp;date=2001&amp;volume=935&amp;spage=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, it will often turn out that they have been deployed apparently unnecessarily, though this has in fact been advantageous since in probabilistic terms they have provided an insurance against a potentially costly outcome. As Nesse notes: "Vomiting, for example, may cost only a few hundred calories and a few minutes, whereas not vomiting may result in a 5% chance of death" page 77.&lt;ref  name="Nesse"/&gt;

Second, self-treatments are costly both in using energy, and also in their risk of damaging the body.

* Immunity – energy for activating lymphocyte and antibody production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lochmiller R, Deerenberg C |title=Trade-offs in evolutionary immunology: just what is the cost of immunity? |journal=Oikos |volume=88 |issue= |pages=87–98 |year=2000 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880110.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Romanyukha06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Romanyukha AA, Rudnev SG, Sidorov IA |title=Energy cost of infection burden: an approach to understanding the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions |journal=J.

Biol. |volume=241 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16378624 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.11.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5193(05)00479-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the risk of an immune response resulting in an [[immune disorders|immune related disorder]].
* Fever – energy (each 1&amp;nbsp;°C raise in blood temperature increases energy expenditure by  10–15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rodriguez DJ, Sandoval W, Clevenger FW |title=Is measured energy expenditure correlated to injury severity score in major trauma patients? |journal=J.

Surg. |volume=161 |issue= 1|pages=140–7 |date=January 1965 |pmid=14252624 |pmc=1408758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 90% of the total cost of fighting [[pneumonia]] goes on increased body temperature.&lt;ref name=Romanyukha06/&gt; There is also the risk of [[hyperpyrexia]].
* Sickness behavior – restricted ability by an animal to forage and defend itself
* Nausea – loss of food nutrients, and potential risk of [[Vomiting#Complications|aspiration]]
* Morning sickness – loss of food nutrients when a mother needs additional, not less, nourishment
* Hypoferremia – impairment in biological processes needing iron resulting in [[iron deficiency anemia]]
* Depression – [[Evolutionary approaches to depression|impaired activity and problem solving]].
* Pain – restricted movement and the [[Chronic pain#Related sequelae|inability to concentrate]]

One factor in deployment is low level physiological control by [[proinflammatory cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]] triggered by bacterial [[lipopolysaccharides]] (LPS).

Another is [[Neural top down control of physiology|higher level control]] in which the brain takes into account what it learns about circumstances and how that makes it well and ill. [[Classical conditioning|Conditioning]] shows the existence of such learnt control: give saccharin paired in a drink with a drug that creates [[immunosuppression]], and later on, giving saccharin alone will produce immunosuppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ader R, Cohen N |title=Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=333–40 |year=1975 |pmid=1162023 |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1162023 |doi=10.1097/00006842-197507000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/nlme.1995.1048 |vauthors=Alvarez-Borda B, Ramírez-Amaya V, Pérez-Montfort R, Bermúdez-Rattoni F |title=Enhancement of antibody production by a learning paradigm |journal=Neurobiol Learn Mem |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=103–5 |date=September 1995 |pmid=7582817 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1074742785710489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0889-1591(02)00031-4 |vauthors=Oberbeck R, Kromm A, Exton MS, Schade U, Schedlowski M |title=Pavlovian conditioning of endotoxin-tolerance in rats |journal=Brain Behav.

==Cost benefit analysis==

=== Economic resource management===
Evolution, according to [[Nicholas Humphrey]], has selected an internal health management system that uses [[cost benefit analysis]] upon whether the deployment of a self-treatment aids [[biological fitness]], and so should be activated. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;a specially designed procedure for “economic resource management” that is, I believe, one of the key features of the “natural health-care service” which has evolved in ourselves and other animals to help us deal throughout our lives with repeated bouts of sickness, injury, and other threats to our well-being.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An analogy is explicitly made with the [[health economics]] consideration used in management decisions involving external medical treatment.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, if you wonder about this choice of managerial terminology for talking about biological healing systems, I should say that it is quite deliberate (and so is the pun on NHS.) With the phrase “natural health-care service” I do intend to evoke, at a biological level, all the economic connotations that are so much a part of modern health-care in society.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===External medications===
External medications will affect the cost benefits advantages of deploying an evolved self-treatment. Some animals use [[Zoopharmacognosy|external ones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engel, Cindy |title=Wild Health : Lessons in Natural Wellness from the Animal Kingdom |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-618-34068-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wildlife|Wild animals]], including [[apes]],  do so in the form of ingested [[geophagy|detoxifying clays]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klein N, Fröhlich F, Krief S |title=Geophagy: soil consumption enhances the bioactivities of plants eaten by chimpanzees |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=325–31 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18188538 |doi=10.1007/s00114-007-0333-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; rough leaves that clear gut parasites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fowler A, Koutsioni Y, Sommer V |title=Leaf-swallowing in Nigerian chimpanzees: evidence for assumed self-medication |journal=Primates |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=73–6 |date=January 2007 |pmid=16897194 |doi=10.1007/s10329-006-0001-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pharmacologically active plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1079/PNS2003257 |author=Huffman MA |title=Animal self-medication and ethno-medicine: exploration and exploitation of the medicinal properties of plants |journal=Proc Nutr Soc |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=371–81 |date=May 2003 |pmid=14506884 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0031-9384(94)90368-9 |vauthors=Koshimizu K, Ohigashi H, Huffman MA |title=Use of Vernonia amygdalina by wild chimpanzee: possible roles of its bitter and related constituents |journal=Physiol. Behav. |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=1209–16 |date=December 1994 |pmid=7878093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Complementary to this, research finds that animals have the ability to select and prefer substances that aid their recuperation from illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.173.3998.749 |vauthors=Green KF, Garcia J |title=Recuperation from illness: flavor enhancement for rats |journal=Science |volume=173 |issue=3998 |pages=749–51 |date=August 1971 |pmid=5568508 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=5568508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social support===
The welfare of social animals (including humans) depends upon other individuals ([[Tend and befriend|social buffering]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kikusui T, Winslow JT, Mori Y |title=Social buffering: relief from stress and anxiety |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. |volume=361 |issue=1476 |pages=2215–28 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17118934 |pmc=1764848 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1941 |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17118934}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actuarial assessments of the costs and benefits of deploying a self-treatment therefore will depend upon the presence, or not, of  other individuals. The presence of helpful others will affect, for example, the risk of predators when incapacitated, and—in those case in which animals do this (such as humans)—the provision of food, and care during sickness.

The health management system factors in the presence of such external treatment and social support as one aspect of the circumstances needed to determine whether it is advantageous to deploy or not an evolved self-treatment.

==Placebos==

===False information===
All humans societies use external medications, and some individuals exist that are considered to have special [[healers|healing]] knowledge about illnesses and their treatments. Humans are also usually supportive to those in their group. The availability of these things will affect the cost benefits of the body deploying its own biological ones. This could, in turn, lead to the health management system (given its beliefs (information) about treatments and support) to deploy or not, or doing so differently, the body’s own treatments.

Nicholas Humphrey describes how the health management system explains placebos – an external treatment without direct physiological effects – as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose, for example, a doctor gives someone who is suffering an infection a pill that she rightly believes to contain an antibiotic: because her hopes will be raised she will no doubt make appropriate adjustments to her health-management strategy – lowering her precautionary defences in anticipation of the sickness not lasting long.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The health management system, in other words, when faced with an infection is tricked into making a mistaken cost benefit analysis using false information. The effect of that false information is that the benefits of the self-treatment cease to outweigh its costs. As a result, it is not deployed, and an individual does not experience unwanted medical symptoms.

===Lack of harm===
Failure to deploy an evolved self-treatment need not put an individual at risk since evolution has advantaged their deployment on a precautionary basis.&lt;ref  name="Nesse"/&gt; As Nicholas Humphrey notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt; many of the health-care measures we’ve been discussing are precautionary measures designed to protect from dangers that lie ahead in an uncertain future. Pain is a way of making sure you give your body rest just in case you need it. Rationing the use of the immune system is a way of making sure you have the resources to cope with renewed attacks just in case they happen. Your healing systems are basically tending to be cautious, and sometimes over-cautious, as if working on the principle of better safe than sorry.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Therefore, not deploying an evolved self-treatment, and so not having a medical symptom due to placebo false information might be without consequence.

==Central governor==

The health management system’s idea of a top down neural control of the body is also found in the idea that a [[central governor]] regulates [[muscle weakness|muscle fatigue]] to protect the body from the harmful effects (such as [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]] and [[hyperglycemia]]) of over prolonged exercise.

The idea of a fatigue governor was first proposed in 1924 by the 1922 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Archibald Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hill AV, Long CN, Lupton H |title=Muscular exercise, lactic acid and the supply and utilisation of oxygen. Parts I–III |journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. |volume=97 |pages=438–75 |year=1924 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/k51611345m783727/fulltext.pdf }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently, on the basis of modern research, by  [[Tim Noakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00007256-200333030-00001  |vauthors=St Clair Gibson A, Baden DA, Lambert MI, etal |title=The conscious perception of the sensation of fatigue |journal=Sports Med |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=167–76 |year=2003 |pmid=12656638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Noakes TD, St Clair Gibson A, Lambert EV |title=From catastrophe to complexity: a novel model of integrative central neural regulation of effort and fatigue during exercise in humans: summary and conclusions |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=120–4 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15665213 |pmc=1725112 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2003.010330 |url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15665213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Noakes TD, Peltonen JE, Rusko HK |title=Evidence that a central governor regulates exercise performance during acute hypoxia and hyperoxia |journal=J.

Biol. |volume=204 |issue=Pt 18 |pages=3225–34 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11581338 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/204/18/3225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0838.2000.010003123.x |author=Noakes TD |title=Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance |journal=Scand J Med Sci Sports |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=123–45 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10843507 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0905-7188&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00007256-200131090-00001 |vauthors=St Clair Gibson A, Lambert ML, Noakes TD |title=Neural control of force output during maximal and submaximal exercise |journal=Sports Med |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=637–50 |year=2001 |pmid=11508520 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like with the health management system, the central governor shares the idea that much of what is attributed to low level feedback homeostatic regulation is, in fact, due to [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top down]] control by the brain.  The advantage of this top down management is that the brain can enhance such regulation by allowing it to be modified by information. For example, in endurance running, a [[Cost-benefit analysis|cost benefit]] trade exists off between the advantages of continuing to run, and the risk if this is too prolonged that it might harm the body. Being able to regulate fatigue in terms of information about the benefits and costs of continued exercise would enhance biological fitness.

Low level theories exist that suggest that fatigue is due  mechanical failure of the exercising muscles ("peripheral fatigue").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwards RHT |chapter=Biochemical bases for fatigue in exercise performance: catastrophe theory in muscular fatigue |veditors=Knuttgen HG, Vogel JA, Poortmans J |title=Biochemistry of exercise |publisher=Human Kinetics |location=Champaign, IL |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-608-07112-1 |pages=1–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such low level theories do not explain why running muscle fatigue is affected by information relevant to cost benefit trade offs. For example, [[marathon]] runners can carry on running longer if told they are near the finishing line, than far away. The existence of a central governor can explain this effect.

In French, '''''jouissance''''' means enjoyment, in terms both of rights and property,&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; and of sexual [[orgasm]]—the latter  has a meaning partially lacking in the English word "enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jouissance|work=Literary Encyclopedia|publisher=The Literary Dictionary Company Limited|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=602|accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poststructuralism]] has developed the latter sense of ''jouissance'' in complex ways, so as to denote a transgressive, excessive kind of pleasure linked to the division and splitting of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] involved.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 162-3&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Lacanian psychoanalysis ==
English editions of the works of [[Jacques Lacan]] have generally left ''jouissance'' untranslated in order to help convey its specialised usage.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Evans, ''An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis''&lt;/ref&gt;  Lacan first developed his concept of an opposition between ''jouissance'' and the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in his Seminar "The Ethics of Psychoanalysis" (1959–1960). Lacan considered that "there is a ''jouissance'' beyond the pleasure principle"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; linked to the partial drive; a ''jouissance'' which compels the subject to constantly attempt to transgress the prohibitions imposed on his enjoyment, to go beyond the pleasure principle.

Yet the result of transgressing the pleasure principle, according to Lacan, is not more pleasure but pain, since there is only a certain amount of pleasure that the subject can bear. Beyond this limit, pleasure becomes pain, and this "painful principle" is what Lacan calls ''jouissance''.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Evans, ''An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis'' (2002) p.93&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''jouissance'' is suffering (''ethics'')—something which may be linked to the influence of the erotic philosophy of [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]], epitomised in Lacan's remark about "the recoil imposed on everyone, in so far as it involves terrible promises, by the approach of ''jouissance'' as such".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. xvi and p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan also linked ''jouissance'' to the [[castration complex]],&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 319-24&lt;/ref&gt; and to the aggression of the [[death drive]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Ethics of Psychoanalysis'' (1992) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

In his seminar "The Other Side of Psychoanalysis" (1969–1970) Lacan introduced the concept of "surplus-''jouissance''" (French ''plus-de-jouir'') inspired by [[Marx]]'s concept of [[surplus-value]]: he considered ''[[objet petit a]]'' is the excess of ''jouissance'' which has no use value, and which persists for the mere sake of ''jouissance''.

Lacan considered that ''jouissance'' is essentially [[phallic]], meaning that it does not relate to the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]" as such. In his seminar "Encore" (1972–1973), however, Lacan introduced the idea of specifically feminine ''jouissance'', saying that women have "in relation to what the phallic function designates of ''jouissance'', a supplementary ''jouissance''...a ''jouissance'' of the body which is...''beyond the phallus''".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. Mitchell/J. Rose eds., ''Feminine Sexuality'' (1982) p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; This feminine ''jouissance'' is ineffable, for both women and men may experience it but know nothing about it.

== In philosophy and literary theory ==
The Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]], a known Lacanian theorist, has adopted the term in his philosophy; it may also be seen in the works, both joint and individual, of [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], and it plays an important role in the writing of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Roland Barthes]].

In his 1973 [[literary theory]] book ''[[The Pleasure of the Text]]'', Barthes divides the effects of texts into two: ''plaisir'' (translated as "pleasure") and ''jouissance''. The distinction corresponds to a further distinction Barthes makes between "readerly" and "writerly" texts. The pleasure of the text corresponds to the readerly text, which does not challenge the reader's position as a [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]. The writerly text provides bliss, which explodes literary codes and allows the reader to break out of his or her subject position.

For Barthes ''plaisir'' is, "a pleasure... linked to cultural enjoyment and identity, to the cultural enjoyment of identity, to a homogenising movement of the ego."&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland. "The Death of the Author." Image—Music—Text. Trans. and ed. Stephen Heath. New York: Hill, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]] puts it, "''Plaisir'' results, then, from the operation of the structures of signification through which the subject knows himself or herself; ''jouissance'' fractures these structures."&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, Richard (1990/2002). ''Studying Popular Music''. Philadelphia: Open University Press. {{ISBN|0-335-15275-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In feminist theory ==

The French feminist writer [[Hélène Cixous]] uses the term ''jouissance'' to describe a form of women's pleasure or sexual rapture that combines mental, physical and spiritual aspects of female experience, bordering on mystical communion: "explosion, diffusion, effervescence, abundance...takes pleasure (jouit) in being limitless".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in E. D. Ermarth, ''Sequel to History'' (1992) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Cixous maintains that ''jouissance'' is the source of a woman's creative power and that the suppression of ''jouissance'' prevents women from finding their own fully empowered voice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engl.niu.edu/wac/cixous_intro.html Introduction to Cixous&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040409090818/http://www.engl.niu.edu/wac/cixous_intro.html |date=2004-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Popular Culture|author=J. Fiske|publisher=Routledge|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''jouissance'' is explored by Cixous and other authors in their writings on ''[[Écriture féminine]]'', a strain of [[Feminism in France|feminist literary theory that originated in France]] in the early 1970s.

Other feminists have argued that [[Freudian]] "hysteria" is ''jouissance'' distorted by patriarchal culture and say that ''jouissance'' is a transcendent state that represents freedom from oppressive linearities. In her introduction to Cixous' ''The Newly Born Woman'', literary critic [[Sandra Gilbert]] writes: "to escape hierarchical bonds and thereby come closer to what Cixous calls ''jouissance'', which can be defined as a virtually metaphysical fulfillment of desire that goes far beyond [mere] satisfaction... [It is a] fusion of the erotic, the mystical, and the political."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Sandra M. Introduction. The Newly Born Woman. By Hélène Cixous and Catherine Clement, 1975. Trans. Betsy Wing. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kay's Tutor v. Ayrshire &amp; Arran Health Board''''' [1987] 2 All ER 417; 1987 S.C. 145; 1987 S.L.T. 577; is an [[Scots Delict Law]] case concerning [[Causation (law)|causation]] in a [[Medical malpractice|medical negligence]] context. It was decided by the House of Lords, with [[Lord Keith of Kinkel]], [[Lord Brandon of Oakbrook]], [[Hugh Griffiths, Baron Griffiths|Lord Griffiths]], [[Lord Mackay of Clashfern]] and [[Lord Ackner]] sitting.

==Facts==
Kay's son was admitted to hospital with [[meningitis]]. By mistake, he was given a [[penicillin]] overdose. It was thirty times the norm. He went deaf. No case had ever been recorded where penicillin had caused deafness. Often, [[meningitis]] itself caused deafness. The first instance found in favour of the plaintiff, but this was overturned by the Court of Appeal. In the House of Lords the plaintiff argued, the overdose increased the risk of neurological damage. Deafness was damage of the same type, therefore the defendants should be liable. Lord Keith demonstrated grasp of medical knowledge by describing the facts somewhat more elaborately.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Meningitis is a disease which causes [[inflammation]] of one or more of the three [[Biological membrane|membranes]] which envelop the [[central nervous system]] consisting of the brain and [[spinal chord]]{{sic|?|}}. The three membranes are the [[dura mater]], the [[arachnoid mater|arachnoid]] and the [[pia mater]]. Between the arachnoid and the underlying pia mater is the [[subarachnoid space]], which is filled with [[cerebro-spinal fluid]] (CSF). The general practitioner had treated the respiratory infection with [[ampicillin]] administered orally, but due to vomiting its therapeutic effect may have been to some extent frustrated. On admission to hospital Andrew was found to be seriously ill. He was treated with [[benzyl penicillin]] and [[sulphadiazine]] administered [[intravenous]]ly. A specimen of CSF was taken and sent for analysis. On the following day, 29 November, the laboratory reported that two cultures of [[pneumococci]] had been cultivated from the specimen. This led to a confirmed diagnosis of [[pneumococcal meningitis]], a most virulent form of the disease. The consultant [[paediatrician]] in charge of the case, Dr McClure, instructed that 10,000 units of penicillin be injected [[intrathecal]]ly, that is to say by way of lumbar puncture into the subarachnoid space containing the CSF. The reason for this procedure was to bring about that the penicillin might most readily reach the infected [[meninges]] and attack the [[bacteria]] which were causing the disease. The injection was carried out shortly after noon on that day by Dr Adam-Strump, a senior house officer. By mistake he injected about 300,000 units of penicillin instead of 10,000 units. This rapidly produced toxic effects. The child went into [[convulsion]]s and later developed a degree of [[hemiparesis]], that is to say [[paralysis]] on one side of his body. Dr Adam-Strump realised his mistake immediately, and remedial measures were urgently instituted. These were successful in saving the child's life and by 1 December the immediate ill effects of the overdose appeared to have been surmounted. A rapid recovery from the meningitis also followed. He was discharged from hospital on 24 December. His parents before then had begun to suspect that he was suffering from deafness. This proved to be indeed the case. He was suffering and still suffers from profound [[bilateral deafness]]."&lt;ref&gt;1987 S.L.T. 577, 578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Judgment==
It was held that where two competing causes of damage existed the law could not presume that the tortious cause was responsible. It needed to be proved that it was an accepted fact that the tortious cause was capable of aggravating the damage. The case was distinguished from ''[[McGhee v. National Coal Board]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[McGhee v. National Coal Board]]'' [1973] 1 W.L.R. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Ackner, who gave the final judgment, offered a good anecdotal account of the evidence at trial about the possible causes of the boy's deafness.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dr McAllister, consultant bacteriologist in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Queen Mother's Hospital, Glasgow had made a special study in laboratory and clinical assessment of antibiotics, organising many symposia on antibiotics all over the world and, in particular, Europe and the United States. His contributions to the literature on this subject numbered nearly 100, including 20 dealing with penicillins. He confirmed that pneumococcal meningitis was the classical disease for producing deafness. He was asked whether he had ever come across any information which would suggest that an overdose of intrathecal penicillin causes or could cause deafness. He said he had searched the literature, he had computer scans done by three different processes, he had watched for years and in his experience there was no single recorded case of deafness from such an overdose.
He was asked in terms by the Lord Ordinary whether, as a bacteriologist, he was saying there was any reason why an overdose of penicillin injected intrathecally could not cause deafness. His reply was:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As a medical scientist I need evidence for things, without evidence and without rational balance of evidence medicine is a dead duck and in this case there is no evidence that an overdose of intrathecal Benzylpenicillin ever has caused deafness." In answer to a further question from the learned judge he said:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All things are possible and in medicine we never say never, but from the point of view of scientific medicine to my mind there is no evidence to incriminate an overdose of intrathecal Benzylpenicillin as a cause of deafness in this or in other cases and on the other side of the waterfall there is a massive amount of evidence to incriminate pneumococcal meningitis as one of the best known causes."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only evidence to the effect that penicillin was the cause of the boy's deafness came from Mr Williams, a neuro-surgeon. His theory that penicillin injected intrathecally would itself have a destructive effect on the auditory nerve was rejected by the Lord Ordinary. The Lord Ordinary, however, developed his own theory, which was not put to any of the expert medical witnesses who gave evidence for the respondents nor was it canvassed at all at the hearing. The First Division of the Court of Session held that the appellant was not entitled to succeed on the basis of this theory and this decision has not been challenged before your Lordships.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lord Ackner agreed that this case was distinguishable from ''McGhee''. In ''McGhee'' there was no problem about evidence that the failure to provide a shower could have caused Mr McGhee's dermatitis. The "could have" element simply reflected that it was uncertain which cause (the brick dust at work, or the lack of a shower) was the operating cause of dermatitis. But here, the idea that the penicillin overdose "could have" caused deafness was of a different quality. It was not just of lesser degree of possibility, but that there was no evidential basis for the assertion at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2051">In [[category theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''limit''' or a '''colimit''' of [[presheaf (category theory)|presheaves]] on a category ''C'' is a limit or colimit in the functor category &lt;math&gt;\widehat{C} = \mathbf{Fct}(C^{\text{op}}, \mathbf{Set})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;'''Notes on the foundation''': the notation '''Set''' implicitly assumes that there is the notion of a small set; i.e., one has made a choice of a [[Grothendieck universe]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The category &lt;math&gt;\widehat{C}&lt;/math&gt; admits small [[limit (category theory)|limit]]s and small [[colimit (category theory)|colimit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kashiwara–Schapira|loc=Corollary 2.4.3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explicitly, if &lt;math&gt;f: I \to \widehat{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a functor from a small category ''I'' and ''U'' is an object in ''C'', then &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim_{i \in I} f(i)&lt;/math&gt; is computed pointwise:

:&lt;math&gt;(\varinjlim f(i))(U) = \varinjlim f(i)(U).&lt;/math&gt;

The same is true for small limits. Concretely this means that, for example, a fiber product exists and is computed pointwise.

When ''C'' is small, by the Yoneda lemma, one can view ''C'' as the full subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\widehat{C}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\eta: C \to D&lt;/math&gt; is a functor, if &lt;math&gt;f: I \to C&lt;/math&gt; is a functor from a small category ''I'' and if the colimit &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\widehat{C}&lt;/math&gt; is representable; i.e., isomorphic to an object in ''C'', then,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kashiwara–Schapira|loc=Proposition 2.6.4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''D'',

: &lt;math&gt;\eta(\varinjlim f) \simeq \varinjlim \eta \circ f,&lt;/math&gt;

(in particular the colimit on the right exists in ''D''.)

The [[Density theorem (category theory)|density theorem]] states that every presheaf is a colimit of representable presheaves.

'''Loyalty''', in general use, is a [[Fixation (psychology)|devotion]] and [[faithfulness]] to a nation, cause, philosophy, [[country]], group, or [[person]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/loyalty |title=Loyalty definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary |publisher=[[Collins English Dictionary]] |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philosophers]] disagree on what can be an object of loyalty, as some argue that loyalty is strictly interpersonal and only another human [[being]] can be the object of loyalty. The definition of loyalty in [[law]] and [[political science]] is the fidelity of an individual to a [[nation]], either one's nation of birth, or one's declared home nation by [[oath]] ([[naturalization]]).

Classical [[tragedy]] is often based on a conflict arising from [[dual loyalty]]. 
''[[Euthyphro]]'', one of [[Plato]]'s early dialogues, is based on the ethical dilemma arising from
Euthyphro intending to lay manslaughter charges against his own father, who had caused the death of a slave through negligence.

In the [[Gospel of Matthew]] 6:24, Jesus states, "No one can serve two masters.  Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.  Ye cannot serve God and [[mammon]]".  This relates to the authority of a master over his servants (as per [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 6:5), who, according to [[Biblical law]], owe undivided loyalty to their master (as per Leviticus 25:44–46).&lt;ref name=White2000 /&gt;
On the other hand, the "[[Render unto Caesar]]" of the synoptic gospels acknowledges the possibility of distinct loyalties (secular and religious) without conflict, but if loyalty to man conflicts with loyalty to God, the latter takes precedence.&lt;ref name=SharmaSharma1998 /&gt;

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] defines loyalty as "allegiance to the sovereign or established government of one's country" and also "personal devotion and reverence to the sovereign and royal family".  It traces the word "[[wikt:loyalty|loyalty]]" to the 15th century, noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service, in love, or to an [[oath]] that one has made. The meaning that the ''Britannica'' gives as primary, it attributes to a shift during the 16th century, noting that the origin of the word is in the [[Old French]] "[[wikt:loialte|loialte]]", that is in turn rooted in the [[Latin language|Latin]] "[[wikt:lex|lex]]", meaning "[[wikt:law|law]]".  One who is loyal, in the [[feudalism|feudal]] sense of [[fealty]], is one who is lawful (as opposed to an [[outlaw]]), who has full legal rights as a consequence of faithful [[allegiance]] to a feudal lord.  Hence the 1911 ''Britannica'' derived its (early 20th century) primary meaning of loyalty to a [[monarch]].&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vandekerckhove2006 /&gt;

Per Wiktionary, it does not seem to be the Mandarin word for "loyalty", nor the name of a (Confucian) philosopher who wrote about the subject.}} Often cited as one of the many virtues of [[Confucianism]], meaning to do the best you can do for others.

"Loyalty" is the most important and frequently emphasized virtue in [[Bushido]]. It combines other six virtues, such as Righteousness ([[wikt:義|義 gi?]]), Courage ([[wikt:勇気|勇 yū?]]), Benevolence, ([[wikt:仁|仁 jin?]]), Respect ([[wikt:礼|礼 rei?]]), Sincerity ([[wikt:誠|誠 makoto?]]), Honour ([[wikt:名誉|名誉 meiyo?]]), and formed the Bushido code: "It is somehow implanted in their chromosomal makeup to be loyal".&lt;ref name=Hurst1990&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurst|first1=G.

==Modern concepts==

[[Josiah Royce]] presented a different definition of the concept in his 1908 book ''The Philosophy of Loyalty''. According to Royce, loyalty is a [[virtue]], indeed a primary virtue, "the heart of all the virtues, the central duty amongst all the duties". Royce presents loyalty, which he defines at length, as the basic moral principle from which all other principles can be derived.&lt;ref name=Thilly1908 /&gt;  The short definition that he gives of the idea is that loyalty is "the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause".&lt;ref name=Kleinig2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thilly1908 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin1994 /&gt;  Loyalty is thoroughgoing in that it is not merely a casual interest but a wholehearted commitment to a cause.&lt;ref name=Mullin2005 /&gt;

Royce's view of loyalty was challenged by Ladd in the article on "Loyalty" in the first edition of the Macmillan ''[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1967).

Ralls (1968) observes that Ladd's article is the Macmillan ''Encyclopaedia''{{'}}s only article on a virtue, and praises it for its "magnificent" declaration by Ladd that "a loyal Nazi is a contradiction in terms".&lt;ref name=Ralls1968 /&gt;
Ladd asserts that, contrary to Royce, causes to which one is loyal are interpersonal, not impersonal or suprapersonal.&lt;ref name=Baron1984 /&gt;  He states that Royce's view has "the ethical defect of postulating duties over and above our individual duties to men and groups of men.  The individual is submerged and lost in this superperson for its tends to dissolve our specific duties to others into 'superhuman' good". Ronald F. Duska, the Lamont Post Chair of Ethics and the Professions at [[The American College of Financial Services|The American College]], extends Ladd's objection, saying that it is a perversion of ethics and virtue for one's self-will to be identified with anything, as Royce would have it.  Even if one were identifying one's self-will with God, to be worthy of such loyalty God would have to be the ''[[summum bonum]]'', the perfect manifestation of good.

Ladd himself characterizes loyalty as interpersonal, i.e., a relationship between a lord and vassal, parent and child, or two good friends.  Duska states that doing so leads to a problem that Ladd overlooks.  Loyalty may certainly be between two persons, but it may also be from a person to a group of people.  Examples of this, which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty, are loyalty by a person to his or her family, to a team that he or she is a member or fan of, or to his or her country.  The problem with this that Duska identifies is that it then becomes unclear whether there is a strict interpersonal relationship involved, and whether Ladd's contention that loyalty is interpersonal—not suprapersonal—is an adequate description.&lt;ref name=Duska2007 /&gt;

Ladd considers loyalty from two perspectives: its proper object and its moral value.&lt;ref name=Ladd1967 /&gt;  

John Kleinig, professor of [[philosophy]] at [[City University of New York]], observes that over the years the idea has been treated by writers from [[Aeschylus]] through [[John Galsworthy]] to [[Joseph Conrad]], by psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, scholars of religion, political economists, scholars of business and marketing, and—most particularly—by political theorists, who deal with it in terms of [[loyalty oath]]s and [[patriotism]]. As a philosophical concept, loyalty was largely untreated by philosophers until the work of [[Josiah Royce]], the "grand exception" in Kleinig's words.&lt;ref name=Kleinig2007 /&gt;  John Ladd, professor of philosophy at [[Brown University]], writing in the Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' in 1967, observes that by that time the subject had received "scant attention in philosophical literature". This he attributed to "odious" associations that the subject had with [[nationalism]], including [[Nazism]], and with the metaphysics of [[idealism]], which he characterized as "obsolete". However, he argued that such associations were faulty and that the notion of loyalty is "an essential ingredient in any civilized and humane system of morals".&lt;ref name=Ladd1967 /&gt;  Kleinig observes that from the 1980s onwards, the subject gained attention, with philosophers variously relating it to [[professional ethics]], [[whistleblowing]], [[friendship]], and [[virtue theory]].&lt;ref name=Kleinig2007 /&gt;

Additional aspects enumerated by Kleinig include the exclusionary nature of loyalty and its subjects.&lt;ref name=Kleinig2007 /&gt;

=== The proper object of loyalty ===
Ladd and others, including [[Milton R. Konvitz]]{{year needed|date=October 2015}} and Marcia W. Baron (1984),&lt;ref name=Baron1984/&gt; disagree amongst themselves as to the proper ''object of'' loyalty—what it is possible to be loyal ''to'', in other words.  Ladd, as stated, considers loyalty to be interpersonal, and that the object of loyalty is always a person. In the ''Encyclopaedia of the History of Ideas'', Konvitz states that the objects of loyalty encompass principles, causes, ideas, ideals, religions, ideologies, nations, governments, parties, leaders, families, friends, regions, racial groups, and "anyone or anything to which one's heart can become attached or devoted".  Baron agrees with Ladd, inasmuch as loyalty is "to certain people or to a group of people, not loyalty to an ideal or cause".  She argues in her [[monograph]], ''The Moral Status of Loyalty'', that "[w]hen we speak of causes (or ideals) we are more apt to say that people are committed to them or devoted to them than that they are loyal to them".  Kleinig agrees with Baron, noting that a person's earliest and strongest loyalties are almost always to people, and that only later do people arrive at abstract notions like values, causes, and ideals.  He disagrees, however, with the notion that loyalties are restricted ''solely'' to personal attachments, considering it "incorrect (as a matter of logic)".&lt;ref name=Kleinig1996 /&gt; Loyalty to people and abstract notions such as causes or ideals is considered an [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary tactic]], as there is a greater chance of survival and procreation if animals belong to loyal packs.&lt;ref name="breedbites"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Power of Tribes in Evolution |work=Breed Bites |date=1 December 2007 |url=https://breedbites.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/the-power-of-tribes-in-evolution/ |accessdate=23 January 2014 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiplicity, disloyalty, and whether loyalty is exclusionary ===
Stephen Nathanson, professor of Philosophy at [[Northeastern University]], states that loyalty can be either ''exclusionary'' or ''non-exclusionary''; and can be ''single'' or ''multiple''.  Exclusionary loyalty excludes loyalties to other people or groups; whereas non-exclusionary loyalty does not.  People may have single loyalties, to just one person, group, or thing, or multiple loyalties to multiple objects.  Multiple loyalties can constitute a ''disloyalty'' to an object if one of those loyalties is ''exclusionary'', excluding one of the others.  However, Nathanson observes, this is a special case.  In the general case, the existence of multiple loyalties does not cause a disloyalty.  One can, for example, be loyal to one's friends, or one's family, and still, without contradiction, be loyal to one's religion, or profession.

=== Other dimensions ===
In addition to ''number'' and ''exclusion'' as just outlined, Nathanson enumerates five other "dimensions" that loyalty can vary along: basis, strength, scope, legitimacy, and attitude.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Loyalties differ in ''basis'' according to their foundations. They may be constructed upon the basis of unalterable facts that constitute a personal connection between the subject and the object of the loyalty, such as biological ties or place of birth (a notion of natural allegiance propounded by [[Socrates]] in his political theory). Alternatively, they may be constructed from personal choice and evaluation of criteria with a full degree of freedom. The degree of control that one has is not necessarily simple; Nathanson points out that whilst one has no choice as to one's parents or relatives, one ''can'' choose to desert them.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Loyalties differ in ''strength''.  They can range from supreme loyalties, that override all other considerations, to merely presumptive loyalties, that affect one's presumptions, providing but one motivation for action that is weighed against other motivations.  Nathanson observes that strength of loyalty is often interrelated with basis.  "[[Blood is thicker than water]]", states an aphorism, explaining that loyalties that have biological ties as their bases are generally stronger.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Loyalties differ in ''scope''.  They range from loyalties with limited scope, that require few actions of the subject, to loyalties with broad or even unlimited scopes, which require many actions, or indeed to do whatever may be necessary in support of the loyalty.  Loyalty to one's job, for example, may require no more action than simple punctuality and performance of the tasks that the job requires.  Loyalty to a family member can, in contrast, have a very broad effect upon one's actions, requiring considerable personal sacrifice.  Extreme patriotic loyalty may impose an unlimited scope of duties.  Scope encompasses an element of ''constraint''.  Where two or more loyalties conflict, their scopes determine what weight to give to the alternative courses of action required by each loyalty.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Loyalties differ in ''[[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]]''.  This is of particular relevance to the conflicts among multiple loyalties.  People with one loyalty can hold that another, conflicting, loyalty is either legitimate or illegitimate.  In the extreme view, one that Nathanson ascribes to religious extremists and xenophobes for examples, all loyalties bar one's own are considered illegitimate.  The xenophobe does not regard the loyalties of foreigners to their countries as legitimate while the religious extremist does not acknowledge the legitimacy of other religions.  At the other end of the spectrum, past the middle ground of considering some loyalties as legitimate and others not, according to cases, or plain and simple indifference to other people's loyalties, is the positive regard of other people's loyalties.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Finally, loyalties differ in the ''attitude'' that the subjects of the loyalties have towards other people.  (Note that this dimension of loyalty concerns the ''subjects'' of the loyalty, whereas legitimacy, above, concerns the loyalties themselves.)  People may have one of a range of possible attitudes towards others who do not share their loyalties, with hate and disdain at one end, indifference in the middle, and concern and positive feeling at the other.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

==In relation to other subjects==

===Patriotism===
{{Main|Patriotism}}
Nathanson observes that loyalty is often directly equated to patriotism.  He states, that this is, however, not actually the case, arguing that whilst patriots exhibit loyalty, it is not conversely the case that all loyal persons are patriots.  He provides the example of a [[mercenary]] soldier, who exhibits loyalty to the people or country that pays him.  Nathanson points to the difference in motivations between a loyal mercenary and a patriot.  A mercenary may well be motivated by a sense of [[professionalism]] or a belief in the sanctity of [[contracts]].  A patriot, in contrast, may be motivated by affection, concern, identification, and a willingness to sacrifice.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Nathanson contends that patriotic loyalty is not always a virtue.  A loyal person can, in general be relied upon, and hence people view loyalty as virtuous.  Nathanson argues that loyalty can, however, be given to persons or causes that are unworthy.  Moreover, loyalty can lead patriots to support policies that are immoral and inhumane.  Thus, Nathanson argues, patriotic loyalty can sometimes rather be a vice than a virtue, when its consequences exceed the boundaries of what is otherwise morally desirable.  Such loyalties, in Nathanson's view, are erroneously ''unlimited'' in their scopes, and fail to acknowledge boundaries of morality.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

===Whistleblowing===
{{Main|Whistleblowing}}
Several scholars, including Duska, discuss loyalty in the context of whistleblowing.  Wim Vandekerckhove of the [[University of Greenwich]] points out that in the late 20th century saw the rise of a notion of a ''bidirectional'' loyalty—between employees and their employer.  (Previous thinking had encompassed the idea that employees are loyal to an employer, but not that an employer need be loyal to employees.)  The ethics of whistleblowing thus encompass a conflicting multiplicity of loyalties, where the traditional loyalty of the employee to the employer conflicts with the loyalty of the employee to his or her community, which the employer's business practices may be adversely affecting.  Vandekerckhove reports that different scholars resolve the conflict in different ways, some of which he, himself, does not find to be satisfactory.  Duska resolves the conflict by asserting that there is really only one proper object of loyalty in such instances, the community, a position that Vandekerckhove counters by arguing that businesses are in need of employee loyalty.

John Corvino, associate professor of Philosophy at [[Wayne State University]] takes a different tack, arguing that loyalty can sometimes be a vice, not a virtue, and that "loyalty is only a virtue to the extent that the object of loyalty is good" (similar to Nathanson). Vandekerckhove calls this argument "interesting" but "too vague" in its description of how tolerant an employee should be of an employer's shortcomings.  Vandekerckhove suggests that Duska and Corvino combine, however, to point in a direction that makes it possible to resolve the conflict of loyalties in the context of whistleblowing, by clarifying the objects of those loyalties.&lt;ref name=Vandekerckhove2006 /&gt;

===Marketing===
{{Main|Loyalty business model}}
Businesses seek to become the objects of loyalty in order to retain customers. [[Brand loyalty]] is a consumer's preference for a particular [[brand]] and a commitment to repeatedly purchase that brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dick Alan S. |author2=Basu Kunal | year = 1994 | title = Customer Loyalty: Toward an Integrated Conceptual Framework | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1177%2F0092070394222001 | journal = Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 99–113 | doi=10.1177/0092070394222001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Loyalty programs]] offer rewards to repeat customers in exchange for being able to keep track of consumer preferences and buying habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sharp Byron |author2=Sharp Anne | year = 1997 | title = Loyalty Programs and Their Impact on Repeat-Purchase Loyalty Patterns | url = http://byronsharp.com/resources/6076.PDF| journal = International Journal of Research in Marketing | volume = 14 | issue = 5| pages = 473–86 | doi=10.1016/s0167-8116(97)00022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One similar concept is [[fan loyalty]], an allegiance to and abiding interest in a [[sports team]], [[fictional character]], or fictional series. Devoted sports fans continue to remain fans even in the face of a string of losing seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Mark|title=The Business of Sports: A Primer for Journalists|date=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415876520| edition=2|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YG2wf1DT1MYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bible==
Attempting to serve two masters leads to “double-mindedness” ([[Epistle of James|James]] 4:8), undermining loyalty to a cause. The [[Bible]] also speaks of loyal ones, which would be those who follow the Bible with absolute loyalty, as in "Precious in the eyes of God is the death of his loyal ones" ([[Psalms]] 116:15).  Most Jewish and Christian authors view the [[binding of Isaac]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 22), in which [[Abraham]] was called by God to offer his son Isaac as a [[burnt offering]], as a test of Abraham's loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Louis A., ''The Akedah: The Binding of Isaac''. (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1997; {{ISBN|1-56821-899-0}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s faithfulness to his master [[Potiphar]] and his rejection of Potiphar's wife's advances ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 39) have also been called an example of the virtue of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;[[William J. Bennett]], ''[[The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great Moral Stories]]'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995; {{ISBN|0-684-83577-0}}), p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misplaced==
{{Main|Misplaced loyalty}}
Misplaced or mistaken loyalty refers to loyalty placed in other persons or [[organisations]] where that loyalty is not acknowledged or [[respect]]ed, is [[Betrayal|betrayed]], or taken advantage of. It can also mean loyalty to a malignant or misguided cause.

[[Social psychology (sociology)|Social psychology]] provides a partial explanation for the phenomenon in the way "the ''norm of social commitment'' directs us to honor our agreements...People usually stick to the deal even though it has changed for the worse".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot R. Smith and Diane M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (2007) p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; [[Humanists]] point out that "man inherits the capacity for loyalty, but not the use to which he shall put it...may unselfishly devote himself to what is petty or vile, as he may to what is generous and noble".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur James Balfour, ''Theism and Humanism'' (2000) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
[[File:Edwin Landseer Attachment.JPG|thumb|160px|right| Foxie, guarding the body of her master [[Charles Gough (artist)| Charles Gough]], in  ''Attachment'' by [[Edwin Landseer]], 1829]]

Animals as [[pet]]s have a large sense of loyalty to humans. Famous cases include [[Greyfriars Bobby]], a Skye terrier who attended his master's grave for fourteen years; [[Hachiko]], a dog who returned to the place he used to meet his master every day for nine years after his [[death]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AC95cdzhg_4C&amp;pg=PA7 |title= First Friend |author= Katharine Rogers|isbn= 9781450208734 |date= April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Foxie, the [[spaniel]] belonging to [[Charles Gough (artist)|Charles Gough]], who stayed by her dead master's side for three months on [[Helvellyn]] in the [[Lake District]] in 1805 (although it is possible that Foxie had eaten Gough's body).&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first= Jonathan |last= Jones |date= 15 March 2003 |title= The Romantics and the Myth of Charles Gough |url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/mar/15/art.artsfeatures |work= The Guardian |location= London |accessdate= 25 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the righteous King [[Yudhishthira]] appears at the gates of Heaven at the end of his life with a stray dog he had picked up along the way as a companion, having previously lost his brothers and his wife to death.  The god [[Indra]] is prepared to admit him to Heaven, but refuses to admit the dog, so Yudhishthira refuses to abandon the dog, and prepares to turn away from the gates of Heaven.  Then the dog is revealed{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to be the manifestation of [[Dharma]], the god of righteousness and justice, and who turned out to be his deified self.  Yudhishthira enters heaven in the company of his dog, the god of righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;
''[[Mahabharata]]'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17003.htm book 17, ch. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, supra, pp. 684–85
&lt;/ref&gt;
Yudhishthira is known by the [[epithet]] Dharmaputra, the lord of righteous duty.

{{Buddhism}}
'''Mindstream''' (''citta-santāna'') in [[Buddhist philosophy]] is the moment-to-moment continuum (Sanskrit: ''saṃtāna'') of sense impressions and mental phenomena,&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal|author= Karunamuni N.D.|title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind|journal=SAGE Open|volume=5 |issue=2 |date=May 2015 | url= http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf | doi=10.1177/2158244015583860}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also described as continuing from one life to another.&lt;ref&gt;The Noble Eightfold Path: The Way to the End of Suffering by Bhikkhu Bodhi

==Definition==
''{{IAST|Citta-saṃtāna}}'' (Sanskrit), literally "the stream of mind",&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''.  Great Britain, Oxford:  Oxford University Press. P.62.  {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the stream of succeeding moments of mind or awareness. It provides a continuity of the personality in the absence of a permanently abiding "self" ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]), which Buddhism denies. The mindstream provides a continuity from one life to another, akin to the flame of a candle which may be passed from one candle to another:{{sfn|Kyimo|2007|p=118}}{{sfn|Panjvani|2013|p=181}}{{refn|group=note|Compare the analogies in the [[Milinda Panha]]}} 
{{quote|Indian Buddhists see the 'evolution' of mind i[n] terms of the continuity of individual mind-streams from one lifetime to the next, with [[karma]] as the basic causal mechanism whereby transformations are transmitted from one life to the next.&lt;ref name="Waldron, William S. 2007"&gt;Waldron, William S.

According to Waldron, 
{{quote|[T]he mind stream (''santāna'') increases gradually by the mental afflictions (''kleśa'') and by actions (''karma''), and goes again to the next world.

==Etymology==

===Sanskrit===
''Citta'' holds the [[semantic field]] of "that which is conscious", "the act of mental apprehension known as ordinary consciousness", "the conventional and relative mind/heart".&lt;ref name="dharmafellowship.org"&gt;Source: [http://www.dharmafellowship.org/library/essays/buddhist-glossary.htm#santana] (accessed: 13 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Citta'' has two aspects: "...Its two aspects are attending to and collecting of impressions or traces (Sanskrit: ''[[Vasanas|vāsanā]]'') cf. ''[[vijñāna]]''."&lt;ref name="dharmafellowship.org"/&gt; ''{{IAST|Saṃtāna}}'' or ''santāna'' (Sanskrit) holds the semantic field of "eternal", "continuum", "a series of momentary events" or "life-stream".&lt;ref name="dharmafellowship.org"/&gt;

===Tibetan===
''Citta'' is often rendered as ''sems'' in Tibetan and saṃtāna corresponds to ''rgyud'', which holds the [[semantic field]] of "continuum", "stream", and "thread"--{{IAST|Citta-saṃtāna}} is therefore rendered ''sems rgyud.'' ''Rgyud'' is the term that Tibetan translators (Tibetan: ''lotsawa'') employed to render the Sanskrit term "''[[tantra]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexander (2002; 2007). ''Making Sense of Tantra''. Source: [http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/e-books/unpublished_manuscripts/making_sense_tantra/pt1/making_sense_tantra_01.html] (accessed: 13 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thugs-rgyud'' is a synonym for ''sems rgyud''&lt;ref name="Dharma Dictionary"&gt;[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Main_Page Dharma Dictionary] (28 December 2005). Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/thugs_rgyud] (accessed: 17 July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;--''Thugs'' holds the semantic field: "Buddha-mind", "([[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]]) mind", "[[mind]]", "[[soul]]", "[[spirit]]", "purpose", "intention", "unbiased perspective", "spirituality", "responsiveness", "spiritual significance", "awareness", "primordial (state, experience)", "enlightened mind", "heart", "breast", "feelings" and is sometimes a homonym of "citta" (Sanskrit).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Main_Page Dharma Dictionary] (4 October 2006). Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/thugs] (accessed: 17 July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thugs-rgyud'' holds the [[semantic field]] "wisdom", "transmission", "heart-mind continuum", "mind", "[continuum/ stream of mind]" and "nature of mind."

===Chinese, Korean and Japanese===
The Chinese equivalent of Sanskrit ''citta-saṃtāna'' and Tibetan ''sems-kyi rgyud'' ("mindstream") is ''xin xiangxu'' ({{zh|s=心相续|t=心相續|p=''xīn xiāngxù''|w=''hsin hsiang-hsü''}}).  According to the ''[[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]'', ''xīn xiāngxù'' means "continuance of the mental stream" (from Sanskrit ''citta-saṃtāna'' or ''citta-saṃtati''), contrasted with ''wú xiàngxù'' 無相續 "no continuity of the mental stream" (from ''asaṃtāna'' or ''asaṃdhi'') and ''shì xiāngxù'' 識相續 "stream of consciousness" (from ''vijñāna-saṃtāna'').

This compound combines ''xin'' [[Wikt:心|心]] "heart; mind; thought; conscience; core" and ''xiangxu'' "succeed each other", with ''xiang'' [[Wikt:相|相]] "each other; one another; mutual; reciprocal" and ''xu'' [[Wikt:續|續]] or [[Wikt:续|续]] "continue; carry on; succeed". Thus it means "thoughts succeeding each other".

''Xin xiangxu'' is pronounced ''sim sangsok'' in [[Korean language|Korean]] and ''shin sōzoku'' in Japanese.

==Origins and development==

The notion of ''citta-santāna'' developed in later Yogacara-thought, where ''citta-santāna'' replaced the notion of [[ālayavijñāna]],{{sfn|Lusthaus|2014|p=7}} the store-house consciousness in which the karmic seeds were stored. It is not a "permanent, unchanging, transmigrating entity", like the atman, but a series of momentary consciousnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Davids, C.A.F. Rhys (1903). "The Soul-Theory in Buddhism" in ''The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland''. Source: [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/rhy.htm] (accessed: Sunday 1 February 2009), pp. 587-588&lt;/ref&gt;

Lusthaus describes the development and doctrinal relationships of [[ālaya-vijñāna|the store consciousness]] (''ālaya-vijñāna'') and [[tathāgatagarbha|Buddha nature]] (''tathāgatagarbha'') in [[Yogācāra]]. To avoid reification of the ''ālaya-vijñāna'',
{{quote|The logico-epistemological wing in part sidestepped the critique by using the term ''citta-santāna'', "mind-stream", instead of ''ālaya-vijñāna'', for what amounted to roughly the same idea. It was easier to deny that a "stream" represented a reified self.&lt;ref&gt;Lusthaus, Dan (undated). ''What is and isn't Yogācāra.'' Source: {{cite web|url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331102337/http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |archivedate=31 March 2010 |df= }} (accessed: 4 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Dharmakirti|Dharmakīrti]] (fl. 7th century) wrote a treatise on the nature of the mind stream in his ''Substantiation of Other mind streams'' (''Saṃtãnãntarasiddhi'').&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web|url=http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/buddh/bsa059_u.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110082146/http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/buddh/bsa059_u.htm |archivedate=10 November 2010 |df= }} (accessed: Wednesday 28 October 2009). There is an English translation of this work by Gupta (1969: pp.81-121) which is a rendering of [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy|Stcherbatsky]]'s work from the Russian: Gupta, Harish C. (1969). ''Papers of Th. Stcherbatsky''. Calcutta: Indian Studies Past and Present. (translated from Russian by Harish C. Gupta).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dharmakirti the mind stream was beginningless temporal sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, John D. (2004). ''Foundations of Dharmakīrti's philosophy''.

The notion of mind stream was further developed in [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] (tantric Buddhism), where "mind stream" (''sems-rgyud'') may be understood as a stream of succeeding moments,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]] (2002). ''Healing with Form, Energy, and Light''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|1-55939-176-6}}. p.82&lt;/ref&gt; within a lifetime, but also in-between lifetimes. The 14th Dalai Lama holds it to be a continuum of consciousness, extending over succeeding lifetimes, though without a self or soul.&lt;ref&gt;Lama, Dalai (1997).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49305">'''Oppression''' can refer to an authoritarian regime controlling its citizens via state control of politics, the monetary system, media, and the military; denying people any meaningful human or civil rights; and terrorizing the populace through harsh, unjust punishment, and a hidden network of obsequious informants reporting to a vicious secret police force. 

Oppression also refers to a less overtly malicious pattern of subjugation, although in many ways this social oppression represents a particularly insidious and ruthlessly effective form of manipulation and control. In this instance, the subordination and injustices do not afflict everyone—instead it targets specific groups of people for restrictions, ridicule, and marginalization. No universally accepted term has yet emerged to describe this variety of oppression, although some scholars will parse the multiplicity of factors into a handful of categories, e.g., social (or sociocultural) oppression; institutional (or legal) oppression; and [[economic oppression]].

==Authoritarian oppression==
The word ''oppress ''comes from the Latin ''oppressus'', past participle of ''opprimere'', ("to press against",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=oppress|title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|last=|first=|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2016|isbn=9780544454453|edition=5th|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125135556/https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=oppress|archivedate=2017-11-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "to squeeze", "to suffocate").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.kdictionaries-online.com/DictionaryPage.aspx?ApplicationCode=18#&amp;&amp;DictionaryEntry=oppress&amp;SearchMode=Entry|title=Random House Kernerman Webster's College Dictionary|last=|first=|publisher=K Dictionaries Ltd, by arrangement with Random House Information Group, an imprint of The Crown Publishing Group, a division of Random House, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|edition=Revised &amp; Updated|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084452/http://www.kdictionaries-online.com/DictionaryPage.aspx?ApplicationCode=18#&amp;&amp;DictionaryEntry=oppress&amp;SearchMode=Entry|archivedate=2014-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian governments]] use oppression to subjugate the people, they want their citizenry to feel that "pressing down", and to live in fear that if they displease the authorities they will, in a metaphorical sense, be "squeezed" and "suffocated", e.g., thrown in a dank, dark, state prison or summarily executed. Such governments oppress the people using restriction, control, terror, hopelessness, and despair.{{efn|This description of authoritarian governments is somewhat simplistic in that it describes the epitome of authoritarianism, i.e., the worst-case scenario, which still exists in some countries today, but has gradually become less prevalent over the last two centuries or so. See the five books cited at the end of this paragraph for a more nuanced discussion. Also see the Wikipedia article, [[Authoritarianism]].}} The tyrant's tools of oppression include, for example, extremely harsh punishments for "unpatriotic" statements; developing a loyal, guileful [[secret police]] force; prohibiting [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of speech]], and [[freedom of the press]]; controlling the monetary system and economy; and imprisoning or killing activists or other leaders who might pose a threat to their power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Competitive Authoritarianism: Hybrid Regimes after the Cold War|last=Levitsky|first=Steven|last2=Way|first2=Lucan A.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521882521|oclc=968631692|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968631692|location=New York City, NY|pages=5–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967148718|title=Non-democratic politics : authoritarianism, dictatorship, and democratization|last=Xavier|first=Márquez|year=2017|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=1–21; 39–61; 130–141|isbn=9781137486318|location=London|oclc=967148718}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/340983053|title=Democracy and authoritarianism in the post-communist world|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last=Bunce|first=Valerie|last2=McFaul|first2=Michael|last3=Stoner|first3=Kathryn|isbn=9780521115988|location=Cambridge, England (UK)|oclc=340983053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/191465180|title=The Protestant ethic and the spirit of authoritarianism: Puritanism, democracy, and society|last=Zafirovski|first=Milan|date=2007|pages=15–18|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|isbn=9780387493206|location=New York City, NY|oclc=191465180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/607553768|title=The new authoritarianism in the Middle East and North Africa|last=King|first=Stephen J.|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253353979|location=Bloomington, IN|oclc=607553768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socioeconomic, political, legal, cultural, and institutional oppression==
Oppression also refers to a more insidious type of manipulation and control, in this instance involving the subjugation and marginalization of specific groups of people within a country or society, such as: [[Women's rights|girls and women]], [[Misandry|boys and men]], [[Person of color|people of color]], [[Minority religion|religious communities]], [[Poverty|citizens in poverty]], [[LGBT history|LGBT people]], [[youth rights|youth and children]], and many more. This [[Social class|socioeconomic]], cultural, political, legal, and institutional oppression (hereinafter, "social oppression") probably occurs in every country, culture, and society, including the most advanced [[Democracy|democracies]], such as the United States, Japan, Costa Rica, Sweden, and Canada.{{efn|This list of countries is mostly arbitrary, and is meant only to illustrate what is meant by "advanced democracies".}}{{efn|The terms [[Representative democracy|representative democracies]], [[Republic|republics]], or [[Democratic republic|democratic republics]] could also be used instead of [[Democracy|democracies]]. The four Wikipedia articles linked to in the previous sentence discuss the similarities and differences between and amongst the four related terms.}}

A single, widely accepted definition of social oppression does not yet exist, although there are commonalities. Taylor (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Taylor|first=Elanor|year=2016|title=Groups and Oppression|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12252/abstract|journal=Hypatia|volume=31|issue=3|pages=520–536|doi=10.1111/hypa.12252|issn=1527-2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829135247/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12252/abstract|archivedate=2016-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined (social) oppression in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Oppression is a form of injustice that occurs when one social group is subordinated while another is privileged, and oppression is maintained by a variety of different mechanisms including social norms, stereotypes and institutional rules. A key feature of oppression is that it is perpetrated by and affects social groups. ... [Oppression]  occurs when a particular social group is unjustly subordinated, and where that subordination is not necessarily deliberate but instead results from a complex network of social restrictions, ranging from laws and institutions to implicit biases and stereotypes. In such cases, there may be no deliberate attempt to subordinate the relevant group, but the group is nonetheless unjustly subordinated by this network of social constraints.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|pp=520-521}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harvey (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41528208|title=Civilized oppression|first=Jean|last=Harvey|date=1999|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=1–2|isbn=978-0847692743|location=Lanham|oclc=41528208}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested the term "civilized oppression", which he introduced as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is harder still to become aware of what I call 'civilized Oppression,' that involves neither physical violence nor the use of law. Yet these subtle forms are by far the most prevalent in Western industrialized societies. This work will focus on issues that are common to such subtle oppression in several different contexts (such as racism, classism, and sexism) ... Analyzing what is involved in civilized oppression includes analyzing the kinds of mechanisms used, the power relations at work, the systems controlling perceptions and information, the kinds of harms inflicted on the victims, and the reasons why this oppression is so hard to see even by contributing agents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Research and theory development on social oppression has advanced apace since the 1980s with the publication of seminal books and articles,{{efn|see "General references (seminal works)" below.}} and the cross-pollination of ideas and discussion among diverse disciplines, such as: feminism, sociology, psychology, philosophy, and political science. Nonetheless, more fully understanding the problem remains an extremely complicated challenge for scholars. Improved understanding will likely involve, for example, comprehending more completely the historical antecedents of current social oppression; the commonalities (and lack thereof) among the various social groups damaged by social oppression (and the individual human beings who make up those groups); and the complex interplay between and amongst sociocultural, political, economic, psychological, and legal forces that cause and support oppression.

==Social oppression==
Social oppression is when a single group in society takes advantage of, and exercises power over, another group using dominance and subordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Sociology: Oppression, Resistance, and the State|last=Glasberg, Shannon|first=Davita, Deric|publisher=Sage Publication Inc|year=2011|isbn=9781452238081|location=United States of America|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in the socially supported mistreatment and exploitation of a group of individuals by those with relative power.&lt;ref&gt;Van Wormer, K., &amp; Besthorn, F. H. (2010). ''Human behavior and the social environment, macro level: Groups, communities, and organizations''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In a social group setting, oppression may be based on many ideas, such as poverty, gender, class, race, or other categories. Oppression by institution, or systematic oppression, is when the laws of a place create unequal treatment of a specific social identity group or groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Institutionalized Oppression Definitions|last=Cheney|first=Carol|last2=LeFrance|first2=Jeannie|date=2006|website=Act for Action|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Quinteros|first3=Terrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of social oppression is when a specific social group is denied access to education that may hinder their lives in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice and the Politics of Difference|last=Young|first=Iris|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic oppression is the divide between two classes of society. These were once determined by factors such slavery, property rights, disenfranchisement, and forced displacement of livelihood. Each divide yielded various treatments and attitudes towards each group.

Social oppression derives from power dynamics and imbalances related to the social location of a group or individual. [[Social location]], as defined by Lynn Weber, is "an individual's or a group's social 'place' in the race, class, gender and sexuality hierarchies, as well as in other critical social hierarchies such as age, ethnicity, and nation".&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Race, Class, Gender, and Sexuality: A Conceptual Framework|last=Weber|first=Lynn|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-538024-8|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=|oclc=699188746}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} An individual's social location often determines how they will be perceived and treated by others in society. Three elements shape whether a group or individual can exercise power: the power to design or manipulate the rules and regulations, the capacity to win competitions through the exercise of political or economic force, and the ability to write and document social and political history.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, S. J. (Ed.). (2015). ''Race, Gender, Sexuality, and Social Class: Dimensions of Inequality and Identity''. SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;. There are four predominant social hierarchies, race, class, gender and sexuality, that contribute to social oppression.

===Privilege===
Weber,&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt; among some other political theorists, argues that oppression persists because most individuals fail to recognize it; that is, discrimination is often not visible to those who are not in the midst of it. [[Privilege (social inequality)|Privilege]] refers to a sociopolitical immunity one group has over others derived from particular societal benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/privilege|title=Definition of PRIVILEGE|last=|first=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920143749/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/privilege|archive-date=2017-09-20|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the groups who have privilege over gender, race, or sexuality, for example, can be unaware of the power their privilege holds. These inequalities further perpetuate themselves because those who are oppressed rarely have access to resources that would allow them to escape their maltreatment. This can lead to [[internalized oppression]], where subordinate groups essentially give up the fight to get access to equality, and accept their fate as a non-dominant group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Freibach-Heifetz|first1=Dana|last2=Stopler|first2=Gila|date=June 2008|title=On conceptual dichotomies and social oppression|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|volume=34|issue=5|pages=515–35|doi=10.1177/0191453708089197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial oppression===
The first social hierarchy is race or racial oppression, which is defined as: " ... burdening a specific race with unjust or cruel restraints or impositions. Racial oppression may be social, systematic, institutionalized, or internalized. Social forms of racial oppression include exploitation and mistreatment that is socially supported."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/world-view/racial-oppression-bacab47f0ce758d|title=What is Racial Oppression?|last=|first=|date=|website=Reference|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425024203/https://www.reference.com/world-view/racial-oppression-bacab47f0ce758d|archive-date=2017-04-25|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States history consists of five primary forms of racial oppression including genocide and geographical displacement, slavery, second-class citizenship, non-citizen labor, and diffuse racial discrimination.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Blauner, B. (1972). ''Racial oppression in America''. Harpercollins College Div.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first, primary form of racial oppression—[[genocide]] and [[Forced displacement|geographical displacement]]—in the US context refers to [[Western Europe]] and settlers taking over an Indigenous population's land. Many Indigenous people, commonly known today as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], were relocated to [[Indian Reservation]]s or killed during wars fought over the land. The second form of racial oppression, [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], refers to [[Africans]] being taken from their homeland and sold as property to [[white Americans]]. Racial oppression, particularly in the [[Southern United States]], was a significant part of daily life and routine in which African-Americans worked on plantations and did other labor without pay and the freedom to leave their workplace. The third form of racial oppression, [[second-class citizen]]ship, refers to some categories of citizens having fewer rights than others. Second-class citizenship became a pivotal form of racial oppression in the United States following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], as African-Americans who were formerly enslaved continued to be considered unequal to white citizens, and had no voting rights. Moreover, immigrants and foreign workers in the US are also treated like second-class citizens, with fewer rights than people born in the US. The fourth form of racial oppression in American history, non-citizen labor, refers to the linkage of race and legal citizenship status. During the middle of the 19th century, some categories of immigrants, such as Mexicans and Chinese, were sought as physical laborers, but were nonetheless denied legal access to citizenship status. The last form of racial oppression in American history is diffuse discrimination. This form of racial oppression refers to discriminatory actions that are not directly backed by the legal powers of the state, but take place in widespread everyday social interactions. This can include employers not hiring or promoting someone on the basis of race, landlords only renting to people of certain racial groups, salespeople treating customers differently based on race, and racialized groups having access only to impoverished schools. Even after the civil rights legislation abolishing segregation, racial oppression is still a reality in the United States. According to Robert Blauner, author of ''Racial Oppression in America'', "racial groups and racial oppression are central features of the American social dynamic".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
[[File:Crying eye.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Pencil drawing of a crying eye.|"crying eye" (pencil drawing)]]

===Class oppression===
The second social hierarchy, class oppression, sometimes referred to as classism, can be defined as prejudice and discrimination based on social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/classism|title=Definition of CLASSISM|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425024521/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/classism|archivedate=2017-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Class is an unspoken social ranking based on income, wealth, education, status, and power. A class is a large group of people who share similar economic or social positions based on their income, wealth, property ownership, job status, education, skills, and power in the economic and political sphere. The most commonly used class categories include: upper class, middle class, working class, and poor class. A majority of people in the United States self-identify in surveys as middle class, despite vast differences in income and status. Class is also experienced differently depending on race, gender, ethnicity, global location, disability, and more. Class oppression of the poor and working class can lead to deprivation of basic needs and a feeling of inferiority to higher-class people, as well as shame towards one's traditional class, race, gender, or ethnic heritage. In the United States, class has become racialized leaving the greater percentage of people of color living in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.classism.org/about-class/|title=Class Action   » About Class|website=www.classism.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703001452/http://www.classism.org/about-class/|archivedate=2017-07-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since class oppression is universal among the majority class in American society, at times it can seem invisible, however, it is a relevant issue that causes suffering for many.

===Gender oppression===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
The third social hierarchy is gender oppression, which is instituted through gender norms society has adopted. In some cultures today, gender norms suggest that masculinity and femininity are opposite genders, however it is an unequal binary pair, with masculinity being dominant and femininity being subordinate. Gender as such is not natural but socially constructed, and gendered power differences provide social mechanisms that benefit masculinity. "Many have argued that cultural practices concerning gender norms of child care, housework, appearance, and career impose an unfair burden on women and as such are oppressive."{{cn|date=November 2017}} According to feminist Barbara Cattunar, women have always been "subjected to many forms of oppression, backed up by religious texts which insist upon women's inferiority and subjugation".{{cn|date=November 2017}} Femininity has always been looked down upon, perpetuated by socially constructed stereotypes, which has affected women's societal status and opportunity. In current society, sources like the media further impose gendered oppression as they shape societal views. Females in pop-culture are objectified and sexualized, which can be understood as degrading to women by depicting them as sex objects with little regard for their character, political views, cultural contributions, creativity or intellect. Feminism, or struggles for women's cultural, political and economic equality, has challenged gender oppression. Gender oppression also takes place against trans, gender-non-conforming, gender queer, or non-binary individuals who do not identify with binary categories of masculine/feminine or male/female.

===Age oppression===
Young people are a commonly, yet rarely acknowledged, oppressed demographic. Minors are denied many democratic and human [[rights]], including the rights to [[vote]], [[marry]], and give [[sexual consent]]. Society as a whole also tends to [[discrimination|discriminate]] against young people and view them as inferior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1978-00956-000]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality oppression===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
The fourth social hierarchy is sexuality oppression or [[heterosexism]]. Dominant societal views with respect to sexuality, and sex partner selection, have formed a sexuality hierarchy oppressing people who do not conform to [[heteronormativity]]. Heteronormativity is an underlying assumption that everyone in society is heterosexual, and those who are not are treated as different or even abnormal by society, excluded, oppressed, and sometimes subject to violence. Heterosexism also derives from societal views of the nuclear family which is presumed to be heterosexual, and dominated or controlled by the male partner. Social actions by oppressed groups such as [[LGBT]]QI movements have organized to create social change.

=== Religious Persecution ===
[[File:P religion world.svg|thumb|Different types of religious symbols]]
Religious persecution is the systematic mistreatment of an individual because of their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.definitions.net/definition/religious+persecution|title=What does religious persecution mean?|website=www.definitions.net|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Iris Young oppression can be divided into different categories such as powerlessness, exploitation, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice and the Politics of Difference|last=Young|first=Iris|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1990|isbn=0691078327|location=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first category of powerlessness in regards to religious persecution is when a group of people that follow one religion have less power than the dominant religious followers. An example of powerlessness would be during the 17th century when the pilgrims, wanting to escape the [[Church of England]] came to what is now called the [[United States]]. The pilgrims created their own religion of [[Protestantism]], and after doing so they eventually passed laws to keep other religions from prospering.  The Protestants used their power of legislature to oppress the other religions in the United States. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumenfeld|first=Warren|date=|title=Christian Privilege and the Promotion of "Secular" and Not-So "Secular" Mainline Christianity in Public Schooling and in the Larger Society|url=|journal=Equity and Excellence in Education|volume=39|pages=|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second category of oppression: exploitation, has been seen in many different forms around the world when it comes to religion. The definition of exploitation is the action or fact of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/exploitation|title=exploitation {{!}} Definition of exploitation in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example during the [[American Civil War]], white Americans used Chinese immigrants in order to build the [[Transcontinental railroad|transcontinental railroads.]] During this time it was common for the Chinese immigrants to follow the religions of [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Confucianism]], because of this the Chinese were looked at as different and not equal to the white Americans. Due to this view it led them to unequal pay, and many hardships during their time working on the railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscitizenship.info/Chinese-immigration-and-the-Transcontinental-railroad/|title=Chinese immigration and the Transcontinental railroad|website=www.uscitizenship.info|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third category that can be seen in religious persecution is violence. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary violence is "the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy". An example of violence in regards to religious persecution is hate crimes that occur in the United States against Muslims. Sense [[September 11 attacks|September 11th, 2001]] hate crimes against people of the Muslim faith have greatly increased. One incident occurred on August 5th, 2017 when three men bombed a [[Mosque]] because they felt that Muslims "'push their beliefs on everyone else'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/minnesota-mosque-bombing-suspects.html|title=3 Suspects in Bombing of Minnesota Mosque Face Weapons Charges|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This violence happens to not only muslims but other religions as well.

===Domination===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
Addressing social oppression on both a macro and micro level, feminist [[Patricia Hill Collins]] discusses her "[[matrix of domination]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment|last=Collins|first=Patricia Hill|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0-415-92483-2|edition=2nd|location=New York|page=295|oclc=491072106|author-link=Patricia Hill Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix of domination discusses the interrelated nature of four domains of power, including the structural, disciplinary, [[hegemony|hegemonic]], and interpersonal domains. Each of these spheres works to sustain current inequalities that are faced by marginalized, excluded or oppressed groups. The structural, disciplinary and hegemonic domains all operate on a macro level, creating social oppression through macro structures such as education, or the criminal justice system, which play out in the interpersonal sphere of everyday life through micro-oppressions.

[[Standpoint theory]] can help us to understand the interpersonal domain. Standpoint theory deals with an individual's social location in that each person will have a very different perspective based on where they are positioned in society. For instance, a white male living in America will have a very different take on an issue such as abortion than a black female living in Africa. Each will have different knowledge claims and experiences that will have shaped how they perceive abortion. Standpoint theory is often used to expose the powerful social locations of those speaking, to justify claims of knowledge through closer experience of an issue, and to deconstruct the construction of knowledge of oppression by oppressors.

===Institutionalized oppression===
"Institutional Oppression occurs when established laws, customs, and practices systemically reflect and produce inequities based on one's membership in targeted social identity groups. If oppressive consequences accrue to institutional laws, customs, or practices, the institution is oppressive whether or not the individuals maintaining those practices have oppressive intentions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcc.edu/resources/illumination/documents/institutionalized-oppression-definitions.pdf |title=Institutionalized Oppression Definitions |format=PDF |last1=Cheney |first1=Carol |last2=LaFrance |first2=Jeannie |last3=Quinteros |first3=Terrie |date=25 August 2006 |website=The Illumination Project |publisher=Portland Community College |accessdate=2012-08-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907023850/http://www.pcc.edu/resources/illumination/documents/institutionalized-oppression-definitions.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - The Monroe Doctrine, 1823.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting representing the Monroe Doctrine, and a quote about oppression by President Franklin D. Roosevelt|U.S. Capitol - oil painting by Allyn Cox - The Monroe Doctrine (1823), plus a quote from President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1940). (photograph: Architect of the Capitol)]]

Institutionalized oppression allows for government organizations and their employees to systematically favor specific groups of people based upon group identity. Dating back to colonization, the United States implemented the institution of slavery where Africans were brought to the United States to be a source of free labor to expand the cotton and tobacco industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seabrook|first=Renita|last2=Wyatt-Nichol|first2=Heather|date=|title=The Ugly Side of America: Institutional Oppression and Race|url=|journal=Journal of Public Management &amp; Social Policy|volume=23|pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing these systems by the United States government was justified through religious grounding where "servants [were] bought and established as inheritable property".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments freed African Americans, gave them citizenship, and provided them the right to vote, institutions such as some police departments continue to use oppressive systems against minorities. They train their officers to profile individuals based upon their racial heritage, and to exert excessive force to restrain them. [[Racial profiling]] and [[police brutality]] are "employed to control a population thought to be undesirable, undeserving, and under punished by established law".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Above the Law: Police and the Excessive Use of Force|last=Skolnick|first=Jerome H.|last2=Fyfe|first2=James J.|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=|location=New York|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both situations, police officers "rely on legal authority to exonerate their extralegal use of force; both respond to perceived threats and fears aroused by out-groups, especially— but not exclusively— racial minorities".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, "blacks are: approximately four times more likely to be targeted for police use of force than their white counterparts; arrested and convicted for drug-related criminal activities at higher rates than their overall representation in the U.S. population; and are more likely to fear unlawful and harsh treatment by law enforcement officials".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The International Association of Chiefs of Police collected data from police departments between the years 1995 and 2000 and found that 83% of incidents involving use-of-force against subjects of different races than the officer executing it involved a white officer and a black subject.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Institutionalized oppression is not only experienced by people of racial minorities, but can also affect those in the LGBT community. Oppression of the LGBT community in the United States dates back to President Eisenhower's presidency where he passed [[Executive Order 10450]] in April 1953 which permitted non-binary sexual behaviors to be investigated by federal agencies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Law and the Gay Rights Story : The Long Search for Equal Justice in a Divided Democracy|last=Walker|first=Frank|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this order, "More than 800 federal employees resigned or were terminated in the two years following because their files linked them in some way with homosexuality."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Oppression of the LGBT community continues today through some religious systems and their believers' justifications of discrimination based upon their own freedom of religious belief. States such as Arizona and Kansas passed laws in 2014 giving religious-based businesses "the right to refuse service to LGBT customers".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violence against Queer People : Race, Class, Gender, and the Persistence of Anti-LGBT Discrimination|last=Meyer|first=Doug|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (EDNA) offers full protection of LGBT workers from job discrimination; however, the act does not offer protection against religious-based corporations and businesses, ultimately allowing the LGBT community to be discriminated against in environments such as churches and religious-based hospitals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The LGBT community is further oppressed by the United States government with the passage of the [[First Amendment Defense Act]] which states, "Protecting religious freedom from Government intrusion is a Government interest of the highest order."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1598/text|title=S.1598 - First Amendment Defense Act|last=Lee|first=Mike|date=June 2015|website=Congress.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608160625/https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1598/text|archive-date=2017-06-08|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act essentially allows for institutions of any kind—schools, businesses, hospitals—to deny service to people based upon their sexuality because it goes against a religious belief.

===Economic oppression===
The term economic oppression changes in meaning and significance over time, depending on its contextual application. In today's context, economic oppression may take several forms, including, but not limited to: the practice of [[bonded labour]] in some parts of India, [[serfdom]], [[Unfree labour|forced labour]], low wages, denial of [[equal opportunity]], and practicing employment discrimination, and economic discrimination based on sex, nationality, race, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Kirst-Ashman, K. K., &amp; Hull, G. H. (2012). Understanding Generalist Practice. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ann Cudd]] describes the main forces of economic oppression as oppressive economic systems and direct and indirect forces. Even though capitalism and socialism are not inherently oppressive, they "lend themselves to oppression in characteristic ways".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Cudd, Ann E. (2006). Analyzing Oppression. Oxford University Press US. {{ISBN|0-19-518744-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She defines direct forces of economic oppression as "restrictions on opportunities that are applied from the outside on the oppressed, including enslavement, segregation, employment discrimination, group-based harassment, opportunity inequality, [[neocolonialism]], and governmental corruption". This allows for a dominant social group to maintain and maximize its wealth through the intentional exploitation of economically inferior subordinates. With indirect forces (also known as oppression by choice), "the oppressed are co-opted into making individual choices that add to their own oppression". The oppressed are faced with having to decide to go against their social good, and even against their own good. If they choose otherwise, they have to choose against their interests, which may lead to resentment by their group.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

An example of direct forces of economic oppression is [[employment discrimination]] in the form of the [[gender pay gap]]. Restrictions on women's access to and participation in the workforce like the wage gap is an "inequality most identified with industrialized nations with nominal equal opportunity laws; legal and cultural restrictions on access to education and jobs, inequities most identified with developing nations; and unequal access to capital, variable but identified as a difficulty in both industrialized and developing nations".&lt;ref name="Mupepi, Mambo 2016"&gt;Mupepi, Mambo (Ed.). (2016). Effective Talent Management Strategies for Organizational Success. Hershey: Business Science Reference. {{ISBN|1522519610}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the median weekly earnings for women were 82 percent of the median weekly earnings for men in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, The Economics Daily, "Women's median earnings 82 percent of men's in 2016. https://www.bls.gov {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123041856/https://www.bls.gov/ |date=2017-11-23 }} (visited April 21, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue women are prevented from achieving complete gender equality in the workplace because of the "ideal-worker norm," which "defines the committed worker as someone who works full-time and full force for forty years straight," a situation designed for the male sex.&lt;ref name="Mupepi, Mambo 2016"/&gt; 

Women, in contrast, are still expected to fulfill the caretaker role and take time off for domestic needs such as pregnancy and ill family members, preventing them from conforming to the "ideal-worker norm". With the current norm in place, women are forced to juggle full-time jobs and family care at home.&lt;ref&gt;Kinnear, Karen L. (2011). Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook. ABC-Clio. {{ISBN|9781598844252}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe that this difference in wage earnings is likely due to the supply and demand for women in the market because of family obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, Charlotta.  (2010). "Why Is There A Gender Wage Gap According To Occupational Prestige?" Acta Sociologica (Sage Publications, Ltd.) 53.2: 99-117. Academic Search Complete.&lt;/ref&gt; Eber and Weichselbaumer argue that "over time, raw wage differentials worldwide have fallen substantially. Most of this decrease is due to better labor market endowments of females".&lt;ref&gt;Weichselbaumer, D. and Winter-Ebmer, R. (2005). A Meta-Analysis of the International Gender Wage Gap. Journal of Economic Surveys, 19: 479–511. Doi: 10.1111/j.0950-0804.2005.00256.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect economic oppression is exemplified when individuals work abroad to support their families. [[Outsourcing|Outsourced]] employees, working abroad generally little to no bargaining power not only with their employers, but with immigration authorities as well. They could be forced to accept low wages and work in poor living conditions. And by working abroad, an outsourced employee contributes to the economy of a foreign country instead of their own. Veltman and Piper describe the effects of outsourcing on female laborers abroad:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Her work may be oppressive first in respects of being [[Heteronomy|heteronomous]]: she may enter work under conditions of constraint; her work may bear no part of reflectively held life goals; and she may not even have the: freedom of bodily movement at work. Her work may also fail to permit a meaningful measure of economic independence or to help her support herself or her family, which she identifies as the very purpose of her working.&lt;ref&gt;Veltman, A., &amp; Piper, M. (Eds.). (2014). Autonomy, Oppression, and Gender. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By deciding to work abroad, laborers are "reinforcing the forces of economic oppression that presented them with such poor options".&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

===Feminism and Equal Rights===
[[File:No Chains Woman.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=Image of a woman breaking free of chains.|A woman breaking free of chains.]]Although a relatively modern form of resistance, feminism's origins can be traced back to the events leading up to the introduction of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA) in 1923. While the ERA was created to address the need for equal protection under the law between men and women in the workplace, it spurred increased feminism that has come to represent the search for equal opportunity and respect for women in patriarchal societies, across all social, cultural, and political spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5771e8ef-9026-4070-a19b-3afe0237ba52%40sessionmgr120&amp;vid=12&amp;hid=117|title=Equality, Sameness, Difference: Revisiting the Equal Rights Amendment|last=Chávez|first=Karma|last2=Nair|first2=Yasmin|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Conrad|first3=Ryan|author-last##=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations and marches have been a popular medium of support, with the January 21, 2017, [[2017 Women's March|Women's March]]'s replication in major cities across the world drawing tens of thousands of supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/01/21/womens-march-photos/|title=Women's March|last=Nusca|first=Andrew|date=January 21, 2017|work=Fortune|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424085625/http://fortune.com/2017/01/21/womens-march-photos/|archive-date=2017-04-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists' main talking points consist of women's reproductive rights, the closing of the pay gap between men and women, the [[glass ceiling]] and workplace discrimination, and the [[intersectionality]] of feminism with other major issues such as African-American rights, immigration freedoms, and gun violence.

==="Resistance"===
Resistance to oppression has been linked to a moral obligation, an act deemed necessary for the preservation of self and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hay|first=Carol|date=|title=The Obligation to Resist Oppression|url=|journal=Journal of Social Philosophy|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, resistance to oppression has been largely overlooked in terms of the amount of research and number of studies completed on the topic, and therefore, is often largely misinterpreted as "lawlessness, belligerence, envy, or laziness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cudd|first=Ann|date=|title=Strikes, Housework, and the Moral Obligation to Resist|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last two centuries, resistance movements have risen that specifically aim to oppose, analyze, and counter various types of oppression, as well as to increase public awareness and support of groups marginalized and disadvantaged by systematic oppression. Late 20th century resistance movements such as [[liberation theology]] and [[anarchism]] set the stage for mass critiques of, and resistance to, forms of social and institutionalized oppression that have been subtly enforced and reinforced over time. Resistance movements of the 21st century have furthered the missions of activists across the world, and movements such as [[liberalism]], [[Black Lives Matter]] (related: [[Blue Lives Matter]], [[All Lives Matter]]) and [[feminism]] (related: [[Meninism]]) are some of the most prominent examples of resistance to oppression today.

[[Pawnbroking|Pawn shops]] are one of the oldest businesses in [[Hong Kong]] {{When|date=January 2018}} {{Citation needed|reason=This isn't really backed up by anything else in this article|date=January 2018}}. In 2015, there were 205 pawn shops in Hong Kong, with the number increasing slightly over the five previous years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ejinsight.com/20150817-why-hong-kong-pawn-shops-are-far-from-fading/|title=Why Hong Kong pawn shops are far from fading |last1=Tsoi  |first1=Raymond|date=17 August 2015 |website= EJ Insight|publisher= |access-date= 19 June 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and development ==
Pawnbroking sprang up in Hong Kong as it developed into an [[entrepôt]]{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2018}}. Jeun Yun Aat (晉源押) was the first pawn shop in Hong Kong{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2018}}. In 1926, the [[Hong Kong government]] strengthened its regulations on pawn shops and promulgated pawn legislation. Since then, pawnbrokers are required to be licensed establishments.&lt;ref&gt;The Hong Kong &amp; Kowloon Pawnbrokers’ Association Limited. http://www.pawn.com.hk/?mod=site_pawn_assoc_history . Extracted on 04 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations allowed the industry to become more and more popular{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2018}}.

The activities of the pawnbrokers were limited by the Japanese during the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]] in the [[Second World War]]. They flourished again after the war in 1945 as a consequence of post-war inflation and a shortage of resources{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2018}}. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With the support of government, The Hong Kong &amp; Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was set up in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members and combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on [[Hong Kong Island]], particularly [[Central,_Hong_Kong|Central]], and [[Kowloon]]. Because many jewelers and goldsmiths shop are located in Central, the mortgage and loan amount is usually higher.&lt;ref&gt;於彥北. 香港當鋪何以經久不衰："押"字招牌后有乾坤 {{cite web |url=http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116213249/http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Extracted on 3/4 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation Needed|reason=for entire paragraph|date=January 2018}}

In order to prevent the sale of stolen property in pawn shops, Hong Kong law stipulates that pawn shops must check the IDs of would-be clients looking to pawn items. Items are under strict verification and registration. Pawn shops must keep digital records of all exchanges. If any suspicious items are found in the pawn shop, the pawn shop is to immediately notify the police.{{Citation Needed|reason=for entire paragraph|date=January 2018}}

On 12 March 2013, the first "Pawn Shop Stocks", Oi Wah Pawnshop Credit Holdings Limited (01319.HK), was listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]].

== Features of pawn shops ==
[[File:Pawnshop front.jpg|thumb|upright|Dong Zung]]

=== Design ===

==== Dong Zung ====
A dong zung is a large rectangular wooden screen, similar to a pair of doors, located right behind the entrance of the pawn shop. The screen is tall enough to block passersby from seeing inside. Clients can be concealed by the board to avoid embarrassment. 

==== Pawning counter ====

The counter of the pawn shop, which is behind the tall board, is typically higher than the average person. There are window frames in the counter. Clients need to give their mortgaged properties upward to the pawning counter. This design shows the higher status of the pawnbrokers. Prices seem to be lower due to the psychological effect caused by this design{{Citation Needed|reason=Need a source for psychological effect|date=January 2018}}. Another reason for setting a high counter is for security. It is hard for passersby and clients to see the environment and workers inside the pawn shop.

=== Names of pawn shops ===

Pawn shops are a traditional industry in China. The majority of the shops use names including words meaning harmonious (for example 'tung' (同), 'wo' (和)) and/or prosperous (for example 'chang' (昌), 'fat' (發), 'fung' (豐)). The idea behind such a name is an entreaty and hope for having glorious and flourishing business development.&lt;ref&gt;周有泉. 香港人的‘二叔公’- 淺談當鋪 http://www.somanhing.com/ftihk/pdf/assignment/pawnshop.pdf Extracted on 3 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; {{Unreliable source|date=December 2017}}

== Pawning procedure ==
[[File:ZeCauBaan.jpg|thumb|upright|Ze Cau Baan]]
# The customer visits the pawn shop and gives the item to be pawned to the shop assistant.
# The shop assistant will assay the item based on the original price and the current condition of the product.
# If the customer accepts the valuation, the shop assistant will verify the documents that can prove the identity of the customers.
# The pawn ticket and cash will be issued to the customers.
# The customers will count the cash immediately and the process is completed if there is no further problem.&lt;ref&gt;The Hong Kong &amp; Kowloon Pawnbrokers’ Association Limited. http://www.pawn.com.hk/?mod=site_pawn_assoc_procedure Extracted on 3 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special terms in pawning ==
* Ceot Zat (出質): Clients offering up items to be pawned.
* Ji Suk Gung/Ciu Fung (二叔公/朝奉): A worker who identifies and appraises the pawned goods.
* Maa Zi (碼子): The number sheet used to track exchanges.
* Zaap Gaa (雜架): Clocks, antiques, etc.
* Jyut Lik (月曆): The lunar calendar. Since months for the lunar calendar are one to two days shorter than the solar calendar, if pawnee repays the loan one day later than the deadline, they need to pay interests for one additional month.
* Lau Dong Ban (流當品): The deadline for repaying loans and getting back the pawned item(s) ends.
* Leoi Gung Gwang (雷公轟): The mortgage interest is as terrible as the rumblings of thunder.
* Ze Cau Baan (遮羞板): A big shield standing in front of the main gate. It is used to hide the situation inside the store.
* Gau Ceot Sap Saam Gwai (九出十三歸): The method pawn shops uses to calculate interest. For instance, when the pawn is worth about 10 dollars, only nine dollars will be lent and in the end thirteen dollars will be needed to repay to loan.&lt;ref&gt;Macau General Chamber of Pawnbrokers. http://www.macaupawnbrokers.com/list.asp?id=328 Extracted on 3 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''perceptual paradox''' illustrates the failure of a theoretical prediction.  [[Theory|Theories]] of [[perception]] are supposed to help a researcher predict what will be perceived when [[sense]]s are stimulated.

A theory usually comprises a [[mathematical model]] (formula),
rules for collecting physical measurements for input into the model,
and rules for collecting physical measurements to which model outputs should map.  When arbitrarily choosing valid input data, the model should reliably generate output data that is indistinguishable from that which is measured in the system being modeled.

Although each theory may be useful for some limited predictions,
theories of vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste are not typically
reliable for comprehensive modeling of perception based on sensory inputs.  A paradox illustrates where a theoretical prediction fails.
Sometimes, even in the absence of a predictive theory,
the characteristics of perception seem nonsensical.

This page lists some paradoxes and seemingly impossible properties of perception.  When an animal is not named in connection with the discussion, human perception should be assumed since
the majority of perceptual research data applies to humans.

== Terminology ==

;&lt;math&gt;SUN_{white}&lt;/math&gt; light: Normal white sunlight is black-body radiation containing a broad and largely featureless spectrum covering the entire range of human vision.
;&lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; light: Televisions and computer screens ''fool'' the eye by generating photons of three narrow wavelength bands where the proportion of photons from industry standard (but improperly named) [[RGB color model|R ''(red)'', G ''(green)'', and B ''(blue)'']] sources is known to be perceived as white.

== Definition ==

A [[Perception|perceptual]] [[paradox]], in its purest form is a statement
illustrating the failure of a formula to predict
what we perceive from what our [[sense]]s [[Transducer|transduce]].

{| border="1"
|Example: standard [[information theory]] limits [[spatial frequency]] based [[Hyperacuity (scientific term)|hyperacuity]] to a factor of approximately 4 over the spatial frequency of [[photoreceptor cell]]s.  Yet, reliable scientific journals have published reports of hyperacuity in excess of a factor of 10.
|}

A seemingly nonsensical characteristic is a statement of factual observation
that is sufficiently intractable that no theory has been proposed to account for it.

{| border="1"
|Example: the [[optical path]] in an eye, from the [[cornea]] to the photoreceptors, goes through a non-spherical cornea and lens that refract and non-circular apertures that diffract such that, in a normal eye, the image on the retina for a point-source is an irregular color-fringed, color-eccentric coaxial bullseye-like pattern with many pathological properties, with the central bright feature covering many photoreceptors.&lt;ref name=Roorda&gt;Roorda, A. “A Review of Optics” chapter 2 in Wavefront Customized Visual Correction: The Quest for SuperVision  II. (Macrae, S.M., Krueger, R.R., Applegate, R.A., ed). Slack Inc. Thorofare, NJ (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, the point-source is perceived clearly, and can be discriminated from other such points as little distance away as 1/10 the visual angle of a photoreceptor.  According to Roorda, in a "perfect" eye, a foveal cone subtends 30 arcseconds, and the diameter of the central "Airy" disk varies between 10 cones (1mm pupil used for reading) to about 1.5 cones (8mm pupil used during fight/flight response).
|}

== Mathematical modeling ==

One branch of research into [[perception]] attempts to explain
what we perceive by applying formulae to [[Sense|sensory]] inputs
and expecting outputs similar to that which we perceive.
For example: what we measure with our eyes should be predicted
by applying formulae to what we measure with instruments that imitate our eye.

Past researchers have made formulae that predict
some, but not all, perceptual phenomena from their sensory origins.
Modern researchers continue to make formulae to overcome
the shortcomings of earlier formulae.

Some formulae are carefully constructed to mimic
actual structures and functions of sensory mechanisms.
Other formulae are constructed by great leaps of faith
about similarity in mathematical curves.

No perceptual formulae have been raised to the status of "natural law"
in the way that the laws of gravitation and electrical attraction have.
So, perceptual formulae continue to be an active area of development
as scientists strive towards the great insight required of a law.

== History ==

Some [[Nobel laureate]]s have paved the way with clear statements of good practice:

wrote that "Practitioners will only be able to claim that a valid explanation of a [[Histology|histological observation]] has been provided if three questions can be answered satisfactorily: what is the functional role of the arrangement in the animal; what mechanisms underlie this function; and what sequence of chemical and mechanical events during [[evolution]] and development gave rise to these mechanisms?"

[[Allvar Gullstrand]] described the problems that arise
when approaching the optics of the eye as if they were as predictable as camera optics.

[[Charles Scott Sherrington]], considered the brain to be
the "crowning achievement of the reflex system",
(which can be interpreted as opening all aspects of perception to simple formulae
expressed over complex distributions).

'''Contrast Invariance'''&lt;br /&gt;
Boundaries between brighter and darker areas
appear to remain of constant relative contrast
when the ratio of logarithms of the two intensities
remains constant:

 &lt;math&gt;Contrast \propto \frac{log I_a}{log I_b}&lt;/math&gt;

But the use of logarithms is forbidden
for values that can become zero such as &lt;math&gt;I_a\,&lt;/math&gt;,
and division is forbidden
by values that can become zero such as &lt;math&gt;log I_b\,&lt;/math&gt;.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception
of contrast invariance.

'''10 Decade Transduction'''

'''Local Contrast'''

'''Color Constancy'''&lt;br /&gt;
When observing objects in a scene, colors appears constant.
An apple looks red regardless of where it is viewed.
In bright direct sunshine, under a blue sky with the sun obscured,
during a colorful sunset, under a canopy of green leaves,
and even under most man-made light sources,
the color of the apple remains unchanging.

Color perception appears to be independent of light wavelength.
[[Edwin Land]] demonstrated this by illuminating a room with
two wavelengths of light of approximately 500&amp;nbsp;nm and 520&amp;nbsp;nm
(both improperly called "green").
The room was perceived in full color,
with all colors appearing unattenuated,
like red, orange, yellow, blue, and purple,
despite the absence of photons other than two close to 510&amp;nbsp;nm.
Note that &lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; light misuses the terminology RGB
since color is a perception and
there are no such things as ''Red'', ''Green'', or ''Blue'' photons.

[[Jerome Lettvin]] wrote an article in the Scientific American
&lt;ref name="Lettvin"&gt;1986 The colors of things, Scientific American, Vol.255.3, pp. 84-91; (with Brou, Philippe, Sciascia, and Linden)&lt;/ref&gt;
illustrating the importance of boundaries and vertices
in the perception of color.

Yet, no published formula predicts the perceived color of objects
in a single image of arbitrary scene illumination.

'''Transverse Chromatic Deaberration'''&lt;br /&gt;
Light that goes through a simple lens such as found in an eye
undergoes refraction, splitting colors.
An &lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; point-source that is off-center to the eye
projects to a pattern where with color separation along a line radial to
the central axis of the eye.
The color separation can be many photoreceptors wide.

Yet, an &lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; pixel on a television or computer screen appears white
even when seen sidelong.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of
the eccentric white pixel.

'''Longitudinal Chromatic Deaberration'''&lt;br /&gt;
As in Transverse Chromatic Deaberration,
color splitting projects also projects the R, G, and B components
of the &lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; pixel to different focal lengths,
resulting in a bulls-eye-like color distribution of light
even at the center of vision.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of
the centered white pixel.

'''Spherical Deaberration'''&lt;br /&gt;
Eyes have corneas and lenses that are imperfectly spherical.
This inhomogeneous shape results in a non-circular distribution of photons on the retina.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of
the non-circularly distributed white pixel.

'''Hyperacuity'''&lt;br /&gt;
People report discrimination much finer than can be predicted
by interpolating sense data between photosensors.
High performing hyperacute vision in some people
has been measured to less than a tenth the radius of a single photoreceptor.
Among measures of hyperacuity are the vernier discrimination of two adjacent lines
and the discrimination of two stars in a night sky.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the discrimination of
the two white pixels closer together than a single photoreceptor.

'''Pupil Size Inversion'''&lt;br /&gt;
When pupils are narrowed to around 1mm for reading fine print,
the size of the central "Airy" disk increases to a diameter of 10 photoreceptors.
The so-called "blur" is increased for reading.
When pupils are widened for fight/flight response,
the size of the central "Airy" disk decreases to a diameter of about 1.5 photoreceptors.
The so-called "blur" is decreased in anticipation of large movements.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts that discrimination
improves when pupils are narrowed.

'''Pupil Shape Inversion'''&lt;br /&gt;
Eyes have pupils (apertures) that cause diffraction.
A point-source of light is distributed on the retina.
The distribution for a perfectly circular aperture
is known by the name "Airy rings".

Human pupils are rarely perfectly circular.
Cat pupils range from almost circular to a vertical slit.
Goat pupils tend to be horizontal rectangular with rounded corners.
Gecko pupils range from circular, to a slit, to a series of pinholes.
Cuttlefish pupils have complex shapes.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of
the various pupil shape distributed white pixel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8169">'''Placebo studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] academic discipline concerning the study of the [[placebo effect]]. The [[placebo effect]] is commonly characterized when patients are given a [[placebo]] or "fake" treatment and then exhibit  perceived improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson JJ, Ritenbaugh C, Nichter M | title = Reconsidering the placebo response from a broad anthropological perspectives | journal = Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 112–52 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19107582 | pmc = 2730465 | doi = 10.1007/s11013-008-9122-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This discipline was pioneered by [[Ted Kaptchuk]] and colleagues at the [[Program in Placebo Studies]] at [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]] and the [[Harvard Medical School]]. It has been found through clinical [[placebo]] studies that the [[placebo]] effect in fact plays a significant role; one specific case being the clinical trials of [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD).&lt;ref name=brunoni&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunoni AR, Lopes M, Kaptchuk TJ, Fregni F | title = Placebo response of non-pharmacological and pharmacological trials in major depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = PLOS One | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = e4824 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19293925 | pmc = 2653635 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004824 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside major depressive disorder, these placebo experiments have been noted in studies of migranes, irritable bowl syndrome, and even Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Luo|first=Yan|title=Mobile P 2P Databases|date=2017|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17885-1_795|work=Encyclopedia of GIS|pages=1267–1274|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319178844|access-date=2018-11-23|last2=Wolfson|first2=Ouri}}&lt;/ref&gt; A treatment cannot be proven effective unless it has been properly conducted and investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=21849|title=Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study {{!}} Winchester Hospital|website=www.winchesterhospital.org|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Until 1955, a [[placebo]] treatment was considered a fraudulent substance administered to appease difficult patients.&lt;ref name=kaptchuk&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaptchuk TJ, Kelley JM, Deykin A, Wayne PM, Lasagna LC, Epstein IO, Kirsch I, Wechsler ME | title = Do "placebo responders" exist? | journal = Contemporary Clinical Trials | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 587–95 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18378192 | doi = 10.1016/j.cct.2008.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the defintion for Placeo has changed its connotation over the years, idealy it has come to mean the false effects are belived to be true by one's expectations. Although, it is a false substance used to satisfy one's ilness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=47b60c2f-3a13-45e2-82eb-fb70092f29f2@sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=89408012&amp;db=ers|title=Login - Sam Houston State University|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, the rise of the placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT), it became widely known throughout the academic community that [[placebo]] effects could in fact result in clinical changes and results.&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt; However, the ability to distinguish the efficacious ability of placebos over a period of time as well as those who are coined responders has proven difficult for scientists.&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt;

== Double-blind ==
A [[Double-blind placebo-controlled trial|double-blind placebo]] is called so when neither the researcher nor the patients know who was given which form of treatment.  This is the most used form of the placebo methods. It differs from a single controled [[placebo]], in that the researchers actually know what patients are given which form of therapy.&lt;ref name="Moher-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, Gøtzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, Elbourne D, Egger M, Altman DG | title = CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials | journal = [[Br Med J]] | volume = 340 | pages = c869 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c869 | pmid = 20332511 | pmc = 2844943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The need in this kind of study is to cancel out the power of suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=21849|title=Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study {{!}} Winchester Hospital|website=www.winchesterhospital.org|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Controlled studies ==
Although the double-blind placebo method is the most common, controlled [[placebo]] expierements require a different understanding. A placebo is given to one group of patients, while the treatment being tested is given to another group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/hormone_therapy/article.htm#hormone_therapy_facts|title=Hormone Therapy for Women: Side Effects, Cancer Risks|work=MedicineNet|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the control is in the hands of people conducting the expierements. 

== Initial clinical experiments ==
In 1954, at [[Harvard Medical School]] a team led by [[Louis Lasagna]] lead the first known experiment to detect [[placebo]] responders.&lt;ref name=lasagna&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lasagna L, Mosteller F, Von Felsinger JM, Beecher HK | title = A study of the placebo response | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 770–9 | date = June 1954 | pmid = 13158365 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(54)90441-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment approximately 162 postoperative patients were observed for significant pain relief from subcutaneous injections of [[placebo]] and morphine.&lt;ref name="lasagna"/&gt; Differences in response and attitude were exhibited between [[placebo]] respondents and non-placebo respondents.&lt;ref name="lasagna" /&gt; "Using Rorschach tests and qualitative interviews, respondents, compared to non-respondents, were more anxious, self-centered, viewed the hospital care as 'wonderful', had more somatic symptoms, used more cathartics, were 'talkers and were  regular church goers.".&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt; Overall, this initial study on placebo responders versus non-responders outlined the initial yet undiscovered effects of the placebo within the placebo study.

In 1957, a team led by Wolf at [[Cornell University Medical School]] conducted an experiment to determine the reliability of the placebo response within the placebo study.&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolf S, Doering CR, Clark ML, Hagans JA | title = Chance distribution and placebo reactor | journal = The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 837–41 | date = June 1957 | pmid = 13429202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The conclusion produced the answer to be "the likelihood of predicting placebo responses was not enhanced by increasing the number of placebo tests performed on any individual."&lt;ref name="wolf" /&gt;

A study on double blind [[placebo]] effects from omega 3 fatty acids and their persistant climb was done in 2006. This study concluded that although the results were "too premature to evaluate," they  showed there was a relationship between the efficacy of the antidepressant placebos and the intake of omega threes PUFAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Pao-Yen|last2=Su|first2=Kuan-Pin|date=2007-07-15|title=A Meta-Analytic Review of Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressant Efficacy of Omega-3 Fatty Acids|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v68n0712|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=68|issue=07|pages=1056–1061|doi=10.4088/jcp.v68n0712|issn=0160-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even your daily diet can trigger aspired results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1337">The '''Plebanski tensor''' is a [[tensor order|order 4 tensor]] in [[general relativity]] constructed from the [[trace-free Ricci tensor]].  It was first defined by [[Jerzy Plebański]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=J.|last1=Plebański|title=The Algebraic structure of the Tensor of Matter|journal=Acta Phys. Pol.|volume=26|page=963|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;S_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; be the trace-free Ricci tensor:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{ab}=R_{ab}-\frac{1}{4}Rg_{ab}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the Plebanski tensor is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;P^{ab}{}_{cd}=S^{[a}{}_{[c}S^{b]}{}_{d]}+\delta^{[a}{}_{[c}S^{b]e}S_{d]e}-\frac{1}{6}\delta^{[a}{}_{[c}\delta^{b]}{}_{d]}S^{ef}S_{ef}.&lt;/math&gt;

The advantage of the Plebanski tensor is that it shares the same symmetries as the [[Weyl tensor]].  It therefore becomes possible to classify different [[spacetime]]s based on additional algebraic symmetries of the Plebanski tensor in a manner analogous to the [[Petrov classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17755">A '''private currency''' is a [[currency]] issued by a private entity, be it an individual, a commercial business, a nonprofit or [[decentralization|decentralized]] common enterprise. It is often contrasted with [[fiat currency]] issued by [[Forms of government|governments]] or [[central bank]]s. In many countries, the issuance of private paper currencies and new [[cryptocurrency]] is severely restricted by law, while the minting of metal coins intended to be used as currency may even be a criminal act such as in the USA (18 U.S. Code § 486).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18 U.S. Code § 486 - Uttering coins of gold, silver or other metal|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/486|accessdate=7 July 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are over four thousand privately issued currencies in more than 35 countries. These include commercial [[Barter#Trade exchanges|trade exchanges]] that use barter credits as units of exchange, private gold and silver exchanges, local paper money, computerized systems of credits and debits, and [[digital currencies]] in circulation, such as [[digital gold currency]].

== Private bank notes ==
[[File:Delaware Bridge Company Dollar.jpg|thumb|right|A private $1 note, issued by the "Delaware Bridge Company" of [[New Jersey]] 1836–1841]]

In the [[United States]], the [[History of banking in the United States#1837%E2%80%931863:_%22Free_Banking%22_Era|Free Banking Era]] lasted between 1837 and 1866, when almost anyone could issue paper money. States, municipalities, [[private bank]]s, railroad and construction companies, stores, restaurants, churches and individuals printed an estimated 8,000 different types of money by 1860. If an issuer went bankrupt, closed, left town, or otherwise went out of business, the note would be worthless. Such organizations earned the nickname of "wildcat banks" for a reputation of unreliability; they were often situated in remote, unpopulated locales said to be inhabited more by wildcats than by people. The [[National Bank Act of 1863]] ended the "wildcat bank" period. See also: [[Free banking#History of free banking|History of free banking]].

[[File:The City Bank Of Sydney 20 pound note.jpg|thumb|right|Private currency issued in Australia by The City Bank of Sydney circa 1900]]
In [[Australia]], the [[Bank Notes Tax Act 1910]] effectively shut down the circulation of private currencies by imposing a prohibitive tax on the practice. The Act was repealed by the ''Commonwealth Bank Act'' 1945, which imposed a fine for private currencies.

Now, s. 44(1) of the Australian ''Reserve Bank Act 1959'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|rba1959130|Reserve Bank Act 1959|44}} Other persons not to issue notes.&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits this practice. In 1976, [[Wickrema Weerasooria]] published an article which suggested that the issuing of [[bank cheque]]s violated this section, though some banks responded that since bank cheques were printed with the words "not negotiable" on them, the cheques were not intended for circulation and thus did not violate the statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weerasooria |first=Wickrema  |title=The Australian Bank Cheque - Some Legal Aspects |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MonashULawRw/1976/3.pdf}} (1976) 2(2) Monash University Law Review 180. {{issn|0311-3140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hong Kong]], although the government issues currency, bank-issued private currency is the dominant medium of exchange. Most [[automated teller machine]]s dispense private [[Banknotes of the Hong Kong dollar|Hong Kong bank notes]].&lt;ref&gt;International Bank Note Society.

In [[Scotland]], the [[Bank of Scotland]], [[Clydesdale Bank]], and the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], and in [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Bank of Ireland]], [[Danske Bank]], [[First Trust Bank]], and [[Ulster Bank]], are authorised by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to issue [[Pound sterling]] bank notes. They are subject to [[central bank]] (the [[Bank of England]]) regulations concerning "ring-fenced backing assets" and are backed in part by deposits at the Bank of England. They are exchangeable with other pound notes on a one-to-one basis, and circulate freely within the United Kingdom, though not legal tender, not even in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In fact, technically, no banknote (including Bank of England notes) qualifies as legal tender in Scotland or Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acbi.org.uk/media/sni_notes_factsheet_nov12_copy1.pdf|author=The Association of Commercial Banknote Issuers|title=Scottish and Northern Ireland Banknotes Fact Sheet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991, residents of and around the city of [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] in Western New York State have been using a private currency in which participating workers either earn or purchase [[Ithaca Hours]], which may be used to buy goods and services locally. The system has been ruled legal provided all Hours-derived revenues are reported to the IRS as income{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}.

[[BerkShares]] is a local currency that circulates in [[The Berkshires]] region of [[Massachusetts]]. It was launched on September 29, 2006 by BerkShares Inc., with research and development assistance from the [[E. F. Schumacher Society]]. The BerkShares website lists over 370 businesses in Berkshire County that accept the currency. In 30 months, 2.2 million BerkShares have been issued from 12 branch offices of five local banks.--&gt;

[[England]] has had the [[Totnes pound]] since it was launched by [[Transition Towns]] Totnes Economics and Livelihoods Group in March 2007; A Totnes Pound is equal to one pound sterling and is backed by sterling held in a bank account.

Since starting in 2006, the "City Initiative [[Karlsruhe]]" has issued the ''Karlsruher'' which has no nominal value. Every coin has the value of 50 Eurocents and is primarily used in parking garages.
As of 2009, 120 companies in Karlsruhe accept the ''Karlsruher'' and usually grant a discount when paid with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karlsruhe (bonus system)|url=http://ka.stadtwiki.net/Karlsruher_%28Bonussystem%29|accessdate=15 April 2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], numerous complementary currencies are in use, such as the [[Calgary Dollar]] and [[Toronto dollar]].  However private currencies in Canada cannot be referred to as being legal tender and many private currencies (as well as loyalty programs) avoid the word "dollar", using names like "coupons" or "bucks", to avoid confusion. Examples include: [[Canadian Tire money]] and [[Pioneer Energy#Bonus Bucks|Pioneer Energy's Bonus Bucks]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Customer reward and [[loyalty program]]s operated by businesses are sometimes counted as private currencies. However, though "points" or "[[frequent flyer program|miles]]" may be exchangeable for merchandise or travel from the program sponsor, most of them lack the key element for currency of being a medium of exchange transferable to other individuals and usable as payment for items from other vendors. A few programs do have "partnerships" allowing this to some extent, and permit the transfer of points or miles. Some startups, such as the Canadian website Points.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://points.com|title=Points.com|website="points.com"}}&lt;/ref&gt; have sought to make loyalty "points" more currency-like by creating an exchange where points from one loyalty program can be traded for points in other such programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2369584,00.asp|title=Points.com establishes currency exchange for loyalty programs|website=www.pcmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cryptocurrencies and digital currencies ==
A [[cryptocurrency]] is a form of [[digital currency|digital]] or [[virtual currency]] where [[cryptography]] secures the transactions and  controls the creation of additional units of the currency.&lt;ref name="crypto currency"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0509/technology-psilocybin-bitcoins-gavin-andresen-crypto-currency.html |title=Crypto Currency |author=Andy Greenberg|publisher=Forbes.com |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] can be used to store the public and private keys which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency.

== Private currency crimes ==

As national currencies can be [[counterfeit]]ed, so too can private currencies, and private currencies are subject to other criminal issues, including [[fraud]].

The [[Liberty dollar (private currency)|Liberty Dollar]] was a commodity-backed private currency created by [[Bernard von NotHaus]] and issued between 1998 and 2009. In 2011, von NotHaus was arrested and subsequently convicted on charges of [[money laundering]], [[mail fraud]], [[wire fraud]], [[counterfeiting]], and [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Defendant Convicted of Minting His Own Currency |publisher=[[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney's Office]] |date=March 18, 2011 |location=[[United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina]] |url=https://www.fbi.gov/charlotte/press-releases/2011/defendant-convicted-of-minting-his-own-currency |archivedate=December 17, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CygqRiVv?url=http://www.fbi.gov/charlotte/press-releases/2011/defendant-convicted-of-minting-his-own-currency |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Lovett |title=Local Liberty Dollar 'Architect' Bernard von NotHaus convicted |date=March 19, 2011 |publisher=Evansville Courier &amp; Press |url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2011/mar/19/local-liberty-dollar-architect-found-guilty/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges stemmed from the government view that the Liberty silver coins too closely resembled official coinage.

In 2007, Angel Cruz, founder of The United Cities Corporation (TUC), announced he was establishing an alternative "asset based" currency named "United States Private Dollars".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/8/25/93036/7434/248/376052 "Florida man launches 'United States Private Dollar'"], ''[[Daily Kos]]'', August 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Cruz claimed United States Private Dollars were "backed by the total net worth of the assets of its members" and had printed six billion dollars' worth of the private currency,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080112204706/http://www.theunitedcities.org/web/content/view/15/14/ "TUC Currencies", United Cities website], via [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; The backing assets were claimed to be valued at 357 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openpr.com/news/25136/TUC-IMPROVING-THE-US-ECONOMY-BY-THE-CIRCULATION-OF-THEIR-PRIVATE-CURRENCY-TODAY.html "TUC Improving the US Economy by the Circulation of Their Private Currency Today", OpenPR.com] August 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The currency featured the slogan "In Jehovah We Trust".&lt;ref name="articles.orlandosentinel.com"&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2007-08-25/news/MONEYSCAM25_1_kissimmee-nonprofit-united-cities "Kissimmee nonprofit 'concerned' over checks"], ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Comptroller of the Currency]] issued an alert warning banks that checks issued by TUC were "valueless instruments" and should not be cashed.&lt;ref name="articles.orlandosentinel.com"/&gt; In 2008, Cruz was indicted by a Federal grand jury in Florida on one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States under {{usc|18|1344}} and {{usc|18|371}} and six counts of bank fraud under {{usc|18|1344}} and {{usc|18|2}} in connection with his dealings with Bank of America, while attempting to get United Cities bank drafts cashed.&lt;ref&gt;Indictment, ''United States v.

[[File:Sieve of Eratosthenes animation.gif|right|frame|Sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm steps for primes below 121 (including optimization of starting from prime's square).]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''[[Sieve theory|sieve]] of Eratosthenes''' is a simple, ancient [[algorithm]] for finding all [[prime number]]s up to any given limit.

It does so by iteratively marking as [[composite number|composite]] (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number, {{math|2}}. The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from that prime, with [[arithmetic progression|constant difference between them]] that is equal to that prime.&lt;ref name="horsley"&gt;Horsley, Rev. Samuel, F. R. S., "''{{lang|el|Κόσκινον Ερατοσθένους}}'' or, The Sieve of Eratosthenes. Being an account of his method of finding all the Prime Numbers," [https://www.jstor.org/stable/106053 ''Philosophical Transactions'' (1683–1775), Vol. 62. (1772), pp. 327–347].&lt;/ref&gt; This is the sieve's key distinction from using [[trial division]] to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime.&lt;ref name="ONeill" /&gt;

The earliest known reference to the sieve ({{lang-grc|κόσκινον Ἐρατοσθένους}}, ''kóskinon Eratosthénous'') is in [[Nicomachus|Nicomachus of Gerasa]]'s ''[[Introduction to Arithmetic]]'',&lt;ref name=nicomachus&gt;{{citation|editor-first=Richard|editor-last=Hoche|editor-link=Richard Hoche|title=Nicomachi Geraseni Pythagorei Introductionis arithmeticae libri II|year=1866|location= Leipzig|publisher= B.G. Teubner|page=31|url=https://archive.org/stream/nicomachigerasen00nicouoft#page/30/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes it and attributes it to [[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene]], a [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]].

One of a number of [[Generating primes#Prime sieves|prime number sieve]]s, it is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes. It may be used to find primes in [[arithmetic progression]]s.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Morehead, "Extension of the Sieve of Eratosthenes to arithmetical progressions and applications", [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1967477 Annals of Mathematics, Second Series '''10''':2 (1909), pp. 88–104].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{quote box|fontsize = 105%|''Sift the Two's and Sift the Three's,''&lt;br /&gt;''The Sieve of Eratosthenes.''&lt;br /&gt;''When the multiples sublime,''&lt;br /&gt;''The numbers that remain are Prime.''|quoted=1|salign=center|source=Anonymous&lt;ref&gt;Clocksin, William F., Christopher S. Mellish, Programming in Prolog, 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;170. {{isbn|3-540-11046-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A [[prime number]] is a [[natural number]] that has exactly two distinct natural number [[divisor]]s: [[1 (number)|1]] and itself.

To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer {{mvar|n}} by Eratosthenes' method:

# Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through {{mvar|n}}: {{math|(2, 3, 4, ..., ''n'')}}.
# Initially, let {{mvar|p}} equal 2, the smallest prime number.
# Enumerate the multiples of {{mvar|p}} by counting in increments of {{mvar|p}} from {{math|2''p''}} to {{mvar|n}}, and mark them in the list (these will be {{math|2''p'', 3''p'', 4''p'', ...}}; the {{mvar|p}} itself should not be marked). 
# Find the first number greater than {{mvar|p}} in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let {{mvar|p}} now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
# When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below {{mvar|n}}.

The main idea here is that every value given to {{mvar|p}} will be prime, because if it were composite it would be marked as a multiple of some other, smaller prime. Note that some of the numbers may be marked more than once (e.g., 15 will be marked both for 3 and 5).

As a refinement, it is sufficient to mark the numbers in step 3 starting from {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, as all the smaller multiples of {{mvar|p}} will have already been marked at that point. This means that the algorithm is allowed to terminate in step 4 when {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is greater than {{mvar|n}}.&lt;ref name="horsley" /&gt; &lt;!-- This does not appear in the algorithm as described by Nicomachus.&lt;ref&gt;Nicomachus, ibid., p.&amp;nbsp;31, where, e.g., 93 is marked as a multiple of 31.&lt;/ref&gt; ---- The above is based on wrong reading of the table in Nicomachus p.&amp;nbsp;31: main factors actually appear in upper row in cells, and their corresponding coefficients in the bottom row; 5 first appears in bottom row for 15 but in top row for 25, and 7 for 49. For 93, 31 is marked in bottom row, below 3. (He also marks 81 as 9*9 and 3*27, so wasn't working with only prime factors, but that's besides the point here.) What the text is saying in Latin or Greek, I have no idea. --&gt;

Another refinement is to initially list odd numbers only, {{math|(3, 5, ..., ''n'')}}, and count in increments of {{math|2''p''}} from {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} in step 3, thus marking only odd multiples of {{mvar|p}}. This actually appears in the original algorithm.&lt;ref name="horsley" /&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;Nicomachus, ibid., p.&amp;nbsp;31, where only odd numbers appear in the table.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the table is not by Nicomachus; it is in the margins, and in Latin. --&gt; This can be generalized with [[wheel factorization]], forming the initial list only from numbers [[coprime]] with the first few primes and not just from odds (i.e., numbers coprime with 2), and counting in the correspondingly adjusted increments so that only such multiples of {{mvar|p}} are generated that are coprime with those small primes, in the first place.&lt;ref name="Runciman"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0956796897002670| title = Functional Pearl: Lazy wheel sieves and spirals of primes| journal = J.

===Example===
To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to 30, proceed as follows.

First, generate a list of integers from 2 to 30:

 &amp;nbsp;2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

The first number in the list is 2; cross out every 2nd number in the list after 2 by counting up from 2 in increments of 2 (these will be all the multiples of 2 in the list):

 &amp;nbsp;2  3 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 4 &lt;/s&gt;}} 5 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 6 &lt;/s&gt;}} 7 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 8 &lt;/s&gt;}} 9  {{gray|&lt;s&gt;10&lt;/s&gt;}} 11 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;12&lt;/s&gt;}} 13 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;14&lt;/s&gt;}} 15 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;16&lt;/s&gt;}} 17 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;18&lt;/s&gt;}} 19 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;20&lt;/s&gt;}} 21 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;22&lt;/s&gt;}} 23 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;24&lt;/s&gt;}} 25 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;26&lt;/s&gt;}} 27 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;28&lt;/s&gt;}} 29 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;30&lt;/s&gt;}}

The next number in the list after 2 is 3; cross out every 3rd number in the list after 3 by counting up from 3 in increments of 3 (these will be all the multiples of 3 in the list):

 &amp;nbsp;2  3 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 4 &lt;/s&gt;}} 5 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 6 &lt;/s&gt;}} 7 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 8 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt; 9 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt; 10&lt;/s&gt;}} 11 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;12&lt;/s&gt;}} 13 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;14 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;15 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;16&lt;/s&gt;}} 17 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;18&lt;/s&gt;}} 19 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;20 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;21 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;22&lt;/s&gt;}} 23 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;24&lt;/s&gt;}} 25 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;26 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;27 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;28&lt;/s&gt;}} 29 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;30&lt;/s&gt;}}

The next number not yet crossed out in the list after 3 is 5; cross out every 5th number in the list after 5 by counting up from 5 in increments of 5 (i.e. all the multiples of 5):

 &amp;nbsp;2  3 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 4 &lt;/s&gt;}} 5 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 6 &lt;/s&gt;}} 7 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 8 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt; 9 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt; 10&lt;/s&gt;}} 11 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;12&lt;/s&gt;}} 13 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;14 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;15 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;16&lt;/s&gt;}} 17 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;18&lt;/s&gt;}} 19 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;20 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;21 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;22&lt;/s&gt;}} 23 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;24 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;25 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;26 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;27 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;28&lt;/s&gt;}} 29 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;30&lt;/s&gt;}}

The next number not yet crossed out in the list after 5 is 7; the next step would be to cross out every 7th number in the list after 7, but they are all already crossed out at this point, as these numbers (14, 21, 28) are also multiples of smaller primes because 7 × 7 is greater than 30. The numbers not crossed out at this point in the list are all the prime numbers below 30:

 &amp;nbsp;2  3     5     7           11    13          17    19          23                29

==Algorithm and variants==
===Pseudocode===
The sieve of Eratosthenes can be expressed in [[pseudocode]], as follows:&lt;ref name="sedgewick"&gt;{{cite book
|last1=Sedgewick |first1=Robert |title=Algorithms in C++
|publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=1992 |isbn=0-201-51059-6 
}}, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/techreports/1990/TR909.pdf Jonathan Sorenson, An Introduction to Prime Number Sieves], Computer Sciences Technical Report #909, Department of Computer Sciences University of Wisconsin-Madison, January 2, 1990 (the use of optimization of starting from squares, and thus using only the numbers whose square is below the upper limit, is shown).&lt;/ref&gt;

 &amp;nbsp;'''Input''': an integer ''n'' &gt; 1.
 &amp;nbsp;&lt;!-- these &amp;nbsp;s prevent bots messing it up --&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;'''Let''' ''A'' be an '''array of [[Boolean data type|Boolean]]''' values, indexed by '''integer'''s 2 to ''n'',
 &amp;nbsp;initially all '''set''' to '''true'''.
 &amp;nbsp;
 &amp;nbsp;'''for''' ''i'' = 2, 3, 4, ..., not exceeding {{math|''{{sqrt|n}}''}}:
 &amp;nbsp;  '''if''' ''A''[''i''] '''is''' '''true''':
 &amp;nbsp;    '''for''' ''j'' = ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''i'', ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2''i'', ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+3''i'', ..., not exceeding ''n'':
 &amp;nbsp;      ''A''[''j''] := '''false'''.
 &amp;nbsp;
 &amp;nbsp;'''Output''': all ''i'' such that ''A''[''i''] '''is''' '''true'''.

This algorithm produces all primes not greater than {{mvar|n}}. It includes a common optimization, which is to start enumerating the multiples of each prime {{mvar|i}} from {{math|''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The [[time complexity]] of this algorithm is {{math|''O''(''n'' log log ''n'')}},{{r|intro}} provided the array update is an {{math|''O''(1)}} operation, as is usually the case.

===Segmented sieve===
As Sorenson notes, the problem with the sieve of Eratosthenes is not the number of operations it performs but rather its memory requirements.{{r|intro}} For large {{mvar|n}}, the range of primes may not fit in memory; worse, even for moderate {{mvar|n}}, its [[CPU cache|cache]] use is highly suboptimal. The algorithm walks through the entire array {{mvar|A}}, exhibiting almost no [[locality of reference]].

A solution to these problems is offered by ''segmented'' sieves, where only portions of the range are sieved at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Crandall &amp; Pomerance, ''Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective'', second edition, Springer: 2005, pp. 121–24.&lt;/ref&gt; These have been known since the 1970s, and work as follows:{{r|intro}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bays | first1 = Carter | last2 = Hudson | first2 = Richard H. | year = 1977 | title = The segmented sieve of Eratosthenes and primes in arithmetic progressions to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; | journal = BIT | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–127 | publisher = | jstor = | doi = 10.1007/BF01932283 | url = | format = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Divide the range 2 through {{mvar|n}} into segments of some size {{math|Δ ≤ {{sqrt|''n''}}}}.
# Find the primes in the first (i.e. the lowest) segment, using the regular sieve.
# For each of the following segments, in increasing order, with {{mvar|m}} being the segment's topmost value, find the primes in it as follows:
## Set up a Boolean array of size {{math|Δ}}, and
## Eliminate from it the multiples of each prime {{math|''p'' ≤ {{sqrt|''m''}}}} found so far, by calculating the lowest multiple of {{math|''p''}} between {{math|{{mvar|m}} - Δ}} and {{mvar|m}}, and enumerating its multiples in steps of {{math|''p''}} as usual, marking the corresponding positions in the array as non-prime.

If {{math|Δ}} is chosen to be {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}}, the space complexity of the algorithm is {{math|''O''({{sqrt|''n''}})}}, while the time complexity is the same as that of the regular sieve.{{r|intro}}

For ranges with upper limit {{math|''n''}} so large that the sieving primes below {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} as required by the page segmented sieve of Eratosthenes cannot fit in memory, a slower but much more space-efficient sieve like the [[sieve of Sorenson]] can be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Incremental sieve===
An incremental formulation of the sieve&lt;ref name="ONeill"&gt;O'Neill, Melissa E., [http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/papers/Sieve-JFP.pdf "The Genuine Sieve of Eratosthenes"], Journal of Functional Programming, Published online by Cambridge University Press 9 October 2008 {{doi|10.1017/S0956796808007004}}, pp. 10, 11 (contains two incremental sieves in Haskell: a priority-queue–based one by O'Neill and a list–based, by Richard Bird).&lt;/ref&gt; generates primes indefinitely (i.e., without an upper bound) by interleaving the generation of primes with the generation of their multiples (so that primes can be found in gaps between the multiples), where the multiples of each prime {{mvar|p}} are generated directly by counting up from the square of the prime in increments of {{mvar|p}} (or {{math|2''p''}} for odd primes). The generation must be initiated only when the prime's square is reached, to avoid adverse effects on efficiency. It can be expressed symbolically under the [[Dataflow programming|dataflow]] paradigm as

   ''primes'' = [''2'', ''3'', ...] \ [[''p''², ''p''²+''p'', ...] for ''p'' in ''primes''],

using [[list comprehension]] notation with &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; denoting [[Complement (set theory)#Relative complement|set subtraction]] of [[arithmetic progressions]] of numbers.

Primes can also be produced by iteratively sieving out the composites through [[Trial division|divisibility testing]] by sequential primes, one prime at a time. It is not the sieve of Eratosthenes but is often confused with it, even though the sieve of Eratosthenes directly generates the composites instead of testing for them. Trial division has worse theoretical [[Analysis of algorithms|complexity]] than that of the sieve of Eratosthenes in generating ranges of primes.&lt;ref name="ONeill"/&gt;

When testing each prime, the ''optimal'' trial division algorithm uses all prime numbers not exceeding its square root, whereas the sieve of Eratosthenes produces each composite from its prime factors only, and gets the primes "for free", between the composites.

==Computational analysis==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
The work performed by this algorithm is almost entirely the operations to cull the composite number representations which for the basic non-optimized version is the sum of the range divided by each of the primes up to that range or
:&lt;math&gt;n\sum_{p\le n}\frac1p,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|n}} is the sieving range in this and all further analysis.

By rearranging [[Mertens' theorems|Mertens' second theorem]], this is equal to {{math|''n'' ( log log ''n'' + ''M'' )}} as {{mvar|n}} approaches infinity, where M is the [[Meissel–Mertens constant]] of about {{val|0.2614972128476427837554268386086958590516}}...

The optimization of starting at the square of each prime and only culling for primes less than the square root changes the "{{math|''n''}}" in the above expression to {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} (or {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|1|2}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and not culling until the square means that the sum of the base primes each minus two is subtracted from the operations. As the sum of the first {{math|''x''}} primes is {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; log ''x''}}&lt;ref&gt;E. Bach and J. Shallit, §2.7 in Algorithmic Number Theory, Vol. 1: Efficient Algorithms, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[prime number theorem]] says that {{math|''x''}} is approximately {{math|{{sfrac|''x''|log ''x''}}}}, then the sum of primes to {{math|''n''}} is {{math|{{sfrac|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|2 log ''n''}}}}, and therefore the sum of base primes to {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} is {{math|{{sfrac|1|log ''n''}}}} expressed as a factor of {{math|''n''}}. The extra offset of two per base prime is {{math|2''π''({{sqrt|''n''}})}}, where {{mvar|π}} is the [[prime-counting function]] in this case, or {{math|{{sfrac|4{{sqrt|''n''}}|log ''n''}}}}; expressing this as a factor of {{math|''n''}} as are the other terms, this is {{math|{{sfrac|4|{{sqrt|''n''}} log ''n''}}}}. Combining all of this, the expression for the number of optimized operations without wheel factorization is
:&lt;math&gt;\log\log n-\frac1{\log n}\left(1-\frac{4}{\sqrt{n}}\right)+M-\log 2.&lt;/math&gt;

For the wheel factorization cases, there is a further offset of the operations not done of
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p\le x}\frac1p&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''x''}} is the highest wheel prime and a constant factor of the whole expression is applied which is the fraction of remaining prime candidates as compared to the repeating wheel circumference. The wheel circumference is
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{p\le x}p&lt;/math&gt;
and it can easily be determined that this wheel factor is
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{p\le x}\frac{p-1}{p}&lt;/math&gt;
as {{math|{{sfrac|''p'' − 1|''p''}}}} is the fraction of remaining candidates for the highest wheel prime, {{math|''x''}}, and each succeeding smaller prime leaves its corresponding fraction of the previous combined fraction.

Combining all of the above analysis, the total number of operations for a sieving range up to {{math|''n''}} including wheel factorization for primes up to {{math|''x''}} is approximately

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{p\le x}\frac{p-1}{p}\left(\log\log n-\frac1{\log n}\left(1-\frac{4}{\sqrt{n}}\right)+M-\log 2-\sum_{p\le x}\frac1p\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

To show that the above expression is a good approximation to the number of composite number cull operations performed by the algorithm, following is a table showing the actually measured number of operations for a practical implementation of the sieve of Eratosthenes as compared to the number of operations predicted from the above expression with both expressed as a fraction of the range (rounded to four decimal places) for different sieve ranges and wheel factorizations (Note that the last column is a maximum practical wheel as to the size of the wheel gaps Look Up Table - almost 10 million values):

The above table shows that the above expression is a very good approximation to the total number of culling operations for sieve ranges of about a hundred thousand (10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) and above.

==Algorithmic complexity==
The sieve of Eratosthenes is a popular way to benchmark computer performance.&lt;ref name="peng1985fall"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-11/1985_11_BYTE_10-11_Inside_the_IBM_PCs#page/n245/mode/2up | title=One Million Primes Through the Sieve | work=BYTE | date=Fall 1985 | accessdate=19 March 2016 | author=Peng, T. A. | pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; As can be seen from the above by removing all constant offsets and constant factors and ignoring terms that tend to zero as n approaches infinity, the [[time complexity]] of calculating all primes below {{mvar|n}} in the [[random access machine]] model is {{math|''O''(''n'' log log ''n'')}} operations, a direct consequence of the fact that the [[prime harmonic series]] asymptotically approaches {{math|log log ''n''}}. It has an exponential time complexity with regard to input size, though, which makes it a [[Pseudo-polynomial time|pseudo-polynomial]] algorithm. The basic algorithm requires {{math|''O''(''n'')}} of memory.

The [[bit complexity]] of the algorithm is {{math|''O''&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;''n'' (log ''n'') (log log ''n'')&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;}} bit operations with a memory requirement of {{math|''O''(''n'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, Paul, "Linear prime-number sieves: a family tree," ''Sci. Comput. Programming'' '''9''':1 (1987), pp. 17–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The normally implemented page segmented version has the same operational complexity of {{math|''O''(''n'' log log ''n'')}} as the non-segmented version but reduces the space requirements to the very minimal size of the segment page plus the memory required to store the base primes less than the square root of the range used to cull composites from successive page segments of size {{math|''O''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{sfrac|{{sqrt|''n''}}|log ''n''}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}}.

A special rarely if ever implemented segmented version of the sieve of Eratosthenes, with basic optimizations, uses {{math|''O''(''n'')}} operations and {{math|''O''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{sqrt|''n''}}{{sfrac|log log ''n''|log ''n''}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} bits of memory.&lt;ref name="Pritchard1"&gt;Paul Pritchard, A sublinear additive sieve for finding prime numbers, Communications of the ACM 24 (1981), 18–23. {{MR|600730}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pritchard2"&gt;Paul Pritchard, Explaining the wheel sieve, Acta Informatica 17 (1982), 477–485. {{MR|685983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pritchard3"&gt;Paul Pritchard, Fast compact prime number sieves (among others), Journal of Algorithms 4
(1983), 332–344. {{MR|729229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To show that the above approximation in complexity is not very accurate even for about as large as practical a range, the following is a table of the estimated number of operations as a fraction of the range rounded to four places, the calculated ratio for a factor of ten change in range based on this estimate, and the factor based on the {{math|log log ''n''}} estimate for various ranges and wheel factorizations (the combo column uses a frequently practically used pre-cull by the maximum wheel factorization but only the 2/3/5/7 wheel for the wheel factor as the full factorization is difficult to implement efficiently for page segmentation):

The above shows that the {{math|log log ''n''}} estimate is not very accurate even for maximum practical ranges of about 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;. One can see why it does not match by looking at the computational analysis above and seeing that within these practical sieving range limits, there are very significant constant offset terms such that the very slowly growing {{math|log log ''n''}} term does not get large enough so as to make these terms insignificant until the sieving range approaches infinity – well beyond any practical sieving range. Within these practical ranges, these significant constant offsets mean that the performance of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is much better than one would expect just using the asymptotic time complexity estimates by a significant amount, but that also means that the slope of the performance with increasing range is steeper than predicted as the benefit of the constant offsets becomes slightly less significant.

One should also note that in using the calculated operation ratios to the sieve range, it must be less than about 0.2587 in order to be faster than the often compared [[sieve of Atkin]] if the operations take approximately the same time each in CPU clock cycles, which is a reasonable assumption for the one huge bit array algorithm. Using that assumption, the sieve of Atkin is only faster than the maximally wheel factorized sieve of Eratosthenes for ranges of over 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; at which point the huge sieve buffer array would need about a quarter of a terabyte (about 250 gigabytes) of RAM memory even if bit packing were used. An analysis of the page segmented versions will show that the assumption that the time per operation stays the same between the two algorithms does not hold for page segmentation and that the sieve of Atkin operations get slower much faster than the sieve of Eratosthenes with increasing range. Thus for practical purposes, the maximally wheel factorized Sieve of Eratosthenes is faster than the Sieve of Atkin although the Sieve of Atkin is faster for lesser amounts of wheel factorization.

Using [[big O notation]] is also not the correct way to compare practical performance of even variations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes as it ignores constant factors and offsets that may be very significant for practical ranges: The sieve of Eratosthenes variation known as the Pritchard wheel sieve&lt;ref name="Pritchard1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pritchard2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pritchard3" /&gt; has an {{math|''O''(''n'')}} performance, but its basic implementation requires either a "one large array" algorithm which limits its usable range to the amount of available memory else it needs to be page segmented to reduce memory use. When implemented with page segmentation in order to save memory, the basic algorithm still requires about {{math|''O''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{sfrac|''n''|log ''n''}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} bits of memory (much more than the requirement of the basic page segmented sieve of Eratosthenes using {{math|''O''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{sfrac|{{sqrt|''n''}}|log ''n''}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} bits of memory). Pritchard's work reduced the memory requirement to the limit as described above the table, but the cost is a fairly large constant factor of about three in execution time to about three quarters the sieve range due to the complex computations required to do so. As can be seen from the above table for the basic sieve of Eratosthenes, even though the resulting wheel sieve has {{math|''O''(''n'')}} performance and an acceptable memory requirement, it will never be faster than a reasonably Wheel Factorized basic sieve of Eratosthenes for any practical sieving range by a factor of about two. Other than that it is quite complex to implement, it is rarely practically implemented because it still uses more memory than the basic Sieve of Eratosthenes implementations described here as well as being slower for practical ranges. It is thus more of an intellectual curiosity than something practical.

 &amp;nbsp;[...]&lt;/small&gt;

Here the example is shown starting from odds, after the first step of the algorithm. Thus, on the {{mvar|k}}th step all the remaining multiples of the {{mvar|k}}th prime are removed from the list, which will thereafter contain only numbers coprime with the first {{mvar|k}} primes (cf. [[wheel factorization]]), so that the list will start with the next prime, and all the numbers in it below the square of its first element will be prime too.

Thus, when generating a bounded sequence of primes, when the next identified prime exceeds the square root of the upper limit, all the remaining numbers in the list are prime.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt; In the example given above that is achieved on identifying 11 as next prime, giving a list of all primes less than or equal to 80.

Note that numbers that will be discarded by a step are still used while marking the multiples in that step, e.g., for the multiples of 3 it is {{nowrap|1=3 × 3 = 9}}, {{nowrap|1=3 × 5 = 15}}, {{nowrap|1=3 × 7 = 21}}, {{nowrap|1=3 × '''''9''''' = 27}}, ..., {{nowrap|1=3 × '''''15''''' = 45}}, ..., so care must be taken dealing with this.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

'''Social neuroscience''' is an interdisciplinary field devoted to understanding how [[biological system]]s implement social processes and [[behavior]], and to using biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social processes and behavior. [[Humans]] are fundamentally a social species, rather than individualists. As such, ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' create [[emergent organization]]s beyond the individual—structures that range from dyads, families, and groups to cities, civilizations, and cultures. These emergent structures evolved hand in hand with [[neural]] and [[hormonal]] mechanisms to support them because the consequent social behaviors helped these organisms survive, reproduce, and care for offspring sufficiently long that they too survived to reproduce. The term "social neuroscience" can be traced to a publication entitled "Social Neuroscience Bulletin" that was published quarterly between 1988 and 1994.  The term was subsequently popularized in an article by [[John Cacioppo]] and [[Gary Berntson]], published in [[the American Psychologist]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cacioppo J. T. |author2=Berntson G. G. | year = 1992 | title = Social psychological contributions to the decade of the brain: Doctrine of multilevel analysis | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1019–1028 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.47.8.1019 | pmid=1510329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cacioppo and Berntson are considered as the legitimate fathers of social neuroscience. Still a young field, social [[neuroscience]] is closely related to [[affective neuroscience]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], focusing on how the [[brain]] mediates [[social interaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cacioppo J. T. |author2=Berntson G. G. |author3=Decety J. | year = 2010 | title = Social neuroscience and its relation to social psychology | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 675–684 | doi=10.1521/soco.2010.28.6.675|pmc=3883133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological underpinnings of [[social cognition]] are investigated in [[social cognitive neuroscience]]

==Overview==
Traditional [[neuroscience]] has for many years considered the [[nervous system]] as an isolated entity and largely ignored influences of the social environments in which humans and many animal species live. In fact, we now recognize the considerable impact of social structures on the operations of the brain and body. These social factors operate on the individual through a continuous interplay of neural, [[neuroendocrine]], [[metabolic]] and [[Immune system|immune]] factors on brain and body, in which the brain is the central regulatory organ and also a malleable target of these factors.&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J. T., Berntson, G. G., &amp; Decety, J. (2011). A history of social neuroscience. In A. W. Kruglanski and [[Wolfgang Stroebe|W. Stroebe]] (Eds.), Handbook of the History of Social Psychology. New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Social neuroscience investigates the [[mechanism (biology)|biological mechanisms]] that underlie social processes and behavior, widely considered one of the major problem areas for the [[neuroscience]]s in the 21st century, and applies concepts and methods of [[biology]] to develop [[scientific theories|theories]] of social processes and behavior in the social and [[behavioral sciences]]. Social neuroscience capitalizes on biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social behavior, and it uses social and behavioral constructs and data to advance theories of neural organization and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cacioppo J.T.| year = 2007 | title = Social neuroscience: progress and implications for mental health | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 99–123 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00032.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cacioppo J. T. |author2=Decety J. | year = 2011 | title = Social neuroscience: challenges and opportunities in the study of complex behavior | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1224| issue = | pages = 162–173| doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05858.x | pmid=21251011 | pmc=3098127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout most of the 20th century, social and biological explanations were widely viewed as incompatible. But advances in recent years have led to the development of a new approach synthesized from the social and biological sciences. The new field of social neuroscience emphasizes the complementary relationship between the different levels of organization, spanning the social and biological domains (e.g., [[Molecular biology|molecular]], [[Cellular biology|cellular]], [[Systems biology|system]], person, relational, collective, societal) and the use of multi-level analyses to foster understanding of the mechanisms underlying the human mind and behavior.

==Methods==
A number of methods are used in social neuroscience to investigate the confluence of [[nervous system|neural]] and social processes. These methods draw from behavioral techniques developed in [[social psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[neuropsychology]], and are associated with a variety of neurobiological techniques including [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), [[facial electromyography]] (EMG), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[event-related potential]]s (ERPs), [[electrocardiogram]]s, [[electromyogram]]s, [[endocrinology]], [[immunology]], [[galvanic skin response]] (GSR), single-cell recording, and studies of [[Ataxia#Focal lesions|focal brain lesion]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adolphs R | year = 2003 | title = Investigating the cognitive neuroscience of social behavior | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 119–126 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00142-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J.T., &amp; Berntson, G.G. (2009), Handbook of Neuroscience for the Behavioral Science. New York: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Jones, E., &amp; Beer, J.S. (2009). Methods in Social Neuroscience. New York: The Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012). The Student's Guide to Social Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Subbaraju et al"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|year=2017 |title= Identification of lateralized compensatory neural activities within the social brain due to autism spectrum disorder in adolescent males |author= Subbaraju V, Sundaram S, Narasimhan S |doi=10.1111/ejn.13634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal models are also important to investigate the putative role of specific brain structures, circuits, or processes (e.g., the [[reward system]] and [[drug addiction]]). In addition, quantitative meta-analyses are important to move beyond idiosyncrasies of individual studies, and neurodevelopmental investigations can contribute to our understanding of brain-behavior associations.&lt;ref&gt;de Haan, M., &amp; Gunnar, M.R. (2009). Handbook of Developmental Social Neuroscience. The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Cacioppo T.T. | year = 2010 | title = Frontiers in human neuroscience, the golden triangle, and beyond | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 767–771 | doi=10.1177/1745691610388780| pmc=3904345}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most popular forms of methods used in social neuroscience are fMRI and EEG. fMRI are very cost efficient and high in spatial resolution. However, they are low in temporal resolution and therefore, are best to discover pathways in the brain that are used during social experiments. fMRI have low temporal resolution (timing) because they read oxygenated blood levels that pool to the parts of the brain that are activated and need more oxygen. Thus, the blood takes time to travel to the part of the brain being activated and in reverse provides a lower ability to test for exact timing of activation during social experiments. EEG is best used when a researcher is trying to brain map a certain area that correlates to a [[social construct]] that is being studied. EEGs provide high temporal resolution but low spatial resolution. In which, the timing of the activation is very accurate but it is hard to pinpoint exact areas on the brain, researchers are to narrow down locations and areas but they also create a lot of "noise". Most recently, researchers have been using TMS which is the best way to discover the exact location in the process of brain mapping. This machine can turn on and off parts of the brain which then allows researchers to test what that part of the brain is used for during social events. However, this machine is so expensive that it is rarely used.

Note: Most of these methods can only provide correlations between brain mapping and social events (apart from TMS), a con of Social Neuroscience is that the research must be interpreted through correlations which can cause a decreased content validity. For example, during an experiment when a participant is doing a task to test for a social theory and a part of the brain is activated, it is impossible to form causality because anything else in the room or the thoughts of the person could have triggered that response. It is very hard to isolate these variables during these experiments. That is why self-reports are very important. This will also help decrease the chances of VooDoo correlations (correlations that are too high and over 0.8 which look like a correlation exists between two factors but actually is just an error in design and statistical measures). Another way to avoid this con, is to use tests with hormones which can infer causality. For example, when people are given oxytocin and placebos and we can test their differences in social behavior between other people. Using SCRs will also help isolate unconscious thoughts and conscious thoughts because it is the body's natural parasympathetic response to the outside world. All of these tests and devices will help social neuroscientists discover the connections in the brain that are used to carry out our everyday social activities.

Primarily [[psychology|psychological]] methods include performance-based measures that record response time and/or accuracy,&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012). The Student's Guide to Social Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Implicit Association Test]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greenwald A. G. |author2=McGhee D. E. |author3=Schwartz J. L. K. | year = 1998 | title = Measuring individual differences in implicit cognition: The Implicit Association Test | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 1464–1480 | doi =  10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464}}&lt;/ref&gt; observational measures such as preferential looking in infant studies; and, self-report measures, such as questionnaire and interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012). The Student's Guide to Social Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurobiological methods can be grouped together into ones that measure more external bodily responses, electrophysiological methods, hemodynamic measures, and lesion methods. 
Bodily response methods include GSR (also known as skin conductance response (SCR)), facial EMG, and the eyeblink startle response. Electrophysiological methods include single-cell recordings, EEG, and ERPs. Hemodynamic measures, which, instead of directly measuring neural activity, measure changes in blood flow, include PET and fMRI. Lesion methods traditionally study brains that have been damaged via natural causes, such as strokes, traumatic injuries, tumors, neurosurgery, infection, or neurodegenerative disorders. In its ability to create a type of 'virtual lesion' that is temporary, TMS may also be included in this category. More specifically, TMS methods involve stimulating one area of the brain to isolate it from the rest of the brain, imitating a brain lesion. This is particularly helpful in brain mapping, a key approach in social neuroscience designed to determine which areas of the brain are activated during certain activities.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012).

==Non-human animal models==
Prolonged maternal separation of rodents correlates with elevated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis response to stress, as well as diminished cognitive ability, relating to minimized GR mRNA in the hippocampus, minimized BDNF, heightened CRH mRNA in the hypothalamus,&lt;ref&gt;Lippmann et al.,[https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/39618716/Long-term_behavioural_and_molecular_alte20151102-11448-11qsnub.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1531788972&amp;Signature=aYtdmi%2Bhyx2Tsi2zNPF8XfaW4BU%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DLong-term_behavioural_and_molecular_alte.pdf "Long-term behavioural and molecular alterations associated with maternal separation in rats"], "Europoean Journal of Neuroscience",
 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and a diminished quantity of glucocorticoid receptor binding sites within the frontal cortex and hippocampus.  Such changes in the rodent infants persist throughout life, resulting in heightened stress reactivity, and relating to diminished negative feedback to stress hormones.&lt;ref&gt;Meaney et al., [http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1986-11163-001 "Early postnatal handling alters glucocorticoid receptor concentrations in selected brain regions"], "Behavioral Neuroscience", 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the frequency of licking and grooming of rodent pups by mothers, influences differences in cognitive ability, HPA response to stress, and social behavior of pups throughout life,&lt;ref&gt;Champagne et al., [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.887.4145&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "Variations in maternal care in the rat as a mediating influence for effects of environment on development"], "Physiology and Behavior", 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meaney, [http://saki.caltech.edu/biCNS217_2008/PDFs/Meaney2001.pdf "Maternal Care, Gene Expression, and the Transmission of Individual Differences in Stress Reactivity across Generations"], "Annual Review of Neuroscience", 2001&lt;/ref&gt; independent of the pups' genetic disposition or prenatal environment&lt;ref&gt;Champagne et al., [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.887.4145&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "Variations in maternal care in the rat as a mediating influence for effects of environment on development"], "Physiology and Behavior", 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis et al., [http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/22/18/7840.full.pdf "Environmental Enrichment Reverses the Effects of Maternal Separation on Stress Reactivity"], "The Journal of Neuroscience", 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and also correlating with alterations in gene expressivity and structure of the hippocampus.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb et al., [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/10/04/1121251109.long "Experience and the developing prefrontal cortex"], "PNAS", 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, in neonatal rhesus macaques, social deprivation corresponds with lower concentrations of oxytocin in cerebrospinal fluid than rhesus macaques that did not experience social deprivation during neonatal development.&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736574804000322 "Neuropeptides and non-human primate social deficits associated with pathogenic rearing experience"], "International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience", 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
While [[animal testing on rodents|rodent studies]] of gene expression predominately measure the consequences of depriving the animals of sensory experiences, a study has also been conducted measuring the consequences of enriching animal sensory experiences on prefrontal cortex development, via tactile stimulation by researchers for 45 minutes per day for the approximately first two weeks of life.  What was discovered was that infants, who received additional tactile stimulation exhibited greater motor performance and spatial learning, in addition to enhanced cerebral cortex synaptic organization, in adulthood, than infants who did not receive additional tactile stimulation.  These findings reinforce the significance of tactile stimulation in early stages of postnatal development and neurogenesis for rodent models.  Because non-human animal studies typically concern either, the presence and absence of parents, or the presence and absence of tactile stimulation, the findings of animal studies on gene expression are likely more comparable to human cases of neglect, as opposed to physical or sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb et al., [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/10/04/1121251109.long "Experience and the developing prefrontal cortex"], "PNAS", 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society for Social Neuroscience==
A dinner to discuss the challenges and opportunities in the interdisciplinary field of social neuroscience at the [[Society for Neuroscience]] meeting ([[Chicago]], November 2009) resulted in a series of meetings led by [[John Cacioppo]] and [[Jean Decety]] with social neuroscientists, [[psychologists]], [[neuroscientist]]s, [[psychiatrists]] and [[neurologist]]s in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[China]], [[Colombia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Social neuroscience was defined broadly as the interdisciplinary study of the neural, hormonal, cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying the emergent structures that define social species. Thus, among the participants in these meetings were scientists who used a wide variety of methods in studies of animals as well as humans, and patients as well as normal participants. The consensus also emerged that a Society for Social Neuroscience should be established to give scientists from diverse disciplines and perspectives the opportunity to meet, communicate with, and benefit from the work of each other. The international, interdisciplinary [[Society for social neuroscience]] (http://S4SN.org) was launched at the conclusion of these consultations in [[Auckland]], New Zealand on 20 January 2010, and the inaugural meeting for the Society was held on November 12, 2010, the day prior to the 2010 Society for Neuroscience meeting ([[San Diego]], CA).

'''Space colonization''' (also called '''space settlement''', or '''extraterrestrial colonization''') is permanent human habitation off the planet [[Earth]].

Many arguments have been made for and against space colonization.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.thespaceshow.com The Space Show], an online radio program, has had on average 16 shows per month going back to 2001, many of which discuss space settlement.&lt;/ref&gt; The two most common in favor of colonization are survival of human [[civilization]] and the [[biosphere]] in the event of a [[Global catastrophic risk|planetary-scale disaster (natural or man-made)]], and the availability of additional resources in space that could enable expansion of human society. The most common objections to colonization include concerns that the [[commodification]] of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful, including major economic and military institutions, and to exacerbate pre-existing detrimental processes such as [[war]]s, [[economic inequality]], and [[environmental degradation]].&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2010-11&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Dickens| first1=Peter|last2=Ormrod|first2=James| url=http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end/ |title=The Humanization of the Cosmos - to What End?|date=Nov 2010|publisher=[[Monthly Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2008-02&gt;Dickens, Peter (Feb 2008).

No space colonies have been built so far. Currently, the building of a space colony would present a set of huge technological and economic challenges. Space settlements would have to provide for nearly all (or all) the material needs of hundreds or thousands of humans, in an environment out in space that is [[Effect of spaceflight on the human body|very hostile]] to human life. They would involve technologies, such as [[controlled ecological life support system]]s, that have yet to be developed in any meaningful way. They would also have to deal with the as-yet unknown issue of how humans would behave and thrive in such places long-term. Because of the present cost of sending anything from the surface of the Earth into orbit (around $2,500 per-pound to orbit, expected to further decrease),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space/is-spacex-changing-the-rocket-equation-132285884/?no-ist|title=Is SpaceX Changing the Rocket Equation?|author=Andrew Chaikin|work=Air &amp; Space Magazine|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a space colony would currently be a massively expensive project.

There are yet no plans for building space colonies by any large-scale organization, either government or private. However, many proposals, speculations, and designs for space settlements have been made through the years, and a considerable number of space colonization [[space advocacy|advocates]] and groups are active. Several famous scientists, such as [[Freeman Dyson]], have come out in favor of space settlement.&lt;ref name=dyson&gt;{{cite web |author=Britt, Robert Roy |date=8 October 2001 |title=Archived copy |website=space.com |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/colonize_why_011008-1.html |accessdate=2006-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125083046/http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/colonize_why_011008-1.html |archivedate=25 November 2010 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the technological front, there is ongoing progress in making access to space cheaper ([[reusable launch system]]s could reach $10 per-pound to orbit),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a7446/elon-musk-on-spacexs-reusable-rocket-plans-6653023/|title=Elon Musk on SpaceX's Reusable Rocket Plans|date=7 February 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in creating [[Space manufacturing|automated manufacturing and construction techniques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anthony|first=Sebastian |title=Space giants join forces to battle SpaceX: This is how cheap space travel begins |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/184434-space-giants-join-forces-to-battle-spacex-this-is-how-cheap-space-travel-begins |accessdate=2014-10-10 |newspaper=NASAspaceflight.com |date=2014-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons==

===Survival of human civilization===
{{Main|Space and survival}}

The primary argument calling for space colonization is the long-term survival of human civilization. By developing alternative locations off Earth, the planet's species, including humans, could live on in the event of [[Global catastrophic risk|natural or man-made disasters on our own planet]].

On two occasions, theoretical physicist and cosmologist [[Stephen Hawking]] has argued for space colonization as a means of saving humanity. In 2001, Hawking predicted that the human race would become extinct within the next thousand years, unless colonies could be established in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Highfield |first=Roger |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1359562/Colonies-in-space-may-be-only-hope-says-Hawking.html |title=Colonies in space may be only hope, says Hawking |work=The Telegraph |date=16 October 2001 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he stated that humanity faces two options: either we colonize space within the next two hundred years and build residential units on other planets, or we will face the prospect of [[Human extinction|long-term extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mankind must colonize other planets to survive, says Hawking". Daily Mail(London). 2006-12-01. Retrieved March 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, then [[NASA]] Administrator [[Michael D. Griffin|Michael Griffin]] identified space colonization as the ultimate goal of current spaceflight programs, saying:
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;the goal isn't just scientific exploration&amp;nbsp;... it's also about extending the range of human habitat out from Earth into the solar system as we go forward in time&amp;nbsp;... In the long run a single-planet species will not survive&amp;nbsp;... If we humans want to survive for hundreds of thousands or millions of years, we must ultimately populate other planets. Now, today the technology is such that this is barely conceivable. We're in the infancy of it.&amp;nbsp;... I'm talking about that one day, I don't know when that day is, but there will be more human beings who live off the Earth than on it. We may well have people living on the Moon. We may have people living on the moons of Jupiter and other planets. We may have people making habitats on asteroids&amp;nbsp;... I know that humans will colonize the solar system and one day go beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/23/AR2005092301691.html| title=NASA's Griffin: 'Humans Will Colonize the Solar System'|date=September 25, 2005| publisher=Washington Post| pages=B07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Louis J. Halle]], formerly of the [[United States Department of State]], wrote in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' (Summer 1980) that the colonization of space will protect humanity in the event of global [[nuclear warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19800601faessay8146/louis-j-halle/a-hopeful-future-for-mankind.html| title=A Hopeful Future for Mankind| first=Louis J.| last=Halle| journal=Foreign Affairs| date=Summer 1980| doi=10.2307/20040585| volume=58| issue=5| pages=1129| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013051342/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19800601faessay8146/louis-j-halle/a-hopeful-future-for-mankind.html| archivedate=2004-10-13| df=| jstor=20040585}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physicist [[Paul Davies]] also supports the view that if a planetary catastrophe threatens the survival of the human species on Earth, a self-sufficient colony could "reverse-colonize" Earth and restore [[Civilization|human civilization]]. The author and journalist [[William E. Burrows]] and the biochemist [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] proposed a private project, the [[Alliance to Rescue Civilization]], with the goal of establishing an off-Earth "[[backup]]" of human civilization.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/science/01arc.html | title = Life After Earth: Imagining Survival Beyond This Terra Firma | publisher = New York Times | first=Richard | last=Morgan | date=2006-08-01 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on his [[Copernican principle]], [[J. Richard Gott]] has estimated that the human race could survive for another 7.8 million years, but it is not likely to ever colonize other planets. However, he expressed a hope to be proven wrong, because "colonizing other worlds is our best chance to hedge our bets and improve the survival prospects of our species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Tierney |first=John |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/science/17tier.html?ex=1342324800&amp;en=ccf375ae9f268470&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |title=A Survival Imperative for Space Colonization |date=July 17, 2007 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vast resources in space===
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space }}
Resources in space, both in materials and energy, are enormous. The [[Solar System]] alone has, according to different estimates, enough material and energy to support anywhere from several thousand to over a billion times that of the current Earth-based human population.&lt;ref&gt;Estimated 3000 times the land area of Earth. O'Neill, Gerard K. (1976, 2000). ''[[The High Frontier]]''. Apogee Books {{ISBN|1-896522-67-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estimated 10 quadrillion (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) people. Lewis, John S. (1997). ''[[Mining the Sky|Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets]].'' Helix Books/Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|0-201-32819-4}} version 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estimated 5 quintillion (5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;) people. Savage, Marshall (1992, 1994). ''[[The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps]].'' Little, Brown. {{ISBN|0-316-77163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the Solar System, several hundred billion other stars in the [[observable universe]] provide opportunities for both colonization and resource collection, though travel to any of them is impossible on any practical time-scale without [[interstellar travel]] by use of [[generation ship]]s or revolutionary new methods of travel, such as [[faster-than-light]] (FTL).

Asteroid mining will also be a key player in space colonization. Water and materials to make structures and shielding can be easily found in asteroids. Instead of resupplying on Earth, mining and fuel stations need to be established on asteroids to facilitate better space travel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2017_Phase_I_Phase_II/Sustainable_Human_Exploration Optical Mining of Asteroids, Moons, and Planets to Enable Sustainable Human Exploration and Space Industrialization]; April 6, 2017; NASA&lt;/ref&gt; Optical mining is the term NASA uses to describe extracting materials from asteroids. NASA believes by using propellant derived from asteroids for exploration to the moon, Mars, and beyond will save $100 billion. If funding and technology come sooner than estimated, asteroid mining might be possible within a decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2016/05/24/how-to-optically-mine-water-from-an-asteroid/#37f0e05c389f Turning Near-Earth Asteroids Into Strategically-Placed Fuel Dumps]; May 24, 2016; Forbe&lt;/ref&gt;

All these planets and other bodies offer a virtually endless supply of resources providing limitless growth potential. Harnessing these resources can lead to much economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Economic Development. Paine, Thomas O. (1992). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252328678_Mars_Colonization_Technically_Feasible_Affordable_and_a_Universal_Human_Drive Mars Colonization: Technically Feasible, Affordable, and a Universal Human Drive].'' National Forum. 72.3. P24. Gale Document Number: GALE|A13330278 (can request a copy directly from the authors)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion with fewer negative consequences===
{{Further|Holocene extinction}}

Expansion of humans and technological progress has usually resulted in some form of environmental devastation, and destruction of [[ecosystem]]s and their accompanying [[wildlife]]. In the past, expansion has often come at the expense of displacing many [[indigenous peoples]], the resulting treatment of these peoples ranging anywhere from encroachment to genocide. Because space has no known life, this need not be a consequence, as some space settlement advocates have pointed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.space-settlement-institute.org/meaning.html| title=The Meaning of Space Settlement| publisher = Space Settlement Institute| accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Marshall (1992, 1994). ''[[The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps]]''. Little, Brown. {{ISBN|0-316-77163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleviating overpopulation and resource demand===
{{See also|Human overpopulation #Extraterrestrial settlement}}
Another argument for space colonization is to mitigate the negative effects of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1976-01-01|title=The impact of space colonization on world dynamics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040162576900196|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=361–399|doi=10.1016/0040-1625(76)90019-6|issn=0040-1625}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2016}}&lt;!-- Is this to mitigate "negative effects" for some group of persons who settle off Earth, or to generally mitigate a perceived overpopulation problem on Earth? Looking for sources on the latter argument, if it is being made. --&gt;
If the resources of space were opened to use and viable life-supporting habitats were built, Earth would no longer define the limitations of growth. Although many of Earth's resources are non-renewable, off-planet colonies could satisfy the majority of the planet's resource requirements. With the availability of extraterrestrial resources, demand on terrestrial ones would decline.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Colonies in Space''; Pournelle, ''A Step Farther Out''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other arguments===
Additional goals cite the innate human drive to explore and discover, a quality recognized at the core of progress and thriving civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Clarke, Arthur C. |title= Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry Into the Limits of the Possible |year= 1962 |chapter= Rocket to the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.spacedaily.com/news/oped-03y.html | title= The Space Settlement Summit | author= McKnight, John Carter | publisher= Space Daily | date= 20 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nick Bostrom]] has argued that from a [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] perspective, space colonization should be a chief goal as it would enable a very large population to live for a very long period of time (possibly billions of years), which would produce an enormous amount of utility (or happiness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html |title= Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological Development |journal= Utilitas |volume= 15 |number= 3 |date= November 2003 |pages= 308–314 |publisher= Cambridge University Press | doi= 10.1017/S0953820800004076|last1= Bostrom |first1= Nick }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that it is more important to reduce existential risks to increase the probability of eventual colonization than to accelerate technological development so that space colonization could happen sooner. In his paper, he assumes that the created lives will have positive ethical value despite the problem of [[suffering]].

In a 2001 interview with Freeman Dyson, J.&amp;nbsp;Richard Gott and Sid Goldstein, they were asked for reasons why some humans should live in space.&lt;ref name=dyson /&gt; Their answers were:
* Spread life and beauty throughout the universe
* Ensure the survival of our species
* Make money through new forms of [[Commercialization of space|space commercialization]] such as [[space-based solar power|solar-power satellites]], [[asteroid mining]], and [[space manufacturing]]
* Save the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] of Earth by moving people and industry into space

==Goals==

Although some items of the infrastructure requirements above can already be easily produced on Earth and would therefore not be very valuable as trade items (oxygen, water, base metal ores, silicates, etc.), other high value items are more abundant, more easily produced, of higher quality, or can only be produced in space. These would provide (over the long-term) a very high return on the initial investment in space infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/the_technical_and_economic_feasibility_of_mining_the_near_earth_asteriods.shtml The Technical and Economic Feasibility of Mining the Near-Earth Asteroids] Presented at 49th IAF Congress, Sept 28 - Oct 2, 1998, Melbourne, Australia by Mark J Sonter&amp;nbsp;— Space Future&lt;/ref&gt;

The mining and extraction of metals from a small asteroid the size of [[3554 Amun]] or [[(6178) 1986 DA]], both small near-Earth asteroids, would be 30 times as much metal as humans have mined throughout history. A metal asteroid this size would be worth approximately US$20 trillion at 2001 market prices.

Space colonization is seen as a long-term goal of some national [[space program]]s. Since the advent of the 21st-century commercialization of space, which saw greater cooperation between NASA and the private sector, several private companies have announced plans toward the [[colonization of Mars]]. Among entrepreneurs leading the call for space colonization are [[Elon Musk]], [[Dennis Tito]] and [[Bas Lansdorp]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4729211/Billionaire-PayPal-founder-announces-Mars-city-bid.html Billionaire PayPal founder announces dramatic Mars city bid], by Jack Losh; The Sun, January 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/business/global/reality-tv-for-the-red-planet.html Reality TV for the Red Planet], by Nicola Clark; The New York Times, March 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/02/130222-manned-mission-mars-tito-space-science/ Businessman Dennis Tito Financing Manned Mission to Mars], by Jane J.

The main impediments to commercial exploitation of these resources are the very high cost of initial investment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Ricky J.|title=Costing and financing a commercial asteroid mining venture|publisher=54th International Astronautical Congress|location=Bremen, Germany|year=2003|id=IAC-03-IAA.3.1.06|url=http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=Paper&amp;gID=16257|accessdate=2009-05-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809183150/http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=Paper&amp;gID=16257|archivedate=2009-08-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the very long period required for the expected return on those investments (''The Eros Project'' plans a 50-year development),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orbdev.com/erosproj.html The Eros Project] - Orbital Development&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that the venture has never been carried out  before&amp;nbsp;— the high-risk nature of the investment.

==Method==
Building colonies in space would require access to water, food, space, people, construction materials, energy, transportation, [[communication]]s, [[life support system|life support]], [[simulated gravity]], [[radiation]] protection and capital investment. It is likely the colonies would be located near the necessary physical resources. The practice of [[space architecture]] seeks to transform spaceflight from a heroic test of human endurance to a normality within the bounds of comfortable experience. As is true of other frontier-opening endeavors, the capital investment necessary for space colonization would probably come from governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jetpress.org/volume4/space.htm |title=The Political Economy of Very Large Space Projects |author=John Hickman |work=Journal of Evolution and Technology |publisher=Jetpress.org |volume=4 |date=November 1999 |accessdate=2013-12-14 |issn=1541-0099}}&lt;/ref&gt; an argument made by John Hickman&lt;ref&gt;John Hickman. 2010.

===Materials===
{{Further|Asteroid mining}}

Colonies on the Moon, Mars, or asteroids could extract local materials. The Moon is deficient in [[volatiles]] such as [[argon]], [[helium]] and compounds of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]] and [[nitrogen]]. The LCROSS impacter was targeted at the Cabeus crater which was chosen as having a high concentration of water for the Moon. A plume of material erupted in which some water was detected. Mission chief scientist Anthony Colaprete estimated that the Cabeus crater contains material with 1% water or possibly more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/NASA-s-moon-blast-called-a-smashing-success-3213973.php | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=David | last=Perlman | title=NASA's moon blast called a smashing success | date=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water [[ice]] should also be in other permanently shadowed craters near the lunar poles. Although helium is present only in low concentrations on the Moon, where it is deposited into [[regolith]] by the solar wind, an estimated million tons of He-3 exists over all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satnews.com/stories2007/4588/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308151604/http://www.satnews.com/stories2007/4588/ |date=March 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has industrially significant [[oxygen]], [[silicon]], and metals such as [[iron]], [[aluminum]], and [[titanium]].

Launching materials from Earth is expensive, so bulk materials for colonies could come from the Moon, a [[near-Earth object]] (NEO), [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]], or [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. The benefits of using such sources include: a lower gravitational force, no [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag]] on cargo vessels, and no biosphere to damage. Many NEOs contain substantial amounts of metals. Underneath a drier outer crust (much like [[oil shale]]), some other NEOs are inactive comets which include billions of tons of water ice and [[kerogen]] hydrocarbons, as well as some nitrogen compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1061/40177(207)107 |title=Discovery of Abundant, Accessible Hydrocarbons nearly Everywhere in the Solar System |last1= Zuppero|first1= Anthony |year= 1996 |publisher= [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] |booktitle= Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Space '96 |doi= 10.1061/40177(207)107|isbn= 0-7844-0177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farther out, [[Colonization of the outer Solar System#Trojan asteroids|Jupiter's Trojan asteroids]] are thought to be rich in water ice and other volatiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sanders|first=Robert|title=Binary asteroid in Jupiter's orbit may be icy comet from solar system's infancy|date=1 February 2006|publisher=UC Berkeley|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/02/01_patroclus.shtml|accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Recycling]] of some raw materials would almost certainly be necessary.

===Energy===
[[Solar energy]] in orbit is abundant, reliable, and is commonly used to power satellites today. There is no night in free space, and no clouds or atmosphere to block sunlight. Light intensity obeys an [[inverse-square law]]. So the solar energy available at distance ''d'' from the Sun is ''E'' = 1367/''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''d'' is measured in [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) and 1367 watts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the energy available at the distance of Earth's orbit from the Sun, 1 AU.&lt;ref&gt;McGRAW-HILL ENCYCLOPEDIA OF Science &amp; Technology, 8th Edition (c)1997; vol. 16 page 654&lt;/ref&gt;

In the weightlessness and vacuum of space, high temperatures for industrial processes can easily be achieved in [[solar ovens]] with huge parabolic reflectors made of metallic foil with very lightweight support structures. Flat mirrors to reflect sunlight around radiation shields into living areas (to avoid line-of-sight access for cosmic rays, or to make the Sun's image appear to move across their "sky") or onto crops are even lighter and easier to build.

Large solar power photovoltaic cell arrays or thermal power plants would be needed to meet the electrical power needs of the settlers' use. In developed parts of Earth, electrical consumption can average 1 kilowatt/person (or roughly 10 [[watt-hour|megawatt-hours]] per person per year.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/esd/energy/information/ElectricPower/1999-2000/access.htm UNESCAP Electric Power in Asia and the Pacific] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213083253/http://www.unescap.org/esd/energy/information/ElectricPower/1999-2000/access.htm |date=February 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These power plants could be at a short distance from the main structures if wires are used to transmit the power, or much farther away with [[wireless power transmission]].

A major export of the initial space settlement designs was anticipated to be large [[solar power satellite]]s that would use wireless power transmission (phase-locked [[microwave]] beams or lasers emitting wavelengths that special solar cells convert with high efficiency) to send power to locations on Earth, or to colonies on the Moon or other locations in space. For locations on Earth, this method of getting power is extremely benign, with zero emissions and far less ground area required per watt than for conventional solar panels. Once these satellites are primarily built from lunar or asteroid-derived materials, the price of SPS electricity could be lower than energy from fossil fuel or nuclear energy; replacing these would have significant benefits such as the elimination of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[nuclear waste]] from electricity generation.

Transmitting solar energy wirelessly from the Earth to the Moon and back is also an idea proposed for the benefit of space colonization and energy resources. Physicist Dr. David Criswell, who worked for NASA during the Apollo missions, came up with the idea of using power beams to transfer energy from space. These beams, microwaves with a wavelength of about 12&amp;nbsp;cm, will be almost untouched as they travel through the atmosphere. They can also be aimed at more industrial areas to keep away from humans or animal activities.&lt;ref name="i2massociates.com"&gt;[http://www.i2massociates.com/downloads/AAPG_Memoir_101-July18-2012.pdf Nuclear Power and Associated Environmental Issues in the Transition of Exploration and Mining on Earth to the Development of Off-World Natural Resources in the 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt; This will allow for safer and more reliable methods of transferring solar energy.

In 2008, scientists were able to send a 20 watt microwave signal from a mountain in Maui to the island of Hawaii. Since then [[JAXA]] and Mitsubishi has teamed up on a $21 billion project in order to place satellites in orbit which could generate up to 1 gigawatt of energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-06/satellites-could-gather-energy-sun-and-beam-it-down-earth Space Based Solar Power],&lt;!--Author?--&gt; ''Popular Science'', June 2, 2011.{{page needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the next advancements being done today in order to make energy be transmitted wirelessly for space-based solar energy.

However, the value of SPS power delivered wirelessly to other locations in space will typically be far higher than to Earth. Otherwise, the means of generating the power would need to be included with these projects and pay the heavy penalty of Earth launch costs. Therefore, other than proposed demonstration projects for power delivered to Earth,&lt;ref name="NatSecSpaceOffice2007"/&gt; the first priority for SPS electricity is likely to be locations in space, such as communications satellites, fuel depots or "orbital tugboat" boosters transferring cargo and passengers between [[low-Earth orbit]] (LEO) and other orbits such as [[geosynchronous orbit]] (GEO), [[lunar orbit]] or [[highly-eccentric Earth orbit]] (HEEO).&lt;ref name="Lewis1997"&gt;[[Mining the Sky]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|132}} The system will also rely on satellites and receiving stations on Earth to convert the energy into electricity. Because of this energy can be transmitted easily from dayside to nightside meaning power is reliable 24/7.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/moon-solar-energy-power Beaming solar energy from the Moon could solve Earth's energy crisis]; March 29, 2017; WIRED]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear power]] is sometimes proposed for colonies located on the Moon or on Mars, as the supply of solar energy is too discontinuous in these locations; the Moon has nights of two Earth weeks in duration. Mars has nights, relatively high gravity, and an atmosphere featuring [[Climate of Mars#Effect of dust storms|large dust storms]] to cover and degrade solar panels. Also, Mars' greater distance from the Sun (1.5 astronomical units, AU) translates into ''E/(1.5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.25)'' only ½-⅔ the solar energy of Earth orbit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091004020806.htm 'Trash Can' Nuclear Reactors Could Power Human Outpost On Moon Or Mars]; October 4, 2009; ScienceDaily&lt;/ref&gt; Another method would be transmitting energy wirelessly to the lunar or Martian colonies from solar power satellites (SPSs) as described above; the difficulties of generating power in these locations make the relative advantages of SPSs much greater there than for power beamed to locations on Earth. In order to also be able to fulfill the requirements of a moon base and energy to supply life support, maintenance, communications, and research, a combination of both nuclear and solar energy will be used in the first colonies.&lt;ref name="i2massociates.com"/&gt;

For both solar thermal and nuclear power generation in airless environments, such as the Moon and space, and to a lesser extent the very thin Martian atmosphere, one of the main difficulties is dispersing the [[Carnot cycle|inevitable heat generated]]. This requires fairly large radiator areas.

===Life support===
{{Further|Effect of spaceflight on the human body|Space medicine|Space food}}

In space settlements, a life support system must recycle or import all the nutrients without "crashing." The closest terrestrial analogue to space life support is possibly that of a [[nuclear submarine]]. Nuclear submarines use mechanical life support systems to support humans for months without surfacing, and this same basic technology could presumably be employed for space use. However, nuclear submarines run "open loop"—extracting oxygen from seawater, and typically dumping [[carbon dioxide]] overboard, although they recycle existing oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airitilibrary.com.libproxy1.usc.edu/Publication/alDetailedMesh?DocID=P20100106003-200911-201004190023-201004190023-1642-1650|title=A Novel Application of the SAWD-Sabatier-SPE Integrated System for CO2 Removal and O2 Regeneration in Submarine Cabins during Prolonged Voyages|last=Huang|first=Zhi|date=|website=Airiti Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling of the carbon dioxide has been approached in the literature using the [[Sabatier process]] or the [[Bosch reaction]].

Although a fully mechanistic life support system is conceivable, a [[closed ecological system]] is generally proposed for life support. The [[Biosphere 2]] project in Arizona has shown that a complex, small, enclosed, man-made biosphere can support eight people for at least a year, although there were many problems. A year or so into the two-year mission oxygen had to be replenished, which strongly suggests that they achieved atmospheric closure.

The relationship between organisms, their habitat and the non-Earth environment can be:
* Organisms and their habitat fully isolated from the environment (examples include artificial [[biosphere]], Biosphere 2, [[life support system]])
* Changing the environment to become a life-friendly habitat, a process called [[terraforming]]
* Changing organisms to become more compatible with the environment (see [[genetic engineering]], [[transhumanism]], [[cyborg]])

A combination of the above technologies is also possible.

===Radiation protection===
{{see also|Health threat from cosmic rays}}

[[Cosmic rays]] and [[solar flare]]s create a lethal radiation environment in space. In Earth orbit, the [[Van Allen belts]] make living above the Earth's atmosphere difficult. To protect life, settlements must be surrounded by sufficient mass to absorb most incoming radiation, unless magnetic or plasma radiation shields were developed.&lt;ref name = spacecraftshielding&gt;[http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~simon_g_shepherd/research/Shielding/ Spacecraft Shielding] engineering.dartmouth.edu. Retrieved 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Passive mass shielding of four metric tons per square meter of surface area will reduce radiation dosage to several [[Sievert#Yearly dose examples|mSv]] or less annually, well below the rate of some populated [[Background radiation#Natural background radiation|high natural background areas]] on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;NASA SP-413 [http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/5appendE.html Space Settlements: A Design Study. Appendix E Mass Shielding] Retrieved 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be leftover material (slag) from processing lunar soil and asteroids into oxygen, metals, and other useful materials. However, it represents a significant obstacle to maneuvering vessels with such massive bulk (mobile spacecraft being particularly likely to use less massive active shielding).&lt;ref name = spacecraftshielding/&gt; Inertia would necessitate powerful thrusters to start or stop rotation, or electric motors to spin two massive portions of a vessel in opposite senses. Shielding material can be stationary around a rotating interior.

===Self-replication===
{{see also|von Neumann probe|clanking replicator|molecular nanotechnology}}

[[Space manufacturing]] could enable self-replication. Some think it's the ultimate goal because it allows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] increase in colonies, while eliminating costs to and dependence on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Crawford, "Where are they?," ''Scientific American'' 283, no. 1 (2000 July): 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It could be argued that the establishment of such a colony would be Earth's first act of [[self-replication]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Margulis and Ricardo Guerrero, "Life as a planetary phenomenon: the colonization of Mars," ''Microbiología'' 11 (1995): 173-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Intermediate goals include colonies that expect only information from Earth (science, engineering, entertainment) and colonies that just require periodic supply of light weight objects, such as [[integrated circuit]]s, medicines, [[DNA|genetic material]] and tools.

===Psychological adjustment===
The monotony and loneliness that comes from a prolonged space mission can leave astronauts susceptible to cabin fever or having a psychotic break. Moreover, lack of sleep, fatigue, and work overload can affect an astronaut's ability to perform well in an environment such as space where every action is critical.&lt;ref&gt;Clynes, Manfred E. and Nathan S. Kline, (1960) "Cyborgs and Space," Astronautics, September, pp.&amp;nbsp;26–27 and 74-76;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population size===
In 2002, the [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[John H. Moore]] [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1936-magic-number-for-space-pioneers-calculated. estimated] that a population of 150–180 would permit a stable society to exist for 60 to 80 generations&amp;nbsp;— equivalent to 2000 years.

A much smaller initial population of as little as two women should be viable as long as human [[embryo]]s are available from Earth. Use of a [[sperm bank]] from Earth also allows a smaller starting base with negligible [[inbreeding]].

Researchers in conservation biology have tended to adopt the "50/500" rule of thumb initially advanced by Franklin and Soule. This rule says a short-term [[effective population size]] (''N''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) of 50 is needed to prevent an unacceptable rate of [[breed|inbreeding]], whereas a long‐term ''N''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; of 500 is required to maintain overall genetic variability. The ''N''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;50 prescription corresponds to an inbreeding rate of 1% per generation, approximately half the maximum rate tolerated by domestic animal breeders. The ''N''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;500 value attempts to balance the rate of gain in genetic variation due to mutation with the rate of loss due to [[genetic drift]].

Assuming a journey of 6,300 years, the astrophysicist Frédéric Marin and the particle physicist Camille Beluffi calculated that the minimum viable population for a [[generation ship]] to reach [[Proxima Centauri]] would be 98 settlers at the beginning of the mission (then the crew will breed until reaching a stable population of several hundred settlers within the ship) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1806.03856|last1=Marin|first1=F|title=Computing the minimal crew for a multi-generational space travel towards Proxima Centauri b|last2=Beluffi|first2=C|class=astro-ph.IM|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611485/this-is-how-many-people-wed-have-to-send-to-proxima-centauri-to-make-sure-someone-actually/amp/ |publisher=''[[MIT Technology Review]]'' |title=This is how many people we’d have to send to Proxima Centauri to make sure someone actually arrives |date=June 22, 2018 |quote=“We can then conclude that, under the parameters used for those simulations, a minimum crew of 98 settlers is needed for a 6,300-year multi-generational space journey towards Proxima Centauri b,” say Marin and Beluffi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Mars mission.jpg|thumb|Artist Les Bossinas' 1989 concept of [[Manned mission to Mars|Mars mission]]]]
Location is a frequent point of contention between space colonization advocates. The location of colonization can be on a physical body [[planet]], [[dwarf planet]], [[natural satellite]], or [[asteroid]] or orbiting one. For colonies not on a body see also [[space habitat]].

===Near-Earth space===

====The Moon====
{{Main|Colonization of the Moon}}
Due to its proximity and familiarity, Earth's Moon is discussed as a target for colonization. It has the benefits of proximity to Earth and lower [[escape velocity]], allowing for easier exchange of goods and services. A drawback of the Moon is its low abundance of volatiles necessary for life such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon. Water-ice deposits that exist in some polar [[Impact crater|craters]] could serve as a source for these elements. An alternative solution is to bring hydrogen from near-Earth asteroids and combine it with oxygen extracted from lunar rock.

The Moon's low surface gravity is also a concern, as it is unknown whether 1/6[[g-force|g]] is enough to maintain human health for long periods.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} &lt;!--add, or link to, something about zero-gee bone decay and the like--&gt;

The Moon's lack of atmosphere provides no protection from space radiation or meteoroids. The early Moon colonies may shelter in ancient [[Lunar lava tube]]s to gain protection. The two-week day/night cycle makes use of solar power more difficult.

====Lagrange points====
{{Main|Lagrange point colonization}}
[[File:Lagrange points.jpg|thumb|A contour plot of the [[gravitational potential]] of the [[Sun]] and [[Earth]], showing the five Earth–Sun Lagrange points]]

Another near-Earth possibility are the five Earth–Moon [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange points]]. Although they would generally also take a few days to reach with current technology, many of these points would have near-continuous solar power because their distance from Earth would result in only brief and infrequent eclipses of light from the Sun. However, the fact that the  Earth–Moon Lagrange points {{L4}} and {{L5}} tend to collect dust and debris, whereas {{L1}}-{{L3}} require active [[orbital stationkeeping|station-keeping]] measures to maintain a stable position, make them somewhat less suitable places for habitation than was originally believed. Additionally, the orbit of {{L2}}–{{L5}} takes them out of the protection of the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] for approximately two-thirds of the time, exposing them to the health threat from cosmic rays.

The five Earth–Sun Lagrange points would totally eliminate eclipses, but only {{L1}} and {{L2}} would be reachable in a few days' time. The other three Earth–Sun points would require months to reach.

===Other micro-g orbits===
See [[space habitat]]

===The inner planets===

====Mercury====
{{expand section|date=August 2018}}
{{specific|section|date=August 2018}}
Colonizing Mercury would involve similar challenges as the Moon as there are few volatile elements, no atmosphere and the surface gravity is lower than Earth's. However, the planet also receives almost seven times the solar flux as the Earth/Moon system.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Geologist Stephen Gillett suggested in 1996 that this could make Mercury an ideal place to build and launch [[solar sail]] spacecraft, which could launch as folded up "chunks" by [[mass driver]] from Mercury's surface.  Once in space the solar sails would deploy. Since Mercury's [[solar constant]] is 6.5 times higher than Earth's, energy for the mass driver should be easy to come by, and solar sails near Mercury would have 6.5 times the thrust they do near Earth. This could make Mercury an ideal place to acquire materials useful in building hardware to send to (and terraform) Venus. Vast solar collectors could also be built on or near Mercury to produce power for large scale engineering activities such as laser-pushed lightsails to nearby star systems.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Schmidt and [[Robert Zubrin]], eds., "Islands in the Sky: Bold New Ideas for Colonizing Space"; Wiley, 1996, p. 71-84&lt;/ref&gt;

====Venus====
{{Main|Colonization of Venus}}
[[File:TerraformedVenus.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a terraformed Venus]]

====Mars====
{{Main|Colonization of Mars}}

===Asteroid belt===
{{Main|Colonization of the asteroids}}
{{See also|Asteroids#Exploration}}

Colonization of asteroids would require space habitats. The [[asteroid belt]] has significant overall material available, the largest object being [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], although it is thinly distributed as it covers a vast region of space. Unmanned supply craft should be practical with little technological advance, even crossing 500 million kilometers of space. The colonists would have a strong interest in assuring their asteroid did not hit Earth or any other body of significant mass, but would have extreme difficulty in moving an asteroid{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} of any size. The orbits of the Earth and most asteroids are very distant from each other in terms of delta-v and the asteroidal bodies have enormous [[momentum]]. Rockets or mass drivers can perhaps be installed on asteroids to direct their path into a safe course.

===Moons of outer planets===

====Jovian moons&amp;nbsp;– Europa, Callisto and Ganymede====
{{Main|Colonization of Europa|Colonization of the outer Solar System}}

The [[Artemis Project]] designed a plan to colonize [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], one of [[Jupiter]]'s moons. Scientists were to inhabit [[igloo]]s and drill down into the Europan ice crust, exploring any sub-surface ocean. This plan discusses possible use of "air pockets" for human habitation. Europa is considered one of the more habitable bodies in the Solar System and so merits investigation as a possible abode for life.

NASA performed a study called ''HOPE'' (Revolutionary Concepts for '''H'''uman '''O'''uter '''P'''lanet '''E'''xploration) regarding the future exploration of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick A. Troutman (NASA Langley Research Center) et al., [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030063128.pdf Revolutionary Concepts for Human Outer Planet Exploration (HOPE)], accessed May 10, 2006 (.doc format)&lt;/ref&gt; The target chosen was [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] due to its distance from Jupiter, and thus the planet's harmful radiation. It could be possible to build a surface base that would produce fuel for further exploration of the Solar System.

Three of the [[Galilean moons]] (Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) have an abundance of volatiles that may support colonization efforts.

====Moons of Saturn&amp;nbsp;– Titan, Enceladus, and others====
{{Main|Colonization of Titan}}

[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is suggested as a target for colonization,&lt;ref name="zoob2ttn"&gt;Robert Zubrin, ''Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization'', section: Titan, pp. 163–166, Tarcher/Putnam, 1999, {{ISBN|978-1-58542-036-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it is the only moon in the Solar System to have a dense atmosphere and is rich in carbon-bearing compounds. Titan has ice water and large methane oceans.&lt;ref name=NasaNews&gt;[https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/titan/] https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/titan/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Zubrin]] identified Titan as possessing an abundance of all the elements necessary to support life{{Where?|date=December 2016}}, making Titan perhaps the most advantageous locale in the outer Solar System for colonization, and saying "In certain ways, Titan is the most hospitable extraterrestrial world within our solar system for human colonization".

[[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] is a small, icy moon orbiting close to Saturn, notable for its extremely bright surface and the geyser-like plumes of ice and water vapor that erupt from its southern polar region. If Enceladus has liquid water, it joins Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa as one of the prime places in the Solar System to look for extraterrestrial life and possible future settlements.

Other large satellites: [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], [[Dione (moon)|Dione]], [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], and [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], all have large quantities of volatiles, which can be used to support settlements.

===Trans-Neptunian region===
{{main|Colonization of trans-Neptunian objects}}

The [[Kuiper belt]] is estimated to have 70,000 bodies of 100&amp;nbsp;km or larger.

[[Freeman Dyson]] has suggested that within a few centuries human civilization will have relocated to the Kuiper belt.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, ''The Sun, The Genome, and The Internet'' (1999) Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513922-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oort cloud]] is estimated to have up to a trillion comets.

===Outside the Solar System===
[[File:LH 95.jpg|thumb|right|A [[star]] forming region in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]]]
Looking beyond the Solar System, there are up to several hundred billion potential stars with possible colonization targets. The main difficulty is the vast distances to other stars: roughly a hundred thousand times further away than the planets in the Solar System. This means that some combination of very high speed (some percentage of the [[speed of light]]), or travel times lasting centuries or millennia, would be required. These speeds are far beyond what current [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems can provide.

Many scientific papers have been published about [[interstellar travel]]. Given sufficient travel time and engineering work, both unmanned and generational voyages seem possible, though representing a very considerable technological and economic challenge unlikely to be met for some time, particularly for manned probes.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Space colonization technology could in principle allow human expansion at high, but sub-relativistic speeds, substantially less than the speed of light, ''c''.&amp;nbsp; An interstellar colony ship would be similar to a space habitat, with the addition of major propulsion capabilities and independent energy generation.

Hypothetical [[starship]] concepts proposed both by scientists and in [[hard science fiction]] include:
* A [[generation ship]] would travel much slower than light, with consequent interstellar trip times of many decades or centuries. The crew would go through generations before the journey is complete, so that none of the initial crew would be expected to survive to arrive at the destination, assuming current human lifespans.
* A [[sleeper ship]], in which most or all of the crew spend the journey in some form of [[hibernation]] or [[suspended animation]], allowing some or all who undertake the journey to survive to the end.
* An [[embryo space colonization|embryo-carrying interstellar starship]] (EIS), much smaller than a generation ship or sleeper ship, transporting human [[embryo]]s or DNA in a frozen or dormant state to the destination. (Obvious biological and psychological problems in birthing, raising, and educating such voyagers, neglected here, may not be fundamental.)
* A [[nuclear fusion]] or [[nuclear fission|fission]] powered ship (e.g. [[ion drive]]) of some kind, achieving velocities of up to perhaps 10% ''c''&amp;nbsp; permitting one-way trips to nearby stars with durations comparable to a human lifetime.
* A [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]-ship, a nuclear-powered concept proposed by [[Freeman Dyson]] which would use [[nuclear bomb|nuclear explosions]] to propel a starship. A special case of the preceding nuclear rocket concepts, with similar potential velocity capability, but possibly easier technology.
* [[Solar sail|Laser propulsion]] concepts, using some form of beaming of power from the Solar System might allow a [[solar sail|light-sail]] or other ship to reach high speeds, comparable to those theoretically attainable by the fusion-powered electric rocket, above. These methods would need some means, such as supplementary nuclear propulsion, to stop at the destination, but a hybrid (light-sail for acceleration, fusion-electric for deceleration) system might be possible.

The above concepts all appear limited to high, but still sub-relativistic speeds, due to fundamental energy and reaction mass considerations, and all would entail trip times which might be enabled by space colonization technology, permitting self-contained habitats with lifetimes of decades to centuries. Yet human interstellar expansion at average speeds of even 0.1% of ''c''&amp;nbsp; would permit settlement of the entire Galaxy in less than one half of a galactic rotation period of ~250,000,000 years, which is comparable to the timescale of other galactic processes. Thus, even if interstellar travel at near relativistic speeds is never feasible (which cannot be clearly determined at this time), the development of space colonization could allow human expansion beyond the Solar System without requiring technological advances that cannot yet be reasonably foreseen. This could greatly improve the chances for the survival of intelligent life over cosmic timescales, given the many natural and human-related hazards that have been widely noted.

If humanity does gain access to a large amount of energy, on the order of the mass-energy of entire planets, it may eventually become feasible to construct [[Alcubierre drive]]s. These are one of the few methods of superluminal travel which may be possible under current physics. However it is probable that such a device could never exist, due to the fundamental challenges posed. For more on this see [[Alcubierre drive#Difficulties|Difficulties of making and using an Alcubierre Drive]].

====Intergalactic travel====
{{Main article|Intergalactic travel}} 
Looking beyond the Milky Way, there are at least 2 trillion other galaxies in the observable universe. The distances between galaxies are on the order of a million times farther than those between the stars. Because of the speed of light limit on how fast any material objects can travel in space, intergalactic travel would either have to involve voyages lasting millions of years,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Armstrong and Anders Sandberg, "Eternity in six hours: Intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox," ''Acta Astronautica'' 89 (2013): 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt; or a possible faster than light propulsion method based on speculative physics, such as the [[Alcubierre drive]]. There are, however, no scientific reasons for stating that [[intergalactic travel]] is impossible in principle.

==Funding==
Space colonization can roughly be said to be possible when the necessary methods of space colonization become [[Economic behavior|cheap enough]] (such as space access by cheaper launch systems) to meet the cumulative funds that have been gathered for the purpose.

Although there are no immediate prospects for the large amounts of money required for space colonization to be available given traditional launch costs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/Basics/wwwwh.html Space Settlement Basics] by Al Globus, NASA Ames Research Center. Last Updated: February 02, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}
there is some prospect of a radical reduction to launch costs in the 2010s, which would consequently lessen the cost of any efforts in that direction. With a published price of {{USD|56.5 million}} per launch of up to {{convert|13150|kg|abbr=on}} payload&lt;ref name=sxCapabilitiesSvcs20131211&gt;{{cite web|title=SpaceX Capabilities and Services |url=http://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities |year=2013&lt;!-- copyright date; no other date provided --&gt; |publisher=SpaceX |accessdate=2013-12-11}} &lt;!-- SpaceX refers to these prices as the "PAID IN FULL STANDARD LAUNCH PRICES (2013)" --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to [[low Earth orbit]], [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9]] rockets are already the "cheapest in the industry".&lt;ref name=fp20131209/&gt; Advancements currently being developed as part of the [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program]] to enable reusable Falcon 9s "could drop the price by an order of magnitude, sparking more space-based enterprise, which in turn would drop the cost of access to space still further through economies of scale."&lt;ref name=fp20131209&gt;{{cite news |last=Belfiore|first=Michael |title=The Rocketeer |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/12/02/the_rocketeer_elon_musk |accessdate=2013-12-11 |newspaper=Foreign Policy |date=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; If SpaceX is successful in developing the reusable technology, it would be expected to "have a major impact on the cost of access to space", and change the increasingly [[competition (economics)|competitive market]] in space launch services.&lt;ref name="bbc20130930"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24331860 |title=Recycled rockets: SpaceX calls time on expendable launch vehicles |publisher=BBC News |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy]] suggested that an [[Inducement prize contest|inducement prize]] should be established, perhaps by government, for the achievement of space colonization, for example by offering the prize to the first organization to place humans on the Moon and sustain them for a fixed period before they return to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/60736main_M2M_report_small.pdf A Journey to Inspire, Innovate, and Discover] - Report of the [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy]], June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrestrial analogues to space colonies==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
The most famous attempt to build an analogue to a self-sufficient colony is [[Biosphere 2]], which attempted to duplicate Earth's biosphere. [[BIOS-3]] is another [[closed ecosystem]], completed in 1972 in [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ecowatch.com/the-worlds-largest-earth-science-experiment-biosphere-2-1882107636.html|title=The World's Largest Earth Science Experiment: Biosphere 2|date=2015-10-16|work=EcoWatch|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[space agency|space agencies]] build testbeds for advanced life support systems, but these are designed for long duration [[human spaceflight]], not permanent colonization.

Remote research stations in inhospitable climates, such as the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/support/southp.jsp|title=Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Devon Island]] [[Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station|Mars Arctic Research Station]], can also provide some practice for off-world outpost construction and operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/stories/devon-island-close-mars-you-may-get|title=Devon Island is as close to Mars as you may get|work=MNN - Mother Nature Network|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mars Desert Research Station]] has a habitat for similar reasons, but the surrounding climate is not strictly inhospitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/12/exploring-mars-utah-mock-mission-simulation-space-science/|title=8 Amazing Places You Can Visit ‘Mars’ on Earth|date=2016-12-12|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first known work on space colonization was ''[[The Brick Moon]]'', a work of fiction published in 1869 by [[Edward Everett Hale]], about an inhabited artificial satellite.&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Hale. ''[[The Brick Moon]]''. Atlantic Monthly, Vol. 24, 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian schoolmaster and physicist [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] foresaw elements of the space community in his book ''Beyond Planet Earth'' written about 1900. Tsiolkovsky had his space travelers building greenhouses and raising crops in space.&lt;ref&gt;K. E. Tsiolkovsky. ''Beyond Planet Earth''. Trans. by Kenneth Syers. Oxford, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Tsiolkovsky believed that going into space would help perfect human beings, leading to immortality and peace.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.informatics.org/museum/tsiol.html The life of Konstantin Eduardovitch Tsiolkovsky 1857–1935] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615044125/http://www.informatics.org/museum/tsiol.html |date=June 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have also written about space colonies as Lasswitz in 1897 and Bernal, Oberth, Von Pirquet and Noordung in the 1920s. [[Wernher von Braun]] contributed his ideas in a 1952 ''Colliers'' article. In the 1950s and 1960s, [[Dandridge M. Cole]]&lt;ref&gt;Dandridge M. Cole and Donald W. Cox ''Islands in Space.'' Chilton, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; published his ideas.

Another seminal book on the subject was the book ''The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space'' by [[Gerard K. O'Neill]]&lt;ref&gt;G. K. O'Neill. ''The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space''. Morrow, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1977 which was followed the same year by ''Colonies in Space '' by [[T. A. Heppenheimer]].&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Heppenheimer. ''Colonies in Space''. Stackpole Books, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

M. Dyson wrote ''Home on the Moon; Living on a Space Frontier'' in 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Marianne J. Dyson: Living on a Space Frontier. National Geographic, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Eckart wrote ''Lunar Base Handbook'' in 2006&lt;ref&gt;Peter Eckart. ''Lunar Base Handbook''. McGraw-Hill, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and then Harrison Schmitt's ''Return to the Moon'' written in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison H. Schmitt. '' Return to the Moon''. Springer, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2013}}, [[Bigelow Aerospace]] is the only [[private spaceflight|private commercial spaceflight]] company that has launched two experimental space station modules, [[Genesis I]] (2006) and [[Genesis II]] (2007),&lt;ref name=sn20070628&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/4007-bigelow-orbital-module-launches-space.html |title=Bigelow's Second Orbital Module Launches Into Space |work=Space.com |first1=Tariq|last1=Malik |first2=Leonard|last2=David |date=June 28, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; into [[low-Earth orbit|Earth-orbit]], and has indicated that their first production model of the space habitat, the [[BA 330]], could be launched by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;

==Planetary protection==

{{see also|Planetary protection}}
Robotic spacecraft to Mars are required to be sterilized, to have at most 300,000 spores on the exterior of the craft—and more thoroughly sterilized if they contact "special regions" containing water,&lt;ref name=groundwatercontamination&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-27526981 Queens University Belfast scientist helps NASA Mars project] "No-one has yet proved that there is deep groundwater on Mars, but it is plausible as there is certainly surface ice and atmospheric water vapour, so we wouldn't want to contaminate it and make it unusable by the introduction of micro-organisms."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COSPAR PLANETARY PROTECTION POLICY"&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2012/05/04/COSPAR_Planetary_Protection_Policy_v3-24-11.pdf COSPAR PLANETARY PROTECTION POLICY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306111646/https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2012/05/04/COSPAR_Planetary_Protection_Policy_v3-24-11.pdf |date=2013-03-06 }} (20 October 2002; As Amended to 24 March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise there is a risk of contaminating not only the life-detection experiments but possibly the planet itself.

It is impossible to sterilize human missions to this level, as humans are host to typically a hundred trillion [[microorganism]]s of thousands of species of the [[human microbiome]], and these cannot be removed while preserving the life of the human. Containment seems the only option, but it is a major challenge in the event of a hard landing (i.e. crash).&lt;ref name=biospherescollide&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/when_biospheres_collide_detail.html#.U_uVh_mwJcQ When Biospheres Collide – a history of NASA's Planetary Protection Programs], Michael Meltzer , May 31, 2012, see Chapter 7, Return to Mars – final section: "Should we do away with human missions to sensitive targets"&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several planetary workshops on this issue, but with no final guidelines for a way forward yet.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, James E. [http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/ppw2015/pdf/1010.pdf "Planetary Protection Knowledge Gaps for Human Extraterrestrial Missions: Goals and Scope." (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt; Human explorers would also be vulnerable to back contamination to Earth if they become carriers of microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10360&amp;page=37 Safe on Mars page 37] "Martian biological contamination may occur if astronauts breathe contaminated dust or if they contact material that is introduced into their habitat. If an astronaut becomes contaminated or infected, it is conceivable that he or she could transmit Martian biological entities or even disease to fellow astronauts, or introduce such entities into the biosphere upon returning to Earth. A contaminated vehicle or item of equipment returned to Earth could also be a source of contamination."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections ==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
A corollary to the [[Fermi paradox]]—"nobody else is doing it"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/06/26/no-we-cannot-know-whether-humans-are-alone-in-the-universe/|title=No, We Haven't Solved The Drake Equation, The Fermi Paradox, Or Whether Humans Are Alone|last=Siegel|first=Ethan|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;—is the argument that, because no evidence of [[Fermi paradox#Alien constructs|alien colonization technology]] exists, it is statistically unlikely to even be possible to use that same level of technology ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/why-aliens-have-not-contacted-humans-2015-9|title=The likeliest reasons why we haven’t contacted aliens are deeply unsettling|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonizing space would require massive amounts of financial, physical, and human capital devoted to research, development, production, and deployment. Earth's [[natural resource]]s do not increase to a noteworthy extent (which is in keeping with the "only one Earth" position of environmentalists). Thus, considerable efforts in colonizing places outside Earth would appear as a hazardous waste of the Earth's limited resources for an aim without a clear end.

The fundamental problem of public things, needed for survival, such as space programs, is the [[free rider problem]]. Convincing the public to fund such programs would require additional self-interest arguments: If the objective of space colonization is to provide a "backup" in case everyone on Earth is killed, then why should someone on Earth pay for something that is only useful after they are dead? This assumes that space colonization is not widely acknowledged as a sufficiently valuable social goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/free-rider/|title=Free Rider - Overview, Examples of Free Rider Problem in Society|work=Corporate Finance Institute|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seen as a relief to the problem of overpopulation even as early as 1758,&lt;ref name = tsr2009&gt;[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1296/1 Planetary demographics and space colonization]; Nader Elhefnawy, The Space Review, February 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--would be best if the original article that Otto Diederich Lutken published were put here--&gt; and listed as one of Stephen Hawking's reasons for pursuing space exploration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/7935505/Stephen-Hawking-mankind-must-move-to-outer-space-within-a-century.html|title=Stephen Hawking: mankind must move to outer space within a century|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become apparent that space colonisation in response to overpopulation is unwarranted. Indeed, the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by fertility rate|birth rates]] of many developed countries, specifically [[spacefaring|spacefaring ones]], are at or below replacement rates, thus negating the need to use colonisation as a means of population control.&lt;ref name = tsr2009/&gt;

Other objections include concerns that the forthcoming colonization and [[commodification]] of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful, including major economic and military institutions e.g. the large financial institutions, the major aerospace companies and the [[military–industrial complex]], to lead to new [[war]]s, and to exacerbate pre-existing exploitation of [[Exploitation of labour|workers]] and [[Exploitation of natural resources|resources]], [[economic inequality]], [[poverty]], social [[Social division|division]] and [[Social exclusion|marginalization]], environmental degradation, and other detrimental processes or institutions.&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2010-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2008-02/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2017-03/&gt;

Additional concerns include creating a culture in which humans are no longer seen as human, but rather as material assets. The issues of [[human dignity]], [[morality]], [[philosophy]], [[culture]], [[bioethics]], and the threat of [[megalomaniac]] leaders in these new "societies" would all have to be addressed in order for space colonization to meet the [[psychology|psychological]] and [[Group (sociology)|social]] needs of people living in isolated colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/sociology.html Sociology and Space Development] B.J. Bluth, Sociology Department, California State University, Northridge, SPACE SOCIAL SCIENCE&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative or addendum for the future of the human race, many science fiction writers have focused on the realm of the 'inner-space', that is the computer-aided exploration of the [[human mind]] and human [[consciousness]]—possibly en route developmentally to a [[Matrioshka Brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://curiosity.com/topics/a-matrioshka-brain-is-a-computer-the-size-of-a-solar-system-curiosity/|title=A Matrioshka Brain Is A Computer The Size Of A Solar System|website=curiosity.com|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unmanned space mission|Robotic exploration]] is proposed as an alternative to gain many of the same scientific advantages without the limited mission duration and high cost of life support and return transportation involved in manned missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/report/robotic-planetary-exploration/|title=Robotic Exploration of the Solar System|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern is the potential to cause [[interplanetary contamination]] on planets that may harbor hypothetical [[extraterrestrial life]].

===Physical, mental and emotional health risks to colonizers===
{{main|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}
An additional concern is the health of the humans who may participate in a colonization venture, including a range of physical, mental and emotional health risks.

==Involved organizations==

Organizations that contribute to space colonization include:
* The [[Space Studies Institute]] funds the study of space habitats.

In the late 1960s, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA), through the federally-funded [[Indian Health Service]] (IHS), covertly imposed a policy of involuntary surgical sterilization upon Native American women in the United States.&lt;ref name=ForcedSterilization&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6242/Forced-Sterilization-of-Native-Americans.html|title=Forced Sterilization of Native Americans|last=|first=|date=|website=Encylopedia JRank|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was only revealed when members of the [[American Indian Movement]] occupied the offices of the BIA in 1972.&lt;ref name=ForcedSterilization/&gt;&lt;ref name=Volscho /&gt; The U.S. General Accounting Office found that the Indian Health Service sterilized 3,406 Native American women between 1973 and 1976. The study showed that 36 women under age 21 were forcibly sterilized regardless of a court-ordered moratorium on sterilizations of women younger than 21.&lt;ref name=NV&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/543.html|title=Native Voices|last=|first=|date=|website=NLM|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] | title= Investigation of Allegations Concerning Indian Health Service | url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/120/117355.pdf | access-date=May 29, 2015 | date=November 4, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; One out of four Native American women were involuntarily sterilized through [[tubal ligation]] or [[hysterectomy]].&lt;ref name=MRL&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralstin-Lewis|first1=D. Marie|title=The Continuing Struggle against Genocide: Indigenous Women's Reproductive Rights|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|date=2005|volume=20|issue=2|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure was often done under the pretense of a check up or abortion and most individuals were not aware they had been sterilized. In the 1970s, the average [[birth rate]] of Native American women was 3.7 however, in 1980 it fell to 1.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Jane|title=The Sterilization of Native American Women|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=24|issue=3|page=402|date = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, forced and coerced sterilizations are alleged to have happened as recently as 2017. In November, 2018, it was announced that over 60 Indigenous women are pursuing a class-action lawsuit alleging they underwent forced or coerced sterilizations over the past 20 to 25 years in [[Saskatchewan]], in which they were not allowed contact with their newborns until they signed forms "consenting" to tubal ligations.&lt;ref name=CBC-11-13-18 /&gt;

== Types of sterilization ==
In the 1970s, after being forced onto [[Indian reservation|reservations]] by the United States government, or [[Indian Relocation Act of 1956|relocated into urban areas]] without adequate support, many Native Americans were struggling with [[poverty]]. The [[Indian Health Service]] (IHS) was their main health provider. A common sterilization procedure was the [[hysterectomy]], a form of permanent sterilization in which the [[uterus]] is removed through the patient's [[abdomen]] or [[vagina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sterilization Abuse: A Proposed Regulatory Scheme|journal=DePaul Law Review|volume=28|issue=3|page=734|last1=Kelly|first1=Mary E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hysterectomies were often performed on Native American women by [[Residency (medicine)|residents]] without the patient's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peal|first1=Tiesha|title=The Continuing Sterilization of Undesirables in America|journal=Rutgers Race and the Law Review|date=2004|volume=6|issue=1|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common form of sterilization was tubal ligation, a sterilization procedure in which a woman's [[fallopian tubes]] are tied, blocked, or cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carpio|first1=Myla |title=The Lost Generation: American Indian and Sterilization Abuse|journal=Social Justice|date=2004|volume=31|issue=4|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quinacrine]] was also used to sterilize Native American women.  Quinacrine is commonly used to treat [[malaria]], but can also be used for non-surgical sterilization. Capsules inserted into the uterus spread and destroy the lining of the Fallopian tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralstin-Lewis|first1=D. Marie|title=The Continuing Struggles against Genocide: Indigenous Women's Reproductive Rights|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|date=2005|volume=20|issue=1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-permanent forms of sterilization were also used including [[Depo-Provera]] and [[Norplant]]. Depo-Provera was used mainly on [[intellectually disabled]] Native American women before it gained clearance from the FDA in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4140251|title=The Continuing Struggle against Genocide: Indigenous Women's Reproductive Rights|last=Ralston-Lewis|first=D. Marie|date=|publisher=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norplant, promoted by the IHS, was marketed by [[Wyeth Pharmaceuticals]] (who were sued over insufficient disclosure of side effects including irregular menstrual bleeding, headaches, nausea and depression). Side effects of these two types of sterilization included the cessation of the menstrual cycle and excessive bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralstin-Lewis|first1=D. Marie|title=The Continuing Struggle against Genocide: Indigenous Women's Reproductive Rights|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|date=2005|volume=20|issue=1|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using 2002 data from the [[National Survey of Family Growth]], the Urban Indian Health Institute found that among women using contraception, the most common methods used by urban American Indian and Alaskan Native women age 15–44 years were female sterilization (34%), oral contraceptive pills (21%), and male condoms (21%). However among the urban Non-Hispanic Whites, the most common methods were oral contraceptive pills 36%),  female sterilization (20%) and male condoms (18%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Urban Indian Health Institute, Seattle Indian Health Board.| title=Reproductive Health of Urban American Indian and Alaska Native Women: Examining Unintended Pregnancy, Contraception, Sexual History and Behavior, and Non-Voluntary Sexual Intercourse. | date=2010| access-date=June 14, 2016 |page=23 | url=http://mchb.hrsa.gov/research/documents/finalreports/forquera_r40_mc_08954_final_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Excuses for sterilization ==
[[Racism]] and harmful [[stereotypes]] of the Native American population, held by members of the dominant culture, were factors that made Native American women targets for sterilization. The media commonly referred to Native American women by misogynist, racist [[Pejorative|slurs]] such as "[[squaw]]",&lt;ref name=Volscho/&gt; defined as a "dirty, subservient, abused, alcoholic and ugly woman who loves to torture white men."&lt;ref name=Volscho/&gt; Negative racial stereotypes propagated the belief among the dominant culture that Native American women were unfit to raise or to have children in comparison to white women.&lt;ref name=Volscho/&gt; First Nations women who have given birth in white hospitals have been coerced into being sterilized against their will; often being told it was mandatory before seeing their babies,&lt;ref name=CBC-11-13-18 /&gt; or being lied to that it was a requirement of the delivery process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Mary E.|title=Sterilization Abuse: A Proposed Regulatory Scheme|journal=De Paul Law Review|date=1979|volume=28|issue=3|page=733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not agreeing to the sterilization procedure would result in the withdrawal of [[welfare]] benefits. Consent forms presented to them failed to indicate that the decision would affect their ability to bear children in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Jane|title=The Indian Health Service and the Sterilization of Native American Women|journal=American Indian Quarterly|date=2000|volume=24|issue=3|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies by the [[Health Research Group]] in 1973 and [[Doctor Bernard Rosenfeld]]'s interviews in 1974 and 1975 show that this action was driven by social and economic factors.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Jane|title=The Indian Health Service and the Sterilization of Native American Women|journal=American Indian Quarterly|date=2000|volume=24|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the white physicians performing this procedure viewed sterilization as the best alternative for these women. They claimed it would improve their financial situation and their family's quality of life.&lt;ref name="Carpio"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carpio|first1=Myla|title=The Lost Generation: American Indian and Sterilization Abuse|journal=Social Justice|date=2004|volume=31|issue=4|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physicians were paid more for performing hysterectomies and tubal ligations than for prescribing other forms of birth control.&lt;ref name="Lawrence" /&gt; The influx of surgical procedures was seen as a training for physicians and as a practice for resident physicians. In 1971, Dr. James Ryan stated that he favored hysterectomies over tubal ligations because "it's more of a challenge...and it's good experience for the junior resident".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peal|first1=Tiesha|title=The Continuing Sterilization of the Undesirables in America|journal=Rutgers Race and the Law Review|volume=6|issue=1|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; With fewer people applying for Medicaid and welfare, the federal government could decrease spending on welfare programs.&lt;ref name="Lawrence" /&gt;

In the 1970s, the negative stereotypes of Native American women held by members of the dominant culture, along with racist beliefs of white superiority, contributed to the belief among white physicians that these women would not be able to limit the number of children or use birth control effectively. These factors all contributed to the sterilization policy.&lt;ref name="Lawrence" /&gt;

==IHS regulations==
The [[Indian Health Service]] (IHS) continues to offer sterilization as a method of family planning.  Tubal ligation and vasectomy are the only procedures which may be performed for the primary purpose of sterilization. Legally, the IHS requires for the patient to give informed consent to the operation, be 21 years of age or older, and not be institutionalized in a correctional or mental health facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Indian Health Service  | title=Indian Health Manual § 3-13.12(F)(5) | url=http://www.ihs.gov/IHM/index.cfm?module=dsp_ihm_pc_p3c13#3-13.12F5 | access-date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]], '''sublimation''' is a [[Defense mechanism#Level 4: Mature|mature type]] of [[defense mechanism]], in which socially unacceptable impulses or idealizations are transformed into socially acceptable actions or behavior, possibly resulting in a long-term conversion of the initial impulse.

[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that sublimation was a sign of [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]] and [[civilization]], allowing people to function normally in culturally acceptable ways. He defined sublimation as the process of deflecting sexual instincts into acts of higher social valuation, being "an especially conspicuous feature of cultural development; it is what makes it possible for higher psychical activities, scientific, artistic or ideological, to play such an "important" part in civilized life".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, '[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]' (1930) in The Standard Edition Of ''The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud&amp;nbsp;– The Future of an Illusion, Civilization and its Discontents, and Other Works'', trans. by James Strachey (Hogarth Press; London, 1961), vol. XXI, 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; Wade and Travis present a similar view, stating that sublimation is when [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] "serves a higher cultural or socially useful purpose, as in the creation of art or inventions".&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Carol and Carol Travis, ''Psychology'', Sixth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2000) 478. {{ISBN|0-321-04931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
&lt;ref&gt;Walter Arnold Kaufmann, Nietzsche: philosopher, psychologist, Antichrist, Chapter 7, section II, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening section of ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' entitled 'Of first and last things', Nietzsche wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is, strictly speaking, neither unselfish conduct, nor a wholly disinterested point of view. Both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seems almost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenest observation. All that we need and that could possibly be given us in the present state of development of the sciences, is a chemistry of the moral, religious, aesthetic conceptions and feeling, as well as of those emotions which we experience in the affairs, great and small, of society and civilization, and which we are sensible of even in solitude. But what if this chemistry established the fact that, even in its domain, the most magnificent results were attained with the basest and most despised ingredients? Would many feel disposed to continue such investigations? Mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin and beginning: must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow the opposite course?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38145/38145-h/38145-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Human, All Too Human, by Friedrich Nietzsche.|work=gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Psychoanalytic theory ==
In Freud's psychoanalytical theory, erotic energy is allowed a limited amount of expression, owing to the constraints of human society and civilization itself. It therefore requires other outlets, especially if an individual is to remain psychologically balanced.

Sublimation ({{lang-de|Sublimierung}}) is the process of transforming [[libido]] into "socially useful" achievements, including artistic, cultural and intellectual pursuits. Freud considered this psychical operation to be fairly salutary compared to the others that he identified, such as [[Psychological repression|repression]], [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], [[denial]], [[reaction formation]], [[intellectualisation]], and [[Psychological projection|projection]]. In ''The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence'' (1936), his daughter, Anna, classed sublimation as one of the major 'defence mechanisms' of the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Freud, The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (Karnac Books, 2011), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud got the idea of '''sublimation''' while reading ''[[Die Harzreise|The Harz Journey]]'' by [[Heinrich Heine]]. The story is about [[Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach]] who cut off the tails of dogs he encountered in childhood and later became a surgeon. Freud concluded that sublimation could be observed in an action performed many times throughout one's life, which firstly appears sadistic, though is ultimately refined into an activity which is of benefit to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Geller, J.(2009). "Of Snips... and Puppy Dog Tails": Freud's Sublimation of Judentum. American Imago66(2), 169-184. The Johns Hopkins University Press. Retrieved April 6, 2012, from Project MUSE database.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpersonal psychoanalysis ===
[[Harry Stack Sullivan]], the pioneer of [[interpersonal psychoanalysis]], defined sublimation as the unwitting substitution of a partial satisfaction with social approval for the pursuit of a direct satisfaction which would be contrary to one's ideals or to the judgment of social censors and other important people who surround one. The substitution might not be quite what we want, but it is the only way that we can get part of our satisfaction and feel secure, too. Sullivan documented that all sublimatory things are more complicated than the direct satisfaction of the needs to which they apply. They entail no disturbance of consciousness, no stopping to think why they must be done or what the expense connected with direct satisfaction would be. In successful sublimation, Sullivan observed extraordinarily efficient handling of a conflict between the need for a satisfaction and the need for security without perturbation of awareness.

== Sexual sublimation ==
'''Sexual sublimation''', also known as '''sexual transmutation''', is the act, especially among some religious traditions, to transform sexual impulses or "sexual energy" into creative energy. In this context, sublimation is the [[transference]] of sexual energy, or [[libido]], into a physical act or a different emotion in order to avoid confrontation with the sexual urge, which is itself contrary to the individual's belief or ascribed religious belief. It is based on the idea that "sexual energy" can be used to create a spiritual nature which in turn can create more sensual works, instead of one's sexuality being unleashed "raw".&lt;ref name="Sivananda1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|authorlink=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|title=Brahmacharya (Celibacy)|url=http://www.sivanandadlshq.org/teachings/brahmacharya.htm|accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samael Aun Weor|authorlink=Samael Aun Weor|title=The Transmutation of Sexual Energy|url=http://www.gnosticteachings.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=43|accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami|authorlink=Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami|title=Cognizantability: Section 2, The Basic Laws of Transmutation|url=http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/mws/mws_cgz_sect-02.html|accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical example in [[Western religions]] is [[clerical celibacy]].

As espoused in the [[Tanya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Likkutei Amarim Tanya I|last=|first=R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi|publisher=Kehot|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=ch. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hasidic]] Jewish mysticism views sublimation of the animal soul as an essential task in life, wherein the goal is to transform animalistic and earthy cravings for physical pleasure into holy desires to connect with God.

Different schools of thought describe general sexual urges as carriers of spiritual essence, and have the varied names of vital energy, vital winds ([[prana]]), spiritual energy, [[ojas]], [[shakti]], [[tummo]], or [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]]. It is also believed that undergoing sexual sublimation can facilitate a mystical awakening in an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|authorlink=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|title=Techniques of Sex Sublimation|url=http://atmajyoti.org/sw_techniques_sex_sublimation.asp|accessdate=2006-07-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060717184624/http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_techniques_sex_sublimation.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swami Krishnananda Saraswati|url=http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_brahmacharya_outlook_consciousness.asp|title=Brahmacharya&amp;nbsp;– An Outlook of Consciousness|accessdate=2006-07-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615043338/http://atmajyoti.org/sw_brahmacharya_outlook_consciousness.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Swami Chidananda|authorlink=Swami Chidananda Saraswati|url=http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_role_of_celibacy_in_spiritual_life.asp|title=The Role of Celibacy in the Spiritual Life|accessdate=2006-07-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041226120409/http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_role_of_celibacy_in_spiritual_life.asp|archivedate=2004-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== According to Jung ==

[[C. G. Jung]] believed sublimation to be mystical in nature, thus differing fundamentally from Freud's view of the concept. For Freud, sublimation helped explain the plasticity of the sexual instincts (and their convertibility to non-sexual ends). The concept also underpinned his psychoanalytical theories, which showed the human psyche at the mercy of conflicting impulses (such as the [[super-ego]] and the [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]]). Jung criticized Freud for obscuring the alchemical origins of sublimation and for attempting instead to make the concept appear scientifically credible:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Sublimation is part of the royal art where the true gold is made. Of this Freud knows nothing; worse still, he barricades all the paths that could lead to true sublimation. This is just about the opposite of what Freud understands by sublimation. It is not a voluntary and forcible channeling of instinct into a spurious field of application, but an alchymical transformation for which fire and prima materia are needed. Sublimation is a great mystery. Freud has appropriated this concept and usurped it for the sphere of the will and the bourgeois, rationalistic ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, Letters, ed. By G. Adler and A. Jaffé (Princeton University Press; Princeton, 1974), vol. 1, 171,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This criticism extends from the private sphere of his correspondence (as above) to specific papers he published on psychoanalysis:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Freud invented the idea of sublimation to save us from the imaginary claws of the unconscious. But what is real, what actually exists, cannot be alchemically sublimated, and if anything is apparently sublimated it never was what a false interpretation took it to be.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, Dreams: (From Volumes 4, 8, 12, and 16 of the Collected Works of C. G. Jung), Princeton University Press (2012), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== According to Lacan ==

=== ''Das Ding'' ===

Lacan's exposition of sublimation is framed within a discussion about the relationship of psychoanalysis and ethics within the seventh book of his seminars.&lt;ref&gt;The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacanian sublimation is defined with reference to the concept ''Das Ding'' (later in his career Lacan termed this ''[[objet petit a]]''); ''Das Ding'' is German for 'the thing' though Lacan conceives it as an abstract notion and one of the defining characteristics of the human condition. Broadly speaking it is the vacuum one experiences as a human being and which one endeavours to fill with differing human relationships, objects and experiences all of which serve to plug a gap in one's psychical needs. For this reason Lacan also considers ''Das Ding'' to be a non-Thing or vacuole.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 134, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationships which one relies on to overcome the vacuity of ''Das Ding'' are always insufficient in wholly satisfying the individual.

Lacan considers ''Das Ding'' a lost object ever in the process of being recuperated by Man. Temporarily the individual will be duped by his or her own psyche into believing that this object, this person or this circumstance can be relied upon to satisfy his needs in a stable and enduring manner when in fact 'it is in its nature that the object as such is lost. It will never be found again. Something is there while one waits for something better, or worse, but which one wants'&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 52"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and again '[Das Ding] is to be found at the most as something missed. One doesn't find it, but only its pleasurable associations.'&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 52"/&gt; Human life unravels as a series of detours in the quest for the lost object or the absolute Other of the individual: 'The pleasure principle governs the search for the object and imposes detours which maintain the distance to ''Das Ding'' in relation to its end.'&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lacanian sublimation ===

Lacanian sublimation centres to a large part on the notion of ''Das Ding''. His general formula for sublimation is that 'it raises an object ... to the dignity of The Thing.&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 112"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan considers these objects (whether human, aesthetic, credal or philosophical) to be signifiers which are representative of ''Das Ding'' and that 'the function of the pleasure principle is, in effect, to lead the subject from signifier to signifier, by generating as many signifiers as are required to maintain at as low a level as possible the tension that regulates the whole functioning of the psychic apparatus.'&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 119"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, man is the 'artisan of his support system',&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 119"/&gt; in other words, he creates or finds the signifiers which delude him into believing he has overcome the emptiness of ''Das Ding''.

Lacan also considers sublimation to be process of creation ''ex nihilo''&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, pp. 115-127.&lt;/ref&gt; (creating out of nothing), whereby an object, human or manufactured, comes to be defined in relation to the emptiness of ''Das Ding''. Lacan's prime example of this is the courtly love of the troubadours and ''Minnesänger''&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 112"/&gt; who dedicated their poetic verse to a love-object which was not only unreachable (and therefore experienced as something missing) but whose existence and desirability also centred around a hole (the vagina&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 163"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;). For Lacan such courtly love was 'a paradigm of sublimation'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; He affirms that the word 'troubadour' is etymologically linked to the Provençal verb ''trobar'' (like the French ''trouver'') 'to find.'&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; If we consider again the definition of ''Das Ding'', it is dependent precisely on the expectation of the subject to re-find the lost object in the mistaken belief that it will continue to satisfy him (or her).

Lacan maintains that creation ''ex nihilo'' operates in other noteworthy fields as well. In pottery for example vases are created around an empty space.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; They are primitive and even primordial artefacts which have benefited mankind not only in the capacity of utensils but also as metaphors of (cosmic) creation ''ex nihilo''. Lacan cites Heidegger who situates the vase between the earthly (raising clay from the ground) and the ethereal (pointing upwards to receive).&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; In architecture, Lacan asserts, buildings are designed around an empty space and in art paintings proceed from an empty canvas,&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 130"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; and often depict empty spaces through perspective.

In myth, Pan pursues the nymph Syrinx who is transformed into hollow reeds in order to avoid the clutches of the God, who subsequently cuts the reeds down in anger and transforms them into what we today call panpipes&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 163"/&gt; (both reeds and panpipes rely on their hollowness for the production of sound).

Lacan briefly remarks that religion and science are also based around emptiness. In regard to religion, Lacan refers the reader to Freud, stating that much obsessional religious behaviour can be attributed to the avoidance of the primordial emptiness of ''Das Ding'' or in the respecting of it.&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 130"/&gt; As for the discourse of science this is based on the notion of ''Verwerfung''&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; (the German word for 'dismissal') which results in the dismissing, foreclosing or exclusion of the notion of ''Das Ding'' presumably because it defies empirical categorisation.

==Empirical research==
A study by Kim, Zeppenfeld, and Cohen studied sublimation by empirical methods.&lt;ref name="kim13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim |first1=Emily |last2=Zeppenfeld |first2=Veronika |last3=Cohen |first3=Dov|title=Sublimation, culture, and creativity.|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|date=2013 |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=639–666 |doi=10.1037/a0033487}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These investigators view their research, published in the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', as providing "possibly the first experimental evidence for sublimation and [suggesting] a cultural psychological approach to defense mechanisms".&lt;ref name="kim13"/&gt;{{rp|639}}

== In fiction ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
*One of the best known examples in Western literature is in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novella, ''[[Death in Venice]]'', where the protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous writer, sublimates his desire for an adolescent boy into writing [[poetry]].
*In [[Alberto Moravia]]'s novel, [[Io e lui (novel)|''Io e lui'' (''Him and Me'', 1971)]], the protagonist is in a constant unsuccessful quest to overcome the power of his large [[penis]], so he sublimates into a serious [[film director]].
*In ''Psychological Science: Mind, Brain and Behavior,'' by [[Michael Gazzaniga]] and [[Todd Heatherton|Todd F. Heatherton]], a more sinister example is given in which a [[sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] becomes a [[surgeon]] or a [[dentist]]. A direct example of this is in the musical and movie ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' characterized in the descriptively sadistic character of Orin Scrivello who follows his mother's advice to become a dentist, quoting her "You'll find a way/to make your natural tendencies pay ... Son, be a dentist/People will pay you to be inhumane."
*[[Agatha Christie]]'s novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' features a villain whose line of work as a judge, dealing out harsh sentences to guilty criminals, had previously permitted him to sublimate his homicidal urges.
* Sexual transmutation was quoted in [[Napoleon Hill]]'s book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (1937), and was illustrated as a principle of success.
* In the ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' episode "[[Criminal Minds (season 7)|The Bittersweet Science]]", it's mentioned that children with a violent past grow up to be police officers or soldiers, not necessarily boxers.
* In ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' by [[Neil Stephenson|Neal Stephenson]], sublimation is presented as the source of the [[Neo-Victorian|Neo-Victorians']] dominance: "...it was precisely their emotional repression that made the Victorians the richest and most powerful people in the world. Their ability to submerge their feelings, far from pathological, was rather a kind of mystical art that gave them nearly magical power over Nature and over the more intuitive tribes. Such was also the strength of the Nipponese."

In [[mathematics]], a '''subsequential limit''' of a [[sequence]] is the limit of some [[subsequence]]. Every subsequential limit is a [[cluster point]], but not conversely. In [[first-countable]] spaces, the two concepts coincide.

The [[supremum]] of the set of all subsequential limits of some sequence is called the limit superior, or limsup. Similarly, the infimum of such a set is called the limit inferior, or liminf. See [[limit superior and limit inferior]].

If (X,d) is a metric space and there is a [[Cauchy sequence]] such that there is a subsequence converging to some x, then the sequence also converges to x.

'''Sustainable regional development''' is the application of [[sustainable development]] at a [[regional]], rather than local, national or global level.  It differs to [[regional development]] per se, as the latter is a term used more generally to describe economic development that emphasises the alleviation of regional disparities.  While regional development has an economic and equity emphasis, sustainable regional development seeks to incorporate ecological concerns.

Sustainable regional development has particular currency in Australia, where the [[Institute for Sustainable Regional Development]] has been established (1997) for the purpose of developing integrated, multi- and inter-disciplinary strategies for environmental and socio-economic change in regional Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Sustainable Regional Development: [http://www.isrd.cqu.edu.au/FCWViewer/view.do?page=1191 About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sydney APEC Leaders' Declaration on Climate Change, Energy Security and Clean Development''' was adopted at [[APEC Australia 2007]] on 8 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/apec/sydney-declaration-on-climate-change-and-energy/2007/09/09/1189276526002.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 Sydney Declaration on Climate Change and Energy]'', Sydney Morning Herald, 9 September 2007. See also ''[http://www.smh.com.au/pdf/leadersstatement.pdf Leaders Statement (PDF)]'' Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement indicates the wish of signatories to work towards aspirational goals on energy efficiency per unit of [[GDP]] while encouraging [[forest cover]] in the region. The APEC wide regional aspirational goal is to reduce energy intensity by at least 25 percent by 2030 from the 2005 level, and set an APEC-wide regional goal of increasing forest cover in the region by 200,000 square kilometres by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/apec-climate-agreement-a-diplomatic-breakthrough/2007/09/09/1189276521977.html APEC climate agreement a 'diplomatic breakthrough]'', The Age, 9 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Environmental and climate organisations such as [[Greenpeace]], the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] and the [[Climate Action Network]] criticised the agreement for not setting binding targets on [[greenhouse gas emissions]] for developed countries, and that the statement was little more than a political stunt.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/09/2027701.htm Govt, green groups face off over Sydney Declaration]'' ABC News,  9 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenpeace media release, ''[http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/news-and-events/media/releases/climate-change/apec-declaration-a-sydney-dist APEC declaration a Sydney distraction from action on climate change]'', Greenpeace website, 8 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenpeace]] pointed out that Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] told an APEC lecture in Melbourne in April 2007 that aspirational targets are a "political stunt" and "not a real target at all".&lt;ref&gt;Liz Micnchin, ''[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/q-when-is-a-stunt-not-a-stunt-a-when-the-boss-likes-the-idea/2007/09/06/1188783413265.html Q: When is a stunt not a stunt? A: When the boss likes the idea]'', The Age, 7 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One Greenpeace spokesperson said the declaration should be named the "'''Sydney Distraction'''" on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Gartrell, ''[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22384889-5005961,00.html Greenpeace slams APEC climate pact]'', Herald Sun, 8 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] called the declaration "very weak" and said the "declaration does not advance global discussions on climate change."&lt;ref&gt;Australian Conservation Foundation Meadia Release, ''[http://www.acfonline.org.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=1408 APEC’s Sydney Declaration is weak on climate ]'' Australian Conservation Foundation website, 8 September 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2345">'''The Survival Lottery''' is a [[thought experiment]], proposed by the philosopher [[John Harris (bioethicist)|John Harris]]. The basis of the idea is to ask people to imagine if [[organ donation]] were expected to save more individuals than it would kill. Hypothetically all individuals are assigned a number and drawn out of ''lottery'' when a donation is needed, and are expected to give up their lives to allow two or more people to live.

==Arguments for==
The argument for '''the survival lottery''' can be as follows:
# Imagine that organ donation was perfect.
# There is no difference between killing and letting die.
# Given 1 and 2 we should adopt the Survival Lottery.

The article is a direct challenge to the belief that there is a difference between killing and letting die, and an exploration of the moral consequences that follow from this.


The utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill defends Harris's proposal and explains it using the three utilitarian principles: happiness, impartiality and consequences.

==Assumptions the "survival lottery" relies on==
The '''survival lottery''' relies on the following assumptions:

# Each life (killed or allowed to die naturally) is of equal value.
# Two lives saved are of more value than one life killed to save them.
# Two lives saved would be completely cured, or be sufficiently cured as to show a quality of two lives greater than a healthy life killed to save them.
# Two lives saved would be able to live long enough on the transplanted organs (staving off rejection and the original sickness causing their need for replacement) as to show a quantitative gain over a completely healthy (and presumable longer) life randomly chosen to be killed.

==Arguments Against==
One or more of these assumptions can be proven false and disarm the '''survival lottery''' thought experiment by proving that while killing and letting die can be determined as equal (hypothetically), the actual lives involved cannot be determined as equal, nor that multiple lives saved are greater than one life lost.

The '''Way of Human Rights''' ({{lang-de|'''Straße der Menschenrechte'''}}) is a monumental outdoor sculpture in [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]].  It was opened on 24 October 1993.  It is sited on the street between the new and old buildings of the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]], connecting Kornmarkt street and the medieval [[city wall]].

In 1988, a twelve-person jury from the Germanisches Nationalmuseum held a design competition to decide on the artistic design of the Kartäusergasse street in Nuremberg.  The winner was a proposal by Israeli artist [[Dani Karavan]] consisting of a gate, 27 round [[Column|pillar]]s made of white concrete, two pillars buried in the ground showing only a round plate, and one columnar [[oak]], for a total of 30 pillars.  Engraved in each pillar is one article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in German and another language.&lt;ref&gt;The inscriptions as summarized by Karavan on the columns http://www.humanrightsanimationproject.org/english/html/human_rights.html accessed 1 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pillars are 8 metres in height, 80&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, and spaced regularly at 5 metres along an axis.&lt;ref&gt;Information about the project from http://www.danikaravan.com/ accessed 1 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The north gate mirrors the medieval city gate located at the south end of the street.

The site of project has a layered history, including the remnants of a monastery, the medieval city wall, buildings designed by [[Sep Ruf]] in the 1950s and 1960s, and a glass-enclosed entrance designed by the firm ME DI UM in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnm.de/architektur.html accessed 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

This sculpture is part of Nuremberg's efforts to shake off its [[Nazi Germany|Nazi-era]] reputation as the "City of the Party Rallies" and reinvent itself as a "City of Peace and Human Rights".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuernberg.de/internet/portal_e/buerger/human_rights.html
accessed 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Nuremberg was honored for this attempt at transformation with the [[UNESCO Prize for Human Rights Education]],&lt;ref&gt;Award ceremony address by Koïchiro Matsuura http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001224/122419E.pdf 21 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Way of Human Rights'' being specifically cited.  The monument is intended as both a repudiation of past crimes and a permanent reminder that human rights are still regularly violated.  Nuremberg's prize for human rights, the [[Nuremberg International Human Rights Award]], is awarded on the site every two years.

A '''whiting event''' is a phenomenon that occurs when a calcium carbonate precipitate cloud forms in [[Body of water|water bodies]] during the [[summer]] every year. It is caused as a result of change in the [[water]] [[temperature]] or by increased [[Photosynthetic reactions|photosynthetic]] activity by certain microscopic marine life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4319/lo.1997.42.1.0133 |title=Whiting events: Biogenic origin due to the photosynthetic activity of cyanobacterial picoplankton |date=1997 |last1=Thompson |first1=Joel B. |last2=Schultze-Lam |first2=Susanne |last3=Beveridge |first3=Terrance J. |last4=Des Marais |first4=David J. |journal=Limnology and Oceanography |volume=42 |pages=133–41 |pmid=11541205 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1127/1864-1318/2003/0109-0171 |id={{INIST|15194875}} |title=Spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of picocyanobacteria in a meromictic karstic lake |date=2003 |last1=Camacho |first1=Antonio |last2=Picazo |first2=Antonio |last3=Miracle |first3=Maria R. |last4=Vicente |first4=Eduardo |journal=Algological Studies |volume=109 |pages=171–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=1768|title=Whiting in Lake Michigan|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81952|title=Whiting Event, Lake Ontario|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Elan Vital (disambiguation)}}

'''''Élan vital''''' ({{IPA-fr|elɑ̃.vital}}) is a term coined by [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] [[Henri Bergson]] in his 1907 book ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'', in which he addresses the question of self-organisation and spontaneous morphogenesis of things in an increasingly complex manner. ''Elan vital'' was translated in the English edition as "vital impetus", but is usually translated by his detractors as "vital force".  It is a hypothetical explanation for [[evolution]] and [[developmental biology|development]] of [[organisms]], which Bergson linked closely with [[consciousness]] – with the intuitive perception of experience and the flow of inner time.&lt;ref&gt;S. Atkinson ed., ''The Philosophy Book'' (2011) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors==
Distant anticipations of Bergson can be found in the work of the pre-Christian [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Posidonius]], who postulated a "vital force" emanated by the sun to all living creatures on the Earth's surface, and in that of [[Zeno of Elea]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Benre, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 98-9&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of ''élan vital'' is also similar to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s concept of the will-to-live.&lt;ref&gt;L. Vikka, ''The Intrinsic Value of Nature'' (1997) p. 56-7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later developments ==

It was believed by some that this essence (''élan vital'') could be harvested and embedded into an inanimate substance and activated with electricity, perhaps taking literally another of Bergson's metaphorical descriptions, the "current of life".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] attempted to recoup the novelty of Bergson's idea in his book ''Bergsonism'', though the term itself underwent substantial changes by Deleuze. No longer considered a [[mystical]], elusive force acting on brute matter, as it was in the [[vitalism|vitalist]] debates of the late 19th century, ''élan vital'' in Deleuze's hands denotes an internal force,&lt;ref&gt;K. Ansell-Pearson, ''Germinal Life'' (2012) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; a substance in which the distinction between organic and inorganic matter is indiscernible, and the emergence of life undecidable.

The notion of ''élan vital'' also had considerable influence on the psychiatrist and phenomenologist [[Eugène Minkowski]] and his own concept of a ''personal élan''&lt;ref&gt;H. Spiegelberg, ''Phenomenology in Psychology and Psychiatry'' (1972) p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; – the element which keeps us in touch with a feeling of life (and is lost in [[autism]]).&lt;ref&gt;J. Picchione, ''The New Avant-Garde in Italy'' (2004) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Army in World War I|French army]] incorporated the doctrine of ''élan vital'' into its thinking during the leadup to the [[First World War]] by arguing that the spirit of individual soldiers was more important for victory than weapons.&lt;ref name="MacMillan"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZZapAQAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914 | publisher=[[Random House]] | author=MacMillan, Margaret | authorlink=Margaret MacMillan | year=2013 | location=[[New York City|New York]] | pages=258 | isbn=978-1-4000-6855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
* Current general consensus by geneticists is that they see no life force other than the organisational matrix contained in the [[genes]] themselves.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Weir, ed., ''Genes and Human Self-Knowledge'' (1994) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[biologist]] [[Julian Huxley]] dryly remarked that Bergson’s ''élan vital'' is no better an explanation of life than is explaining the operation of a railway engine by its ''élan locomotif'' ("locomotive driving force"). The same alleged epistemological fallacy is parodied in [[Molière]]'s ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'', where a quack "answers" the question of "Why does [[opium]] cause sleep?" with "Because of its [[soporific]] power."&lt;ref&gt;'' Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire.'' [[:s:fr:Le Malade imaginaire/3ème intermède|Le Malade imaginaire, (French Wikisource)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Huxley happily used the term ''élan vital'' in a more metaphorical sense, as may be seen from the following excerpt:
{{quote|"When I was just last in New York, I went for a walk, leaving Fifth Avenue and the Business section behind me, into the crowded streets near the Bowery. And while I was there, I had a sudden feeling of relief and confidence. There was Bergson’s ''élan vital''—there was assimilation causing life to exert as much pressure, though embodied here in the shape of men, as it has ever done in the earliest year of evolution: there was the driving force of progress"|lecture 1, n.p.,{{Citequote|date=August 2014}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080806205313/http://library.rice.edu/collections/WRC/finding-aids/manuscripts/0050/ J. Huxley papers]}}

*Author and popular theologian [[C. S. Lewis|C.S. Lewis]] rejected Bergson's concept in his essay The Weight of Glory stating "...even if all the happiness they promised could come to man on earth, yet still each generation would lose it by death, including the last generation of all, and the whole story would be nothing, not even a story, for ever and ever. Hence all the nonsense that Mr. Shaw puts into the final speech of Lilith, and Bergson’s remark that the élan vital is capable of surmounting all obstacles, perhaps even death—as if we could believe that any social or biological development on this planet will delay the senility of the sun or reverse the second law of thermodynamics."&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, Essay Collection'' (2000) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;
