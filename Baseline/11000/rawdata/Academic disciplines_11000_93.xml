The '''1966 flood of the Arno''' ({{lang-it|Alluvione di Firenze del 4 novembre 1966}}) in [[Florence]] killed 101 people and damaged or destroyed millions of masterpieces of art and rare books. It is considered the worst [[flood]] in the city's history since 1557. With the combined effort of Italian and foreign volunteers alike, or ''angeli del fango'' ("Mud Angels"), many of these fine works have been restored. New methods in [[Art conservation|conservation]] were devised and [[Art conservation and restoration|restoration]] laboratories established. However, even decades later, much work remains to be done.

== Overview ==
Located in the [[Tuscany]] region of [[Central Italy]], the [[Arno]] river is approximately {{convert|240|km|mi}} long.  It flows from the Mount Falterona hills of the [[Apennine Mountains]] to the [[Ligurian Sea]], just {{convert|11|km|mi|0}} west of [[Pisa]].  Lush vineyards and olive groves line the river's scenic course to the west, out to sea. Principally utilized for [[irrigation]] purposes, only {{convert|32|km|mi}} of the river is used for navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Arno River | encyclopedia=Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia | year=2007 | url=http://gme.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0017000-0 | accessdate =23 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Arno River | encyclopedia=The World Book Encyclopedia | volume=1 | publisher=World Book, Inc. | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest flows of the river generally occur in spring and autumn of every year, when rainfall in the Apennines is at its greatest. The intensity of the 1966 flood was further increased by both the [[orography]] of the Apennines, which contributed to the high run-off rates and river discharges, and urban development. Roads, such as the Via de Calzaiuoli, served as narrow channels for floodwaters, allowing for their greater speed and destruction within the city; bridges, on the other hand, hindered river flow where it was needed, allowing water to pour over the [[floodplain]] with great force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Florence Floods: 4 November 1966 | journal=The Geographical Journal | date=June 1967 | volume=133 | issue=2 | pages=277–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline of events ==
[[File:1966 Arno Florence flood 2008.JPG|thumb|Square in Florence with a white [[high water mark]] of the 1966 flood. At this point the marker is about {{convert|4|m|ft}} high.]]

===3 November===

* After a long period of steady rain, the Levane and La Penna dams in Valdarno began to discharge more than {{convert|2000|m3|cuft}} of water per second toward Florence.
* At 14:30, the Civil Engineering Department reported "'an exceptional quantity of water.'"
* Cellars in the [[Florence#Subdivisions|Santa Croce]] and San Frediano areas began to flood.
* Police received calls for assistance from villagers up the Arno Valley.
* The flood's first victim, a 52-year-old worker, died at the Anconella [[Water purification|water treatment plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===4 November 1966===

* At 04:00, engineers, fearing that the Valdarno dam would burst, discharged a mass of water that eventually reached the outskirts of Florence at a rate of {{convert|60|km/h}}.
* At 07:26, the Lungarno delle Grazie cut off gas, electricity and water supplies to affected areas.
* By 08:00, army barracks were flooded.
* By 09:00, hospital emergency generators (the only source of electrical power remaining) failed.
* Landslides obstructed roads leading to Florence, while narrow streets within city limits funneled floodwaters, increasing their height and velocity.
* By 09:45, the [[Piazza del Duomo, Florence|Piazza del Duomo]] was flooded.
* The powerful waters ruptured central heating oil tanks, and the oil mixed with the water and mud, causing greater damage.
* Florence was divided in two, and officials were unable to immediately reach citizens of the city past the Piazza Michelangelo.
* At its highest, the water reached over {{convert|6.7|m|ft}} in the Santa Croce area.
* By 20:00, the water began to lower.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clarkson, Christopher | title = The Florence Flood of November 1966 &amp; Its Aftermath | year = 2003 | url = http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/publication/ndl_newsletter/135/lecture1_135_353.pdf | format = PDF

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The flood has had a lasting impact on Florence, economically and culturally. City officials and citizens were unprepared for the storm and the widespread devastation that it caused. There were virtually no emergency measures in place, at least partially because Florence is located in an area where the frequency of flooding is relatively low. In fact, approximately 90% of the city's population were completely unaware of the imminent disaster.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Residents were set to celebrate their country's World War I victory over [[Austria]] on 4 November, [[Armed Forces Day#Italy|Armed Forces Day]]. In commemoration, businesses were closed and many of their employees were out of town for the public holiday. While many lives were likely spared as a result, the locked buildings greatly inhibited the salvaging of valuable materials from numerous institutions and shops, with the exception of a number of jewellery stores whose owners were warned by their nightwatchmen.

5,000 families were left homeless by the storm, and 6,000 stores were forced out of business.  Approximately 600,000 tons of mud, rubble and sewage severely damaged or destroyed numerous collections of books, manuscripts and fine art. In fact, it is estimated that between 3 and 4 million books and manuscripts were damaged, as well as 14,000 movable works of art.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003" /&gt;

Artist [[Marco Sassone]], in a 1969 interview, recalled the impact of the flood on Florence's residents: "The only thing you could do was watch and be helpless. Nature was master...the women became crazy with fear. They began throwing things from the windows and screaming 'who is going to save my children?'" It was reported that 101 people lost their lives in the flood waters.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Phyllis. County Artist Relives Florence Disaster. The Register, Sunday 2 November 1969, p 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collections affected===
* Archives of the Opera del [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo]] (Archivio di Opera del Duomo): 6,000 volumes of documents and 55 illuminated manuscripts were damaged.
* [[Gabinetto Vieusseux|Gabinetto Vieusseux Library]] (Biblioteca del Gabinetto Vieusseux): All 250,000 volumes were damaged, including titles of romantic literature and Risorgimento history; submerged in water, they became swollen and distorted. Pages, separated from their text blocks, were found pressed upon the walls and ceiling of the building.
* [[National Central Library (Florence)|National Central Library]] (Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Firenze): Located alongside the Arno, the National Library was cut off from the rest of the city by the flood. 1,300,000 items (a third of their holdings) were damaged, including prints, maps, posters, newspapers and a majority of works in the Palatine and Magliabechi collections.
* The State Archives ([[Archivio di Stato di Firenze|Archivio di Stato]]): Roughly 40% of the collection was damaged, including property and financial records; birth, marriage and death records; judicial and administrative documents; and police records, among others.

== Funding and assistance ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--most of section has no citations--&gt;
Realizing the immense wealth and importance of Florentine culture in a global context, many individuals and organizations contributed to the conservation mission, providing both funding and manpower. Art historian and professor Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti assembled a committee with [[List of mayors of Florence|Mayor Piero Bargellini]] as chairman to raise awareness of the needs of Florence's art and academic institutions. Members included prominent figures from around the world, representatives of their own respective institutions.

A number of other international committees were formed with the intention of sponsoring various institutions in Florence:
* The Franco-Italian Committee aided the Church of Santa Maria Maddalena di Pazzi in Borgo Pinti.
* The U.S. Committee to Rescue Italian Art, composed of 25 sub-committees and chaired by [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], assisted in restoring frescoes around the city.
* The Viennese armory was responsible for restoring the arms and armor of the [[Bargello]] Museum.
* A Dutch committee sponsored the Buonarroti House Museum.
* A group of Germans repaired the musical instruments of the Bardini Museum.
The work of and contributions made by these committees were supervised by a central committee in Rome.

Additional funding came from various governments, [[UNESCO]], and the International Committee for the Assistance of Museums, Works of Art, Libraries and Archives, among others.  The city of [[Edinburgh]] (Scotland), twinned with Florence, sent practical help for the citizens in the form of double-decker buses to temporarily replace those which had been lost in the floods.  When these eventually returned home, they operated with the international 'GB' registration plate still affixed to the rear; each also carried a small plaque presented by the Florentine transport authorities indicating their gratitude for the gesture made by the people of Edinburgh.

Charity auctions were also organised. In a show of support for the Florentine art community, [[Pablo Picasso]] had one of his paintings, ''Recumbent Woman Reading'', auctioned off on an internationally televised programme. He donated the $105,000 it earned to restoration efforts in Italy. Similarly, [[Pietro Annigoni]] and [[Luciano Guarnieri]] donated the money they earned from selling 575 colour [[lithographs]] (depicting the events surrounding the flood and its aftermath), produced from 13 of their drawings.

Florentine native [[Franco Zeffirelli]] produced the short documentary ''[[Florence: Days of Destruction]]'' to raise awareness of the flood. Released a month after the disaster, it reputedly raised more than $20 million for reconstruction efforts.&lt;ref name='NGA'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/podcasts/lectures/2011.shtm |title=National Gallery of Art - Videos and Podcasts, December 2011 |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=29 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201205345/http://www.nga.gov/podcasts/lectures/2011.shtm |archivedate=1 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was narrated in English and Italian by actor [[Richard Burton]].&lt;ref name='DukeLib'&gt;{{cite web| url=https://blogs.library.duke.edu/preservation/2012/02/15/florence-days-of-destruction-a-film-by-franco-zeffirelli/|title=Preservation Underground - Florence: Days of Destruction (A Film by Franco Zeffirelli)|publisher=Duke University Library|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many institutions from around the world financially compensated employees who travelled to Italy and aided in the restoration of Florence, many others volunteered their services for absolutely no pay. Collectively, these people have been fondly referred to as "Mud Angels", due to their commitment to working in such deplorable conditions.&lt;ref name="Batini 1967"&gt;{{cite book | last=Batini | first=Giorgio | title=4 November 1966: The River Arno in the Museums of Florence:Galleries, Monuments, Churches, Libraries, Archives and Masterpieces Damaged by the Flood | year=1967 | publisher=Bonechi | location=Florence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Thorough flood... | journal=The Burlington Magazine | date=November 1986 | volume=128 | issue=1004 | page=779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Mud Angels"===
[[List of mayors of Florence|Mario Primicerio]], the mayor of Florence from 1995 to 1999, helped celebrate the Mud Angels' (''angeli del fango'') efforts during an anniversary celebration in 1996. Thirty years earlier, he was a professor who lent his assistance in preserving the priceless artefacts of Florence. The Angels cleaned the city of refuse, mud and oil, and retrieved works of art, books and other materials from flooded rooms; experts from around the world volunteered their time and knowledge in the conservation of the aforementioned materials.

In a 1996 interview, Primicerio offered three principal reasons as to why the Mud Angels felt compelled to help: a concern for future generations, a feeling of international unity and a pervasive sense of solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first=Mario |last=Primicerio |url=http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/intventt.htm |title=We are really delighted to invite the Mud Angels to Florence: Interview with Mario Primicerio, the Mayor of Florence |year=1996 |accessdate=21 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217085124/http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/intventt.htm |archivedate=17 February 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|What we were doing was dictated by the desire to give back the traces of the history of the past to future generations, so that it could be used for the spiritual growth of people who perhaps had yet to be born...it was the international community that worked to try to save Florence, this unique patrimony which belonged to the whole world.|Mario Primicerio|Speciale Alluvione}}

===The "Flood Ladies"===
The [[Flood Ladies]] were a group of international female artists who contributed artworks to the city of Florence following the catastrophic 1966 flood of the Arno as a sign of solidarity and to help repair the psychological damage done by the flood. The group was formed in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] in 1966. Contributors to the collection lived all over the world. In 2014 the organization Advancing Women Artist Foundation headed an effort to preserve, exhibit and acknowledge the contribution of these women.

== Conservation measures ==
Many experts in the field of conservation, such as [[Peter Waters]], utilised their knowledge in restoring the works of art and literature ravaged by the flood. Staff from the Central Institute of Restoration and Institute of Book Pathology, for example, volunteered their time, efforts, and expertise in this enormous undertaking. New concepts, such as "phased conservation," and methods in conservation, such as mass deacidification, were conceived during this period after the flood ravaged the city of Florence.&lt;ref name="channel4.com"&gt;{{cite web | title = Cities and Disaster: The Florence Flood of 1966 | url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html| accessdate =5 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070517215628/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html| archivedate= 17 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books and records===
Priorities were established during the process of conserving damaged books and records, the most critical of which became the retrieval of materials from flooded rooms. After they were rescued, books and records were typically washed and disinfected. In certain cases, [[Bookbinding|bindings]] were cut and sheets treated individually.  Following a thorough cleansing, the materials were then dried in Florentine libraries, space permitting, or at locations outside of the city, such as [[kiln|tobacco kilns]] and [[granaries]]. In some circumstances, large quantities of books were covered with sawdust, as a means of drawing out moisture. When not washed prior to drying, dried mud was then scraped off the exterior of the books.

One or both of two drying techniques was applied: interleaving by hand and/or drying with the aid of domestic heaters or other mechanical equipment. Interleaving involved the placement of blotting papers within the text-block of a book and replacing them once they were fully soaked; a variety of papers were used, including mimeograph paper and green blotting paper (the latter of which ultimately caused more damage). In kilns, the [[humidity]] level was slowly lowered from ninety to forty percent. If deemed necessary, bindings were removed and dried separately.  Removed pages were hung out to dry on an apparatus similar to a [[clothes line]].

Fearing the spread of [[mold]], workers completed these tasks with the greatest speed possible. After they were disinfected and dried, the items were then reassembled, restored and, if necessary, rebound. [[Library catalog|Card catalogs]] and in some cases, the actual books and documents were reproduced by reprinting on early [[Printing press|presses]], [[photocopying]], or copying by hand.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Batini 1967" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="The Florentine Flood Disaster"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Florentine Flood Disaster | journal=The Burlington Magazine | date=April 1967 | volume=109 | issue=769 | pages=192–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Libraries and Archives of Florence | journal=Times Literary Supplement | date=1 December 1966| first=Nicolai | last=Rubinstein | page=1133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url = http://data.scl.utah.edu/fmi/xsl/stream/details.xsl?-recid=354&amp;a::v=1O9iEOa749 | title = The Restoration of Books: Florence 1968 | medium = DVD | publisher = Royal College of Art | location = London | date = 1968 | accessdate= 27 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====The National Library Centers of Florence: a case study====
Initially the transportation of large numbers of books to other institutes (to repair and rebind) was considered, but decided against on logistical grounds. Within six months of the flood, the National Library of Florence had 144 workers on hand: three binders, eight binder trainees, two librarians, forty-two workmen, eighty-one student volunteers and eight other library staff members.

Together they devised a logical and efficient method of book repair, involving nine separate and clearly defined steps:

* Books were selected for treatment. The details of work to be done were recorded on a formatted card that accompanied its respective book throughout its treatment. Once work was completed, the card was permanently filed. A universal language utilising symbols, created with [[foreign worker]]s in mind, was employed in the formatting of this card.  Symbols were assigned to key phrases that communicated the condition of each book and how its repair was to be conducted, such as:
** historically important-only to be dealt with by experts
** incomplete
** medium mud
** rebind
** collation part missing
* The book was photographed.
* The book's collation was verified and its covers removed and stored in a marked case (if they were to be used in a new binding).
* If necessary, the book was carefully taken apart to wash it in warm water and disinfect it with Topane.
* In certain cases, the leaves of the book were [[mass deacidification|deacidified]] and buffered.
* The text-block was pressed.
* The text-block was dried in specially designed cabinets.
* Sections of the book were then reconstructed and the text-blocks collated.
* Finally, each book was wrapped in a paper sheet that had been impregnated with an antimicrobial substance, then they were set aside for any later repair or rebinding. The binding was completed in the main reading room of the library, which had been converted (temporarily) for this purpose.

This methodical nine-part system enabled workers to process between seventy and a hundred books a day.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003" /&gt;

After the Florence flood, the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale was not allowed to put books back into the lower levels.&lt;ref&gt;Lenzuni, Anna. “Coping with Disaster.” Preservation of library materials: conference held at the National Library of Austria, Vienna, 7–10 April 1986. Ed. Merrily A. Smith. IFLA publications, 40–41. München: Saur, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paintings===
Many panel paintings were critically damaged as a result of water saturating their wood, causing the glue and [[gesso]], which compose the priming layer, to dissolve. Consequently, the paintings' colours dissolved as well. In addition, the moisture caused paintings to buckle and crack or develop blisters, and the paint to chip and fall.  Actions were taken to stabilize the problem by applying [[rice paper]] to the affected paintings and storing them in cool, stable environments where humidity was slowly decreased. In extreme cases, the paint layer was extracted from the wood and gesso and then reapplied to a new support. [[Nystatin]], an antifungal, was sprayed on the wood to prevent mold from growing. Treatment facilities were established at locations such as the Boboli Garden Lemon-House, where over two hundred of these panel paintings were restored.

Similar measures were necessary to conserve canvas paintings. First, an original canvas was relined and gauze applied to the painted surface, which was then ironed. This process is referred to as the ''rintelatura'', or "new canvas" method. Relatively minor surface work was often completed with a variety of solvents and/or types of [[resin]].

===Frescoes===
[[Fresco]]es demanded more complicated treatment. Normally water, once it evaporates, will leave a layer of residual salt on the surface of the wall that absorbed it. In some instances, the resultant [[efflorescence]] obscured painted images. In other cases, the impermeability of the fresco plaster caused the salt to become trapped beneath the surface, causing bubbles to form and erupt, and the paint to fall. The adhesion of the plaster to the wall was often also seriously compromised. A fresco could only be detached when fully dry. To dry a fresco, workers cut narrow tunnels beneath it, in which heaters were placed to draw out moisture from below (instead of outwards, which would have further damaged the paintings). Within a few days, the fresco was ready to be detached.

Fuel oil, which coated many painted works of art, was removed by using Japanese tissue paper to apply a solvent, which dissolved the tar. An [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]], such as [[talcum powder]], was then distributed on the tissue paper.

===Sculpture and other objects===
It became imperative to clean sculpture immediately, before it fully absorbed the oil. Flaking sculpture was sprayed with a [[silicate]] mixture, while wooden pieces were treated with [[insecticides]] and toxic gases to kill insects and prevent future infestation. [[Weapon]]ry, like firearms and swords, were taken apart, cleaned with [[Kerosene|paraffin]], and finally lubricated to prevent future rusting.

[[Bronze]] objects were kept in dehumidification chambers for a few weeks and cleaned with distilled water or polished. For more severely damaged pieces, experts completed "depth cleaning," which entailed the use of small drills and vacuuming. Similar measures were taken with gold.  Broken objects were reassembled using photographs and other retrieved documentation.&lt;ref name="Batini 1967" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Florentine Flood Disaster" /&gt;

===Effect on preservation and conservation awareness===
The disastrous results of the flood established an international awareness of the need for preservation and conservation education and facilities.  In the United States, for example, it is no coincidence that the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] was passed in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stipe | first=Robert and Antoinette J. Lee | url=http://www.emich.edu/public/geo/history.html#preservationact | title=The American Mosiac: Preserving A Nation's Heritage | year=1987 | publisher= U.S. Committee, International Council on Monuments and Sites | location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate= 4 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the next twenty years:
{{Quotation|2,000 to 3,000 preservation organizations actively engaged in public education, advocacy, preservation and restoration projects of various kinds, many of them operating revolving funds. In terms of geographic interest, distinctions among the regions are no longer drawn. Membership in the National Trust for Historic Preservation grew from 10,700 in 1966 to 185,000 in 1986. More than 35 university graduate professional and technical courses directly related to historic preservation were created in the interim. It would be reasonable to estimate that more than 54,000 jobs were created in the administrative aspect of preservation alone.|Robert E. Stipe and Antoinette J. Lee}}

===Work outstanding===
A significant amount of restorative work remains to be done in Florence.  Due to a lack of awareness, funding, and manpower, a great number of works of art and books lie in storage, dirty and damaged.  Christopher Clarkson, noted conservator, called attention to this problem in a 2007 letter, stating that the National Library still has a "warehouse" full of books to be repaired and bound; many others need cleaning or reassembling.  According to a 1993 report, approximately 25% of the 80,000 items belonging to the Magliabecchi and Palatino collections had not been fully restored in the nearly thirty years since the flood.  The number of conservators that work at the library presently is only about a tenth of the amount that worked there immediately after the flood.&lt;ref name="channel4.com"/&gt;

==Environmental measures==

Regional officials in Tuscany are responsible for organizing a massive project, the purpose of which is to not only protect the area from future flooding but to maintain high water quality and effectively utilize water resources.

Work commenced in 1984, with the construction of the Bilancino Dam, near Florence.  The Sieve tributary and spillway at [[Pontedera]] are among other developments.  The national government has funded a majority of these various subprojects, with the city of Florence being the primary recipient of the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bilancino Dam, A Reservoir for Florence | url=http://www.comune.firenze.it/servizi_pubblici/ambiente/acqua/ciclo/Inglese/1BILenglish.htm | accessdate =1 March 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041221224245/http://www.comune.firenze.it/servizi_pubblici/ambiente/acqua/ciclo/Inglese/1BILenglish.htm |archivedate = 21 December 2004|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''accelerating expansion of the universe''' is the observation that the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion]] of the [[universe]] is such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy is receding from the observer is continuously increasing with time.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AM-20170818"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scharping |first=Nathaniel |title=Gravitational Waves Show How Fast The Universe is Expanding |url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/10/gravitational-waves-show-how-fast-the-universe-is-expanding |date=18 October 2017 |website=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ES-20180311"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weaver |first1=Donna |last2=Villard |first2=Ray |title=Measuring universe expansion reveals mystery – Is something unpredicted going on in the depths of space? |url=http://earthsky.org/space/measuring-universe-expansion-reveals-mystery |date=11 March 2018 |website=[[Earth &amp; Sky]] |accessdate=11 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/104-the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/expansion-of-the-universe/616-is-the-universe-expanding-faster-than-the-speed-of-light-intermediate|title=Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accelerated expansion was discovered in 1998, by two independent projects, the [[Supernova Cosmology Project]] and the [[High-Z Supernova Search Team]], which both used distant [[type Ia supernovae]] to measure the acceleration.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15165371 |title=Nobel physics prize honours accelerating universe find |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/# |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peebles |first1=P.

The distance can then be compared to the supernovae's cosmological [[redshift]], which measures how much the universe has expanded since the supernova occurred.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Hubble law]], which established that the further an object is from us, the faster it is receding.&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected result was that objects in the universe are moving away from another at an accelerated rate. Cosmologists at the time expected that recession velocity would always be decelerating to the gravitational attraction of the matter in the universe. Three members of these two groups have subsequently been awarded [[Nobel Prize]]s for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmology |first=Steven |last=Weinberg |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2008 |isbn=9780198526827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmatory evidence has been found in [[baryon acoustic oscillations]], and in analyses of the clustering of galaxies.

The accelerated expansion of the universe is thought to have begun since the universe entered its [[dark-energy-dominated era]] roughly 5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Frieman"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Frieman |first=Joshua A. |last2=Turner |first2=Michael S. |last3=Huterer |first3=Dragan |year=2008 |title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=385–432 |arxiv=0803.0982 |bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn |1=&lt;ref name="Frieman" /&gt; Frieman, Turner &amp; Huterer (2008) p. 6: "The Universe has gone through three distinct eras: radiation-dominated, {{math|''z'' ≳ 3000}}; matter-dominated, {{math|3000 ≳ ''z'' ≳ 0.5}}; and dark-energy-dominated, {{math|''z'' ≲ 0.5}}.

These results are robust – data from any one method can be removed without compromising the constraints – and they are not substantially weakened by dropping the assumption of spatial flatness."|group="notes"}}
Within the framework of [[general relativity]], an accelerated expansion can be accounted for by a positive value of the [[cosmological constant]] {{mvar|Λ}}, equivalent to the presence of a positive [[vacuum energy]], dubbed "[[dark energy]]". While there are alternative possible explanations, the description assuming dark energy (positive {{mvar|Λ}}) is used in the current standard model of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], which also includes [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and is known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

==Background==
{{Nature timeline}}
{{further|Cosmological constant|Lambda-CDM model|Hubble's law|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann equations}}
In the decades since the detection of [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) in 1965,&lt;ref name="Penzias&amp;Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Penzias |first=A. A. |last2=Wilson |first2=R. W. |date=1965 |title=A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080&amp;nbsp;Mc/s |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=142 |issue=1 |pages=419–421 |bibcode=1965ApJ...142..419P |doi=10.1086/148307}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Big Bang]] model has become the most accepted model explaining the evolution of our universe. The [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]] defines how the [[energy]] in the universe drives its expansion.

:&lt;math&gt; H^2={\left ( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right )}^2=\frac{8{\pi}G}{3}\rho-\frac{{\Kappa}c^2}{a^2} &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|Κ}} represents the [[curvature of the universe]], {{math|''a''(''t'')}} is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]], {{mvar|ρ}} is the total energy density of the universe, and {{mvar|H}} is the [[Hubble parameter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nemiroff |first1=Robert J. |authorlink1=Robert J. Nemiroff |last2=Patla |first2=Bijunath |title=Adventures in Friedmann cosmology: A detailed expansion of the cosmological Friedmann equations |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=265–276 |doi=10.1119/1.2830536 |arxiv=astro-ph/0703739 |bibcode=2008AmJPh..76..265N |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We define a [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_c=\frac{3H^2}{8{\pi}G} &lt;/math&gt;
and the [[density parameter]]
:&lt;math&gt; \Omega=\frac{\rho}{\rho_c} &lt;/math&gt;

We can then rewrite the Hubble parameter as

:&lt;math&gt; H(a)=H_0 \sqrt{{\Omega_ka^{-2} + \Omega}_ma^{-3} + \Omega_ra^{-4} + \Omega_\mathrm{DE}a^{-3(1+w)}} &lt;/math&gt;

where the four currently hypothesized contributors to the energy density of the universe are [[Shape of the universe|curvature]], [[matter]], [[radiation]] and [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name=Bassett&gt;{{cite book |last=Lapuente |first=P. |chapter=Baryon Acoustic Oscillations |title=Dark Energy: Observational and Theoretical Approaches |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2010 |isbn=978-0521518888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the components decreases with the expansion of the universe (increasing scale factor), except perhaps the dark energy term. It is the values of these cosmological parameters which physicists use to determine the acceleration of the universe.

The [[Friedmann equations|acceleration equation]] describes the evolution of the scale factor with time

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}=-\frac{4{\pi}G}{3}\left( \rho + \frac{3P}{c^2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[pressure]] {{mvar|P}} is defined by the cosmological model chosen. (see [[Accelerating universe#Explanatory models|explanatory models]] below)

Physicists at one time were so assured of the deceleration of the universe's expansion that they introduced a so-called [[deceleration parameter]] {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Ryden&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Cosmology |last=Ryden |first=Barbara |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Addison Wesley |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2016}} Current observations point towards this deceleration parameter being negative.

===Relation to inflation===
According to the theory of [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]], the very early universe underwent a period of very rapid, quasi-exponential expansion. While the time-scale for this period of expansion was far shorter than that of the current expansion, this was a period of accelerated expansion with some similarities to the current epoch.

===Technical definition===
The definition of "accelerating expansion" is that the second time derivative of the cosmic scale factor, &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt;, is positive, which implies that the [[deceleration parameter]] is negative. However, note this does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; imply that the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] is increasing with time. Since the Hubble parameter is defined as &lt;math&gt; H(t) \equiv \dot{a}(t) / a(t) &lt;/math&gt;, it follows from the definitions that the derivative of the Hubble parameter is given by 

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dH}{dt} = -H^2(1 + q) &lt;/math&gt;

so the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time unless &lt;math&gt; q &lt; -1 &lt;/math&gt;. Observations prefer &lt;math&gt; q \approx -0.55 &lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt; is positive but &lt;math&gt; dH/dt &lt;/math&gt; is negative.  Essentially, this implies that the cosmic recession velocity of any one particular galaxy is increasing with time, but its velocity/distance ratio is still decreasing; thus different galaxies expanding across a sphere of fixed radius cross the sphere more slowly at later times.

It is seen from above that the case of "zero acceleration/deceleration" corresponds to &lt;math&gt; a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear function of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; q = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \dot{a} = const&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; H(t) = 1/t &lt;/math&gt;.

==Evidence for acceleration==
To learn about the rate of expansion of the universe we look at the [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]-redshift relationship of astronomical objects using [[Cosmic distance ladder#Standard candles|standard candles]], or their distance-redshift relationship using [[standard ruler]]s. We can also look at the growth of [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]], and find that the observed values of the cosmological parameters are best described by models which include an accelerating expansion.

===Supernova observation===
[[File:Asymmetric Ashes (artist's impression).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Artist's impression of a Type Ia supernova, as revealed by spectro-polarimetry observations]]
The first evidence for acceleration came from the observation of [[Type Ia supernova]]e, which are exploding [[white dwarf]]s that have exceeded their [[Chandrasekhar limit|stability limit]]. Because they all have similar masses, their intrinsic [[luminosity]] is standardizable. Repeated imaging of selected areas of the sky is used to discover the supernovae, then follow-up observations give their peak brightness, which is converted into a quantity known as luminosity distance (see [[distance measures in cosmology]] for details).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=Albrecht|first1=Andreas |display-authors=etal |title=Report of the Dark Energy Task Force |date=2006 |eprint=astro-ph/0609591}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spectral line]]s of their light can be used to determine their [[redshift]].

For supernovae at redshift less than around 0.1, or light travel time less than 10 percent of the age of the universe, this gives a nearly linear distance–redshift relation due to [[Hubble's law]]. At larger distances, since the expansion rate of the universe has changed over time, the distance-redshift relation deviates from linearity, and this deviation depends on how the expansion rate has changed over time. The full calculation requires computer integration of the Friedmann equation, but a simple derivation can be given as follows: the redshift {{mvar|z}} directly gives the [[cosmic scale factor]] at the time the supernova exploded.

:&lt;math&gt; a(t)=\frac{1}{1+z} &lt;/math&gt;

So a supernova with a measured redshift {{math|''z'' {{=}} 0.5}} implies the universe was {{sfrac|1|1 + 0.5}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2|3}} of its present size when the supernova exploded. In the standard accelerated expansion scenario the rate of expansion still decreases, but does so more slowly than the non-accelerated case. This means that in the accelerated case, the past rate of expansion is slower than it would be in the non-accelerated case.  Thus in a universe with accelerated expansion, it takes a longer time to expand from two thirds its present size, compared to a non-accelerating universe with the same present-day value of the Hubble constant. This results in a larger light-travel time, larger distance and fainter supernovae, which corresponds to the actual observations. [[Adam Riess]] ''et al.'' found that "the distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia were, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density {{math|''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.2}} universe without a cosmological constant".&lt;ref name=Riess&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riess |first1=Adam G. |display-authors=etal |title=Observational Evidence from Supernovae for an Accelerating Universe and a Cosmological Constant |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=1009–1038 |year=1998 |doi=10.1086/300499 |bibcode=1998AJ....116.1009R |arxiv=astro-ph/9805201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the measured high-redshift distances were too large, compared to nearby ones, for a decelerating universe.&lt;ref name=Pain&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pain |first=Reynald |last2=Astier |first2=Pierre |title=Observational evidence of the accelerated expansion of the Universe |journal=Comptes Rendus Physique |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=521–538 |arxiv=1204.5493 |doi=10.1016/j.crhy.2012.04.009 |date=2012 |bibcode=2012CRPhy..13..521A |citeseerx=10.1.1.747.3792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baryon acoustic oscillations===
{{main|Baryon acoustic oscillations}}
In the early universe before [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]] took place, [[photon]]s and matter existed in a [[Structure formation#Primordial plasma|primordial plasma]]. Points of higher density in the photon-baryon plasma would contract, being compressed by gravity until the pressure became too large and they expanded again.&lt;ref name=Ryden/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}} This contraction and expansion created vibrations in the plasma analogous to [[sound waves]]. Since [[dark matter]] only interacts [[gravitationally]] it stayed at the centre of the sound wave, the origin of the original overdensity. When decoupling occurred, approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=G. |year=2009 |title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement |volume=180 |issue=2 |pages=225–245 |arxiv=0803.0732 |bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H }}&lt;/ref&gt; photons separated from matter and were able to [[free streaming|stream freely]] through the universe, creating the [[cosmic microwave background]] as we know it. This left shells of [[baryonic matter]] at a fixed radius from the overdensities of dark matter, a distance known as the sound horizon. As time passed and the universe expanded, it was at these anisotropies of matter density where galaxies started to form. So by looking at the distances at which galaxies at different redshifts tend to cluster, it is possible to determine a standard [[angular diameter distance]] and use that to compare to the distances predicted by different cosmological models.

Peaks have been found in the correlation function (the probability that two galaxies will be a certain distance apart) at {{nowrap|100 ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; [[Parsec#Megaparsecs and Gigaparsecs|Mpc]]}},&lt;ref name=Bassett/&gt; indicating that this is the size of the sound horizon today, and by comparing this to the sound horizon at the time of decoupling (using the CMB), we can confirm the accelerated expansion of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisenstein |first1=Daniel J. |display-authors=etal |title=Detection of the Baryon Acoustic Peak in the Large‐Scale Correlation Function of SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=2005 |volume=633 |issue=2 |pages=560–574 |doi=10.1086/466512 |bibcode=2005ApJ...633..560E |arxiv=astro-ph/0501171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clusters of galaxies===
Measuring the mass functions of [[galaxy cluster]]s, which describe the [[number density]] of the clusters above a threshold mass, also provides evidence for dark energy {{explain|date=March 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dekel |first=Avishai |title=Formation of Structure in the Universe |location=New York, NY |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1999 |isbn=9780521586320}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing these mass functions at high and low redshifts to those predicted by different cosmological models, values for {{mvar|w}} and {{mvar|Ω&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} are obtained which confirm a low matter density and a non zero amount of dark energy.&lt;ref name=Pain/&gt;

===Age of the universe===
{{see also|Age of the universe}}
Given a cosmological model with certain values of the cosmological density parameters, it is possible to integrate the Friedmann equations and derive the age of the universe.

:&lt;math&gt; t_0=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{da}{\dot{a}} &lt;/math&gt;

By comparing this to actual measured values of the cosmological parameters, we can confirm the validity of a model which is accelerating now, and had a slower expansion in the past.&lt;ref name=Pain/&gt;

==Explanatory models==
[[File:Dark Energy.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The expansion of the Universe accelerating. Time flows from bottom to top]]

===Dark energy===
{{main|Dark energy}}
The most important property of dark energy is that it has negative pressure (repulsive action) which is distributed relatively homogeneously in space.

:&lt;math&gt; P=wc^2\rho &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|c}} is the speed of light and {{mvar|ρ}} is the energy density. Different theories of dark energy suggest different values of {{mvar|w}}, with {{math|''w'' &lt; −{{sfrac|1|3}}}} for cosmic acceleration (this leads to a positive value of {{mvar|ä}} in the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe#Background|acceleration equation]] above).

The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is a cosmological constant or [[vacuum energy]]; in this case {{math|''w'' {{=}} −1}}. This leads to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], which has generally been known as the Standard Model of Cosmology from 2003 through the present, since it is the simplest model in good agreement with a variety of recent observations. Riess ''et al.'' found that their results from supernovae observations favoured expanding models with positive cosmological constant ({{math|''Ω&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0}}) and a current accelerated expansion ({{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}}).&lt;ref name=Riess/&gt;

===Phantom energy===
{{main|Phantom energy}}
Current observations allow the possibility of a cosmological model containing a dark energy component with equation of state {{math|''w'' &lt; −1}}. This phantom energy density would become infinite in finite time, causing such a huge gravitational repulsion that the universe would lose all structure and end in a [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=Robert |last2=Kamionkowski |first2=Marc |last3=Weinberg |first3=Nevin |title=Phantom Energy: Dark Energy with {{math |''w'' &lt; −1}} Causes a Cosmic Doomsday |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=91 |issue=7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.071301 |bibcode=2003PhRvL..91g1301C |pmid=12935004 |date=August 2003 |pages=071301 |arxiv=astro-ph/0302506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for {{math|''w'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|3|2}}}} and {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;=70&amp;nbsp;km·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·Mpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, the time remaining before the universe ends in this Big Rip is 22&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=R.

===Alternative theories===
{{see also|Dark energy#Theories of dark energy}}
There are many alternative explanations for the accelerating universe. Some examples are [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], a proposed form of dark energy with a non-constant state equation, whose density decreases with time. [[Dark fluid]] is an alternative explanation for accelerating expansion which attempts to unite dark matter and dark energy into a single framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Anaelle |last1=Halle |first2=Hongsheng |last2=Zhao |first3=Baojiu |last3=Li |date=2008 |title=Perturbations in a non-uniform dark energy fluid: equations reveal effects of modified gravity and dark matter |arxiv=0711.0958 |doi=10.1086/587744 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume=177 |issue=1 |pages=1 |bibcode=2008ApJS..177....1H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, some authors have argued that the accelerated expansion of the universe could be due to a repulsive [[gravitational interaction of antimatter]]&lt;ref name="benoit-levy"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A. |last1=Benoit-Lévy |first2=G. |last2=Chardin |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/01/aa16103-10/aa16103-10.html |title=Introducing the Dirac–Milne universe |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=537 |issue=78 |page=A78 |year=2012 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201016103 |arxiv=1110.3054 |bibcode=2012A&amp;A...537A..78B }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hajdukovic"&gt;{{cite journal |first=D.

Another type of model, the backreaction conjecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/28/16/164008 |volume=28 |issue=16 |title=Backreaction: directions of progress |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |pages=164008 |arxiv=1102.0408 |bibcode=2011CQGra..28p4008R |last1=Räsänen |first1=Syksy |last2=Ratra |first2=Bharat |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.nucl.012809.104435 |volume=62 |issue=1 |title=Backreaction in Late-Time Cosmology |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science |pages=57–79 |arxiv=1112.5335 |bibcode=2012ARNPS..62...57B |last1=Buchert |first1=Thomas |last2=Räsänen |first2=Syksy |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed by cosmologist Syksy Räsänen:&lt;ref name="NS2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11498-is-dark-energy-an-illusion/ |title=Is dark energy an illusion? |date=2007 |newspaper=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rate of expansion is not homogenous, but we are in a region where expansion is faster than the background. Inhomogeneities in the early universe cause the formation of walls and bubbles, where the inside of a bubble has less matter than on average. According to general relativity, space is less curved than on the walls, and thus appears to have more volume and a higher expansion rate. In the denser regions, the expansion is slowed by a higher gravitational attraction. Therefore, the inward collapse of the denser regions looks the same as an accelerating expansion of the bubbles, leading us to conclude that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/23025-doctor-who-tardis-regions-universe.html |title=A Cosmic 'Tardis': What the Universe Has In Common with 'Doctor Who' |website=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit is that it does not require any new physics such as dark energy. Räsänen does not consider the model likely, but without any falsification, it must remain a possibility. It would require rather large density fluctuations (20%) to work.&lt;ref name="NS2007" /&gt;

A final possibility is that dark energy is an illusion caused by some bias in measurements. For example, if we are located in an emptier-than-average region of space, the observed cosmic expansion rate could be mistaken for a variation in time, or acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiltshire |first=David L. |year=2007 |title=Exact Solution to the Averaging Problem in Cosmology |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=99 |issue=25 |page=251101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.251101 |pmid=18233512 |bibcode=2007PhRvL..99y1101W |arxiv=0709.0732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ishak, Mustapha |author2=Richardson, James |author3=Garred, David |author4=Whittington, Delilah |author5=Nwankwo, Anthony |author6=Sussman, Roberto |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.78.123531 |journal=Physical Review D |title=Dark Energy or Apparent Acceleration Due to a Relativistic Cosmological Model More Complex than FLRW? |volume=78 |issue=12 |pages=123531 |year=2008 |arxiv=0708.2943 |bibcode=2008PhRvD..78l3531I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mattsson, Teppo |doi=10.1007/s10714-009-0873-z |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |volume=42 |title=Dark energy as a mirage |issue=3 |pages=567–599 |year=2010 |arxiv=0711.4264 |bibcode=2010GReGr..42..567M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clifton |first=Timothy |author2=Ferreira, Pedro |date=April 2009 |title=Does Dark Energy Really Exist? |journal=Scientific American |volume=300 |issue=4 |pages=48–55 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0409-48 |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=does-dark-energy-exist |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |pmid=19363920 |bibcode=2009SciAm.300d..48C }}&lt;/ref&gt; A different approach uses a cosmological extension of the [[equivalence principle]] to show how space might appear to be expanding more rapidly in the voids surrounding our local cluster.

==Theories for the consequences to the universe==
{{See also|Future of an expanding universe}}
As the universe expands, the density of radiation and ordinary [[dark matter]] declines more quickly than the density of [[dark energy]] (see [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]]) and, eventually, dark energy dominates. Specifically, when the scale of the universe doubles, the density of matter is reduced by a factor of 8, but the density of dark energy is nearly unchanged (it is exactly constant if the dark energy is a [[cosmological constant]]).&lt;ref name=Ryden/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}}

In models where dark energy is a cosmological constant, the universe will expand exponentially with time in the far future, coming closer and closer to a [[de Sitter space]]time. This will eventually lead to all evidence for the Big Bang disappearing, as the cosmic microwave background is redshifted to lower intensities and longer wavelengths. Eventually its frequency will be low enough that it will be absorbed by the [[interstellar medium]], and so be screened from any observer within the galaxy. This will occur when the universe is less than 50 times its current age, leading to the end of cosmology as we know it as the distant universe turns dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krauss |first1=Lawrence M. |last2=Scherrer |first2=Robert J. |title=The return of a static universe and the end of cosmology |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |year=2007 |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1545–1550 |doi=10.1007/s10714-007-0472-9 |arxiv=0704.0221 |bibcode=2007GReGr..39.1545K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A constantly expanding universe with non-zero cosmological constant has mass density decreasing over time, to an undetermined point when zero matter density is reached. All matter (electrons, protons and neutrons) would ionize and disintegrate, with objects dissipating away.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Baez]], "The End of the Universe", 7 February 2016. http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/end.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives for the [[ultimate fate of the universe]] include the [[Big Rip]] mentioned above, a [[Big Bounce]], [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Crunch]].

'''Alexandria University''' ({{lang-ar|جامعة الإسكندرية}}) is a public university in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. It was established in 1938 as a satellite of [[Cairo University|Fouad University]] (the name of which was later changed to Cairo University), becoming an independent entity in 1942. It was known as Farouk University until the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] when its name was changed to the University of Alexandria. [[Taha Hussein]] was the founding [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of Alexandria University. It is now the second largest university in Egypt and has many affiliations to various universities for ongoing [[research]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24644">'''Body schema''' is a concept used in several disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[philosophy]], [[sports medicine]], and [[robotics]]. The neurologist [[Henry Head|Sir Henry Head]] originally defined it as a postural model of the body that actively organizes and modifies 'the impressions produced by incoming sensory impulses in such a way that the final sensation of [body] position, or of locality, rises into consciousness charged with a relation to something that has happened before'.&lt;ref name = "Head2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Head |first= H.|year= 1920|title=Studies in Neurology. Vol 2.|publisher= London: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a postural model that keeps track of limb position, it plays an important role in control of action. It involves aspects of both central (brain processes) and peripheral ([[Sensory system|sensory]], [[Proprioception|proprioceptive]]) systems.  Thus, a body schema can be considered the collection of processes that registers the posture of one's body parts in space. The schema is updated during body movement. This is typically a non-conscious process, and is used primarily for spatial organization of action. It is therefore a pragmatic representation of the body’s spatial properties, which includes the length of [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s and limb segments, their arrangement, the configuration of the segments in space, and the shape of the body surface.&lt;ref name = "Haggard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haggard |first= P.|author2=D.

A clear differentiation of body schema from [[Body image (medicine)|body image]] has [[#Confusion with body image|developed gradually]].

==History==
[[Henry Head]], an English neurologist who conducted pioneering work into the somatosensory system and sensory nerves, together with British neurologist [[Gordon Morgan Holmes]], first described the concept in 1911.&lt;ref name = "Head"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/brain/34.2-3.102|last=Head |first= H.|author2=G. Holmes|title=Sensory disturbances from cerebral lesions|journal= Brain|year= 1911|volume= 34|issue=2–3|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was first termed "postural schema" to describe the disordered spatial representation of patients following damage to the [[parietal lobe]] of the brain. Head and Holmes discussed two schemas (or schemata): one body schema for the registration of posture or movement and another body schema for the localization of stimulated locations on the body surface. "Body schema" became the term used for the "organized models of ourselves".&lt;ref name = "Head"/&gt; The term and definition first suggested by Head and Holmes has endured nearly a century of research with clarifications as more has become known about [[neuroscience]] and the brain.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt;[[File:Henry Head.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Henry Head, the pioneering English neurologist who first defined and used the term "body schema".]]

==Properties==
Neuroscientists Patrick Haggard and [[Daniel Mark Wolpert|Daniel Wolpert]] have identified seven fundamental properties of the body schema. It is spatially coded, [[Modularity|modular]], [[Adaptability|adaptable]], supramodal, coherent, [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]], and updated with [[Motion (physics)|movement]].&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt;

===Spatial encoding===
The body schema represents both position and configuration of the body as a 3-dimensional object in space. A combination of sensory information, primarily [[Somatosensory system|tactile]] and [[Visual system|visual]], contributes to the representation of the limbs in space.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Macaluso"/&gt; This integration allows for [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] to be localized in external space with respect to the body.&lt;ref name = "Berti"/&gt; An example by Haggard and Wolpert shows the combination of tactile sensation of the hand with information about the joint angles of the arm, which allow for rapid movements of said arm to swat a fly.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt;

===Modular===
The body schema is not represented wholly in a single [[List of regions in the human brain|region of the brain]].&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt; Recent [[fMRI]] (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) studies confirm earlier results. For example, the schema for feet and hands are coded by different regions of the brain, while the fingers are represented by a separate part entirely.&lt;ref name="Chaminade"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.04.026|author1=Chaminade, T. |author2=A. Meltzoff |author3=J. Decety  |last-author-amp=yes |title=An fMRI study of imitation: action representation and body schema|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2005|volume=43|issue=1|pages=115–127|pmid=15488911|pmc=3648209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptable===
[[Neuroplasticity|Plastic]] changes to the body schema are active and continuous. For example, gradual changes to the body schema must occur over the lifetime of an individual as he or she grows and absolute and relative sizes of body parts change over his or her life span.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt; The development of the body schema has also been shown to occur in young [[child]]ren. One study showed that with these children (9-, 14-, and 19-month-olds), older children handled spoons so as to optimally and comfortably grip them for use, whereas younger children tended to reach with their [[handedness|dominant]] hand, regardless of the orientation of the spoon and eventual ease of use.&lt;ref name = "Johnson2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(99)00063-3|last=Johnson |first=S.|title= Thinking ahead: the case for motor imagery in prospective judgements of prehension|journal= Cognition|year= 2000|volume= 74|issue=1|pages=33–70|pmid=10594309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term plasticity has been shown with the integration of tools into the body schema.&lt;ref name = "Carlson"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maravita2"/&gt; The [[Multisensory integration#Rubber hand illusion|rubber hand illusion]] has also shown the rapid reorganization of the body schema on the timescale of seconds, showing the high level of plasticity and speed with which the body schema reorganizes.&lt;ref name = "Lewis"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11097-010-9154-2|last=Lewis |first= E. |author2=D. M. Lloyd|title= Embodied experience: A first-person investigation of the rubber hand illusion|journal= Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences|year= 2010|volume= 9|issue=3|pages=317–339}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Illusion, participants view a dummy hand being stroked with a paintbrush, while their own hand is stroked identically. Participants may feel that the touches on their hand are coming from the dummy hand, and even that the dummy hand is, in some way, their own hand.

===Supramodal===
By its nature, body schema integrates [[proprioception|proprioceptive]], (the sense of the relative position of neighbouring parts of one's body), and tactile information to maintain a three-dimensional body representation. However, other sensory information, particularly visual, can be in the same representation of the body. This simultaneous participation means there are combined representations within the body schema, which suggests the involvement of a process to translate primary information (e.g. visual, tactile, etc.) into a single [[stimulus modality|sensory modality]] or an abstract, amodal form.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt;

===Coherent===
The body schema, to function properly, must be able to maintain coherent organization continuously.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt; To do so, it must be able to resolve any differences between sensory inputs. Resolving these inter-sensory inconsistencies can result in interesting sensations, such as those experienced during the Rubber Hand Illusion.&lt;ref name = "Lewis"/&gt;

===Interpersonal===
It is thought that an individual's body schema is used to represent both one's own body and the bodies of others. [[Mirror neurons]] are thought to play a role in the interpersonal characteristics of body schema. Interpersonal projection of one's body schema plays an important role in successfully imitating motions such as hand gestures, especially while maintaining the handedness and location of the gesture, but not necessarily copying the exact motion itself.&lt;ref name = "Chaminade"/&gt;

===Updated with movement===
A working body schema must be able to interactively track the movements and positions of body parts in space.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt; Neurons in the premotor cortex may contribute to this function. A class of neuron in the premotor cortex is multisensory. Each of these multisensory neurons responds to tactile stimuli and also to visual stimuli. The neuron has a tactile receptive field (responsive region on the body surface) typically on the face, arms, or hands. The same neuron also responds to visual stimuli in the space near the tactile receptive field. For example, if a neuron's tactile receptive field covers the arm, the same neuron will respond to visual stimuli in the space near the arm. As shown by [[Michael Graziano|Graziano]] and colleagues, the visual receptive field will update with arm movement, translating through space as the arm moves.&lt;ref name="Graziano&amp;etal2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Graziano, M.S.A. |author2=Hu, X.T. |author3=Gross, C.G |last-author-amp=yes | year=1997 | title=Coding the locations of objects in the dark | journal=Science | volume=277 | pages=239–241 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5323.239 | PMID=9211852 | issue=5323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graziano&amp;etal&amp;1994"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Graziano, M.S.A. | author-link=Michael Graziano | author2=Yap, G.S. | author3=Gross, C.G | last-author-amp=yes | year=1994 | title=Coding of visual space by premotor neurons | journal=Science | volume=266 | pages=1054–1057|doi=10.1126/science.7973661 | pmid=7973661}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar body-part-centered neuronal receptive fields relate to the face. These neurons apparently monitor the location of body parts and the location of nearby objects with respect to body parts. Similar neuronal properties may also be important for the ability to incorporate external objects into the body schema, such as in tool use.

==Extended Body Schema==
The idea of the extended body schema is that, aside from the proprioceptive, visual, and sensory components that contribute to making a mental conception of one's body, the same processes that contribute to a body schema are also able to incorporate external objects into the mental conception of one's body. &lt;ref&gt;Aglioti et al., 1996. Disownership of left hand and objects related to it in a patient with right brain damage. NeuroReport. 8:293-296.&lt;/ref&gt; Part philosophical and part neuroscience, this concept builds upon the ideas of plasticity and adaptation to attempt to answer the question of where the body schema ends. 

There is debate as to whether this concept truly exists, with one side arguing that the body schema does not extend past the body and the other side believing otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, C. L., &amp; Farah, M. J. (1995). The psychological reality of the body schema: A test with normal participants. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 21(2), 334-343.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto and Kitazawa. 2011. Reversal of subjective temporal order due to arm crossing. Nature Neuroscience 4: 759-765&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporting Arguments===
The perspective shared by those who agree with the theory of the extended body schema follow reasoning in line with such that supports theories on [[Body_schema#Tool_use|tool use]]. 

In some studies, attempts at understanding tool assimilation are used to argue for the existence of the extended body schema. In an experiment involving the use and interaction with wool objects, subjects were tested on their ability to perceive afterimages of wool objects in varying contexts. Subjects accustomed their eyes to a dark room and then were shown a brief (1 millisecond) flash of light, intending to produce an afterimage effect of their arms which they held out in front of them during the experiment. Moving an arm afterwards would make the afterimage "fade" or disappear as it moved, thus indicating that the feature (the arm) was being tracked and integrated into the person's body schema. To test integration of the meaningless wool objects, subjects experienced four different contexts. 

# Subjects held the wool objects in each hand and one hand (the active hand) would move, still holding the object (the active object). 
# Using the active hand, the active wool object would be dropped once an afterimage was perceived. 
# Using the active hand, one would grab the active wool object once an afterimage was perceived. 
# The subjects were to hold onto a mechanical device which held the wool object. Once an afterimage was perceived, a subject's active hand would cause the mechanical device to drop the wool object. 

In all situations but the fourth, the subjects experienced the same "fading" effect as they did with their arm alone. This would thus indicate that the wool objects had been integrated into their body schema and contributes support towards the idea of the body's using proprioceptive and visual elements to create an extended body schema. The mechanical device acted as an intermediate between the subject and the active object, and the subjects' failure to detect an afterimage in that context indicates that this concept of extension is limited to being sensitive to only what the body is directly in contact with.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson et al. 2010. Rapid Assimilation of External Objects Into the Body Schema. ''Psychological Science''. 21(7):1000-1005&lt;/ref&gt;



===Dissenting Arguments===

The alternate perspective is that the body is the limit of any sort of body schema. 

An example of this division is found in a study and discussion on personal and extrapersonal attention, where personal relates to the body's sense of itself (the body schema) and extrapersonal relates to all external of such. Some research supports the claim that these two categories are purely distinct and do not intermingle, contrary to what the extended body schema theory describes. Evidence for such is primarily found in subjects with unilateral neglect, such as in the case of E.D.S., who was a middle-aged man with right hemisphere brain damage. When he was tested for hemispatial neglect using traditional measures such as sentence reading and cancellation tests, E.D.S. showed few signs and upon later examination showed no signs whatsoever, leading doctors to believe he was normal. However, he constantly had issues with physical therapy because he would claim to not be able to see his left leg; upon further examination, E.D.S. was known to have a particular type of hemispatial neglect that only affected the perception of his body. The motor function of the left side of his body was negatively affected though not totally compromised, yet when attempting tasks such as shaving, he would invariably not shave the left side of his face. This led some researchers to believe that there is a distinction between personal and extrapersonal neglect, which would thus reflect a similar distinction with body schema itself.&lt;ref&gt;Guariglia and Antonucci. 1992. Personal and extrapersonal space: A case of neglect dissociation. Neuropsychologia, 30:1001-1009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated disorders==

===Deafferentation===
The most direct of related [[Disease#Disorder|disorders]], [[Silver Spring monkeys#Deafferentation experiments|deafferentation]] occurs when sensory input from the body is reduced or absent, without affecting [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]], or motor, neurons. The most famous case of this disorder is "IW", who lost all sensory input from below the neck, resulting in temporary paralysis. He was forced to learn to control his movement all over again using only his conscious body image and visual feedback. As a result, when constant visual input is lost during an activity, such as walking, it becomes impossible for him to complete the task, which may result in falling, or simply stopping. IW requires constant attention to tasks to be able to complete them accurately, demonstrating how automatic and [[subconscious]] the process of integrating touch and proprioception into the body schema actually is.&lt;ref name = "Gallagher"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gallagher |first= S.|author2=J. Cole|title= Body schema and body image in a deafferented subject|journal= Journal of Mind and Behavior|year= 1995|volume= 16|issue=4|pages=369–390|url=http://www.umaine.edu/jmb/archives/volume16/16_4_1995autumn.html#abstract2 | accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autotopagnosia===
[[Autotopagnosia]] typically occurs after left parietal lesions. Patients with this disorder make errors which result from confusion between adjacent body parts. For example, a patient may point to their knee when asked to point to their hip. Because the disorder involves the body schema, localization errors may be made both on the patient’s own body and that of others. The spatial unity of the body within the body schema has been damaged such that it has incorrectly been segmented in relation to its other modular parts.&lt;ref name = "Sirigu"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/brain/114.1.629|author=Sirigu, A.|title= Multiple representations contribute to body knowledge processing: Evidence from a case of autotopagnosia|journal= Brain|year= 1991|volume=114|issue=1|pages=629|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phantom limb===
[[Phantom limb]]s are a phenomenon which occurs following [[amputation]] of a limb from an individual. In 90–98% of cases, amputees report feeling all or part of the limb or body part still there, taking up space.&lt;ref name = "Ramachandran"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/brain/121.9.1603|last=Ramachandran |first=V.S.|author2=W. Hirstein|title= The perception of phantom limbs. The D. O. Hebb lecture|journal= Brain|year= 1998|volume= 121|issue=9|pages=1603–30|pmid=9762952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amputee may perceive a limb under full control, or [[Paralysis|paralyzed]]. A common side effect of phantom limbs is phantom limb pain. The neurophysiological mechanisms by which phantom limbs occur is still under debate.&lt;ref name = "Giummarra"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2007.01.009|author=Giummarra, M.|title= Central mechanisms in phantom limb perception: the past, present and future|journal= Brain Research Reviews|year= 2007|volume= 54|issue=1|pages=219–232|pmid=17500095|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common theory posits that the [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent neurons]], since deafferented due to amputation, typically remap to adjacent cortical regions within the brain. This can cause amputees to report feeling their missing limb being touched when a seemingly unrelated part of the body is stimulated (such as if the face is touched, but the amputee also feels their missing arm being stroked in a specific location). Another facet of phantom limbs is that the [[Efference copy|efferent copy]] (motor feedback) responsible for reporting on position to the body schema does not attenuate quickly. Thus the missing body part may be attributed by the amputee to still be in a fixed or movable position.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt;



==Tool use==
[[File:Rhesus Macaques - cropped.jpg|thumb|Rhesus macaques are able to be trained to use rudimentary tools, but have never been proven to use tools spontaneously in the wild.&lt;ref name = "Maravita2"/&gt;]]
Not only is it necessary for the body schema to be able to integrate and form a three-dimensional representation of the body, but it also plays an important role in [[Tool use by animals|tool]] use.&lt;ref name = "Maravita2"/&gt; Studies recording neuronal activity in the intraparietal cortex in [[macaque]]s have shown that, with training, the macaque body schema updates to include tools, such as those used for reaching, into the body schema.&lt;ref name = "Maravita2"/&gt; In humans, body schema plays an important role in both simple and complex tool use, far beyond that of macaques.&lt;ref name = "Berti"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maravita2"/&gt; Extensive training is also not necessary for this integration.&lt;ref name = "Chaminade"/&gt;

The mechanisms by which tools are integrated into the body schema are not fully understood. However, studies with long-term training have shown interesting [[Phenomenon|phenomena]]. When wielding tools in both hands in a crossed posture, behavioral effects reverse in a similar way to when only hands are crossed. Thus, sensory stimuli are delivered the same way be it to the hands directly or indirectly via the tools. These studies suggest the mind incorporates the tools into the same or similar areas as it does the adjacent hands.&lt;ref name = "Maravita2"/&gt; Recent research into the short term plasticity of the body schema used individuals without any prior training with tools. These results, derived from the relation between [[afterimage]]s and body schema, show that tools are incorporated into the body schema within seconds, regardless of length of training, though the results do not extend to other species besides humans.&lt;ref name = "Berti"/&gt;

==Confusion with body image==
Historically, body schema and [[Body image (medicine)|body image]] were generally lumped together, used interchangeably, or ill-defined. In science and elsewhere, the two terms are still commonly misattributed or confused.  Efforts have been made to distinguish the two and define them in clear and differentiable ways.&lt;ref name = "Gallagherbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher |first=S.|title= How the body shapes the mind|year= 2006|isbn=0-19-920416-0|publisher= Oxford University Press, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; A body image consists of perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs concerning one's body. In contrast, body schema consists of sensory-motor capacities that control movement and posture.

Body image may involve a person’s conscious perception of his or her own physical appearance. It is how individuals see themselves when picturing themselves in their mind, or when perceiving themselves in a mirror.  Body image differs from body schema as perception differs from movement.  Both may be involved in action, especially when learning new movements.

'''''But I'm a Cheerleader''''' is a 1999 American [[Satire|satirical]] [[romantic comedy]] film directed by [[Jamie Babbit]] and written by [[Brian Wayne Peterson]]. [[Natasha Lyonne]] stars as Megan Bloomfield, a high school cheerleader whose parents send her to a residential inpatient [[conversion therapy]] camp to cure her [[lesbianism]]. There Megan soon comes to embrace her sexual orientation, despite the therapy, and falls in love. The supporting cast includes [[Melanie Lynskey]], [[Dante Basco]], [[Eddie Cibrian]], [[Clea DuVall]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], Katrina Phillips, [[RuPaul]], [[Richard Moll]], [[Mink Stole]], [[Kip Pardue]], [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]], and [[Bud Cort]].

''But I'm a Cheerleader'' was Babbit's first feature film. It was inspired by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs. She used the story of a young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the [[social construction]] of [[gender role]]s and [[heteronormativity]]. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.

When it was initially rated as [[NC-17]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], Babbit made cuts to allow it to be re-rated as [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R]]. When interviewed in the documentary film ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'' Babbit criticized the MPAA for discriminating against films with gay content.

Many critics did not like the film, comparing it unfavorably with the films of [[John Waters]] and criticizing the colorful production design. Although the lead actors were praised for their performances, some of the characters were described as [[stereotype|stereotypical]].

== Plot ==
Seventeen-year-old Megan ([[Natasha Lyonne]]) is a sunny high school [[Twelfth grade|senior]] who loves cheerleading and is dating a [[American football|football player]], Jared (Brandt Wille). She does not enjoy kissing Jared, however, and prefers looking at her fellow cheerleaders. Combined with Megan's interest in [[vegetarianism]] and [[Melissa Etheridge]], her family and friends suspect that she is in fact a lesbian. With the help of [[ex-gay]] Mike ([[RuPaul]]), they surprise her with an intervention. Following this confrontation, Megan is sent to True Directions, a [[reparative therapy]] camp which uses a five-step program (similar to [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]' [[twelve-step program]]) to convert its campers to heterosexuality.

At True Directions, Megan meets the founder, strict disciplinarian Mary Brown ([[Cathy Moriarty]]), Mary's supposedly heterosexual son Rock ([[Eddie Cibrian]]),{{refn|In ''A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory'', Nikki Sullivan calls Rock "overtly homosexual" and says that Mary's desire to cure her son of homosexuality is the inspiration for the True Directions program. (According to the film's backstory, she started True Directions after her husband left her for another man.)&lt;ref name=Sullivan55 /&gt;|group="nb"}} and a group of young people trying to "cure" themselves of their homosexuality. With the prompting of Mary and the other campers, Megan reluctantly agrees that she is a lesbian (step 1 of the five-step program). This fact, at odds with her traditional, religious upbringing, distresses her and she puts every effort into becoming heterosexual. Early on in her stay at True Directions, Megan discovers two of the boys, Dolph and Clayton ([[Dante Basco]] and [[Kip Pardue]]), [[making out]]. She panics and screams, leading to their discovery by Mike. Dolph is made to leave and Clayton is punished by being forced into isolation.

The True Directions program involves the campers admitting their homosexuality (step 1), rediscovering their [[gender identity]] by performing stereotypically gender-associated tasks (step 2), finding the [[Root cause|root]] of their homosexuality through family therapy (step 3), demystifying the other sex (step 4), and simulating heterosexual intercourse (step 5). Over the course of the program, Megan becomes friends with another girl at the camp, Graham ([[Clea DuVall]]) who, though more comfortable being gay than Megan, was forced to the camp at the risk of otherwise being disowned by her family.

The True Directions kids are encouraged to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, [[ex-ex-gay]]s Larry and Lloyd ([[Richard Moll]] and [[Wesley Mann]]), who take the campers to a local [[gay bar]] where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance. When Mary discovers the trip, she makes them all [[Picketing (protest)|picket]] Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying placards and shouting [[Homophobia|homophobic]] abuse. Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love. When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.

Megan and Dolph infiltrate the True Directions graduation ceremony where Dolph easily coaxes Clayton away. Megan entreats Graham to join them as well, but Graham nervously declines. Megan then performs a cheer for Graham and tells her that she loves her, finally winning Graham over. They drive off with Dolph and Clayton. The final scene of the film shows Megan's parents ([[Mink Stole]] and [[Bud Cort]]) attending a [[PFLAG]] meeting to come to terms with their daughter's homosexuality.

== Background and production ==
''But I'm a Cheerleader'' was Babbit's first feature film.&lt;ref name=Warn /&gt; She had previously directed two [[short subject|short films]], ''Frog Crossing'' (1996) and ''[[Sleeping Beauties]]'' (1999), both of which were shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. She went on to direct the 2005 [[Thriller film|thriller]] ''[[The Quiet]]'' and the 2007 comedy ''[[Itty Bitty Titty Committee]]''. Babbit and Sperling (as producer) secured financing from Michael Burns, then the vice president of [[Prudential Financial|Prudential Insurance]] (now Vice Chairman of [[Lions Gate Entertainment]]) after showing him the script at Sundance.&lt;ref name=Warn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt; According to Babbit, their one-sentence [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] was "Two high-school girls fall in love at a reparative therapy camp."&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt; Burns gave them an initial budget of [[US$]]500,000 which was increased to US$1 million when the film went into production.&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt;

=== Conception ===
Babbit, whose mother runs a halfway house called New Directions for young people with drug and alcohol problems, had wanted to make a comedy about rehabilitation and the 12-step program.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt; After reading an article about a man who had returned from a reparative therapy camp hating himself, she decided to combine the two ideas.&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Advocate /&gt; With girlfriend Andrea Sperling, she came up with the idea for a feature film about a cheerleader who attends a reparative therapy camp.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; They wanted the main character to be a cheerleader because it is "...&amp;nbsp;the pinnacle of the American dream, and the American dream of femininity."&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt; Babbit wanted the film to represent the lesbian experience from the [[Butch and femme|femme]] perspective to contrast with several films of the time that represented the butch perspective (for example, ''[[Go Fish (film)|Go Fish]]'' and ''[[The Watermelon Woman]]'').&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt; She also wanted to satirize both the [[Christian right|religious right]] and the [[gay community]].&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;
Not feeling qualified to write the script herself, Babbit brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] [[Brian Wayne Peterson]].&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt; Peterson had experience with reparative therapy while working at a prison clinic for [[sex offender]]s.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt; He has said that he wanted to make a film that would not only entertain people, but also make people get angry and talk about the issues it raised.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt;

=== Set and costume design ===
[[File:Cheerleader-pickets.jpg|thumb|alt=Three young women and three young men stand in a line, with an older woman and an older man. One young woman stands behind the rest, with her back to a bright pink van. The women wear vivid pink skirts and tops and the men wear vivid blue shorts and shirts. They hold placards, in bright blue and pink, which display statements including "Silly Faggots&amp;nbsp;— Dicks are for Chicks" and "Procreate". One young woman, without a placard, throws a rock in front of her.|The True Directions campers picket the ex-ex-gays. The intense colors were intended to show the artificiality of gender construction.]]
Babbit says that her influences for the look and feel of the film included John Waters, [[David LaChapelle]], ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' and [[Barbie]].&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;
She wanted the production and costume design to reflect the themes of the story. There is a progression from the organic world of Megan's hometown, where the dominant colors are orange and brown, to the fake world of True Directions, dominated by intense blues and pinks (which are intended to show the artificiality of [[Gender studies|gender construction]]).&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; According to Babbit, the [[Mysophobia|germaphobic]] character of Mary Brown represents [[AIDS]] paranoia and her clean, ordered world is filled with plastic flowers, fake sky and [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] outfits.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; The external shots of the colorful house complete with a bright pink [[picket fence]] were filmed in [[Palmdale, California]].&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt;

=== Casting ===
Babbit recruited Clea DuVall, who had starred in her short film ''Sleeping Beauties'', to play the role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and [[Melanie Lynskey]].&lt;ref name=Warn /&gt; Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt; She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short ''Sleeping Beauties'' and was eager to work with the director.&lt;ref name=Judd /&gt; She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster.&lt;ref name=Warn /&gt; Babbit briefly considered [[Rosario Dawson]] as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]], would not be right for the All-American character.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;

Babbit made a conscious effort to cast [[Person of color|people of color]] for minor roles, in an effort to combat what she describes as "racism at every level of making movies."&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; From the beginning she intended the characters of Mike (played by RuPaul), Dolph ([[Dante Basco]]) and Andre ([[Douglas Spain]]) to be [[African American]], [[Asian people|Asian]] and Hispanic, respectively. She initially considered [[Arsenio Hall]] for the character of Mike but says that Hall was uncomfortable about playing a gay-themed role.&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt; As Mike, RuPaul makes a rare film appearance out of [[Drag (clothing)|drag]].&lt;ref name=Fine /&gt;

== Themes ==
[[File:Grahammeg.jpg|alt=Two young women face forwards, standing over a pink wooden cradle. Both are wearing pink outfits and the background is a pink room. The woman on the left has chin-length dark hair and holds in her right hand a plastic lifelike baby doll. With her left hand she pushes the other woman, who has long, light brown hair and also leans over the doll.|thumb|Graham and Megan attempt to reinforce their gender roles through performing traditional female tasks.]]
''But I'm a Cheerleader'' is not only about sexuality, but also gender and the [[social construction]] of [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name=Sullivan52 /&gt; One of the ways in which Babbit highlighted what she called the artificiality of gender construction was by using intense blues and pinks in her production and costume design.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; Chris Holmlund in ''Contemporary American Independent Film'' notes this feature of the film and calls the costumes "gender-tuned."&lt;ref name=Holmlund /&gt; Ted Gideonse in ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine wrote that the costumes and colors of the film show how false the goals of True Directions are.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt;

Gender roles are further reinforced by the tasks the campers have to perform in "Step 2: Rediscovering Your Gender Identity." Nikki Sullivan in ''A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory'' says that this rediscovery is shown to be difficult and unsuccessful rather than the natural discovery of their latent heterosexuality.&lt;ref name=Sullivan52 /&gt; Sullivan says that the film not only highlights the ways in which gender and sexuality are constructed but also takes the norms and truths about [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] society and renders them strange or "queer."&lt;ref name=Sullivan52 /&gt; Holmlund says that Babbit makes the straight characters less normal and less likable than the gay ones.&lt;ref name=Holmlund /&gt; Sullivan says that this challenge of heteronormativity makes ''But I'm a Cheerleader'' an exemplification of [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name=Sullivan52 /&gt;

== Rating and distribution ==
When originally submitted to the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] rating board, ''But I'm a Cheerleader'' received an [[NC-17]] rating. In order to get a commercially viable R rating, Babbit removed a two-second shot of Graham's hand sweeping Megan's clothed body, a [[Panning (camera)|camera pan]] up Megan's body when she is masturbating, and a comment that Megan "ate Graham out" (slang for [[cunnilingus]]).&lt;ref name=Taubin /&gt; Babbit was interviewed by [[Kirby Dick]] for his 2006 documentary film ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]''.&lt;ref name=DickFilm /&gt; A critique of the MPAA's rating system, it suggests that films with homosexual content are treated more stringently than those with only heterosexual content, and that scenes of female sexuality draw harsher criticism from the board than those of male sexuality.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; It compares this movie to ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' (also released in 1999), which features a teenage boy masturbating and was given an R rating (though ''American Pie'' also originally received an NC-17 rating and also required cuts to its masturbation scene to reduce its rating to R). Babbit says that she felt discriminated against for making a gay film.&lt;ref name=GayWired /&gt; The film was rated as M (for mature audiences) in Australia and in New Zealand, 14A in Canada, 12 in Germany and 15 in the United Kingdom.

The film [[premiere]]d on September 12, 1999 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and was shown in January 2000 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It went on to play at several international film festivals including the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]] festival and the [[London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival]]. It first appeared in U.S. theaters on July 7, 2000, distributed by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]].&lt;ref name=BoxOfficeMojo /&gt; [[Fine Line Features]] had intended to distribute the film but dropped it two months before it was due to open following a dispute with the film's production company, [[Ignite Entertainment]].&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;&lt;ref name=Churi /&gt; It closed after 8 weeks, with its widest release having been 115 theaters.&lt;ref name=BoxOfficeMojo /&gt;

The film was released on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] DVD by Lions Gate on July 22, 2002 and by [[Universal Studios]] on October 3, 2002.&lt;ref name=Movieweb /&gt; Other than the [[film trailer|theatrical trailer]], it contains no extras.&lt;ref name=DVDReview /&gt; It was released on Region 2 DVD on June 2, 2003 by [[Prism Leisure]]. In addition to the trailer, it features an interview with Jamie Babbit and behind the scenes footage.&lt;ref name=Amazon /&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Box office and audience reaction ===
''But I'm a Cheerleader'' grossed [[United States dollar|$]]2,205,627 in the United States and $389,589 elsewhere, giving a total of $2,595,216 worldwide. In its opening weekend, showing at four theaters, it earned $60,410 which was 2.7% of its total gross.&lt;ref name=BoxOfficeMojo /&gt; According to [[Box Office Mojo]], it ranked at 174 for all films released in the US in 2000 and 74 for R-rated films released that year.&lt;ref name=BoxOfficeMojo /&gt; {{As of|December 2011}}, its all time box-office ranking for [[LGBT]]-related films is 73.&lt;ref name=MojoGay /&gt;

The film was a hit with festival audiences and received [[standing ovation]]s at the [[San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mandelb /&gt; It has been described as a favorite with gay audiences and on the [[art film|art house]] circuit.&lt;ref name=Tropiano /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benshoff /&gt;

=== Critical reception ===
Initial mainstream critical response to ''But I'm a Cheerleader'' was mostly negative. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave it a score of 34% based on 47 reviews,&lt;ref name=Tomatoes /&gt; and [[Metacritic]] gave it a score of 39% based on 30 reviews.&lt;ref name=MetaCritic /&gt; The overall theme of reviews is that it is a heartfelt film with good intentions, but that it is flawed.&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt;&lt;ref name=Berardinelli /&gt; Some reviewers found it funny and enjoyable with "genuine laughs", however.&lt;ref name=LaSalle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Baumgarten /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] rated it three stars (of four) and wrote, it "is not a great, breakout comedy, but more the kind of movie that might eventually become a regular on the midnight cult circuit."&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt; Others found it obvious, leaden, and heavy handed.&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitchell /&gt;

Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Elvis Mitchell]] described the character of Megan as a sweet heroine and Lyonne and DuVall were praised for their performances.&lt;ref name=Mitchell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Noh /&gt; [[Mick LaSalle]] called Lyonne wonderful and said that she was well matched by DuVall.&lt;ref name=LaSalle /&gt; Marjorie Baumgarten said that they "hit the right notes."&lt;ref name=Baumgarten /&gt; Alexandra Mendenhall, writing for [[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterEllen.com]] felt that the relationship between Graham and Megan, having great chemistry, does not get enough screen time.&lt;ref name=Mendenhall /&gt; Mitchell called their love scenes "tender."&lt;ref name=Mitchell /&gt;
Other characters, particularly the males, were described as "offputting" and "nothing but stereotypes."&lt;ref name=Mitchell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Noh /&gt;

Several reviewers compared the film to those of director [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] but felt that it fell short of the mark.&lt;ref name=Noh /&gt; Stephanie Zacharek called it a "Waters knockoff"&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt; while Ebert said that Waters might have been ruder and more polished.&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt; Babbit says that although Waters is one of her influences, she did not want her film to have the "bite" of his.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; She states that whereas John Waters does not like romantic comedies, she wanted to tell a conventionally romantic story.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; The production design, which was important to the overall look and feel of the film,&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt; drew mixed responses. LaSalle described it as clever and eyecatching and [[James Berardinelli]] called it a standout feature.&lt;ref name=Berardinelli /&gt;&lt;ref name=LaSalle /&gt; Others found it to be gaudy, dated, cartoonish and ghastly.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt;

Stephanie Zacharek, writing for [[Salon.com]] said that with regard to issues of sexual orientation and homophobia, Babbit is preaching to the converted.&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt; Cynthia Fuchs, for NitrateOnline.com, agreed, stating that "no one who is phobic might recognize himself in the film" and that "the audience who might benefit most from watching it either won't see the film or won't see the point."&lt;ref name=FuchsReview /&gt; [[David Edelstein]] said that the one sidedness of the film creates a lack of dramatic tension and calls it lazy counterpropaganda.&lt;ref name=Edelstein /&gt; In contrast, LaSalle said that "the picture manages to make a heartfelt statement about the difficulties of growing up gay" and [[Timothy Shary]] said that the film openly challenges homophobia and offers support to teenaged gay viewers.&lt;ref name=LaSalle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shary /&gt; Chris Holmlund said that the film shows that [[queer]] identity is multi-faceted, using as an example the scene where the ex-ex-gays tell Megan that there is no one way to be a lesbian.&lt;ref name=Holmlund /&gt;

Reviews from the [[List of LGBT periodicals|gay media]] were more positive, and the film has undergone a critical reassessment over time as it has been understood more to have been deliberately satirical and campy, drawing on John Waters' techniques. Feminist website Autostraddle declared the film to be #1 of 100 best lesbian movies of all time in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/100-best-lesbian-queer-bisexual-movies-285412/|title=The 100 Best Lesbian Movies Of All Time|date=August 11, 2015|work=Autostraddle|access-date=June 2, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AfterEllen.com (which covers the feminist "lesbian/bi pop culture beat"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afterellen.com/about|title=About – AfterEllen|work=AfterEllen|access-date=June 3, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has called it "one of the five best lesbian movies ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afterellen.com/movies/454739-sapphic-cinema-im-cheerleader|title=Sapphic Cinema: "But I'm a Cheerleader" – AfterEllen|date=September 25, 2015|work=AfterEllen|access-date=June 3, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; That site had originally called the movie's story predictable and the characters stereotypical in its initial 2007 review, with the reviewer saying the film was, overall, funny and enjoyable.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall" /&gt;  ''[[Curve (magazine)|Curve]]'' called the film an "incredible comedy" and said that Babbit has "redefined lesbian film" with this movie and her other work.&lt;ref name="Curve" /&gt; Praise was not universal, however. Jan Stuart, writing for ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', said that although the film tries to subvert gay stereotypes, it is unsuccessful. She called it "numbingly crude" and said that the [[kitsch]] portrait of [[Middle America (US)|Middle America]] is out of touch with today's gay teenagers.&lt;ref name=Stuart /&gt;

=== Awards ===
The film won the Audience Award and the Graine de Cinéphage Award at the 2000 [[Créteil International Women's Film Festival]], an annual French festival which showcases the work of female directors.&lt;ref name=SullivanM /&gt; Also that year it was nominated by the [[Political Film Society]] of America for the [[Political Film Society Awards|PFS award]] in the categories of [[Political Film Society Award for Human Rights|Human Rights]] and [[Political Film Society Award for Exposé|Exposé]], but lost out to ''[[Remember the Titans]]'' and ''[[Before Night Falls (film)|Before Night Falls]]'', respectively.&lt;ref name=PFS /&gt;

A law based on a prior court decision"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For additional cites giving this definition, see [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|the section on the connotations of the term "common law,"]] below.&lt;/ref&gt;  The defining characteristic of “common law” is that it arises as precedent.  In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past [[precedent]]ial decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts.  If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as ''[[stare decisis]]''). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a "[[Case of first impression|matter of first impression]]"), and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question, judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision).&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury v.

Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.")&lt;/ref&gt; The court states an [[legal opinion|opinion]] that gives reasons for the decision, and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as [[precedent]] to bind future judges and litigants.

By the early 20th century, legal professionals had come to reject any idea of a higher or natural law, or a law above the law.

== Definitions ==
The term ''common law'' has many connotations. The first three set out here are the most-common usages within the legal community. Other connotations from past centuries are sometimes seen, and are sometimes heard in everyday speech.

=== Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law {{Anchor|Disambiguate_statute}} ===
The first definition of "common law" given in ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 10th edition, 2014, is "The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions; [synonym] CASELAW, [contrast] STATUTORY LAW."  &lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334|quote=1. The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions; [synonym] CASE LAW [contrast to] STATUTORY LAW.}}  ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' is the most-used legal dictionary used among legal professionals in the U.S.{{cite web|url=https://library.law.yale.edu/us-legal-dictionaries|title=U.S. Legal Dictionaries|last=|first=|date=|website=library.law.yale.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is given as the first definition in modern legal dictionaries, is characterized as the “most common” usage among legal professionals, and is the usage frequently seen in decisions of courts.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DuhaimeDef1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonProbateDef1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USvTexas"&gt;For an example of this usage in a decision of the United States Supreme Court, see the quote from ''United States v Texas'' in the section “[[Common law#Interaction with statute|Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law]]” below.&lt;/ref&gt; In this connotation, "common law" distinguishes the authority that promulgated a law. For example, the law in most [[Anglo-America]]n [[jurisdiction]]s includes "[[statute|statutory law]]" enacted by a [[legislature]], "[[Regulation (law)|regulatory law]]" (in the U.S.) or “[[Primary and secondary legislation|delegated legislation]]” (in the U.K.) promulgated by [[executive branch]] agencies pursuant to delegation of rule-making authority from the legislature, and common law or "[[case law]]", ''i.e.'', decisions issued by [[courts]] (or [[quasi-judicial]] [[tribunal]]s within agencies).&lt;ref name="salmond32"&gt;{{harvnb|Salmond|1907|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|first connotation]] can be further differentiated into
; (a) pure common law: arising from the traditional and inherent authority of courts to define what the law is, even in the absence of an underlying statute or regulation. Examples include most [[criminal law]] and [[procedural law]] before the 20th century, and even today, most [[contract law]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Allen Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts, §&amp;nbsp;1.7, Aspen (2004) (although certain fields of contract law have been modified by statute, "judicial decisions [remain] the dominant primary source of contract law.")&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[law of torts]].&lt;ref name="SpeiserLawOfTorts"&gt;Stuart Speiser, et al., The American Law of Torts, §§&amp;nbsp;1:2, 1:5, and 1:6, Thompson Reuters (2013) (describing common law development of tort law in England and the United States, and the "little reluctance [of courts] to overrule (or disapprove statements in) decisions in tort law either now deemed wrong or inadvisedly considered" and disinclination toward any contention that change must be by legislation).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute"&gt;''E.g.'', Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch 341 (defining a new rule of contract law with no basis in statute); ''Marbury v. Madison'', 137 5 U.S. 137 (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.");''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916) (discussed [[common law#CL Common Law Evolves|elsewhere in this article]], adjudicating the tort of negligence that existed in no statute, and expanding the law to cover parties that had never been addressed by statute);  Alexander Hamilton, ''[[The Federalist]]'', Nos. 78 and 81 (J. Cooke ed. 1961), 521–530, 541–55 ("The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution, is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body."); see [[rule against perpetuities]] for a judicially created law originating in 1682 that governs the validity of trusts and [[future interests]] in [[real property]], [[Rule in Shelley's Case]] for a rule created by judges in 1366 or before, and [[life estate]] and [[fee simple]] for rules of real property ownership that were judicially created in the late 12th century as the crown began to give law-making power to courts.&lt;/ref&gt;
; (b) interstitial common law: court decisions that analyze, interpret and determine the fine boundaries and distinctions in law promulgated by other bodies. This body of common law, sometimes called "interstitial common law", includes judicial interpretation of the [[Constitution]], of legislative statutes, and of [[Regulation (law)|agency regulations]], and the application of law to specific facts.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;
Publication of decisions, and indexing, is essential to the development of common law, and thus governments and private publishers publish [[law reports]].&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, large legal publishers include West Publishing and Lexis. In the UK, examples of private reports are the [[All England Law Reports]] and the [[Lloyd's Law Reports]]&lt;/ref&gt; While all decisions in [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law jurisdictions]] are precedent (at varying levels and scope as discussed throughout the article on [[precedent]]), some become "leading cases" or "landmark decisions" that are cited especially often.

=== Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems {{Anchor|Disambiguate_civil_law}} ===
''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 2, differentiates "common law" jurisdictions and legal systems from "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" or "[[Codification (law)|code]]" jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef1"/&gt; Common law systems place great weight on court decisions, which are considered "law" with the same force of law as statutes—for nearly a millennium, common law courts have had the authority to make law where no legislative statute exists, and statutes mean what courts interpret them to mean.&lt;ref&gt;It is characteristic of the common law to adopt an approach based "on precedent, and on the development of the law incrementally and by analogy with established authorities".  ''Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police'', Supreme Court, [2018] UKSC 4, para.21.[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/4.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in civil law jurisdictions (the legal tradition that prevails, or is combined with common law, in Europe and most non-Islamic, non-common law countries), courts lack authority to act if there is no statute.  Civil law judges tend to give less weight to judicial precedent, which means that a civil law judge deciding a given case has more freedom to interpret the text of a statute independently (compared to a common law judge in the same circumstances), and therefore less predictably. For example, the [[Napoleonic code]] expressly forbade French judges to pronounce general principles of law.&lt;ref&gt;"5. The judges are forbidden to pronounce, by way of general and legislative determination, on the causes submitted to them." [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/book1/c_preliminary.html Code of Napoleon, Decree of March 5, 1803, Law 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The role of providing overarching principles, which in common law jurisdictions is provided in judicial opinions, in civil law jurisdictions is filled by giving greater weight to scholarly literature, as explained [[Common law#CL academic writings|below]].

Common law systems trace their history to England, while civil law systems trace their history through the [[Napoleonic Code]] back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] of [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radford.edu/~junnever/law/commonlaw.htm|title=Description and History of Common Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html|title=The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law as opposed to equity {{Anchor|3. Law as opposed to equity}} ===
''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 4, differentiates "common law" (or just "law") from "[[equity (law)|equity]]".&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334|quote=4. The body of law derived from law courts as opposed to those sitting in equity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salmond32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef2"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage | last = Garner | first= Bryan A. | year = 2001 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = New York | edition = 2nd, revised | ref = harv|p=177|quote=Second, with the development of equity and equitable rights and remedies, ''common law'' and equitable courts, procedure, rights, and remedies, etc., are frequently contrasted, and in this sense ''common law'' is distinguished from ''equity.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1873, [[England and Wales|England]] had two complementary court systems: courts of "law" which could only award [[Monetary damages|money damages]] and recognized only the legal owner of property, and courts of "equity" ([[courts of chancery]]) that could issue [[injunction|injunctive relief]] (that is, a [[court order]] to a party to do something, give something to someone, or stop doing something) and recognized [[trust (law)|trusts]] of property. This split propagated to many of the colonies, including the United States. For most purposes, most jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal system and most states, have merged the two courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule2.htm Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 2] ("There is one form of action—the civil action.") (1938)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friedmanxix"&gt;{{harvnb|Friedman|2005|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, even before the separate courts were merged, most courts were permitted to apply both law and equity, though under potentially different procedural law. Nonetheless, the historical distinction between "law" and "equity" remains important today when the case involves issues such as the following:
* categorizing and prioritizing [[rights to property]]—for example, the same article of property often has a "[[Equitable title#Equitable versus legal title|legal title]]" and an "[[equitable title]]", and these two groups of ownership rights may be held by different people.
* in the United States, determining whether [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|the Seventh Amendment's]] right to a [[jury trial]] applies (a determination of a fact necessary to resolution of a "common law" claim)&lt;ref&gt;"In Suits at common law ... the right of [[Jury trial|trial by jury]] shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law."&lt;/ref&gt; vs. whether the issue will be decided by a [[judge]] (issues of what the law is, and all issues relating to equity).
* the standard of review and degree of deference given by an appellate tribunal to the decision of the lower tribunal under review (issues of law are reviewed ''de novo'', that is, "as if new" from scratch by the appellate tribunal, while most issues of equity are reviewed for "abuse of discretion", that is, with great deference to the tribunal below).
* the remedies available and rules of procedure to be applied.
Courts of equity rely on common law principles of binding precedent.

=== Archaic meanings and historical uses {{Anchor|4. Historical uses}} ===

In addition, there are several historical (but now archaic) uses of the term that, while no longer current, provide background context that assists in understanding the meaning of "common law" today.

In one usage that is now archaic, but that gives insight into the history of the common law, "common law" referred to the pre-Christian system of law, imported by the Saxons to England, and dating to before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], and before there was any consistent law to be applied.&lt;ref name="JeffersonToCooper"&gt;One example of this usage is in a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Dr. Thomas Cooper. {{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/jefferson_cooper.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=February 10, 1814|quote=Authorities for what is common law may therefore be as well cited, as for any part of the Lex Scripta, and there is no better instance of the necessity of holding the judges and writers to a declaration of their authorities than the present; where we detect them endeavoring to make law where they found none, and to submit us at one stroke to a whole system, no particle of which has its foundation in the common law. For we know that the common law is that system of law which was introduced by the Saxons on their settlement in England, and altered from time to time by proper legislative authority from that time to the date of Magna Carta, which terminates the period of the common law, or lex non scripta, and commences that of the statute law, or Lex Scripta. This settlement took place about the middle of the fifth century. But Christianity was not introduced till the seventh century; the conversion of the first christian king of the Heptarchy having taken place about the year 598, and that of the last about 686. Here, then, was a space of two hundred years, during which the common law was in existence, and Christianity no part of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JeffersonToCartwright&gt;Another example of this usage is in another letter of Jefferson, to John Cartright.{{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter To Major John Cartwright|url=http://www.yamaguchy.com/library/jefferson/cartwright.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=June 5, 1824|quote=I was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction, at length, of the judiciary usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions, that Christianity is a part of the common law. The proof of the contrary, which you have adduced, is incontrovertible; to wit, that the common law existed while the Anglo-Saxons were yet Pagans, at a time when they had never yet heard the name of Christ pronounced, or knew that such a character had ever existed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That usage is obsolete today. It is both underinclusive and overinclusive.

"Common law" as the term is used today in common law countries contrasts with ''[[ius commune]]''. While historically the ''ius commune'' became a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems, in England it was not a point of reference at all.&lt;ref name="Ius Commune' p.20"&gt;[[David John Ibbetson]], ''Common Law and Ius Commune'' p.20 (2001) {{ISBN|978-0-85423-165-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] dealt with lawsuits in which the Monarch had no interest, i.e., between commoners.

''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 3 is "General law common to a country as a whole, as opposed to special law that has only local application."&lt;ref name="Blacks10th"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; From at least the 11th century and continuing for several centuries after that, there were several different circuits in the royal court system, served by [[Circuit court|itinerant judges]] who would travel from town to town dispensing the King's justice in "[[assize]]s". The term "common law" was used to describe the law held in common between the circuits and the different stops in each circuit.&lt;ref name="Blacks10th" /&gt; The more widely a particular law was recognized, the more weight it held, whereas purely local customs were generally subordinate to law recognized in a plurality of jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Blacks10th" /&gt;

== Basic principles of common law ==

=== Common law adjudication ===

In a common law jurisdiction several stages of research and analysis are required to determine "what the law is" in a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Kent Gionfriddo, Thinking Like a Lawyer: The Heuristics of Case Synthesis, 40 Texas Tech. L.Rev. 1 (Sep. 2007) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1012220] [https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1209]&lt;/ref&gt; First, one must ascertain the facts. Then, one must locate any relevant statutes and cases. Then one must extract the principles, analogies and statements by various courts of what they consider important to determine how the next court is likely to rule on the facts of the present case. Later decisions, and decisions of higher courts or legislatures carry more weight than earlier cases and those of lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, one integrates all the lines drawn and reasons given, and determines "what the law is". Then, one applies that law to the facts.

In practice, common law systems are considerably more complicated than the simplified system described above. The decisions of a court are binding only in a particular [[jurisdiction]], and even within a given jurisdiction, some courts have more power than others. For example, in most jurisdictions, decisions by [[appellate courts]] are binding on lower courts in the same jurisdiction, and on future decisions of the same appellate court, but decisions of lower courts are only non-binding persuasive authority. Interactions between common law, [[constitutional law]], [[statutory law]] and [[Regulation (law)|regulatory law]] also give rise to considerable complexity.

=== The common law evolves to meet changing social needs and improved understanding {{anchor|CL_Common_Law_Evolves}} ===
[[File:Holmes Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Oliver Wendell Holmes to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1902.]]
[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] cautioned that "the proper derivation of general principles in both common and constitutional law ... arise gradually, in the emergence of a consensus from a multitude of particularized prior decisions."&lt;ref&gt;Frederic R. Kellog, Law, Morals, and Justice Holmes, 69 Judicature 214 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Cardozo|Justice Cardozo]] noted the "common law does not work from pre-established truths of universal and inflexible validity to conclusions derived from them deductively", but "[i]ts method is inductive, and it draws its generalizations from particulars".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 22–23 (1921).&lt;/ref&gt;

The common law is more malleable than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, to adapt to new trends in political, legal and [[social philosophy]]. Second, the common law evolves through a series of [[incrementalism|gradual steps]], that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects.&lt;ref&gt;The beneficial qualities of the common law's incrementalist evolution was most eloquently expressed by the future [[Lord Mansfield]], then Solicitor General Murray, in the case of ''Omychund v. Barker'', who contended that "a statute very seldom can take in all cases; therefore the common law, that works itself pure by rules drawn from the fountain of justice, is for that reason superior to an [[Act of Parliament|act of parliament]]." I Atk. 21, 33, 26 Eng. Rep. 15, 22–23 (Ch. 1744)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).

One example of the gradual change that typifies evolution of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule through most of the 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in [[privity of contract]]. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Winterbottom v. Wright'', 10 M&amp;W 109, 152 Eng.Rep. 402, 1842 WL 5519 (Exchequer of pleas 1842)&lt;/ref&gt; the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The ''Winterbottom'' court recognized that there would be "absurd and outrageous consequences" if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ("privity") with the negligent party.

A first exception to this rule arose in 1852, in the case of ''[[Thomas v. Winchester]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/thomas_winchester.htm ''Thomas v. Winchester''], 6 N.Y. 397 (N.Y. 1852)&lt;/ref&gt; when New York's highest court held that mislabeling a poison as an innocuous herb, and then selling the mislabeled poison through a dealer who would be expected to resell it, put "human life in imminent danger". ''Thomas'' relied on this reason to create an exception to the "privity" rule. In, 1909, New York held in ''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.''&lt;ref&gt;''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.'', 195 N.Y. 478, 480 (N.Y. 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; that a coffee urn manufacturer was liable to a person injured when the urn exploded, because the urn "was of such a character inherently that, when applied to the purposes for which it was designed, it was liable to become a source of great danger to many people if not carefully and properly constructed".

Yet the privity rule survived. In ''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'',&lt;ref&gt;''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'', 221 F. 801 (2nd Cir. 1915)&lt;/ref&gt; (decided in 1915 by the federal appeals court for New York and several neighboring states), the court held that a car owner could not recover for injuries from a defective wheel, when the automobile owner had a contract only with the automobile dealer and not with the manufacturer, even though there was "no question that the wheel was made of dead and ‘dozy‘ wood, quite insufficient for its purposes." The ''Cadillac'' court was willing to acknowledge that the case law supported exceptions for "an article dangerous in its nature or likely to become so in the course of the ordinary usage to be contemplated by the vendor". However, held the ''Cadillac'' court, "one who manufactures articles dangerous only if defectively made, or installed, e.g., tables, chairs, pictures or mirrors hung on the walls, carriages, automobiles, and so on, is not liable to third parties for injuries caused by them, except in case of willful injury or fraud,"
[[File:Cardozo Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Benjamin Cardozo to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1932.]]
Finally, in the famous case of ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916)[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/macpherson_buick.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1916, [[Benjamin Cardozo|Judge Benjamin Cardozo]] for New York's highest court pulled a broader principle out of these predecessor cases. The facts were almost identical to ''Cadillac'' a year earlier: a wheel from a wheel manufacturer was sold to Buick, to a dealer, to MacPherson, and the wheel failed, injuring MacPherson. Judge Cardozo held:

{{quote|It may be that Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. have extended the rule of Thomas v. Winchester. If so, this court is committed to the extension. The defendant argues that things imminently dangerous to life are poisons, explosives, deadly weapons—things whose normal function it is to injure or destroy. But whatever the rule in Thomas v. Winchester may once have been, it has no longer that restricted meaning. A scaffold (Devlin v. Smith, supra) is not inherently a destructive instrument. It becomes destructive only if imperfectly constructed. A large coffee urn (Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co., supra) may have within itself, if negligently made, the potency of danger, yet no one thinks of it as an implement whose normal function is destruction. What is true of the coffee urn is equally true of bottles of aerated water (Torgesen v. Schultz, 192 N. Y. 156). We have mentioned only cases in this court. But the rule has received a like extension in our courts of intermediate appeal. In Burke v. Ireland (26 App. Div. 487), in an opinion by CULLEN, J., it was applied to a builder who constructed a defective building; in Kahner v. Otis Elevator Co. (96 App. Div. 169) to the manufacturer of an elevator; in Davies v. Pelham Hod Elevating Co. (65 Hun, 573; affirmed in this court without opinion, 146 N. Y. 363) to a contractor who furnished a defective rope with knowledge of the purpose for which the rope was to be used. We are not required at this time either to approve or to disapprove the application of the rule that was made in these cases. It is enough that they help to characterize the trend of judicial thought.

We hold, then, that the principle of ''Thomas v. Winchester'' is not limited to poisons, explosives, and things of like nature, to things which in their normal operation are implements of destruction. If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. ... There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable.}}

Cardozo's new "rule" exists in no prior case, but is inferrable as a synthesis of the "thing of danger" principle stated in them, merely extending it to "foreseeable danger" even if "the purposes for which it was designed" were not themselves "a source of great danger". ''MacPherson'' takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression, not a wild departure. Cardozo continues to adhere to the original principle of ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright|Winterbottom]]'', that "absurd and outrageous consequences" must be avoided, and he does so by drawing a new line in the last sentence quoted above: "There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable." But while adhering to the underlying principle that ''some'' boundary is necessary, ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.|MacPherson]]'' overruled the prior common law by rendering the formerly dominant factor in the boundary, that is, the privity formality arising out of a contractual relationship between persons, totally irrelevant. Rather, the most important factor in the boundary would be the nature of the thing sold and the foreseeable uses that downstream purchasers would make of the thing.

The example of the evolution of the law of negligence in the preceding paragraphs illustrates two crucial principles: (a) The common law evolves, this evolution is in the hands of judges, and judges have "made law" for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="SpeiserLawOfTorts" /&gt; (b) The [[ratio decidendi|reasons given for a decision]] are often more important in the long run than the outcome in a particular case. This is the reason that judicial opinions are usually quite long, and give rationales and policies that can be balanced with judgment in future cases, rather than the bright-line rules usually embodied in statutes.

=== Publication of decisions ===

All law systems rely on written publication of the law,&lt;ref name="BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil" /&gt; so that it is accessible to all. Common law decisions are published in [[law reports]] for use by lawyers, courts and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=148|title=Legal Dictionary – Law.com|work=Law.com Legal Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the American Revolution, Massachusetts became the first state to establish an official Reporter of Decisions. As newer states needed law, they often looked first to the Massachusetts Reports for authoritative precedents as a basis for their own common law.&lt;ref name="BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil"&gt;Social Law Library, Common Law or Civil Code?, Boston Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States federal courts relied on private publishers until after the Civil War, and only began publishing as a government function [[United States Reports#history|in 1874]]. [[West (publisher)|West Publishing in Minnesota]] is the largest private-sector publisher of law reports in the United States. Government publishers typically issue only decisions "in the raw," while private sector publishers often add indexing, editorial analysis, and similar finding aids.

=== Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law{{anchor|Interaction_with_statute}} ===

In common law legal systems, the common law is crucial to understanding almost all important areas of law. For example, in [[English law|England and Wales]], in English Canada, and in most states of the [[Law of the United States|United States]], the basic law of [[contract]]s, [[tort]]s and [[property law|property]] do not exist in statute, but only in common law (though there may be isolated modifications enacted by statute). As another example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1877,&lt;ref&gt;''Meister v. Moore'', 96 U.S. 76 (1877) ("No doubt a statute may take away a common law right, but there is always a presumption that the legislature has no such intention unless it be plainly expressed.")&lt;/ref&gt; held that a [[Michigan]] statute that established rules for [[solemnization]] of marriages did not abolish pre-existing [[common-law marriage]], because the statute did not affirmatively require statutory solemnization and was silent as to preexisting common law.

In almost all areas of the law (even those where there is a statutory framework, such as contracts for the sale of goods,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/ Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2, on Contracts for the Sales of Goods]&lt;/ref&gt; or the criminal law),&lt;ref&gt;[[Model Penal Code]] as adopted in several states, for example, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/nycodes/c82.html New York's Penal Law]&lt;/ref&gt; legislature-enacted statutes generally give only terse statements of general principle, and the fine boundaries and definitions exist only in the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]]. To find out what the precise law is that applies to a particular set of facts, one has to locate [[precedent]]ial decisions on the topic, and reason from those decisions by [[analogy]].

In ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law jurisdictions (in the sense opposed to "civil law")]], legislatures operate under the assumption that [[statute]]s will be interpreted against the backdrop of the pre-existing common law. As the United States Supreme Court explained in ''United States v Texas'', 507 U.S. 529 (1993):

:Just as longstanding is the principle that "[s]tatutes which invade the common law ... are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident." ''Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson'', 343 U.S. 779, 783 (1952); ''Astoria Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino'', 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991). In such cases, Congress does not write upon a clean slate. ''Astoria'', 501 U.S. at 108. In order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must "speak directly" to the question addressed by the common law. ''Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham'', 436 U. S. 618, 625 (1978); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', 451 U. S. 304, 315 (1981).

For example, in most U.S. states, the criminal statutes are primarily codification of pre-existing common law. ([[Codification (law)|Codification]] is the process of enacting a statute that collects and restates pre-existing law in a single document—when that pre-existing law is common law, the common law remains relevant to the interpretation of these statutes.) In reliance on this assumption, modern statutes often leave a number of terms and fine distinctions unstated—for example, a statute might be very brief, leaving the precise definition of terms unstated, under the assumption that these fine distinctions will be inherited from pre-existing common law. (For this reason, many modern American law schools teach the common law of crime as it stood in England in 1789, because that centuries-old English common law is a necessary foundation to interpreting modern criminal statutes.)

With the transition from English law, which had common law crimes, to the new legal system under the [[U.S. Constitution]], which prohibited [[ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' laws]] at both the federal and state level, the question was raised whether there could be common law crimes in the United States. It was settled in the case of [[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']],&lt;ref name="USvHudson"&gt;[[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']], {{ussc|11|32|1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; which decided that federal courts had no jurisdiction to define new common law crimes, and that there must always be a (constitutional) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it.

Still, many states retain selected common law crimes. For example, in Virginia, the definition of the conduct that constitutes the crime of robbery exists only in the common law, and the robbery statute only sets the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Johnson v. Commonwealth'', 209 Va. 291, 293, 163 S.E.2d 570, ___ (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Code of Virginia|Virginia Code]] section 1-200 establishes the continued existence and vitality of common law principles and provides that "The common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly."

By contrast to statutory codification of common law, some statutes displace common law, for example to create a new [[cause of action]] that did not exist in the common law, or to legislatively overrule the common law. An example is the [[tort]] of [[wrongful death]], which allows certain persons, usually a spouse, child or [[estate (law)|estate]], to sue for damages on behalf of the deceased. There is no such tort in English common law; thus, any jurisdiction that lacks a wrongful death statute will not allow a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a loved one. Where a wrongful death statute exists, the compensation or other remedy available is limited to the remedy specified in the statute (typically, an upper limit on the amount of damages). Courts generally interpret statutes that create new causes of action narrowly—that is, limited to their precise terms—because the courts generally recognize the legislature as being supreme in deciding the reach of judge-made law unless such statute should violate some "second order" constitutional law provision (''cf''. [[judicial activism]]).

Where a tort is rooted in common law, all traditionally recognized damages for that tort may be sued for, whether or not there is mention of those [[damages]] in the current statutory law. For instance, a person who sustains bodily injury through the [[negligence]] of another may sue for medical costs, pain, suffering, loss of earnings or earning capacity, mental and/or emotional distress, loss of [[quality of life]], disfigurement and more. These damages need not be set forth in statute as they already exist in the tradition of common law. However, without a wrongful death statute, most of them are extinguished upon death.

In the United States, the power of the federal judiciary to review and invalidate unconstitutional acts of the federal executive branch is stated in the constitution, Article III sections 1 and 2: "The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. ... The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority..." The first [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark decision]] on "the judicial power" was ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', {{ussc|5|137|1803|Cranch|1}}. Later cases interpreted the "judicial power" of Article III to establish the power of federal courts to consider or overturn any action of Congress or of any state that conflicts with the Constitution.

The interactions between decisions of different courts is discussed further in the article on [[precedent]].

=== Overruling precedent—the limits of ''stare decisis'' ===
The [[Common law#United States federal system (1789 and 1938)|United States federal courts]] are divided into twelve regional circuits, each with a [[United States courts of appeals|circuit court of appeals]] (plus a thirteenth, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals in patent cases and cases against the federal government, without geographic limitation). Decisions of one circuit court are binding on the district courts within the circuit and on the circuit court itself, but are only persuasive authority on sister circuits. District court decisions are not binding precedent at all, only persuasive.

Most of the U.S. federal courts of appeal have adopted a rule under which, in the event of any conflict in decisions of panels (most of the courts of appeal almost always sit in panels of three), the earlier panel decision is controlling, and a panel decision may only be overruled by the court of appeals sitting ''en banc'' (that is, all active judges of the court) or by a higher court.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''South Corp. v. United States'', 690 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (''en banc'' in relevant part) (explaining order of precedent binding on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit); ''Bonner v. City of Prichard, Alabama'', 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (''en banc'') (after the Eleventh Circuit was split off from the Fifth Circuit, adopting precedent of Fifth Circuit as binding until overruled by the Eleventh Circuit ''en banc'': "The [pre-split] Fifth followed the absolute rule that a prior decision of the circuit (panel or ''en banc'') could not be overruled by a panel but only by the court sitting ''en banc''. The Eleventh Circuit decides in this case that it chooses, and will follow, this rule."); ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office).&lt;/ref&gt; In these courts, the older decision remains controlling when an issue comes up the third time.

Other courts, for example, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Supreme Court, always sit ''en banc'', and thus the ''later'' decision controls. These courts essentially overrule all previous cases in each new case, and older cases survive only to the extent they do not conflict with newer cases. The interpretations of these courts—for example, Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes—are stable only so long as the older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court. Older decisions persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is right, and that it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled.

In the jurisdictions of [[England and Wales]] and of [[Northern Ireland]], since 2009, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] has the authority to overrule and unify criminal law decisions of lower courts; it is the final court of appeal for civil law cases in all three of the UK jurisdictions but not for criminal law cases in Scotland. From 1966 to 2009, this [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|power]] lay with the [[House of Lords]], granted by the Practice Statement of 1966.&lt;ref&gt;83 Cr App R 191, 73 Cr App R 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's federal system, described [[Common law#CL Canada federal|below]], avoids regional variability of federal law by giving national jurisdiction to both layers of appellate courts.

=== Common law as a foundation for commercial economies ===

The reliance on judicial opinion is a strength of common law systems, and is a significant contributor to the robust commercial systems in the United Kingdom and United States. Because there is reasonably precise guidance on almost every issue, parties (especially commercial parties) can predict whether a proposed course of action is likely to be lawful or unlawful, and have some assurance of consistency. As [[Justice Brandeis]] famously expressed it, "in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right."&lt;ref&gt;''Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.'', 285 U.S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to predict gives more freedom to come close to the boundaries of the law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Yeo Tiong Min, "[http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html A Note on Some Differences in English Law, New York Law, and Singapore Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502093747/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html |date=2007-05-02 }}" (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many commercial contracts are more economically efficient, and create greater wealth, because the parties know ahead of time that the proposed arrangement, though perhaps close to the line, is almost certainly legal. Newspapers, taxpayer-funded entities with some religious affiliation, and political parties can obtain fairly clear guidance on the boundaries within which their [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] rights apply.

In contrast, in jurisdictions with very weak respect for precedent,&lt;ref&gt;for example, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] issues very few of its decisions in precedential form, Kate Gaudry &amp; Thomas Franklin, Only 1 in 20,631 ex parte appeals designated precedential by PTAB, IPWatchdog (Sep. 27, 2015), and various lower tribunals in the Patent Office give very weak respect to earlier superior decisions.&lt;/ref&gt; fine [[Question of law|questions of law]] are redetermined anew each time they arise, making consistency and prediction more difficult, and procedures far more protracted than necessary because parties cannot rely on written statements of law as reliable guides. In jurisdictions that do not have a strong allegiance to a large body of precedent, parties have less ''a priori'' guidance (unless the written law is very clear and kept updated) and must often leave a bigger "safety margin" of unexploited opportunities, and final determinations are reached only after far larger expenditures on legal fees by the parties.

This is the reason&lt;ref name="EisenbergMillerNewYork" /&gt; for the frequent choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts, even when neither entity has extensive contacts with New York—and remarkably often even when neither party has contacts with the United States.&lt;ref name="EisenbergMillerNewYork"&gt;Theodore Eisenberg &amp; Geoffrey P. Miller, The Flight to New York: An Empirical Study of Choice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses in {{Sic|hide=y|Publicly|-}}Held Companies’ Contracts (2008). New York University Law and Economics Working Papers. Paper 124, http://lsr.nellco.org/nyu_lewp/124 (based on a survey of 2882 contracts, "New York law plays a role for major corporate contracts similar to the role Delaware law plays in the limited setting of corporate governance disputes. ... New York's dominance is striking. It is the choice of law in approximately 46 percent of contracts," and if merger contracts excluded, over half)&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial contracts almost always include a "choice of law clause" to reduce uncertainty. Somewhat surprisingly, contracts throughout the world (for example, contracts involving parties in Japan, France and Germany, and from most of the other states of the United States) often choose the law of New York, even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated. Because of its history as the United States' commercial center, New York common law has a depth and predictability not (yet) available in any other jurisdictions of the United States. Similarly, American corporations are often formed under Delaware [[Corporations law|corporate law]], and American contracts relating to corporate law issues ([[Mergers and acquisitions|merger and acquisitions]] of companies, rights of shareholders, and so on.) include a Delaware [[choice of law]] clause, because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg &amp; Miller at 19–20 (Delaware is chosen in about 15% of contracts, "Delaware dominates for one type of contract—[merger] trust agreements. ... The dominance of Delaware for this specialized type of contract is apparently due to the advantages and flexibility which Delaware's business trust statute.")&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction (for example, England and Wales, and the state of California), but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg &amp; Miller at 19, only about 5% of commercial contracts designate California choice of law, where nearly 50% designate New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the United States, parties that are in different jurisdictions from each other often choose the law of England and Wales, particularly when the parties are each in former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth. The common theme in all cases is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations, and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well-developed body of common law to achieve that result.

Likewise, for litigation of commercial disputes arising out of unpredictable torts (as opposed to the prospective choice of law clauses in contracts discussed in the previous paragraph), certain jurisdictions attract an unusually high fraction of cases, because of the predictability afforded by the depth of decided cases. For example, [[London]] is considered the pre-eminent centre for litigation of [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-becomes-litigation-capital-of-the-world-1031231.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Richard | last=Osley | title=London becomes litigation capital of the world | date=2008-11-23}}. London is also forum for many defamation cases, because UK law is more plaintiff-friendly—in the United States, the First Amendment protection for freedom of the press allows for statements concerning public figures of questionable veracity, where in the UK, those same statements support a judgment for libel.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to say that common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the legislature has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures—but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Taxpayer Advocate Service, 2008 Report to Congress, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/08_tas_arc_msp_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|English law}}

=== Origins ===
The common law{{mdash}}so named because it was "common" to all the king's courts across England{{mdash}}originated in the practices of the courts of the English kings in the centuries following the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Prior to the Norman Conquest, much of England's legal business took place in the local folk courts of its various [[shires]] and [[Hundred (county division)|hundreds]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  A variety of other individual courts also existed across the land: urban boroughs and merchant fairs held their own courts, as did the [[University of Oxford|universities of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and large landholders also held their own manorial and seigniorial courts as needed.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Additionally, the [[Catholic Church]] operated its own court system that adjudicated issues of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}

The main sources for the history of the common law in the Middle Ages are the [[plea rolls]] and the [[Year Books]]. The plea rolls, which were the official court records for the Courts of Common Pleas and King's Bench, were written in Latin. The rolls were made up in bundles by law term: Hilary, Easter, Trinity, and Michaelmas, or winter, spring, summer, and autumn. They are currently deposited in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|the UK National Archives]], by whose permission images of the rolls for the Courts of Common Pleas, King's Bench, and Exchequer of Pleas, from the 13th century to the 17th, can be viewed online at the Anglo-American Legal Tradition site (The O'Quinn Law Library of the University of Houston Law Center).&lt;ref&gt;Documents from Medieval and Early Modern England from the National Archives in London.[http://aalt.law.uh.edu/]  Publications of the [[Selden Society]] include a Year Books series and other volumes transcribing and translating the original manuscripts of early common law cases and law reports, each volume having its editor's scholarly introduction.

The form of reasoning used in common law is known as [[casuistry]] or [[case-based reasoning]]. The common law, as applied in [[civil case]]s (as distinct from [[criminal case]]s), was devised as a means of [[damages|compensating]] someone for wrongful acts known as [[tort]]s, including both [[intentional tort]]s and torts caused by [[negligence]], and as developing the body of law recognizing and regulating [[contract]]s. The type of [[legal procedure|procedure]] practiced in common law courts is known as the [[adversarial system]]; this is also a development of the common law.

=== Medieval English common law ===

The early development of case-law in the thirteenth century has been traced to [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton's]] ''On the Laws and Customs of England'' and led to the yearly compilations of court cases known as [[Year Books]], of which the first extant was published in 1268, the same year that Bracton died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Plucknett|T. F. T. Plucknett]], ''A Concise History of the Common Law, 5th edition, 1956, London and Boston, pp.260-261&lt;/ref&gt; The Year Books are known as the law reports of medieval England, and are a principal source for knowledge of the developing legal doctrines, concepts, and methods in the period from the 13th to the 16th centuries, when the common law developed into recognizable form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/law/faculty-scholarship/legal-history-the-year-books/ BUSL, ''Legal History: The Year Books'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of English and American Literature ''The Year Books and their Value''[http://www.bartleby.com/218/1309.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Westminster Hall edited.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Westminster Hall]] in the [[Palace of Westminster]], [[London]], early 19th century.]]

In 1154, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] became the first [[Plantagenet]] king. Among many achievements, Henry institutionalized common law by creating a unified system of law "common" to the country through incorporating and elevating local custom to the national, ending local control and peculiarities, eliminating arbitrary remedies and reinstating a [[jury]] system—citizens sworn on oath to investigate reliable criminal accusations and civil claims. The jury reached its [[verdict]] through evaluating common [[Traditional knowledge|local knowledge]], not necessarily through the presentation of [[evidence (law)|evidence]], a distinguishing factor from today's civil and criminal court systems.

Henry II developed the practice of sending judges from his own central court to hear the various disputes throughout the country. His judges would resolve disputes on an [[ad hoc]] basis according to what they interpreted the customs to be. The king's judges would then return to London and often discuss their cases and the decisions they made with the other judges. These decisions would be recorded and filed. In time, a rule, known as ''stare decisis'' (also commonly known as precedent) developed, whereby a judge would be bound to follow the decision of an earlier judge; he was required to adopt the earlier judge's interpretation of the law and apply the same principles promulgated by that earlier judge if the two cases had similar facts to one another. Once judges began to regard each other's decisions to be binding precedent, the pre-Norman system of local customs and law varying in each locality was replaced by a system that was (at least in theory, though not always in practice) common throughout the whole country, hence the name "common law".

Henry II's creation of a powerful and unified court system, which curbed somewhat the power of [[canon law|canonical]] (church) courts, brought him (and England) into conflict with the church, most famously with [[Thomas Becket]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The murder of the Archbishop gave rise to a wave of popular outrage against the King. Henry was forced to repeal the disputed laws and to abandon his efforts to hold church members accountable for secular crimes (see also [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]).

The English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] was established after [[Magna Carta]] to try lawsuits between commoners in which the monarch had no interest. Its judges sat in open court in the Great Hall of the king's [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Palace of Westminster]], permanently except in the vacations between the four terms of the [[Legal year]].

Judge-made common law operated as the primary source of law for several hundred years, before [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] acquired legislative powers to create [[statutory law]]. It is important to understand that common law is the older and more traditional source of law, and legislative power is simply a layer applied on top of the older common law foundation. Since the 12th century, courts have had parallel and co-equal authority to make law&lt;ref name="William Burnham 2006"&gt;William Burnham, ''Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States'', 4th ed. (St. Paul, Thomson West, 2006), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;—"legislating from the bench" is a traditional and essential function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the "judicial power" specified by Article III of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute" /&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, "judges do and must legislate."&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate"&gt;''Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen'', 244 U.S. 205, 221 (1917) (Holmes, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; There are legitimate debates on how the powers of courts and legislatures should be balanced. However, the view that courts lack law-making power is historically inaccurate and constitutionally unsupportable.

In England, judges have devised a number of rules as to [[Mechanisms of the English common law|how to deal with precedent decisions]].

=== Influence of Roman law ===
The term "common law" is often used as a contrast to Roman-derived "civil law", and the fundamental processes and forms of reasoning in the two are quite different. Nonetheless, there has been considerable cross-fertilization of ideas, while the two traditions and sets of foundational principles remain distinct.

By the time of the rediscovery of the [[Roman law]] in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already developed far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., R. C. van Caenegem, ''The Birth of the English Common Law'' 89–92 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first common law scholars, most notably [[Ranulf de Glanvill|Glanvill]] and [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]], as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Peter Birks]], Grant McLeod, ''Justinian's Institutes'' 7 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first and throughout its history one of the most significant treatises of the common law, Bracton's ''De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae'' (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian's ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Institutes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., George E. Woodbine (ed.), Samuel E. Thorne (transl.), ''Bracton on the Laws and Customs of England'', Vol. I (Introduction) 46 (1968); Carl Güterbock, ''Bracton and his Relation to the Roman Law'' 35–38 (1866).&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into ''[[in rem]]'' (typically, actions against a ''thing'' or property for the purpose of gaining title to that property; must be filed in a court where the property is located) and ''[[in personam]]'' (typically, actions directed against a person; these can affect a person's rights and, since a person often owns things, his property too) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone's ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'',&lt;ref&gt;Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stein, ''Continental Influences on English Legal thought, 1600–1900'', ''in'' Peter Stein, ''The Character and Influence of the Roman Civil Law'' 223 ''et seq''. (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent [[unjust enrichment]]) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coke and Blackstone ===

The first attempt at a comprehensive compilation of centuries of common law was by Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], in his treatise, ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'' in the 17th century.

The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765–1769.

=== Propagation of the common law to the colonies and Commonwealth by reception statutes ===

{{anchor|CL_Reception_Statutes}}A [[reception statute]] is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent, by which the new nation adopts (i.e. receives) pre-independence common law, to the extent not explicitly rejected by the [[legislative body]] or [[constitution]] of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, and the precedent originating from it, as the default law, because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state. All U.S. states, with the partial exception of [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]], have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the common law by judicial opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3KFBnC0P0C Thinking like a lawyer: an introduction to legal reasoning] (Westview Press, 1996), pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of reception statutes in the United States, the states of the U.S., Canada and its provinces, and Hong Kong, are discussed in the [[reception statute]] article.

Yet, adoption of the common law in the newly-independent nation was not a foregone conclusion, and was controversial. Immediately after the American Revolution, there was widespread distrust and hostility to anything British, and the common law was no exception.&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt; Jeffersonians decried lawyers and their common law tradition as threats to the new republic. The Jeffersonians preferred a legislatively-enacted civil law under the control of the political process, rather than the common law developed by judges that—by design—were insulated from the political process. The Federalists believed that the common law was the birthright of Independence: after all, the natural rights to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" were the rights protected by common law. Even advocates for the common law approach noted that it was not an ideal fit for the newly-independent colonies: judges and lawyers alike were severely hindered by a lack of printed legal materials. Before Independence, the most comprehensive law libraries had been maintained by Tory lawyers, and those libraries vanished with the loyalist expatriation, and the ability to print books was limited. Lawyer (later president) John Adams complained that he "suffered very much for the want of books". To bootstrap this most basic need of a common law system—knowable, written law—in 1803, lawyers in Massachusetts donated their books to found a law library.&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt;  A Jeffersonian newspaper criticized the library, as it would carry forward "all the old authorities practiced in England for centuries back ... whereby a new system of jurisprudence [will be founded] on the high monarchical system [to] become the Common Law of this Commonwealth... [The library] may hereafter have a very unsocial purpose."&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt;

=== Decline of Latin maxims and "blind imitation of the past", and adding flexibility to ''stare decisis'' {{Anchor|History_and_Holmes}} ===
Well into the 19th century, ancient maxims played a large role in common law adjudication. Many of these maxims had originated in Roman Law, migrated to England before the introduction of Christianity to the British Isles, and were typically stated in Latin even in English decisions. Many examples are familiar in everyday speech even today, "[[Nemo iudex in causa sua|One cannot be a judge in one's own cause]]" (see [[Dr. Bonham's Case]]), rights are reciprocal to obligations, and the like. Judicial decisions and treatises of the 17th and 18th centuries, such at those of Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], presented the common law as a collection of such maxims.

Reliance on old maxims and rigid adherence to precedent, no matter how old or ill-considered, came under critical discussion in the late 19th century, starting in the United States. [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] in his famous article, "The Path of the Law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=10 |journal=Harvard Law Review |pages=457, 469 |year=1897|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2373|title=The Path of the Law|first=Oliver Wendell |last=Holmes, Jr.|doi=10.2307/1322028|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented, "It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past." Justice Holmes noted that study of maxims might be sufficient for "the man of the present", but "the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics". In an 1880 lecture at Harvard, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]] [https://archive.org/details/commonlaw00holmuoft O. W. Holmes, Jr., ''The Common Law'']&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow men, have had a good deal more to do than the [[:w:syllogism|syllogism]] in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the [[:w:axiom|axioms]] and corollaries of a book of mathematics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Louis Brandeis]], later appointed to the United States Supreme Court, became noted for his use of policy-driving facts and economics in [[Brandeis Brief|his briefs]], and extensive appendices presenting facts that lead a judge to the advocate's conclusion. By this time, briefs relied more on facts than on Latin maxims.

Reliance on old maxims is now deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;''Acree v. Republic of Iraq'', 370 F.3d 41 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Common law decisions today reflect both precedent and policy judgment drawn from economics, the social sciences, business, decisions of foreign courts, and the like. The degree to which these external factors ''should'' influence adjudication is the subject of active debate, but it is indisputable that judges ''do'' draw on experience and learning from everyday life, from other fields, and from other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roper v. Simmons]], 543 U.S. 551 (2005) (holding unconstitutional to impose capital punishment for crimes committed while under the age of 18, based on "evolving standards of decency", largely based on other nations' law)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity ===
&lt;!-- "Fusion of law and equity" redirects here. Please edit redirect if changing the name of this section header --&gt;
As early as the 15th century, it became the practice that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common law system would petition the King in person. For example, they might argue that an award of damages (at [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]) was not sufficient redress for a trespasser occupying their land, and instead request that the trespasser be evicted. From this developed the system of [[Equity (law)|equity]], administered by the [[Lord Chancellor]], in the courts of [[Court of equity|chancery]]. By their nature, equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue for years as one court countermanded the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salmond|1907|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it was established by the 17th century that equity should prevail.

In England, courts of law ([[Common law#Disambiguate equity|as opposed to equity]]) were combined with [[Court of equity|courts of equity]] by the [[Judicature Acts]] of 1873 and 1875, with equity prevailing in case of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Lobban, Michael "Preparing for Fusion: Reforming the Nineteenth-Century Court of Chancery, Part II | year=2004 | work=Law and History Review, 2004 (University of Illinois Press) . {{ISSN|0738-2480}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, parallel systems of [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] (providing money [[damages]], with cases heard by a jury upon either party's request) and equity (fashioning a remedy to fit the situation, including injunctive relief, heard by a judge) survived well into the 20th century. The [[United States federal courts]] procedurally separated law and equity: the same judges could hear either kind of case, but a given case could only pursue causes in law or in equity, and the two kinds of cases proceeded under different procedural rules. This became problematic when a given case required both money damages and injunctive relief. In 1937, the new [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] combined [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] and equity into one form of action, the "civil action". Fed.R.Civ.P. {{frcp|2}}. The distinction survives to the extent that issues that were "[[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]" as of 1791 (the date of adoption of the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]) are still subject to the right of either party to request a jury, and "equity" issues are decided by a judge.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.'', 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) ("[W]e [the U.S. Supreme Court] have understood that the right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right which existed under the English [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]] when the Amendment was adopted. In keeping with our longstanding adherence to this 'historical test,', we ask, first, whether we are dealing with a cause of action that either was tried at [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law (as opposed to equity)]] at the time of the founding or is at least analogous to one that was. If the action in question belongs in the law category, we then ask whether the particular trial decision must fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance of the common-law right as it existed in 1791." citations and quotations omitted, holding that interpretation of the scope of a patent had no analogy in 1790, and is thus a question to be decided by a judge, not a jury)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Delaware]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Tennessee]] still have separate courts of [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] and equity, for example, the [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]]. In many [[U.S. state|states]] there are separate divisions for law and equity within one court.

=== Common law pleading and its abolition in the early 20th century ===

For centuries, through the 19th century, the common law recognized only specific [[Form of action|forms of action]], and required very careful drafting of the opening pleading (called a [[writ]]) to slot into exactly one of them: Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Special Assumpsit, General Assumpsit, Trespass, Trover, Replevin, Case (or Trespass on the Case), and Ejectment.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Maitland, ''The Forms of Action at Common Law'', 1909, Lecture I, online [https://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/basis/maitland-formsofaction.asp] or John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common Law Pleading (1894) or [[James Barr Ames|Ames]], [[Joseph Chitty|Chitty]], [[Henry John Stephen|Stephen]], [[James Bradley Thayer|Thayer]] and other writers named in the preface of Perry's ''Common-law Pleading: its history and principles'' (Boston, 1897)[http://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/commonlawpleadin00perr.pdf] or [https://kateofgaia.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/handbook-of-common-law-pleadings1.pdf ''Handbook of Common Law Pleading, Koffler and Reppy, 1969, online'']&lt;/ref&gt; To initiate a lawsuit, a pleading had to be drafted to meet myriad technical requirements: correctly categorizing the case into the correct legal pigeonhole (pleading in the alternative was not permitted), and using specific "magic words" encrusted over the centuries. Under the old common law pleading standards, a suit by a ''pro se'' ("for oneself," without a lawyer) party was all but impossible, and there was often considerable procedural jousting at the outset of a case over minor wording issues.

One of the major reforms of the late 19th century and early 20th century was the abolition of common law pleading requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the remainder of the "common law" discussed in the rest of the article remained intact; all that was abolished were the highly technical requirements for language of the paper provided by the plaintiff to the defendant to initiate a case.&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff can initiate a case by giving the defendant "a short and plain statement" of facts that constitute an alleged wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 4, a complaint must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."&lt;/ref&gt; This reform moved the attention of courts from technical scrutiny of words to a more rational consideration of the facts, and opened access to justice far more broadly.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 1, civil procedure rules "should be construed, administered, and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives to common law systems ==

=== Civil law systems--comparisons and contrasts to common law{{anchor|Contrasts between common law and civil law systems}} ===
[[File:Corpus Iuris Civilis 02.jpg|thumb|A 16th century edition of ''Corpus Juris Civilis Romani'' (1583)]]

The main alternative to the common law system is the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, which is used in [[Continental Europe]], and most of the rest of the world.

==== Judicial decisions play only a minor role in shaping civil law ====
The primary contrast between the two systems is the role of written decisions and precedent.

In common law jurisdictions, nearly every case that presents a ''bona fide'' disagreement on the law is resolved in a written opinion. The legal reasoning for the decision, known as ''[[ratio decidendi]]'', not only determines the court's judgment between the parties, but also stands as precedent for resolving future disputes. In contrast, civil law decisions typically do not include explanatory opinions, and thus no precedent flows from one decision to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, H. Law, Liberty and the Constitution: A Brief History of the common Law (2018)&lt;/ref&gt;
In common law systems, a single decided case is binding [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]] to the same extent as statute or regulation, under the principle of ''stare decisis''. In contrast, in civil law systems, individual decisions have only advisory, not binding effect. In civil law systems, case law only acquires weight when a long series of cases use consistent reasoning, called ''[[jurisprudence constante]]''. Civil law lawyers consult case law to obtain their best prediction of how a court will rule, but comparatively, civil law judges are less bound to follow it.

For that reason, statutes in civil law systems are more comprehensive, detailed, and continuously updated, covering all matters capable of being brought before a court.&lt;ref&gt;''The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions'', Robbins Collection, University of California at Berkeley.[https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adversarial system vs. inquisitorial system ====
[[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|Common law systems]] tend to give more weight to separation of powers between the judicial branch and the executive branch. In contrast, civil law systems are typically more tolerant of allowing individual officials to exercise both powers.  One example of this contrast is the difference between the two systems in allocation of responsibility between prosecutor and adjudicator.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/constitutional-law/inquisitorial-and-adversarial-system-of-law-constitutional-law-essay.php|title=Inquisitorial And Adversarial System Of Law|website=lawteacher.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compass.port.ac.uk/UoP/file/c7ffec37-0632-475f-84ba-ae018a2f0f38/1/Types_of_law_IMSLRN.zip/page_10.htm|title=Types of Legal System: Adversarial v. Investigatory Trial Systems|first=|last=LangstoT|website=compass.port.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law courts usually use an [[adversarial system]], in which two sides present their cases to a neutral judge.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory" /&gt; In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, criminal proceedings proceed under an [[inquisitorial system]] in which an examining magistrate serves two roles by developing the evidence and arguments for one side and then the other during the investigation phase.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory" /&gt;

The examining magistrate then presents the dossier detailing his or her findings to the president of the bench that will adjudicate on the case where it has been decided that a trial shall be conducted. Therefore, the president of the bench's view of the case is not neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier. Unlike the common law proceedings, the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial, as long as he or she does not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused.

The proceeding in the inquisitorial system is essentially by writing. Most of the witnesses would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such evidence will be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports. In the same way, the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but he or she will be free to change her or his evidence at trial. Whether the accused pleads guilty or not, a trial will be conducted. Unlike the adversarial system, the conviction and sentence to be served (if any) will be released by the trial jury together with the president of the trial bench, following their common deliberation.

There are many exceptions in both directions. For example, most proceedings before U.S. federal and state agencies are inquisitorial in nature, at least the initial stages (''e.g.'', a patent examiner, a social security hearing officer, and so on), even though the law to be applied is developed through common law processes.

==== Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems{{anchor|CL academic writings}} ====
The role of the legal academy presents a significant "cultural" difference between common law ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|connotation 2]]) and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions.  In both systems, treatises compile decisions and state overarching principles that (in the author's opinion) explain the results of the cases.  In neither system are treatises considered "law," but the weight given them is nonetheless quite different.

In common law jurisdictions, lawyers and judges tend to use these treatises as only "finding aids" to locate the relevant cases. In common law jurisdictions, scholarly work is seldom cited as authority for what the law is.&lt;ref&gt;At least in the U.S., practicing lawyers tend to use "law professor" or "law review article" as a pejorative to describe a person or work that is insufficiently grounded in reality or practicality—every young lawyer is admonished repeatedly by senior lawyers not to write "law review articles," but instead to focus on the facts of the case and the practical effects of a given outcome.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Justice Roberts noted the "great disconnect between the academy and the profession."&lt;ref&gt;A Conversation with Chief Justice Roberts, June 11, 2011 [https://www.c-span.org/video/?300203-1/conversation-chief-justice-roberts] at 30:30.&lt;/ref&gt; When common law courts rely on scholarly work, it is almost always only for factual findings, policy justification, or the [[Legal history|history and evolution of the law]], but the court's legal conclusion is reached through analysis of relevant statutes and common law, seldom scholarly commentary.

In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, courts give the writings of [[law school|law professors]] significant weight, partly because civil law decisions traditionally were very brief, sometimes no more than a paragraph stating who wins and who loses. The rationale had to come from somewhere else: the academy often filled that role.

==== Narrowing of differences between common law and civil law ====
The contrast between civil law and common law legal systems has become increasingly blurred, with the growing importance of [[jurisprudence]] (similar to [[case law]] but not binding) in civil law countries, and the growing importance of statute law and codes in common law countries.

Examples of common law being replaced by statute or codified rule in the United States include [[Common law offence#United States|criminal law]] (since 1812,&lt;ref name="USvHudson" /&gt; U.S. federal courts and most but not all of the States have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), [[commercial law]] (the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in the early 1960s) and procedure (the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in the 1930s and the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] in the 1970s). But note that in each case, the statute sets the general principles, but the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]] process determines the scope and application of the statute.

An example of convergence from the other direction is shown in the 1982 decision ''Srl CILFIT and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA v Ministry of Health'' ({{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1982:335}}), in which the [[European Court of Justice]] held that questions it has already answered need not be resubmitted. This showed how a historically distinctly common law principle is used by a court composed of judges (at that time) of essentially civil law jurisdiction.

The former [[Soviet Bloc]] and other Socialist countries used a [[Socialist law]] system.

Much of the [[Muslim world]] uses [[Sharia]] (also called [[Sharia|Islamic law]]).

== Common law legal systems in the present day ==
=== In jurisdictions around the world ===
The common law constitutes the basis of the legal systems of:
* [[Law of Australia|Australia]] (both federal and individual states),
* [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]],
* [[Belize]],
* Brunei,
* Canada (both [[Common law#CL Canada federal|federal]] and the [[Common law#CL Canada provinces|individual provinces]] (except Quebec)),
* the Caribbean jurisdictions of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahamas, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago,

* United States (both the [[Common law#CL United States federal|federal]] system and the individual [[Common law#CL United States|states]] (with the partial exception of [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]])),

and many other generally [[English-speaking countries]] or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (except the UK's [[Common law#CL Scotland|Scotland]], which is [[bijuridicial law|bijuridicial]], and [[Malta]]). Essentially, every country that was colonised at some time by England, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom uses common law except those that were formerly colonised by other nations, such as [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]] (which follows the [[bijuridicial law|law]] of France in part), South Africa and Sri Lanka (which follow [[Common law#CL Roman Dutch|Roman Dutch law]]), where the prior civil law system was retained to respect the [[civil rights]] of the local colonists. Guyana and Saint Lucia have mixed Common Law and Civil Law systems.

The remainder of this section discusses jurisdiction-specific variants, arranged chronologically.

=== Scotland{{anchor|CL Scotland}} ===
[[Scotland]] is often said to use the civil law system, but it has [[Scots law|a unique system]] that combines elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] with an element of its own common law long predating the [[Act of Union (1707)|Treaty of Union]] with England in 1707 (see [[Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages]]), founded on the customary laws of the tribes residing there. Historically, [[Scots Law|Scottish common law]] differed in that the use of ''precedent'' was subject to the courts' seeking to discover the principle that justifies a law rather than searching for an example as a ''precedent'',&lt;ref&gt;Stair Memorial Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; and principles of [[natural justice]] and fairness have always played a role in Scots Law. From the 19th century, the Scottish approach to precedent developed into a ''stare decisis'' akin to that already established in England thereby reflecting a narrower, more modern approach to the application of case law in subsequent instances. This is not to say that the substantive rules of the common laws of both countries are the same although in many matters (particularly those of UK-wide interest) they are similar.

Scotland shares the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], with England, Wales and Northern Ireland for civil cases; the court's decisions are binding on the jurisdiction from which a case arises but only influential on similar cases arising in Scotland. This has had the effect of converging the law in certain areas. For instance, the modern UK [[negligence|law of negligence]] is based on ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'', a case originating in Paisley, Scotland.

Scotland maintains a separate criminal law system from the rest of the UK, with the [[High Court of Justiciary]] being the final court for criminal appeals. The highest court of appeal in civil cases brought in Scotland is now the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (before October 2009, final appellate jurisdiction lay with the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/about/role-of-the-supreme-court.html|title=Role of The Supreme Court – The Supreme Court|first=The Supreme|last=Court|website=www.supremecourt.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
==== States of the United States (17th century on){{anchor|CL United States}} ====
The centuries-old authority of the common law courts in England to develop law case by case and to apply statute law&lt;ref name="William Burnham 2006" /&gt;—"legislating from the bench"— is a traditional function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the "judicial power" specified by Article III of the U.S. constitution.&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute" /&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, "judges do and must legislate” (in the federal courts, only interstitially, in state courts, to the full limits of common law adjudicatory authority).&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate" /&gt;

===== New York (17th century) =====
The state of [[New York (state)|New York]], which also has a civil law history from its [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonial]] days, began a [[Codification (law)|codification]] of its law in the 19th century. The only part of this codification process that was considered complete is known as the [[Field Code]] applying to [[civil procedure]]. The original colony of [[New Netherland]] was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch. When the English captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law. However, the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|recaptured]] by the Dutch. When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced, as a punishment unique in the history of the British Empire, the English imposed common law upon all the colonists, including the Dutch. This was problematic, as the [[patroon]] system of land holding, based on the [[Feudalism|feudal system]] and civil law, continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-19th century. The influence of [[Roman-Dutch law]] continued in the colony well into the late 19th century. The codification of a law of general obligations shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in New York continued on from the Dutch days.

===== Louisiana (1700s){{anchor|Louisiana (1700s)}} =====

Under [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana's codified system]], the [[Louisiana Civil Code]], private law—that is, [[substantive law]] between private sector parties—is based on principles of law from continental Europe, with some common law influences. These principles derive ultimately from [[Roman law]], transmitted through [[Law of France|French law]] and [[Law of Spain|Spanish law]], as the state's current territory intersects the area of North America colonized by Spain and by France. Contrary to popular belief, the Louisiana code does not directly derive from the [[Napoleonic Code]], as the latter was enacted in 1804, one year after the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. However, the two codes are similar in many respects due to common roots.

Louisiana's [[criminal law]] largely rests on English common law. Louisiana's [[administrative law]] is generally similar to the [[administrative Procedure Act (United States)|administrative law of the U.S. federal government]] and other U.S. states. Louisiana's [[procedural law]] is generally in line with that of other U.S. states, which in turn is generally based on the U.S. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

Historically notable among the Louisiana code's differences from common law is the role of property rights among women, particularly in inheritance gained by widows.

===== California (1850s) =====
The [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] has a system based on common law, but it has [[Codification (law)|codified]] the law in the manner of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. The reason for the enactment of the [[California Codes]] in the 19th century was to replace a pre-existing system based on Spanish civil law with a system based on common law, similar to that in most other states. California and a number of other [[Western United States|Western states]], however, have retained the concept of [[community property]] derived from civil law. The California courts have treated portions of the codes as an extension of the common-law tradition, subject to judicial development in the same manner as judge-made common law. (Most notably, in the case ''[[Li v. Yellow Cab Co.]]'', 13 Cal.3d 804 (1975), the [[California Supreme Court]] adopted the principle of [[comparative negligence]] in the face of a [[California Civil Code]] provision codifying the traditional common-law doctrine of [[contributory negligence]].)

==== United States federal courts (1789 and 1938){{anchor|CL United States federal}} ====
[[File:Uscatitle11.jpg|thumb|USCA: some annotated volumes of the [[United States Code|official compilation]] and codification of federal statutes.]]

The United States federal government (as opposed to the states) has a variant on a common law system. [[United States federal courts]] only act as interpreters of statutes and the constitution by elaborating and precisely defining broad statutory language ([[Common law#Disambiguate statute|connotation 1(b)]] above), but, unlike state courts, do not act as an independent source of common law.

Before 1938, the federal courts, like almost all other common law courts, decided the law on any issue where the relevant legislature (either the U.S. Congress or state legislature, depending on the issue), had not acted, by looking to courts in the same system, that is, other federal courts, even on issues of state law, and even where there was no express grant of authority from Congress or the Constitution.

In 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64, 78] (1938), overruled earlier precedent,&lt;ref&gt;''Swift v. Tyson'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=41&amp;page=1 41 U.S. 1] (1842). In ''Swift'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] had held that federal courts hearing cases brought under their [[diversity jurisdiction]] (allowing them to hear cases between parties from different states) had to apply the statutory law of the states, but not the common law developed by state courts. Instead, the Supreme Court permitted the federal courts to make their own common law based on general principles of law. ''Erie v. Tompkins'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64] (1938). ''Erie'' overruled ''Swift v. Tyson'', and instead held that federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction had to use all of the same [[substantive law]] as the courts of the states in which they were located. As the ''Erie'' Court put it, there is no "general federal common law", the key word here being '''''general'''''. This history is elaborated in
[[federal common law]].&lt;/ref&gt; and held "There is no federal general common law," thus confining the federal courts to act only as interpreters of law originating elsewhere. ''E.g.'', ''Texas Industries v. Radcliff'', {{ussc|451|630|1981}} (without an express grant of statutory authority, federal courts cannot create rules of intuitive justice, for example, a right to contribution from co-conspirators). Post-1938, federal courts deciding issues that arise under state law are required to defer to state court interpretations of state statutes, or reason what a state's highest court would rule if presented with the issue, or to certify the question to the state's highest court for resolution.

Later courts have limited ''Erie'' slightly, to create a few situations where [[United States federal courts]] are permitted to create [[federal common law]] rules without express statutory authority, for example, where a federal rule of decision is necessary to protect uniquely federal interests, such as foreign affairs, or financial instruments issued by the federal government. ''See, e.g.'', ''[[Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|318|363|1943}} (giving federal courts the authority to fashion common law rules with respect to issues of federal power, in this case [[negotiable instrument]]s backed by the federal government); ''see also'' ''[[International News Service v. Associated Press]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=248&amp;page=215 248 U.S. 215] (1918) (creating a cause of action for misappropriation of "hot news" that lacks any statutory grounding); ''but see National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc.'', 105 F.3d 841, 843–44, 853 (2d Cir. 1997) (noting continued vitality of ''INS'' "hot news" tort under New York state law, but leaving open the question of whether it survives under federal law). Except on Constitutional issues, Congress is free to legislatively overrule federal courts' common law.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Boerne v. Flores'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=521&amp;invol=507 521 U.S. 507] (1997) (invalidating the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]], in which Congress had attempted to redefine the court's jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=451&amp;invol=304 451 U.S. 304] (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States executive branch agencies (1946) ====
Most executive branch agencies in the United States federal government have some adjudicatory authority. To greater or lesser extent, agencies honor their own precedent to ensure consistent results. Agency decision making is governed by the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] of 1946.

For example, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] issues relatively few [[regulations]], but instead promulgates most of its substantive rules through [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]].

=== India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh (19th century and 1948){{anchor|CL India and Pakistan}} ===
The law of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are largely based on [[English law|English]] common law because of the long period of [[British Empire|British colonial influence]] during the period of the [[British India|British Raj]].

[[History of India|Ancient India]] represented a distinct tradition of law, and had an historically independent school of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', dating from 400 BCE and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'', from 100 CE, were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]'s central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in this period, which finally culminated in the creation of the [[Gupta Empire]], relations with ancient Greece and Rome were not infrequent. The appearance of similar fundamental institutions of international law in various parts of the world show that they are inherent in international society, irrespective of culture and tradition.{{sfn|Alexander|1952|pp=289–300}} Inter-State relations in the pre-Islamic period resulted in clear-cut rules of warfare of a high humanitarian standard, in rules of neutrality, of treaty law, of customary law embodied in religious charters, in exchange of embassies of a temporary or semi-permanent character.&lt;ref&gt;Viswanatha, S.T., ''International Law in Ancient India'', 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

When India became part of the [[British Empire]], there was a break in tradition, and Hindu and Islamic law were supplanted by the common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the failed [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion]] against the British in 1857, the [[British Parliament]] took over control of India from the [[British East India Company]], and [[British India]] came under the direct rule of [[the Crown]]. The British Parliament passed the [[Government of India Act 1858|Government of India Act of 1858]] to this effect, which set up the structure of British government in India.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |work = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1923 |accessdate = 2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It established in Britain the office of the [[Secretary of State for India]] through whom the Parliament would exercise its rule, along with a [[Council of India]] to aid him. It also established the office of the [[Governor-General of India]] along with an Executive Council in India, which consisted of high officials of the British Government. As a result, the present judicial system of the country derives largely from the British system and has little correlation to the institutions of the pre-British era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jain|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify-inline|date=August 2015}}

==== Post-partition India (1948){{anchor|CL India}} ====

[[File:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution for a country, containing 395 articles, 12 schedules, numerous amendments and 117,369 words.]]

Post-partition, [[Law of India|India]] retained its common law system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|author=[[K. G. Balakrishnan]]|title=An Overview of the Indian Justice Delivery Mechanism|url=http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/speeches/speeches_2008/abu_dhabi__as_delivered.pdf|event=International Conference of the Presidents of the Supreme Courts of the World|location=Abu Dhabi|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=23–24 March 2008|quote=India, being a common law country, derives most of its modern judicial framework from the British legal system.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102153013/http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/speeches/speeches_2008/abu_dhabi__as_delivered.pdf|archivedate=2 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of contemporary Indian law shows substantial European and American influence. Legislation first introduced by the British is still in effect in modified form today. During the drafting of the [[Indian Constitution]], laws from Ireland, the United States, Britain, and France were all synthesized to produce a refined set of Indian laws. Indian laws also adhere to the [[United Nations]] guidelines on [[human rights law]] and [[environmental law]]. Certain [[international trade law]]s, such as those on [[intellectual property]], are also enforced in India.

The exception to this rule is in the state of [[Goa]], annexed in stages in the 1960s through 1980s. In Goa, a Portuguese [[uniform civil code]] is in place, in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages, divorces and adoption.

==== Post-partition Pakistan (1948){{anchor|CL Pakistan}} ====

Post-partition, [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]] retained its common law system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/user_files/File/REVIEW_P_46&amp;47_2011_full.pdf |title=Federation of Pakistan v.

==== Post-partition Bangladesh (1968){{anchor|CL Bangladesh}} ====

Post-partition, Bangladesh retained its common law system.

=== Canada (1867){{anchor|CL Canada}} ===

[[Canadian law|Canada]] has separate federal and provincial legal systems. The division of [[jurisdiction]] between the federal and provincial Parliaments is specified in the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-5.html#anchorbo-ga:s_91-gb:s_91 Constitution Act, 1867], s. 91(10), (18)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canadian provincial law{{anchor|CL Canada provinces}} ====

Each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]] is considered a separate jurisdiction with respect to common law matters. As such, only the provincial legislature may enact legislation to amend private law. Each has its own procedural law, statutorily created provincial courts and superior trial courts with inherent jurisdiction culminating in the Court of Appeal of the province. This is the highest court in provincial jurisdiction, only subject to the Supreme Court of Canada in terms of appeal of their decisions. All but one of the provinces of [[Law of Canada|Canada]] use a common law system (the exception being [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]], which uses a French-heritage civil law system for issues arising within provincial jurisdiction, such as property ownership and contracts).

==== Canadian federal law{{anchor|CL Canada federal}} ====

Canadian Federal Courts operate under a separate system throughout Canada and deal with narrower subject matter than superior courts in provincial jurisdiction. They hear cases reserved for federal jurisdiction by the Canadian constitution, such as immigration, intellectual property, judicial review of federal government decisions, and admiralty. The [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] is the appellate level court in federal jurisdiction and hears cases in multiple cities, and unlike the United States, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal is not divided into appellate circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fca-caf.gc.ca/index_e.shtml |title=Federal Court of Appeal – Home |publisher=Fca-caf.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law is uniform throughout Canada. It is based on the constitution and federal statutory Criminal Code, as interpreted by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The administration of justice and enforcement of the criminal code are the responsibilities of the provinces.

Canadian federal statutes must use the terminology of both the common law and civil law for those matters; this is referred to as legislative bijuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/harmonization/bijurilex/aboutb-aproposb.html|title=Department of Justice – About Bijuralism|first=Government of Canada, Department of Justice, Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=canada.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nicaragua ===
[[Nicaragua]]'s legal system is also a mixture of the English Common Law and Civil Law.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} This situation was brought through the influence of British administration of the Eastern half of the [[Mosquito Coast]] from the mid-17th century until about 1894, the [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] period from about 1855 through 1857, USA interventions/occupations during the period from 1909 to 1933, the influence of USA institutions during the [[Somoza family]] administrations (1933 through 1979) and the considerable importation between 1979 and the present of USA culture and institutions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Israel (1948){{anchor|CL Israel}} ===
[[Israeli law|Israel]] has a common law legal system. Its basic principles are inherited from the law of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] and thus resemble those of British and American law, namely: the role of courts in creating the body of law and the authority of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|supreme court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lawofisrael.com/israeli-supreme-court-decisions | title=Supreme court decisions database}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reviewing and if necessary overturning legislative and executive decisions, as well as employing the adversarial system. One of the primary reasons that the [[Constitution of Israel|Israeli constitution]] remains [[unwritten constitution|unwritten]] is the fear by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution, combined with the common-law elements, would severely limit the powers of the [[Knesset]] (which, following the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], holds near-unlimited power).{{sfn|Mahler|2004|p=126}}

=== Roman Dutch Common law{{anchor|CL Roman Dutch}} ===
[[Roman Dutch law|Roman Dutch Common law]] is a bijuridical or mixed system of law similar to the common law system in [[Scotland]] and [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]]. Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions include [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[Namibia]], [[Swaziland]], [[Sri-Lanka]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. Many of these jurisdictions recognise customary law, and in some, such as South Africa the Constitution requires that the common law be developed in accordance with the Bill of Rights. Roman Dutch common law is a development of [[Roman Dutch law]] by courts in the Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions. During the Napoleonic wars the Kingdom of the Netherlands adopted the French ''code civil'' in 1809, however the Dutch colonies in the Cape of Good Hope and Sri Lanka, at the time called Ceylon, were seized by the British to prevent them being used as bases by the French Navy. The system was developed by the courts and spread with the expansion of British colonies in Southern Africa. Roman Dutch common law relies on legal principles set out in Roman law sources such as Justinian's Institutes and Digest, and also on the writing of Dutch jurists of the 17th century such as [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]] and [[Johannes Voet|Voet]]. In practice, the majority of decisions rely on recent precedent.

=== Ghana ===
Ghana follows the English common-law&lt;ref&gt;The common law as used in this paper designates the English common-law as a legal tradition which is made up of law (generally referred to as the common law), and the doctrine of equity.&lt;/ref&gt; tradition which was inherited from the British during her colonisation. Consequently, the laws of Ghana are, for the most part, a modified version of imported law that is continuously adapting to changing socio-economic and political realities of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Obiri-Korang P "Private international law of contract in Ghana: the need for a paradigm shift" (2017) P 8; Quansah ''The Ghana Legal System'' (2011) P 51&lt;/ref&gt; The Bond of 184&lt;ref&gt;The Bond was a pact between the British and some chiefs from the southern states of the Gold Coast under which British protection was extended to the signatories in exchange for judicial authority over them.&lt;/ref&gt; 4 was the first most important event in the history of Ghana (then Gold Coast) that marked the critical period when the people ceded their independence to the British&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, Benion ''The Constitutional Law of Ghana'' (1962). Boahen, however, submits that the Bond of 1844 is not as important as held by some Ghanaian historians. He further posits that it cannot be the Mgna Carta of Ghana or the basis for British rule or law – see Boahen ''Ghana: Evolution and Change in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century'' (1975) 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave the British judicial authority. Later, the Supreme Court Ordinance of 1876 “formally” introduced British law, be it the common law or statutory law, in the Gold Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Asante “Over a hundred years of a national legal system in Ghana: a review and critique” 1988 ''Journal of African Law'' 31 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14&lt;ref&gt;This states that “the common law, the doctrines of equity, and Statutes of general application which were in force in England at the date when the colony obtained a local legislature, that is to say, on the 24th of July 1874, shall be in force within the jurisdiction of the court”.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ordinance formalised the application of the common-law tradition in the country.

Ghana, after independence, did not do away with the common law system inherited from the British, and today it has been enshrined in the 1992 Constitution of the country. Chapter four of Ghana's Constitution, entitled “The Laws of Ghana”, has in Article 11(1) the list of laws applicable in the state. This comprises (a) the Constitution; (b) enactments made by or under the authority of the Parliament established by the Constitution; (c) any Orders, Rules and Regulations made by any person or authority under a power conferred by the Constitution; (d) the existing law; and (e) the common law.&lt;ref&gt;According to Article 11(2) of Ghana’s Constitution, the common law of Ghana shall comprise the rule of law generally known as the common law, the rules generally known as the doctrine of equity and the rules of customary law, including those determined by the Superior Court of Judicature.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the modern-day Constitution of Ghana, like those before it, embraced the English common law by entrenching it in its provisions. The doctrine of judicial precedence which is based on the principle of ''stare decisis'' as applied in England and other pure common law countries also applies in Ghana.

== Scholarly works ==
[[File:WilliamBlackstone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir William Blackstone]] as illustrated in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''.]]
[[Edward Coke]], a 17th-century Lord Chief Justice of the English Court of Common Pleas and a [[Member of Parliament]], wrote several legal texts that collected and integrated centuries of case law. Lawyers in both England and America learned the law from his ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England|Institutes]]'' and ''Reports'' until the end of the 18th century. His works are still cited by common law courts around the world.

The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765–1769. Since 1979, a facsimile edition of that first edition has been available in four paper-bound volumes. Today it has been superseded in the English part of the United Kingdom by [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] that covers both common and statutory English law.

While he was still on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], and before being named to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] published a short volume called ''[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]]'', which remains a classic in the field. Unlike Blackstone and the Restatements, Holmes' book only briefly discusses what the law ''is''; rather, Holmes describes the common law ''process''. Law professor [[John Chipman Gray]]'s ''The Nature and Sources of the Law'', an examination and survey of the common law, is also still commonly read in [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]].

In the United States, [[Restatement of the Law|Restatements]] of various subject matter areas (Contracts, Torts, Judgments, and so on.), edited by the [[American Law Institute]], collect the common law for the area. The ALI Restatements are often cited by American courts and lawyers for propositions of uncodified common law, and are considered highly persuasive authority, just below binding precedential decisions. The [[Corpus Juris Secundum]] is an encyclopedia whose main content is a compendium of the common law and its variations throughout the various state jurisdictions.

Scots ''common law'' covers matters including murder and theft, and has sources in custom, in legal writings and previous court decisions. The legal writings used are called ''Institutional Texts'' and come mostly from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Examples include Craig, ''Jus Feudale'' (1655) and Stair, ''The Institutions of the Law of Scotland'' (1681).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4368">[[File:Computability in Europe logo.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Association CiE logo]]'''Computability in Europe''' ('''CiE''') is an [[international organization]] of mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists, philosophers, theoretical physicists and others interested in new developments in computability and in their underlying significance for the real world.  CiE aims to widen understanding and appreciation of the importance of the concepts and techniques of computability theory, and to support the development of a vibrant multi-disciplinary community of researchers focused on computability-related topics. CiE positions itself at the interface between applied and fundamental research, prioritising mathematical approaches to computational barriers.

CiE originated as a research network in 2003, became a conference series in 2005, and the ''Association  Computability in Europe'' was formed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Benedikt Löwe, ''Barry Cooper (1943–2015): The engine of Computability in Europe'', Computability 5(1):3-11 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Association ==

The ''Association Computability in Europe'' was founded in [[Athens]], [[Greece]] in 2008.
Its founding president (2008 to 2015) was 
Professor [[S. Barry Cooper]]; its current president is [[Paola Bonizzoni]] and its current secretary general is [[Giuseppe Primiero]]. The Association is promoting the development, particularly in Europe, of computability-related science, ranging over mathematics, computer science, and applications in various natural and engineering sciences such as physics and biology. This also includes the promotion of the study of philosophy and history of computing as it relates to questions of computability.

Past presidents of the Association were [[S. Barry Cooper]] (2008-2015) and Dag Normann (2015-2016). The current members of the Council of the Association are

'''Computational semiotics''' is an interdisciplinary field that applies, conducts, and draws on research in [[logic]], [[mathematics]], the [[theory of computation|theory]] and [[computer programming|practice]] of [[computer science|computation]], [[formal language|formal]] and [[natural language|natural]] [[linguistics|language studies]], the [[cognitive science]]s generally, and [[semiotics]] proper.  A common theme of this work is the adoption of a [[sign (semiotics)|sign-theoretic]] perspective on issues of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[knowledge representation]].  Many of its applications lie in the field of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) and fundamental devices of recognition.

One part of this field, known as [[algebraic semiotics]], combines aspects of [[algebra]]ic specification and social semiotics, and has been applied to [[user interface]] design and to the representation of [[mathematical proof]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1381">In [[psychiatry]], the term '''dippoldism''' ([[German language|German]]: '''dippoldismus''') is used to  refer to the [[spanking]] (or other corporal punishment) of [[Minor (law)|minors]] for sexual motives.

Dippoldism is the [[paraphilia]] of sexual arousal from [[spanking]] or otherwise applying [[corporal punishment]] to [[children]]. It is named after '''Andreas Dippold''', a German schoolteacher who, in 1903, beat his pupil Heinz Koch to death.

[[File:Stirling-Motor Kuhdung Hochhut 16082007.JPG|thumbnail|[[Stirling engine|Stirling-Motor]] powered with cow dung in the Technical Collection Hochhut in Frankfurt on Main]]
'''Dry dung fuel''' (or '''dry manure fuel''') is animal [[feces]] that has been dried in order to be used as a fuel source. It is used as a fuel in many countries around the world. Using dry [[manure]] as a fuel source is an example of [[reuse of excreta]]. A disadvantage of using this kind of fuel is increased air pollution.&lt;ref name="MudwayDuggan2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mudway|first1=Ian S|last2=Duggan|first2=Sean T|last3=Venkataraman|first3=Chandra|last4=Habib|first4=Gazala|last5=Kelly|first5=Frank J|last6=Grigg|first6=Jonathan|title=Combustion of dried animal dung as biofuel results in the generation of highly redox active fine particulates| journal=Particle and Fibre Toxicology|volume=2|issue=1|year=2005|pages=6|issn=1743-8977|doi=10.1186/1743-8977-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, this kind of fuel source is known as "dung cakes".

== Types ==

===Dry dung and moist dung===
Dry dung is more commonly used than moist dung, because it [[Combustion|burns]] more easily. Dry manure is typically defined as having a moisture content less than 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fs.fed.us/woodybiomass/documents/Yakima_County_Biomass_Report.pdf|title = Biomass Report, Yakima County Public Works Solid Waste Division|format = PDF|date = |accessdate = 2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dung cakes ===
[[File:A Pile of Dung Cakes.JPG|thumb|A pile of dung cakes in the village [[Nihal Singh Wala]] of District [[Moga District|Moga]] in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]]]
"Dung cakes", made from the by-products of [[animal husbandry]], are traditionally used as fuel in [[India]] for making food in a domestic [[hearth]] called a [[Chulha]]. They are made by hand by village women and are traditionally made from cow or buffalo dung. One dung cake of an average size gives 2100 kJ worth of energy. Dung cakes are also known as ''goitha'', ''uple'', ''kande'', ''gosse'' or ''thepdi''.

These are the cakes of cow dung molded by bare hands with a curvature to be able to keep stuck to the walls. Once dried they are put in a pile and covered with thatch called ''bitauda''. These bitaudas are visible in parts of rural India albeit with different names. The size and shape of the cake might vary with region. Its also not uncommon to see these cakes directly used in earthen ovens.

This bio-fuel has been used primarily for two reasons: for easy disposal of cow dung and as easily available and cheap fuel. 

=== Human feces ===
[[Human feces]] can in principle also be dried and used as a fuel source if they are collected in a type of [[dry toilet]], for example an [[incinerating toilet]]. Since 2011, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] is supporting the development of such toilets as part of their "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge" to promote safer, more effective ways to treat human [[excreta]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth von Muench, Dorothee Spuhler, Trevor Surridge, Nelson Ekane, Kim Andersson, Emine Goekce Fidan, Arno Rosemarin (2013) [http://www.susana.org/_resources/documents/default/2-2042-ssp-17okt20134-10-about-the-gates-sanitation-grants-on-forum.pdf Sustainable Sanitation Alliance members take a closer look at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation’s sanitation grants], Sustainable Sanitation Practice Journal, Issue 17, p. 4-10&lt;/ref&gt; The [[omniprocessor|omni-processor]] is another example of using human feces contained in [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] or [[sewage sludge]] as a fuel source.

'''Evolutionary anthropology''' is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominids]] and non-hominid [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]]. Various fields and disciplines of evolutionary anthropology are:

* [[Human evolution]] and [[anthropogeny]].
* [[Paleoanthropology]] and [[paleontology]] of both human and non-human primates.
* [[Primatology]] and primate [[ethology]].
* The [[sociocultural evolution]] of [[human behavior]].
* The [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[evolutionary linguistics]] of humans.
* The [[archaeological]] study of human technology and change over time and space.
* [[Human evolutionary genetics]] and changes in the [[human genome]] over time.
* The [[neuroscience]], [[endocrinology]], and [[neuroanthropology]] of human and primate cognition, culture and actions and abilities.
* [[Human behavioural ecology]] and the interaction of humans and the environment.
* Studies of human [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], and differences and changes between species, variation between human groups, and relationships to cultural factors.

Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as archaeology, [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], primatology, and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

Studies of biological evolution generally concern the evolution of the human form. Cultural evolution involves the study of cultural change over time and space and frequently incorporate [[cultural transmission]] models. Note that cultural evolution is not the same as biological evolution, and that human culture involves the transmission of cultural information, which behaves in ways quite distinct from [[human biology]] and [[genetics]]. The study of cultural change is increasingly performed through [[cladistics]] and genetic models.

'''Experiential education''' is a philosophy of education that describes the process that occurs between a teacher and student that infuses direct experience with the [[learning environment]] and content.&lt;ref&gt;Itin, C. M. (1999). Reasserting the Philosophy of Experiential Education as a Vehicle for Change in the 21st Century. The Journal of Experiential Education,.22(2), 91-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is not interchangeable with [[experiential learning]]; however experiential learning is a sub-field and operates under the methodologies of experiential education.&lt;ref&gt;Breuning, M., &amp; O'Connell, T. (2008, Spring/Summer). An overview of Outdoor Experiential Education. Taproot, 10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Experiential Education]] regards experiential education as "a philosophy that informs many methodologies in which educators purposefully engage with learners in direct experience and focused reflection in order to increase knowledge, develop skills, clarify values, and develop people's capacity to contribute to their communities".&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.aee.org/about/whatIsEE/ "What is Experiential Education?"], Association for Experiential Education,  Retrieved 8/7/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Experiential education is the term for the philosophy and [[educational progressivism]] is the movement which it informed.

==About==
[[John Dewey]] was the most famous proponent of experiential education, writing ''[[Experience and Education (book)|Experience and Education]]'' (1938).  It expressed his ideas about curriculum theory in the context of historical debates about school organization and the need to have experience as central in the educational process; hence, experiential education is referred to as a philosophy. Dewey's fame during that period rested on relentlessly critiquing public education and pointing out that the [[authoritarian]], strict, pre-ordained knowledge approach of modern traditional education was too concerned with delivering knowledge, and not enough with understanding students' experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wilderdom.com/experiential/ExperientialDewey.html Neil, J. (2005) "John Dewey, the Modern Father of Experiential Education"], Wilderdom.com. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey's work influenced dozens of other prominent experiential models and advocates in the later 20th century, including [[Foxfire Fund|Foxfire]],&lt;ref&gt;Starnes, B.A. (1999) [http://www.ericdigests.org/1999-3/foxfire.htm "The Foxfire Approach to Teaching and Learning: John Dewey, Experiential Learning, and the Core Practices."] ERIC Digests - ED426826. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[service learning]],&lt;ref&gt;Giles, D.E., Jr., &amp; Eyler, J. (1994). [http://www.umich.edu/%7Emjcsl/volumes/vol1abstracts.html#vol1-9 "Theoretical roots of service learning in John Dewey: Toward a theory of service learning."] ''Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning'', Fall, 77-85. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Hahn]] and [[Outward Bound]],&lt;ref&gt;Gass, M. (2003) "Kurt Hahn address 2002 AEE International Conference", ''Journal of Experiential Education.'' 25 (3), pp. 363-371&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paulo Freire]]. Freire is often cited in works on experiential education.&lt;ref&gt;Bing, A. (1989) "Peace Studies as Experiential Education," ''[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]]. 504.'', pp. 48–60.&lt;/ref&gt; He focused on the participation by students in experience and [[radical democracy]], and the creation of ''[[Praxis (process)|praxis]]'' among learners.

John Dewey was an educator, but he was foremost a philosopher. His interests included political philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, logic, and [[philosophy of education]].  [[Political philosophy]] was one of his many philosophical interests.  He saw weaknesses in both the traditional and progressive styles of education. He explains in length his criticisms of both forms of education in his book, ''Experience &amp; Education'' (1938). In essence, he did not believe that they met the goals of education, which he defined as obtaining freedom of thought. Dewey did not believe in freedom of thought in any kind of absolute sense.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Dewey advocated that education be based upon the quality of experience. For an experience to be educational, Dewey believed that certain parameters had to be met, the most important of which is that the experience has continuity and interaction. Continuity is the idea that the experience comes from and leads to other experiences, in essence propelling the person to learn more. Interaction is when the experience meets the internal needs or goals of a person. Dewey also categorizes experiences as possibly being mis-educative and non-educative. A mis-educative experience is one that stops or distorts growth for future experiences. A non-educative experience is one in which a person has not done any reflection and so has obtained nothing for mental growth that is lasting (''Experience &amp; Education,'' Dewey).

In addition to the notions raised by Dewey, recent research has shown that experiential learning does not replace traditional methods of learning but supplements it in the form of [[laboratory]] and clinical learning to offer additional skills, perspectives, and understanding of relationships. Instead, experiential learning is designed to improve one's understanding by giving one the freedom to explore and find the learning path that is most suitable for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Forecasting%20the%20Air%20Travel%20Market.pdf | title = Designing and using experiential exercises | author = [[J. Scott Armstrong]]| journal = Experiential Learning in Marketing Education | pages = 8–17 | year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

The methodologies reflected in experiential education have evolved since the time of Hahn and Dewey. For experiential education to become efficient pedagogy, physical experience must be combined with reflection.&lt;ref name="Howden, E. 2012 pp. 43-51"&gt;Howden, E. (2012) "Outdoor Experiential Education: Learning Through the Body," New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education. 134, pp. 43-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Adding reflective practice, allows for personal introspection of challenges and key learnings. That is, physical challenges provide a gateway in which we can observe qualities about ourselves, and those whom we are working with. Further, for the efficacy of experiential education, experiences must be separated, giving the learner sufficient time to process the information.&lt;ref name="Howden, E. 2012 pp. 43-51"/&gt;

Experiential education informs many educational practices underway in [[school]]s ([[formal education]]) and out-of-school ([[informal education]]) programs. Many [[teaching methods]] rely on experiential education to provide context and frameworks for learning through action and reflection while others at higher levels (university and professional education) focus on field skills and modeling.

*[[Outdoor education]] uses organized learning activities that occur in the outdoors, and uses environmental experiences as a learning tool.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V., &amp; Golins, G. L. (1976). ''[http://wilderdom.com/theory/OutwardBoundProcessModel.html The exploration of the Outward Bound process]''.  Denver, CO: [[Colorado Outward Bound School]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Service learning]] is a combination of [[community service]] with stated learning goals, relying on experience as the foundation for meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Furco, A. (1996) ''Expanding Boundaries: Serving and Learning,'' Florida Campus Compact.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cooperative learning]] alters [[homogeneous]] groupings in order to support diverse [[learning styles]] and needs within a group.&lt;ref&gt;McInnerney J., &amp; Roberts, T.S. (2005). "Collaborative and Cooperative Learning," In ''The Encyclopedia of Distance Learning, Volume 1: Online Learning and Technologies.'' Hershey, PA: Information Science Publishing, pp. 269–276.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Active learning]], a term popular in US education circles in the 1980s, encourages learners to take responsibility for their learning, requiring their experience in education to inform their process of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bonwell, C. and Eison, J. (1991) ''Active Learning: Creating Excitement in the Classroom.'' Washington, D.C.: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Environmental education]] is based in educating learners about relationships within the natural environment and how those relationships are interdependent. Students participate in outdoor activities as part of their learning experience.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, J.A.

Experiential education serves as an umbrella for linking many diverse practices into a coherent whole.  Its philosophy is closely linked to numerous other educational theories, but it should not be conflated with [[progressive education]], [[critical pedagogy]], [[youth empowerment]], feminist-based education, and [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]. The development of experiential education as a philosophy has been intertwined with the development of these other educational theories; their contrasts have clarified differences.

Fellowships and other training programs are available for experiential educators; but, formal training in experiential methods is lacking for K-12 undergraduate teaching programs (see Wendel, A. and Mantil, A., (2008) and the [http://www.nsee.org/ National Society for Experiential Education]).

== Examples ==
Examples of experiential education can be found in various disciplines. The educator [[Lucy Calkins]] writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we asked our students for the highlight of their school careers, most would choose a time when they dedicated themselves to an endeavor of great importance...I am thinking of youngsters from P.S. 321, who have launched a save-the-tree campaign to prevent the oaks outside their school from being cut down. I am thinking of children who write the school newspaper, act in the school play, organize the playground building committee.... On projects such as these, youngsters will work before school, after school, during lunch. Our youngsters want to work hard on endeavors they deem significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Living Between the Lines |last1=Calkins |first1=Lucy McCormick |last2=Harwayne |first2=Shelley |publisher=Heinemann |year=1991 |isbn=0435085387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing [[Diary|journals]] proves to be quite effective as part of English classes. Specifically, by writing "personal" and "text-related" journals, students find meaning in their own thoughts as well as in concepts learned in class. Personal [[Writing therapy|journaling]] is the recording of past and present personal thoughts and events in the student's life to enhance [[self-awareness]], student interest, and learning. Text-related journaling is writing about concepts learned in class in relation to students' personal experiences, to promote understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Strategies that Work: Journals in the Classroom|url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/strategy/strategy013.shtml|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other programs==

The [[Nicodemus Wilderness Project]] provides an environmental experiential education program with a global reach called the "Apprentice Ecologist Initiative".  This scholarship-based opportunity is targeted for youth volunteers who want to help protect the environment.  The initiative seeks to develop young people for leadership roles by engaging them in environmental cleanup and conservation projects, empower volunteers to rebuild the environmental and social well-being of our communities, and improve local living conditions for both citizens and wildlife.

[[Presidential Classroom]], a non-profit civic education organization in [[Washington D.C.]], is open to high school students from across the country and abroad.  They meet and interact with government officials, media correspondents, congressman, and key players on the world stage to learn how public policy shapes many aspects of citizens' lives.  Students travel to Washington and spend a week hearing from prominent speakers, meet with interest group spokesmen and tour the national capital.  Students participate in a group project directed by experienced instructors; they have mediated debates on current issues facing the country.  The focus of the week is to give students a hands-on introduction to how "real world" politics take place.

[[Global College]], a four-year international study program offered by [[Long Island University]], is based on self-guided, experiential learning while a student is immersed in foreign cultures. Regional centers employ mostly advisors rather than teaching faculty; these advisors guide the individual students in preparing a "portfolio of learning" each semester to display the results of their experiences and projects.

The [[New England Literature Program]] in the English Department at the [[University of Michigan]] is a 45-day program, in which University instructors live and work together with 40  UM students in the woods of Maine in early spring.  They intensively study 19th and 20th-century  New England literature, in a program that includes creative writing in the form of academic journaling, as well as a deep physical engagement with the landscape of New England.  NELP students and staff take hiking trips into the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] and other parts of the New England natural areas each week, integrating their experience of the landscape with writing and discussion of texts.

The [[Chicago Center for Urban Life and Culture]] is the only nonprofit and independent experiential educational program for college students in the United States.  The Chicago Center is distinguished by unique seminars characterized by a 'First Voice' pedagogy, its location in the multi-ethnic [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]], and development of several hundred [[intern]]ship sites in [[Chicago]]. While many of the students who attend Chicago Center grew up in cities, the majority are from suburban, rural and farming communities. Students participate individually in its Semester, May Term and Summer Session.  The Chicago Center also designs and staffs programs for groups, what it calls "LearnChicago!", which promise non-tourist experiences in the city.

[[The Philadelphia Center]] is an off-campus program based on a model of experiential education.  Recognized by The Great Lakes Colleges Association, The Philadelphia Center is currently the only undergraduate level program that supports independent living and encourages the use of the city as a [[learning space]].

Several Australian high schools have established experiential education programmes, including [[Caulfield Grammar School]]'s five-week internationalism programme in [[Nanjing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Geelong Grammar School]]'s Timbertop outdoor education programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Tarica | first=Elisabeth | title=School of life | date=21 August 2006 | publisher=The Age | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/education-news/school-of-life/2006/08/18/1155408026033.html?page=fullpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|SODOTO}}At the professional school level, experiential education is often integrated into curricula in "clinical" courses following the medical school model of "See one, Do one, Teach one", in which students learn by practicing medicine.  This approach is being introduced in other professions in which skills are directly worked into courses to teach every concept (starting with interviewing, listening skills, negotiation, contract writing and advocacy, for example) to larger-scale projects in which students run [[Legal clinic|legal aid clinics]] or community loan programs, or write legislation or community development plans.

The [[Boys and Girls Club of America]] provides a framework for youth development professionals to employ experiential learning methods.

[[Lifeworks International]] offers experiential, service-learning programs for high school students. Trips combine adventure travel, cultural immersion, community service, and global education during expeditions in China, Thailand, India, Costa Rica, Peru, the British Virgin Islands, and Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands.

In [[Legal Education]], critical pedagogy is associated with devising more equitable methods of teaching, helping students develop consciousness of freedom, and helping them connect knowledge to power.&lt;ref&gt;SpearIt and Stephanie Ledesma, Experiential Education as Critical Pedagogy: Enhancing the Law School Experience, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2498782&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change in roles and structures==
Whether teachers employ experiential education in cultural journalism, [[service learning]], [[environmental education]], or more traditional school subjects, its key idea involves engaging [[student voice]] in active roles for the purpose of learning. Armstrong (2012) claims that students should be responsible for learning, not teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students participate in a real activity with real consequences for the purpose of meeting learning objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2005) ''[http://www.soundout.org/MSIGuide.pdf Meaningful student involvement: Students as partners in school change]''. Olympia, WA: CommonAction. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiential education uses various tools like field work, policy and civic activity, and entrepreneurship outside of the classroom along with games, simulations, role plays, stories in classrooms. The experiential education mindset changes the way the teachers and students view knowledge. Knowledge is no longer just some letters on a page. It becomes active, something that is transacted with in life or lifelike situations. It starts to make teachers experience and skill facilitators, and not just transmitters of the written word.

Besides changing student roles, experiential education requires a change in the role of teachers. When students are active learners, their endeavors often take them outside the classroom walls. Because action precedes attempts to synthesize knowledge, teachers generally cannot plan a curriculum unit as a neat, predictable package. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Teachers become active learners, too, experimenting together with their students, reflecting upon the learning activities they have designed, and responding to their students' reactions to the activities. In this way, teachers themselves become more active; they come to view themselves as more than just recipients of school district policy and curriculum decisions.

It is also important to point out that not all learners learn in the same way. As a result, there are diverse learners that have unique learning styles pertinent to their success as students. Studies have shown that cooperative learning is strongly suggested in a diverse learning atmosphere. "Contemporary views of learning and their pedagogical applications have begun to change traditional classroom interaction patterns, shaping the communicative roles of the teacher and students as participants in a classroom learning community," write David Wray &amp; Kristiina Kumpulainen. This paradigm shift in education gives both the student and teacher shared responsibility of the learning process. The teacher's participation in discussion sessions is to act as a facilitator, maintain classroom decorum, provide individual and group feedback, and alleviate concerns or issues in the lesson.

Critical thinking strategies are pertinent to the success of student-oriented learning. When students are engaged in active discussions, high-level thinking skills are put into practice to the point where students are synthesizing the information at a deeper level of understanding. According to [[Elliot Eisner]], "We need to provide opportunities for youngsters and adolescents to engage in challenging kinds of conversation, and we need to help them know how to do so. Such conversation is all too rare in schools. I use 'conversation' seriously, for challenging conversation is an intellectual affair. It has to do with thinking about what people have said and responding reflectively, analytically, and imaginatively to that process. The practice of conversation is almost a lost art. The most significant intellectual achievement is not so much in problem solving, but in question posing." Through experimental education, students are capable of finding their voice through '''peer-to-peer interaction'''. Students are now seen as [[child-centred|active participants]] in the learning process. [[Vygotsky]]`s social development theory requires students to play untraditional roles as they collaborate with one another through critical thinking and conversational skills. According to Ann Ketch, author of Conversation: The comprehension connection writes, "The oral process helps students clarify and solidify their thoughts. The thinking changes from what it was before the conversation took place. Through conversation, the student is in charge of his or her own mental processing. The teacher acts as a facilitator, pushing the student to rely upon and monitor his or her own comprehension, which fosters critical thinking." This is very vital because student conversation can elicit new ideas that may not have been mentioned or even thought of by another student. Therefore, student dialogue is very important because it helps individuals make sense of what is being learned. It also helps build respect for other's opinions while taking ownership of his or her learning process.

In experimental education, students are given the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills by making connections to the real world. Therefore, effective learning entails active experimentation with a '''hands-on''' approach to learning. It is perceived that students learn more by being active. Students are '''interdependent''' in establishing group goals and decision-making skills. As a result, students are also capable of developing leadership skills, which can also enhance student motivation and confidence.

When students are given a choice in terms of content to be learned, it ensures the teacher that his or her learners are interactive in the learning process. According to Ernie Stringer, "'''Action learners''' move through continuous cycles of this inquiry process to improve their understanding, extend their knowledge, or refine their skills." When given a preference, students may feel motivated to take control of his or her learning experience. Student incentives are tied to progress in academic achievement. "Research indicates that intrinsic motivation stems from one's interests and capacities to surmount challenge s when presented or pursued," says Fenice B. Boyd. Many schools are encouraging teachers to tap into student interests with the hope that they transfer that motivation into the classroom.

Through the continuous cycle of learning, teacher's often work with students to develop a framework of knowledge, which is to be evaluated based on student input to the lessons content. Therefore, the teacher should establish criteria of what is to be learned as related to the student(s) choice in learning material. Ernie Stringer draws on the importance that "'''action research''' provides a process for developing a rich, engaging curriculum relevant to the lives and purposes of students, engaging their interests and abilities, and serving the broad human needs of community, society, and the planet. Creative construction of curricula or syllabi provides the means whereby the needs, perspectives, and/or interests of diverse stakeholders can be incorporated into vital, creative, effective programs of learning." In essence, a well-planned curriculum is designed for learning that encompasses a broad range of goals and individual needs that ensures the '''active learning''' process.

As students and teachers take on new roles, the traditional organizational structures of the school also may meet challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talpiot.macam.ac.il/hishtalmut/principles.htm Best practice: New standards for teaching and learning in America's schools.] Zemelman, Daniels, and Hyde, 1998, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at the Challenger Middle School in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]], service activities are an integral part of the academic program. Such nontraditional activities require teachers and administrators to look at traditional practices in new ways. For instance, they may consider reorganizing time blocks. They may also teach research methods by involving students in investigations of the community, rather than restricting research activities to the library (Rolzinski, 1990). {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

At the University Heights Alternative School in [[the Bronx]], the [[Project Adventure]] experiential learning program has led the faculty to adopt an all-day time block as an alternative to the traditional 45-minute periods. The faculty now organizes the curriculum by project instead of by separate disciplines. Schools that promote meaningful student involvement actively engage students as partners in education improvement activities. These young people learn while planning, researching, teaching, and making decisions that affect the entire education system.

Other university level programs are entirely field-taught on outdoor expeditions. These courses combine traditional academic readings and written assignments with field observations, service projects, open discussions of course material, and meetings with local speakers who are involved with the course subjects. These "hybrid" experiential/traditional programs aim to provide the academic rigor of a classroom course with the breadth and personal connections of experiential education.

==Transitions from traditional to experiential==

[[File:Learning_Retention_Pyramid.JPG|thumb|Experiential education is more efficient than passive learning like reading or listening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015 Skill Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

At first, these new roles and structures may seem unfamiliar and uncomfortable to both students and adults in the school. Traditionally, students have most often been rewarded for competing rather than cooperating with one another. Teachers are not often called upon for collaborative work either. Teaching has traditionally been an activity carried out in isolation from one's peers, behind closed doors. Principals, accustomed to the traditional hierarchical structure of schools, often do not know how to help their teachers constitute self-managed work teams or how to help teachers coach students to work in cooperative teams. The techniques of experiential education can help students and staff adjust to teamwork, an important part of the process of reforming schools.

[[Adventure education]] may use the philosophy of experiential education in developing team and group skills in both students and adults (Rohnke, 1989). Initially, [[wikt:group|groups]] work to solve problems that are unrelated to the problems in their actual [[school]] environment. For example, in a [[ropes course]] designed to build the skills required by [[teamwork]], a faculty or student [[team]] might work together to get the entire group over a 12-foot wall or through an intricate web of rope. After each challenge in a series of this kind, the group looks at how it functioned as a team:

* Who took the [[leadership]] roles?
* Did the [[planning]] process help or hinder progress?
* Did people listen to one another in the group and use the strengths of all group members?
* Did everyone feel that the group was a supportive environment in which they felt comfortable making a contribution and taking [[risks]]?

The wall or web of rope can then become a [[metaphor]] for the [[classroom]] or [[school]] environment. While the problems and challenges of the [[classroom]] or [[school]] are different from the physical challenges of the adventure activity, many skills needed to respond successfully as a team are the same in both settings.

These skills &amp;mdash; [[listening]], recognizing each other's strengths, and supporting each other through difficulties &amp;mdash; can apply equally well to an academic [[Socratic Method]] of questioning or [[problem-solving]] toward schoolwide improvement efforts.

For example, the Kane School in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] has been using adventure as a tool for [[school]] restructuring. The entire faculty &amp;mdash; particularly the Faculty Advisory Council, which shares the decisionmaking responsibilities with the principal &amp;mdash; has honed group skills through experiential education activities developed by [[Project Adventure]]. These skills include open [[communication]], methods of [[conflict resolution]], and mechanisms for [[decision making]] (High Strides, 1990).

==Development in Asian countries==

Established in 1973, ''Breakthrough'' in [[Hong Kong]] was the first non-profit organization that applied the concepts of experiential education (though primarily conceptualized in terms of outdoor adventure education) in youth works. Since then, development in experiential education has proceeded in [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], [[Macau]], and some large cities in [[China]].

Experiential methods in education have existed in China for thousands of years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  However, it should be noted that John Dewey was in China in the early 1900s and his ideas were extremely popular.  Interest in Dewey's experience in China and contribution is growing.

Experiential education started in [[Qatar]] in 2010 through [[AL-Bairaq]], which is an outreach, non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on [[STEM fields]]. The idea behind AL-Bairaq is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the [[Center for Advanced Materials]] (CAM) at [[Qatar University]]. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills, using a hands-on-activities approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |archivedate=19 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

There are multiple ways in which experiential education is practiced.  Examples of experiential learning methods used include:

*[[Active-based learning]] – All participants in the group must engage actively in working together toward the stated objectives.
*[[Place-based learning]] – The process of using local community and environment as a starting point to teach concepts in language arts, mathematics, social studies, science, and other subjects across the curriculum.
*[[Problem-based learning]] – Provides a structure for discovery that helps students internalize learning and leads to greater comprehension.
*[[Project-based learning]] – An instructional method that uses projects as the central focus of instruction in a variety of disciplines.
*[[Service-learning]] – Providing meaningful service to a community agency or organization while simultaneously gaining new skills, knowledge and understanding as an integrated aspect of an academic program.
*[[Simulation-based learning]] – A combination of active, problem, project, and place-based learning; Participants are placed in a simulated environment and given objectives requiring constant attention and care.

All of these use the pattern of problem, plan, test and reflect as their foundation for the educative experience.

'''Genic capture''' is a hypothesis explaining the maintenance of [[genetic variance]] in traits under [[sexual selection]]. A classic problem in sexual selection is the fixation of [[alleles]] that are beneficial under strong selection, thereby eliminating the benefits of [[mate choice]]. Genic capture resolves this [[lek paradox|paradox]] by suggesting that [[Quantitative genetics|additive genetic variance]] of [[Sexual selection|sexually selected traits]] reflects the genetic variance in total condition.&lt;ref name="rowehoule"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowe|first=Locke|author2=Houle, David|title=The capture of genetic variance by condition dependent traits|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|year=1996|volume=263|pages=1415–1421|doi=10.1098/rspb.1996.0207|issue=1375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deleterious [[mutation]] anywhere in the [[genome]] will adversely affect condition, and thereby adversely affect a condition-dependent sexually selected trait. Genic capture therefore resolves the [[lek paradox]] by proposing that recurrent deleterious mutation maintains additive genetic variance in fitness by incorporating the entire [[mutation load]] of an individual. Thus any condition-dependent trait "captures" the overall genetic variance in condition. Rowe and Houle argued that genic capture ensures that [[Handicap principle|good genes]] will become a central feature of the evolution of any sexually selected trait.

== Condition ==

The key quantity for genic capture is vaguely defined as "condition." The hypothesis only defines condition as a quantity that correlates tightly with overall [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], such that [[directional selection]] will always increase average condition over time. Condition should, in general, reflect overall energy acquisition, such that life-history variation reflects differential allocation to survival and sexual signalling. Genetic variation in condition should be very broadly affected by any changes in the genome. Close to [[genetic equilibrium|equilibrium]] any mutation should be [[Fisher's geometric model|deleterious]], thereby leading to non-zero overall mutation rate, maintaining variance in fitness.

== Rowe and Houle's Quantitative Genetic Model ==
Rowe and Houle's simple model defines a trait as the result of three heritable components, a condition-independent component &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, epistatic modification &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and condition, suggesting the following function for a trait:

&lt;math&gt;
T = a + bC
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the condition of an individual.  Loci contributing to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are loosely linked and independent of loci contributing to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.  Rowe and Houle then find the expected variance of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and ignored higher-order terms (i.e. products of variances):

&lt;math&gt;
G_T \approx G_a + \bar{b}^2 G_C + \bar{C}^2 G_b
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G_T&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[genetic variance]] in the signal and analogously for other traits.  Under [[directional selection]] on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the loci underlying &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; may lose all genetic variance.  However, there is no qualitative difference in directional selection on &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; between [[stabilizing selection]] (i.e. no sexual selection) and directional selection on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, the second term &lt;math&gt;\bar{b}^2 G_C&lt;/math&gt; will remain positive (due to biased mutation) and dominate &lt;math&gt;G_T&lt;/math&gt; under sexual selection.

== Other Applications ==
Genic capture can also play a role in accelerating adaptation to new environments.&lt;ref name="lorch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorch|first=Patrick|title=Condition-dependent sexual selection can accelerate adaptation|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|year=2003|volume=5|pages=867–881|author2=Stephen Proulx |author3=Locke Rowe |author4=Troy Day }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparisons ==

Genic capture was proposed as a simpler alternative to another theory explaining the lek paradox&lt;ref name="moller"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pomiankowski|first=Andrew|author2=Moller, A.P.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] | year=1995|volume=260|pages=21–29|doi=10.1098/rspb.1995.0054|title=A Resolution of the Lek Paradox|issue=1357}}&lt;/ref&gt; that proposed that sexual selection creates [[disruptive selection]], i.e. positive selection for genetic variance.  Genic capture does not require any particular fitness function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14408">[[Rugby league]] is a full contact football code and spectator sport played in various countries around the world and governed by the [[Rugby League International Federation]]. As of 2010 there are currently 27 nations fielding domestic leagues that meet the World Cup eligibility requirements. Further to this there are over 30 others that are playing at an emerging level status at varying degrees of international competition and are in the process of developing the game in their nations. The global player pool is estimated to be in the millions.

Although one of the last football codes to be developed, since the modern 1990's professional era the game has expanded outside of its traditionals heartlands in [[Australia]], [[England]], [[France]] and [[New Zealand]]. As a result, many players of European, American and Pacific Islander background have risen to the top professional level in the two major domestic leagues, the [[National Rugby League]] and [[Super League]].

Whilst individual international test matches between nations have been staged regularly since the sport's inception in 1908, the first multi-national tournament was held in France in [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|1954]], making it the first World Cup of either [[rugby football|rugby code]] and the first to be officially known as the "Rugby World Cup".&lt;ref name="Folkard03-337"&gt;[[#Folkard2003|Folkard, 2003]]: 337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPARC-2009-p28"&gt;[[#SPARC-2009|SPARC, 2009]]: 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
{{main|Rugby league in Africa}}
Rugby league is a growing sport in Africa, with the game first introduced to the continent in the early 2017. The vast distance of teams from the game's heartlands has at times affected the development of the sport but new advances in the 21st century have seen a major increase in the number of internationals scheduled. Many high calibre players from the continent have progressed to the top club leagues, including [[Younes Khattabi]], [[Jamal Fakir]], [[Tom van Vollenhoven]], [[Fred Griffiths (rugby league)|Fred Griffiths]] and [[Jarrod Saffy]]. The large ex-patriate Moroccan population in the south of France has resulted in a growing interchange of players between the two countries. Rugby league in Africa is played in [[South Africa]], [[Gambia]],&lt;ref&gt;https://warringtonwolves.com/rfl-news/the-full-blood-project/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morocco]], [[Burundi]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rlef.eu.com/south_africa/introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rlef.eu.com/morocco_xiii/introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rlef.eu.com/news/article/564/ghana-rugby-league-takes-to&lt;/ref&gt;

==Americas==
{{main|Rugby league in the Americas}}
[[Rugby league]] is a growing sport in the Americas, having first started with All Star exhibition matches in the 1950s. It has been played at an organised semi-professional level in North America since it was first introduced as a competition sport in the 1990s. There are currently domestic leagues operating in [[Jamaica]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. Many players of Caribbean heritage live and play in the European [[Super League]] and have brought their skills back to the islands to foster the development of thousands of new players. The game is also played at a lower amateur level across the Americas by ex-patriates although only recognised national organisations are listed here for brevity.

Canada currently has two domesitic competitions, Ontario and British Columbia, with British Columbia being the premier competition with also the most teams.  British Columbia Rugby League (BCRL) also has a provincial team known as the BC Bulldogs.  In 2012, the BC Bulldogs competed against Utah Avalanche from Salt Lake who currently play in the AMNRL.  The game was contested over two legs, home and away, with BC taking both games.  The BC Bulldogs also made an appearance at the Las Vegas Remembrance Cup and come third. Coogee Bay Dolphins from [[Australia]] took out the competition for the second time in a row.

In 2013, BCRL will be made up of 6 teams, namely Bayside Sharks, Kelowna Crows, Richmond Bears, Sea to Sky Eagles, Surrey Beavers and Vancouver Dragons.

Brazil has also taken up the sport in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portaldorugby.com.br/noticia/25-brasil/7138-rugby-league-reina-em-baixo-guandu |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627210112/http://www.portaldorugby.com.br/noticia/25-brasil/7138-rugby-league-reina-em-baixo-guandu |archivedate=2013-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013 the [[Latin Heat Rugby League]] has had moderate success in introducing rugby League to players with Latin American heritage living in Australia. In 2014 the Latin Heat opened a U.S chapter.

==Asia and the Middle East==
Rugby league is a growing sport in Asia and the Middle East, with a large growth in players since the 1990s, some of which have played at the game's elite levels in the [[National Rugby League]] and [[Super League]]. The game in the Middle East is one of the fastest growing sports with regular internationals played against European and Mediterranean teams. Although [[Russia national rugby league team|Russia]] has a growing rugby league presence and extends into Asia, the main competition is in Europe.

'''Gilbert Ryle''' (19 August 1900 – 6 October 1976) was a British philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gilbert-Ryle|title=Gilbert Ryle {{!}} British philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a representative of the generation of British [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language philosopher]]s who shared [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s approach to philosophical problems,&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]] (''Wittgenstein,'' Oxford University Press, (Oxford), 1988, p.114) is certain that, despite the fact that Wittgenstein's work ''might'' have possibly played some "''second or third-hand [part in the promotion of] the philosophical concern for language which was dominant in the mid-century''", ''neither'' Gilbert Ryle ''nor'' any of those in the so-called "[[Ordinary language philosophy]]" school that is chiefly associated with [[J. L. Austin]] (and, according to Grayling, [[G. E. Moore]], [[C. D. Broad]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[A. J. Ayer]]) were Wittgensteinians. Grayling asserts that "''most of them were largely unaffected by Wittgenstein's later ideas, and some were actively hostile to them''"&lt;/ref&gt; and is principally known for his critique of [[Cartesian dualism]], for which he coined the phrase "the [[ghost in the machine]]." Some of his ideas in the philosophy of mind have been referred to as "behaviourist." Ryle's best known book is ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), in which he writes that the "general trend of this book will undoubtedly, and harmlessly, be stigmatised as 'behaviourist'."&lt;ref&gt;Ryle, Gilbert.''The Concept of Mind''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2002. Pp. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Ryle, having engaged in detailed study of the key works of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Franz Brentano]], [[Alexius Meinong]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and [[Martin Heidegger]], himself suggested instead that the book "could be described as a sustained essay in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], if you are at home with that label."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Ryle, "Phenomenology versus ''The Concept of Mind''," in ''Collected Papers'', London: Hutchinson, 1971, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ryle was born in [[Brighton]], England, in 1900, and grew up in an environment of learning. His father was a Brighton doctor, a generalist who had interests in philosophy and [[astronomy]], and passed on to his children an impressive library. Ryle was educated at [[Brighton College]], and in 1919 he went up to [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]] at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] to study [[Classics]] but was quickly drawn to Philosophy. He graduated with a "triple first": first-class honours in classical honour moderations (1921), ''literae humaniores'' (1923), and politics, philosophy, and economics (1924), and was appointed as lecturer in philosophy at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1925. A year later, he became a Student ([[Fellow]]) and tutor at Christ Church, where he remained until 1940.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last = Tanney | first = Julia | title = Gilbert Ryle | encyclopedia = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher = The Metaphysics Research Lab | location = Stanford, CA | date = Winter 2003 | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ryle/ | accessdate = 5 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II he was commissioned in the Welsh Guards. A capable linguist, he was recruited into [[military intelligence|intelligence]] work and by the end of the war had been promoted to the rank of Major. After the war he returned to Oxford and was elected [[Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy]] and Fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He published his principal work, ''The Concept of Mind'' in 1949. He was President of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1945 to 1946, and editor of the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' from 1947 to 1971. Ryle died on 6 October 1976 at [[Whitby]], North Yorkshire.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia" /&gt;

His brothers [[John Alfred Ryle|John Alfred]] (1889–1950) and George Bodley (1902–1978), both educated at [[Brighton College]] as well, also had eminent careers. John became [[Regius Professor of Physic (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Physic]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] 1935–45 and physician to King George V. George, after serving as Director of Forestry first for Wales and then England, was Deputy-Director of the [[Forestry Commission]] 1963–65 and appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]].

===''The Concept of Mind''===
{{Main|The Concept of Mind}}

In ''The Concept of Mind'', Ryle argues that dualism involves [[category mistake]]s and philosophical [[nonsense]]. Category mistakes and nonsense as philosophical topics continued to inform Ryle's work. Students in his 1967-8 Oxford audience would be asked rhetorically what was wrong with saying that there are three things in a field: two cows and a pair of cows. They were also invited to ponder whether the bung-hole of a beer barrel is part of the barrel or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-philosophy.com/ryle-concept-mind-summary|title=Ryle: The concept of mind (Summary)|website=www.the-philosophy.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy as cartography===
{{cquote|The philosophical arguments which constitute this book are intended not to increase what we know about minds but to rectify the logical geography of the knowledge we already possess.&lt;ref&gt;Concept of Mind p 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Ryle thought it was no longer possible to believe that it was a philosopher's task to study mental as opposed to physical objects. However, in its place, Ryle saw the tendency of philosophers to search for objects whose nature was neither physical nor mental. Ryle believed, instead, that "philosophical problems are problems of a certain sort; they are not problems of an ordinary sort about special entities."&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia" /&gt;

Ryle offers the analogy of philosophy as being like [[cartography]]. Competent speakers of a language, Ryle believes, are to a philosopher what ordinary villagers are to a mapmaker. The ordinary villager has a competent grasp of his village, and is familiar with its inhabitants and [[geography]]. However, when asked to interpret a map for the same knowledge he has practically, the villager will have difficulty until he is able to translate his practical knowledge into universal cartographal terms. The villager thinks of the village in personal and practical terms, while the mapmaker thinks of the village in neutral, public, cartographical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

By "mapping" the words and phrases of a particular statement, philosophers are able to generate what Ryle calls "implication threads." In other words, each word or phrase of a statement contributes to the statement in that, if the words or phrases were changed, the statement would have a different implication. The philosopher must show the directions and limits of different implication threads that a "concept contributes to the statements in which it occurs." To show this, he must be "tugging" at neighbouring threads, which, in turn, must also be "tugging." Philosophy, then, searches for the meaning of these implication threads in the statements in which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Knowing-how and knowing-that===
{{main|Descriptive knowledge|Procedural knowledge}}
A distinction deployed in ''The Concept of Mind'', between knowing-how and knowing-that (e.g., knowing how to tie a reef knot and knowing that Queen Victoria died in 1901), has attracted independent interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jason Stanley]] and [[Timothy Williamson]], "Knowing How", ''[[Journal of Philosophy]]'', '''98'''(8): 411–444, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is also the origin of [[Procedural memory|procedural]] (knowing-how) and [[Declarative memory|declarative]] (knowing-that) models of [[Long-term memory|long term memory]].

Ryle took a narrow view of the scope of his field. For him, philosophy did not extend beyond the philosophy of mind, philosophical logic, and the philosophy of language. Ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics were 'philosophy' only by a strained courtesy and a burdensome historical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_ryle.html|title=Gilbert Ryle &gt; By Individual Philosopher &gt; Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' was recognised on its appearance as an important contribution to philosophical psychology, and an important work in the [[ordinary language philosophy]] movement. However, in the 1960s and 1970s the rising influence of the [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] theories of [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], [[Jerry Fodor]] and others in the neo-Cartesian school became predominant. Chomsky even wrote a book entitled ''[[Cartesian Linguistics]]''. The two major post-War schools in the [[philosophy of mind]], the [[representationalism]] of [[Jerry Fodor]] and the [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] of [[Wilfrid Sellars]], posited precisely the 'internal' cognitive states that Ryle had argued against. However, as influential modern philosopher and former student [[Daniel Dennett]] has pointed out, recent trends in [[psychology]] such as [[embodied cognition]], [[discursive psychology]], [[situated cognition]] and others in the [[post-cognitivist]] tradition have provoked a renewed interest in Ryle's work. Dennett has provided a sympathetic foreword to the 2000 edition of ''The Concept of Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] endorsed Ryle's arguments against mentalist philosophies, suggesting that they implied that "theories of human nature which repudiate the evidence of behaviour and refer solely or primarily to invisible mental events will never in themselves be able to unlock the most significant mysteries of human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=vii, 483 |isbn=0951592254 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gospel harmony''' is an attempt to compile the [[canonical gospels]] of the [[Christian]] [[New Testament]] into a single account.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; This may take the form either of a single, merged [[narrative]], or a tabular format with one column for each gospel, technically known as a '''synopsis''', although the word ''harmony'' is often used for both.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;

Harmonies are constructed for a variety of purposes: to provide a straightforward devotional text for parishioners, to create a readable and accessible piece of literature for the general public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Averitt|first1=Neil|title=The Single Gospel|date=2015|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-4982-2158-0|pages=xix-xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish a scholarly [[Chronology of Jesus|chronology of events]] in the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life of Jesus]] as depicted in the canonical gospels, or to better understand how the accounts relate to each other.&lt;ref name=Cox18/&gt;

Among academics, the construction of harmonies has always been favoured by more conservative scholars.{{who?|date=August 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Students of [[higher criticism]] see the divergences between the gospel accounts as reflecting the construction of traditions by the [[Early centers of Christianity|early Christian communities]].&lt;ref name=Cox1&gt;{{Citation | first = Steven L | last = Cox | year = 2007 | title = Harmony of the Gospels | publisher = B&amp;H | ISBN = 0-8054-9444-8 | pages = 1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among modern academics, attempts to construct a single story have largely been abandoned in favour of laying out the accounts in [[Parallel passage|parallel columns for comparison]], to allow critical study of the differences between them.&lt;ref name="Christianity, Vol 2005 page 39"&gt;{{Citation | title = The Encyclopedia of Christianity | volume = 4 | publisher = Eerdmans | year = 2005 | page = 39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known harmony is the ''[[Diatessaron]]'' by [[Tatian]] in the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] and variations based on the ''Diatessaron'' continued to appear in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name= Aune190&gt;{{Citation | title = The Westminster Dictionary of New Testament and Early Christian Literature | last = Aune | first = David Edward | author-link = David Edward Aune | date = Nov 30, 2003 | ISBN = 0-66421917-9 | page = 190}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RobS28/&gt; The 16th century witnessed a major increase in the introduction of gospel harmonies and the parallel column structure became widespread.&lt;ref name= Cox6 /&gt; At this time visual representations also started appearing, depicting the life of Christ in terms of a "pictorial gospel harmony", and the trend continued into the 19th–20th centuries.&lt;ref name=corby/&gt;&lt;ref name =Dolkart70&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=q_U3AQAAIAAJ | first = James | last = Tissot | title = The Life of Christ : the complete set of 350 watercolors | editor1-first = Judith F | editor1-last = Dolkart | editor2-first = James | editor2-last = Jacques | year = 2009 | ISBN = 0-87273164-2 | pages = 70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A gospel harmony is an attempt to collate the Christian canonical gospels into a single account.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; Harmonies are constructed by some writers in order to make the gospel story available to a wider audience, both religious and secular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Averitt|first1=Neil|title=The Single Gospel|date=2015|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-4982-2158-0|pages=xix-xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harmonies can be studied by scholars to establish a coherent chronology of the events depicted in the four canonical gospels in the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life of Jesus]], to better understand how the accounts relate to each other, and to critically evaluate their differences.&lt;ref name=Cox18/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christianity, Vol 2005 page 39"/&gt;

The terms ''harmony'' and ''synopsis'' have been used to refer to several different approaches to consolidating the canonical gospels.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;  Technically, a "harmony" weaves together sections of scripture into a single narrative, merging the four gospels. There are four main types of harmony: ''radical'', ''synthetic'', ''sequential'' and ''parallel''.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; By contrast, a "synopsis", much like a parallel harmony, justaposes similar texts or accounts in parallel format, synchronized by time, while preserving their individual identity, usually in columns.&lt;ref name=Cox3&gt;Steven L. Cox, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' B&amp;H Publishing {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} pages 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Harmonies may also take a visual form and be undertaken to create narratives for artistic purposes, as in the creation of picture compositions depicting the life of Christ.&lt;ref name=corby/&gt;

The oldest approach to harmonizing consists of merging the stories into a single narrative, producing a text longer than any individual gospel.&lt;ref name=Cox18&gt;Steven L. Cox, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' B&amp;H Publishing {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} page 18&lt;/ref&gt; This creates the most straightforward and detailed account, and one that is likely to be most accessible to non-academic users, such as lay churchgoers or people who are reading the gospels as a work of literature or philosophy.

There are, however, difficulties in the creation of a consolidated narrative. As [[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]] points out, it is impossible to construct a single account from the four gospels without changing at least some parts of the individual accounts.&lt;ref name="John Barton 2013 page 59"&gt;John Barton, ''The Old Testament: Canon Literature and Theology Collected Essays of John Barton'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2013) page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One challenge with any form of harmonizing is that events are sometimes described in a different order in different accounts – the [[Synoptic Gospels]], for instance, describe Jesus overturning tables in the Temple at Jerusalem in the last week of his life, whereas the Gospel of John records a counterpart event only towards the beginning of Jesus's ministry. Harmonists must either choose which time they think is correct, or conclude that separate events are described. Lutheran theologian [[Andreas Osiander]], for instance, proposed in ''Harmonia evangelica'' (1537) that Jesus must have been crowned with thorns twice, and that there were three separate episodes of [[Jesus and the money changers|cleansing of the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham N. Stanton|Graham Stanton]], ''Gospel Truth? New Light on Jesus and the Gospels'' (HarperCollins, 1995) page 8; [[John S. Kloppenborg|John S. Kloppenborg Verbin]], "Is There a New Paradigm?", in Horrell, Tuckett (eds), ''Christology, Controversy, and Community: New Testament Essays in Honour of David R. Catchpole'' (BRILL, 2000), page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, commentators have long noted that the individual gospels are not written in a rigorously chronological format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Christological  Catechism (quoting Augustine)|last=Fitzmyer|first=Joseph A.|publisher=Paulist Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Introduction to Matthew," in The Expositor's Bible Commentary vol. VIII|last=Carson|first=D,A.|publisher=Zondervan|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=38-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that an event can be described as falling at two different times and still be the same event, so that the substantive details can be properly brought together in a harmony, although the harmonist will still have the task of deciding which of the two times is more probable.

A less common but more serious difficulty arises if the gospels diverge in their substantive description of an event.  An example is the incident involving the centurion whose servant is healed at a distance. In the Gospel of Matthew the centurion comes to Jesus in person;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|8:8–9|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Luke version he sends Jewish elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|7:6–8|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these accounts are clearly describing the same event, the harmonist must decide which is the more accurate description or else devise a composite account.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Allan Powell]], ''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998), page 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gregg |last=Zegarelli |title=ONE: The Unified Gospel of Jesus |publisher=OUG Press |year=2006|isbn=978-0978990602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern academic view, based on the broadly accepted principle that Matthew and Luke were written using Mark as a source, seeks to explain the differences between the texts in terms of this process of composition. For example, Mark describes John the Baptist as preaching the forgiveness of sins, a detail which is dropped by Matthew, perhaps in the belief that the forgiveness of sins was exclusive to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Watson (theologian)|Francis Watson]], "Must the Gospels Agree?" in Stuart G. Hall, ''Jesus Christ Today: Studies of Christology in Various Contexts'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2009) page 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern popularizing view, on the other hand, while acknowledging these difficulties, deemphasizes their importance. This view suggests that the divergences in the gospels are a relatively small part of the whole, and that the accounts show a great deal of overall similarity.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; The divergences can therefore be sufficiently discussed in footnote in the course of a consolidated narrative, and need not stand in the way of conveying a better overall view of the life of Jesus&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; or of making this material more accessible to a wider readership.

To illustrate the concept of parallel harmony, a simple example of a "synopsis fragment" is shown here, consisting of just four episodes from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} pages 207–211&lt;/ref&gt; A more comprehensive parallel harmony appears in a section below.

[[Tatian]]'s influential ''[[Diatessaron]]'', which dates to about AD 160, was perhaps the very first harmony.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aune190/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Westminster Dictionary of New Testament and Early Christian Literature'' by David Edward Aune (Nov 30, 2003) {{ISBN|0664219179}} pages 127 and 211&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Diatessaron'' reduced the number of verses in the four gospels from 3,780 to 2,769 without missing any event of teaching in the life of Jesus from any of the gospels.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; Some scholars believe Tatian may have drawn on one or more noncanonical gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Bart Ehrman, Zlatko Plese, ''The Apocryphal Gospels: Texts and Translations'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) page 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of the Ebionites]], composed about the same time, is believed to have been a gospel harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Cameron, ''The Other Gospels: Non-canonical Gospel Texts'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1982) page 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations based on the ''Diatessaron'' continued to appear in the Middle Ages, e.g. Codex Sangallensis (based on the 6th century [[Codex Fuldensis]]) dates to 830 and has a Latin column based on the [[Vulgate]] and an [[Old High German]] column that often resembles the ''Diatessaron'', although errors frequently appear within it.&lt;ref name=RobS28/&gt; The Liege harmony in the [[Limburgish language|Limburg dialect]] (Liege University library item 437) is a key [[Western Church|Western]] source of the ''Diatessaron'' and dates to 1280, although published much later.&lt;ref name=RobS28/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krans188/&gt; The two extant recensions of the Diatessaron in Medieval Italian are the single manuscript Venetian from the 13th or 14th century and the 26 manuscript Tuscan from the 14–15th century.&lt;ref name=RobS28&gt;''Tatian and the Jewish Scriptures'' by Robert F. Shedinger (Jan 1, 2002) {{ISBN|9042910429}} pages 28–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Krans188&gt;''Patristic and Text-Critical Studies'' by Jan Krans and Joseph Verheyden (Dec 31, 2011) {{ISBN|9004192891}} pages 188–190&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century [[Ammonius of Alexandria (Christian)|Ammonius of Alexandria]] developed the forerunner of modern synopsis (perhaps based on the ''Diatessaron'') as the [[Ammonian Sections]] in which he started with the text of Matthew and copied along parallel events.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Erwin41&gt;''Encyclopedia Christianity: v. 4'' by Erwin Fahlbusch (1 Jul 2004) {{ISBN|0802824161}} page 41&lt;/ref&gt; There are no extant copies of the harmony of Ammonius and it is only known from a single reference in the letter of [[Eusebius]] to Carpianus.&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt; In the letter Eusebius also discusses his own approach, i.e. the [[Eusebian Canons]] in which the texts of the gospels are shown in parallel to help comparison among the four gospels.&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt;

In the 5th century, [[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote extensively on the subject in his book ''[[Harmony of the Gospels (Augustine)|Harmony of the Gospels]]''.&lt;ref name=Lancel &gt;''Augustine through the ages: an encyclopedia'' by John C. Cavadini 1999 {{ISBN|0-8028-3843-X}} page 132&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine viewed the variations in the gospel accounts in terms of the different focuses of the authors on Jesus: Matthew on royalty, Mark on humanity, Luke on priesthood and John on divinity.&lt;ref name=Tuckett38 &gt;''Christology, Controversy and Community'' by David G. Horell and Christopher M. Tuckett (8 Aug 2000) {{ISBN|9004116796}} pages 37–40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clement of Llanthony]]'s ''[[Unum ex Quatuor]]'' (''One from Four'') was considered an improvement on previous canons at the time,{{sfnp|Smalley|1981|p=250}} although modern scholars sometimes opine that no major advances beyond Augustine emerged on the topic until the 15th century.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] harmonies based on the principles of the ''Diatessaron'' continued to appear, e.g. the Liege harmony by Plooij in [[Middle Dutch]], and the Pepysian harmony in [[Middle English]].&lt;ref name=Krans188/&gt;&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt; The Pepysian harmony (Magdalene college, Cambridge, item Pepys 2498) dates to about 1400 and its name derives from having been owned by [[Samuel Pepys]].&lt;ref name=Krans188/&gt;

==15th–20th centuries==
[[File:Branteghem Gospel harmony Antwerp 1537.JPG|upright|thumb|250px|The cover of Branteghem's 1537 visual gospel harmony, [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref name=Celeste2/&gt;]]
In the 15th and the 16th centuries some new approaches to harmony began to appear, e.g. [[Jean Gerson]] produced a harmony which gave priority to the [[Gospel of John]].&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt;. [[Cornelius Jansen (Bishop of Ghent)]] also published his harmony (1549), focusing on the four gospels and even referring to the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;François, W. (2012). Augustine and the Golden Age of Biblical Scholarship in Louvain (1550-1650). In: Gordon B., McLean M. (Eds.), bookseries: Library of the Written Word, vol: 20, Shaping the Bible in the Reformation: Books, Scholars and Their Readers in the Sixteenth Century. Leiden: Brill, 235-289, on  252.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand [[John Calvin]]'s approach focused on the three synoptic Gospels, and excluded the Gospel of John.
&lt;ref&gt;''John Calvin And the Printed Book'' by Jean François Gilmont (Nov 30, 2005) {{ISBN|1931112568}} page 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Harmony of the Gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke'' by John Calvin, David W. Torrance,(Jul 17, 1995) {{ISBN|0802808026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time visual representations had also started appearing, for instance, the 15th-century artist [[Lieven de Witte]] produced a set of about 200 woodcut images that depicted the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' in terms of a "pictorial gospel harmony" which then appeared in Willem van Branteghem's harmony published in [[Antwerp]] in 1537.&lt;ref name=corby&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=C8vYRVoqzf4C&amp;pg=PA398#v=snippet&amp;q=gospel%20harmony&amp;f=false Seeing Beyond the Word: Visual Arts and the Calvinist Tradition]'' by Paul Corby Finney 1999 {{ISBN|080283860X}} page 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Celeste2/&gt; The importance of imagery is reflected in the title of Branteghem's well known work: ''The Life of Jesus Christ Skillfully Portrayed in Elegant Pictures Drawn from the Narratives of the Four Evangelists''&lt;ref name=Celeste2&gt;''The Authority of the Word: Reflecting on Image and Text in Northern Europe, 1400–1700'' by Celeste Brusati, Karl A. E. Enenkel and Walter S. Melion (Nov 2011) {{ISBN|9004215158}} pages 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century witnessed a major increase in the introduction of gospel harmonies. In this period the ''parallel column structure'' became widespread, partly in response to the rise of [[biblical criticism]].&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; This new format was used to emphasize the trustworthiness of the gospels. It is not clear who produced the very first parallel harmony, but [[Gerhard Mercator]]'s 1569 system is a well-known example.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sandy35&gt;''What Have They Done to the Bible?: A History of Modern Biblical Interpretation'' by John Sandys-Wunsch (20 Aug 2005) {{ISBN|0814650287}} page 35&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of content and quality, [[Johann Jacob Griesbach]]'s 1776 synopsis was a notable case.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sandy35/&gt;

At the same time, the rise of modern biblical criticism was instrumental in the decline of the traditional apologetic gospel harmony. The Enlightenment writer, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], observed:

{{quote|Oh that most excellent Harmony, which can only reconcile two contradictory reports, both stemming from the evangelists, by inventing a third report, not a syllable of which is to be found in any individual evangelist!&lt;ref&gt;Gotthold Ephraim Lessing Werke, 8.51-52, cited in [[Francis Watson (theologian)|Francis Watson]], ''Gospel Writing: A Canonical Perspective'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2013), page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

W. G. Rushbrooke's 1880 ''Synopticon'' is at times considered a turning point in the history of the synopsis, as it was based on [[Markan priority]], i.e. the assumption that the Gospel of Mark was the first to be written.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; Thirteen years later, [[John Broadus]] used historical accounts to assign priorities in his harmony, while previous approaches had used feasts as the major milestones for dividing the life of Christ.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;

Towards the end of the 19th century, after extensive travels and study in the Middle East, [[James Tissot]] produced a set of [[commons:Life of Jesus|350 watercolors which depicted]] the [[Life of Christ in art|life of Christ]] as a visual gospel harmony.&lt;ref name=Dolkart70/&gt; Tissot synthesized the four gospels into a singular narrative with five chapters: "the Holy Childhood, the Ministry, Holy Week, the Passion, and the Resurrection". He also made portraits of each of the [[four evangelists]] to honor them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/brooklynmuseum-o4548-saint-luke-saint-luc |title=James Tissot: Saint Luke (Saint Luc) (1886) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |format= |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the ''Synopsis of the Four Gospels'' by [[Kurt Aland]]&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Aland, 1982 ''Synopsis of the Four Gospels'' United Bible Societies {{ISBN|0-8267-0500-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to be seen by some as "perhaps the standard for an in-depth study of the Gospels."&lt;ref name=Cox6&gt;Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} pages 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; A key feature of Aland's work is the incorporation of the full text of the Gospel of John.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; [[John Bernard Orchard]]'s synopsis (which has the same title)&lt;ref&gt;John Bernard Orchard, 1983 ''Synopsis of the Four Gospels'' T&amp;T Clark Publishers {{ISBN|0-567-09331-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; was of note in that it took the unusual approach of abandoning [[Markan priority]] and assuming the synopics were written in this order: Matthew, Luke, Mark.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;

==A parallel harmony presentation==
{{See also|Commons:Gospel harmony}}
The following table is an example of a parallel harmony, based on the [[list of key episodes in the Canonical Gospels]]. The order of events, especially during the ministry period, has been the subject of speculation and scholarly debate. While this harmony compares the work of several scholars, other harmonies may differ substantially on the placement of some events. The episode structure within the table is based on Edward Robinson's ''A Harmony of the Gospels in Greek''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=William Newcome |editor=Edward Robinson |title=A harmony of the Gospels in Greek, in the general order of Le Clere &amp; Newcome, with Newcome's notes: Printed from the text and with the various readings of Knapp |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_harmony_of_the_Gospels_in_Greek_in_the.html?id=04bNAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Gould and Newman |year=1834}}

'''Heritage science''' is cross-disciplinary scientific research of [[cultural heritage]]. It encompasses research enabling access to [[cultural heritage]], its [[Art conservation|conservation]], [[Interpretation (aesthetics)|interpretation]] and [[management]].

The term has become widely used after 2006 when it became increasingly evident that the more traditional terms [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]] or preservation science inadequately reflected the breadth of research into [[cultural heritage]]. Heritage scientists in museums, galleries, libraries, archives, universities and research institutions support conservation (often called [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]]), access (e.g. development of new [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] tools), interpretation, including [[archaeometry]] and [[archaeological science]] (e.g. dating, [[Provenance|provenancing]], attribution), heritage management (e.g. development of tools and knowledge supporting strategic or environmental management decisions) and wider societal engagement with heritage (e.g. heritage [[Value (ethics)|values and ethics]]). Heritage science is also an excellent vehicle for public engagement with science as well as heritage.

Heritage science is seen as "key to the long-term sustainability of heritage: it is about managing change and risk and maximising social, cultural and economic benefit not just today, but in such a way that we can pass on to future generations that which we have inherited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldsctech/256/256.pdf |format=PDF |title=Science and Technology Committee : Science and Heritage |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domains of research, where heritage science makes a particular input were recognised to be museums, galleries, libraries and archives; the built historic environment and archaeology, by the United Kingdom National Heritage Science Strategy documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescienceforum.org.uk/strategy.php | title=UK National Heritage Science Strategy | accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
[[File:Red Rot Leather.jpg|right|thumbnail|Red rot on leather bindings was one of the first conservation issues to excite scientists.]]
The field still requires its literature canon and opinions on whether heritage science is a domain in its own right or a field of research diverge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5SpIq80XpU | title=Round Table discussion on the Future of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this appears a matter of academic recognition, rather than a matter of research practice.

Heritage science is an old field of research: in his [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] in 1843, [[Michael Faraday]] already pointed out how pollution importantly contributes to book degradation. The following premises appear to be of defining importance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heritagescienceresearch.wordpress.com/2015/11/17/theory_heritagescience/ | title=A Brief Theory of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Heritage science is inherently biased, as scientists, by doing research on heritage, contribute to its value: they create and popularize heritage through their research. 
# Heritage science is neither fundamental nor experimental: work with actual heritage objects, building or sites cannot be repeatable because heritage is not an experiment. On the other hand, the [[scientific method]] and deductive reasoning is easily applied when working with models and model objects, which heritage scientists often do due to the high value of actual historic objects and consequentially, sampling restrictions.

Since the context of heritage is often unknown, there can be any number of variables affecting the heritage system under observation – inductive reasoning is therefore often applied in heritage science. In this aspect, the premise of heritage science comes close to social science.
Heritage that is accessible, in its preserved authentic form or as a (digital) reproduction, is a "resource for economic growth, employment and social cohesion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/library/publications/2014-heritage-communication_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe |publisher=EU |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through improved access, heritage science therefore contributes to well-being. Heritage science is proof that there is no world of [[The Two Cultures|'Two Cultures']]. A scientist, researching heritage defies the existence of the divide: there can be no scientific research of heritage without a contribution by humanities research. Heritage science also successfully bridges science and culture, because it provides an attractive vehicle to convey ideas and concepts related to technology and engineering, as well as culture and society. Heritage science can be considered an anthropogenic analog to environmental geography, which was defined by [[Halford Mackinder]] in 1887 as a discipline that aims to "bridge one of the greatest of all gaps" between "the natural sciences and the study of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacKinder|first=H. J.|date=1887|title=On the Scope and Methods of Geography|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1801248|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography|volume=9|issue=3|pages=141–174|doi=10.2307/1801248}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Research==
[[Image:WoS publications 2015.png|right|thumbnail|Publication trends in the heritage science field, 2005-2014.]]

Heritage science is an increasingly lively science domain. Materials and techniques of the past are often very difficult to study and state-of-the-art techniques and methods need to be employed. Discoveries new to science are often the result of such endeavours, e.g. new antibiotics from bacteria discovered in the [[Cave of Altamira]], in Spain. With its wide definition, heritage science spans a significant variety of scientific activities. In order to support conservation, access, interpretation and management, heritage science must be based on an [[interdisciplinary]] palette of knowledge, from fundamental sciences ([[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[biology]]) to [[arts]] and [[humanities]] (conservation, [[archaeology]], [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[history]], [[art history]] etc.), including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[computer science]]s and [[engineering]].

In academia, heritage science is often performed by scientists spending a proportion of their time on heritage-related research. The academic field, judged by the number of academic outputs published annually, is steadily increasing. This could be taken to estimate the domain size – with the number of outputs in 2014 being 6,800 (Source: Web of Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ |title=ISI Web of Knowledge |publisher=Images.isiknowledge.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it could be assumed that there are about 3,000 heritage scientists active in the field (publishing on average 2 academic publications per year). This goes against the generally held view that the field is small.

The proportion per country varies greatly, about 20% of researchers being active in the US, 15% in the UK, 10% in Italy, 5% France, and 5% in China (with a strong increase in the last decade).

Since 2013, the scientific domain has its own flagship journal, ''Heritage Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagesciencejournal.com/ |title=Heritage Science |publisher=Heritagesciencejournal.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Mind the Gap project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/our-role/collection-care/heritage-science-research-and-development/collaborative-working-practices-mind-the-gap/ |title= Mind the gap project |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the UK EPSRC/AHRC Science and Heritage Programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescience.ac.uk/ |title= UK AHRC/EPSRC Science and Heritage Programme |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported on the drivers and impediments in cross-disciplinary research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mind-the-gap-report-jan-2014.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mind the Gap Report |publisher=AHRC |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project found that there is no gap between rigour and relevance in heritage science research but rather that there is a continuum of activity. However, there was less satisfaction with heritage science research in relation to its impact on practice, in comparison to its academic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagesciencejournal.com/content/2/1/11 |title= Mind the gap: rigour and relevance in collaborative heritage science research |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:SEAHA Mobile Heritage Lab.jpg|thumbnail|The SEAHA Mobile Heritage Laboratory for field research and public engagement with science and heritage.]]
The heritage science career paths are various. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of heritage science, any academic background is suitable, from [[formal sciences]], [[natural sciences]] to [[social sciences]]. 
Most researchers have entered the field by carrying out doctoral research in the field, which is due to the fact that there is currently no undergraduate course in this domain. Since 2010, Master's degree courses in heritage science have become available at [[University College London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/heritage/programmes/mres-msc/mres-seaha |title=Heritage Science Masters at UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Queens University Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/gap/ProspectiveStudents/PostgraduateStudies/GraduateStudiesTaught/HeritageScience/ |title=Heritage Science Masters at Queens University, Belfast |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, students can obtain undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in conservation science at the [[University of Florence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unifi.it/p-cor2-2016-101227-B194-GEN-1-1.html|title=Offerta formativa - Università degli Studi di Firenze - UniFI|website=www.unifi.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Bologna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://corsi.unibo.it/SCIENCEFORCONSERVATION/Pages/default.aspx|title=Two year master in Science for the conservation-restoration of cultural heritage - Ravenna - Università di Bologna|website=corsi.unibo.it|language=en|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a recently created programme at the [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice|University of Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unive.it/pag/20740/|title=Summary: Master's Degree Programme in Conservation Science and Technology for Cultural Heritage - Ca' Foscari|website=www.unive.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other universities in Italy have faculty members whose primary research focus is in heritage science; these groups often accept international students who would like to obtain a PhD in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scich.it/index.html|title=COLOMBINI GROUP - Chemical Science for the Safeguard of Cultural Heritage|website=www.scich.it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?oscar.chiantore#profilo|title=Prof. Oscar Chiantore - Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Scienza dei Materiali - Università degli Studi di Torino|last=Torino|first=Università degli Studi di|website=scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taught courses in heritage science programmes include elements of heritage science, e.g. technical art history is often part of [[art history]] courses, and [[natural sciences]] are often taught in conservation courses. [[Brandenburg University of Technology]] in Germany offers the international Master's programme World Heritage Studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/en/heritage-studies-phd/|title=World Heritage Studies, Master of Arts|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PhD programme Heritage Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/worldheritage-ma/|title=PhD Programme Heritage Studies|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[University College London|UCL]], [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Brighton]], the Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology ([http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ SEAHA]) was established in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ |title=Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key aspect of the SEAHA scheme is the collaborative nature of projects, enabling partnerships between academic institutions, industry and national heritage agencies and giving an applied focus to the research training.

Since the field requires significant cross-disciplinary and transferrable skills, graduates may be able to take jobs in industry and academia. To work within the field of heritage science (e.g. in a museum laboratory), a PhD in the physical sciences and significant experience in a museum or conservation studio is typically required.

'''Historic paint analysis''' is the [[scientific analysis]] of [[architectural coatings|architectural finishes]], including not only [[paint]]s but also metallic finishes and clear and translucent finishes used on historic [[building]]s. The primary purpose of such analysis is to determine the color of the finish used at a particular time in the building's history, usually the original construction, but not always. Secondary purposes include determination of ingredients such as media ([[water]], [[oil]], [[latex]], etc.) and [[pigments]] (organic pigments, inorganic pigments, [[dyes]], etc.). Paint analysis is also used at times as a dating technique for various building elements.

Typical problems encountered in historic paint analysis include such things as paint loss, surface deterioration, newer materials, substrates, delamination, media and pigment deterioration, and alligatoring.

==History==
Historic [[architectural]] paint analysis finds its roots in the early twentieth century in the United States. The historic preservation movement began in 1849 with the preservation of [[Mount Vernon]], the home of [[George Washington]].  Early [[preservationist]]s began to realize that paints and finishes which had survived were very important but may not have been the original, or historic, finishes.  Interest in historic wallpapers also developed with the interest in historic paint and color. One of the earliest endeavors came with the restoration of [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] funded by [[John D. Rockefeller]] in the 1920s. Early investigations by simple scraping of the finishes by Susan Nash&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jr.,Thomas H., and Papas, Jr., Nicholas A. "Colonial Williamsburg Colors: A Changing Spectrum". In Paint in America: The Colors of Historic Buildings, Roger W. Moss, ed. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1994&lt;/ref&gt; of the surviving original buildings  yielded a palette that became popularly known as Williamsburg colors. 

In the 1950s and 1960s serious efforts at investigating original paint colors were underway at [[Independence National Historical Park]] in Philadelphia by architect Penelope Hartshorne Batcheler.  Her pioneering efforts introduced, for the first time in this country, the use of a stereo microscope to more closely examine the 18th century paints at [[Independence Hall]].  Batcheler also introduced the use of the [[Munsell Color System]] for matching and referencing original paint colors.  Her landmark publication, "Paint Color Research and Restoration", was the very first publication concerning the analysis of historic architectural paints for determination of original colors. At the same time, in the [[United Kingdom]], microscopy of paint samples was developed by Joyce Plesters of the [[National Gallery, London]] who worked mainly with easel paintings but also with samples from wall-paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Plesters, 'Cross-sections &amp; Chemical Analysis of Paint Samples', ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 2, (1956), 110-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and early 1970s [[Morgan W. Phillips]] at the [[Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities]] (SPNEA) became involved with historic paint and color analysis, specifically at the Harrison Gray Otis House in Boston. At the same time, E. Blaine Cliver, Historical Architect, who originally worked with Batcheler at the National Park Service (NPS) in Philadelphia, then with the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] in Washington, DC and later at the Northeast Regional Office of the NPS, became involved with historic paint analysis, especially in a laboratory in Building 28 of the former [[Boston Navy Yard]]. In the early 1970s, [[Frank S. Welsh]] joined the NPS in Philadelphia and began his research and study of historic paints with Penelope Batcheler, where he introduced the use of the National Bureau of Standards Color Name Charts, ([[NIST]]) for naming the colors matched to the Munsell Color System.  Welsh also was the first to introduce the term "paint analysis" into the lexicon of historic preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, Frank S. "Paint &amp; Color Restoration," ''The Old-House Journal'', Vol. 3, No. 8, August, 1975. 1,8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; As an independent historic paint color consultant one of his first major projects was [[Monticello]], the home of [[Thomas Jefferson]].  In the mid 1970s, Matthew J. Mosca started working for the National Trust with Blaine Cliver.  Later, as a preservation consultant, Mosca researched the historic colors of [[Mount Vernon]].

The advances in the science of paint color research by these individuals suggested that the popular Williamsburg colors had been matched to faded and aged finishes. During the 1980s and 1990s [[Colonial Williamsburg]] consulted with Welsh to undertake a comprehensive paint and color analysis on numerous buildings in the historic area.&lt;ref&gt; Taylor, Jr., Thomas H. and Pappas, Nicholas A., "Colonial Williamsburg: A Changing Spectrum," in ''Paint in America: The Colors of Historic Building''s, Roger W. Moss, ed. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1994, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his research, "the first modern scientific paint analysis" there, confirmed that the Williamsburg color palette did not represent the actual historic colors.  In addition he found that in many cases their early efforts had mistakenly matched later paint layers, some nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jr.,Thomas H., and Papas, Jr., Nicholas A. 'Colonial Williamsburg Colors: A Changing Spectrum,' in, ''Paint in America: The Colors of Historic Buildings'', Roger W. Moss, ed. (New York, John Wiley, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, paint analysis was done on site by carefully removing later paint layers to reveal a sequence of finishes down to the substrate. This was the methodology employed during the early restoration of finishes at Historic Williamsburg. Although this method is employed by a few practitioners, it is not common because of its inherent problems of misinterpretation and failure to address issues such as paint ageing and discoloration.&lt;ref&gt;see the following paper: Patrick Baty [http://www.papers-paints.co.uk/scrapes.htm “To Scrape or Not to Scrape”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120185948/http://www.papers-paints.co.uk/scrapes.htm |date=2008-11-20 }} for the drawbacks of carrying out a scrape.  This was originally published in ''Traditional Paint News'' vol.1, no.2. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Because finishes analysis is performed under laboratory conditions samples are collected in the field for later analysis and can be collected by the analyst or by his client who then ships them to him.

==Laboratory analysis==
The primary purposes of analysis are to determine historic finishes and to determine principle components such as media or basic pigments. There are two methodologies in the preparation of paint samples for microscopic analysis. The first, which is derived from the medical world, is to treat the sample as a specimen and set it into a fixed position in a permanent medium such as [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]]. The specimen is then ground to a flat finish, providing a horizontal surface for viewing under a microscope. The second is to leave the samples in a loose condition with their broken surfaces which then can be manipulated under the microscope to permit a variety of views of the layers. The primary disadvantage to the first method is that the grinding process tends to blur layers together, especially layers of similar or identical colors. It also provide only a single, fixed point of viewing. The second method lacks these disadvantages, although skill and experience is required to manipulate the samples effectively.

Following preparation of the samples, they are typically viewed under an optical microscope using either natural north light or [[Polarized light|polarized artificial light]] simulating natural north light. North light is essential in order to render the colors accurately without the effects of the yellow spectrum of direct sunlight. Each individual layer is identified and, typically, matched to the [[Munsell color system]]. The Munsell color system is a scientific system in which colors have been ranged into a color fan based upon three attributes: [[hue]] or color, the chroma or [[color saturation]], and the value or neutral [[Lightness (color)|lightness]] or darkness. Unlike color systems developed by paint manufacturers, the Munsell system provides an unchanging standard of reference which is unaffected by the marketplace and changing tastes in colors.

The hue notation, the color, indicates the relation of the sample to a visually equally spaced scale of 100 hues. There are 10 major hues, five principal and five intermediate within this scale. The hues are identified by initials indicating the central member of the group: red R, yellow-red YR, yellow Y, yellow-green YG, green G, blue-green BG, blue B, purple-blue PB, purple P, and red-purple PR. The hues in each group are identified by the numbers 1 to 10. The most purplish of the red hues, 1 on the scale of 100, is designated as 1R, the most yellowish as 10R, and the central hue as 5R. The hue 10R can also be expressed as 10, 5Y as 25, and so forth if a notation of the hue as a number is desired. Chroma indicates the degree of departure of a given hue from the neutral gray axis of the same value. It is the strength of saturation of color from neutral gray, written /0 to /14 or further for maximum color saturation.

Value, or lightness, makes up the neutral gray axis of the color wheel, ranging from black, number 1, to white at the top of the axis, number 10. A visual value can be approximated by the help of the neutral gray chips of the Rock or Soil Color chart with ten intervals. The color parameters can be expressed with figures semi-quantitatively as: hue, value/chroma (H, V/C). The color "medium red" should serve as an example for presentation with the three color attributes, 5R 5.5/6. This means that 5R is located in the middle of the red hue, 5.5 is the lightness of Munsell value near the middle between light and dark, and 6 is the degree of the Munsell chroma, or the color saturation, which is about in the middle of the saturation scale.

'''Historical archaeology''' is a form of [[archaeology]] dealing with places, things, and issues from the past or present when written records and oral traditions can inform and contextualize cultural material. These records can both complement and conflict with the archaeological evidence found at a particular site. Studies focus on literate, historical-period societies as opposed to non-literate, [[prehistory|prehistoric]] societies. While they may not have generated the records, the lives of people for whom there was little need for written records, such as the [[working class]], slaves, indentured labourers, and children but who live in the historical period can also be the subject of study. The sites are found on land and underwater. [[Industrial archaeology]], unless practiced at industrial sites from the prehistoric era, is a form of historical archaeology concentrating on the remains and products of industry and the Industrial era.

==Definition==
According to the overall definition given here based on methodological and theoretical aspects [[classical archaeology]] or [[egyptology]] as well as [[medieval archaeology]] are disciplines of historical archaeology. In practice however – mainly in the Americas – historical archaeology refers to the modern, post-1492 period, which in Europe is often referred to as [[postmedieval archaeology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25130">Various aspects of communication have been the subject of study since ancient times, and the approach eventually developed into the academic discipline known today as communication studies.

==Pre-20th century==
In ancient [[Greece]] and Rome, the study of [[rhetoric]], the art of [[Eloquence|oratory]] and [[persuasion]], was a vital subject for [[student]]s. One significant ongoing debate was whether one could be an effective speaker in a base cause ([[Sophists]]) or whether excellent rhetoric came from the excellence of the orator's character ([[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]]). Through the European Middle Ages and [[Renaissance]] [[grammar]], rhetoric, and [[logic]] constituted the entire [[trivium (education)|trivium]], the base of the system of classical learning in Europe.

Communication has existed since the beginning of human beings, but it was not until the 20th century that people began to study the process. As communication technologies developed, so did the serious study of communication. When World War I ended, the interest in studying communication intensified. The social-science study was fully recognized as a legitimate discipline after World War II.

Before becoming simply communication, or communication studies, the discipline was formed from three other major studies: psychology, sociology, and political science.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson D. Pooley, “The New History of Mass Communication Research,” in History of Media and Communication Research: Contested Memories, edited with David Park (New York: Peter Lang, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Communication studies focus on communication as central to the human experience, which involves understanding how people behave in creating, exchanging, and interpreting messages.

== United States ==

=== 1900s–20s ===
Though the study of communication reaches back to antiquity and beyond, early twentieth-century work by [[Charles Horton Cooley]], [[Walter Lippmann]], and [[John Dewey]] have been of particular importance for the academic discipline as it stands today. In his 1909 ''Social Organization: a Study of the Larger Mind'', Cooley defines communication as "the mechanism through which human relations exist and develop—all the symbols of the mind, together with the means of conveying them through space and preserving them in time." This view gave processes of communication a central and constitutive place in the study of social relations. ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]'', published in 1922 by Walter Lippmann, couples this view with a fear that the rise of new technologies in mass communication allowed for the 'manufacture of consent,' and generated dissonance between what he called 'the world outside and the pictures in our heads,' referring to the rift between the idealized concept of democracy and its reality. John Dewey's 1927 ''[[The Public and its Problems]]'' drew on the same view of communications, but instead took a more optimistic reform agenda, arguing famously that "communication can alone create a great community," as well as "of all affairs, communication is the most wonderful."

Cooley, Lippmann, and Dewey capture themes like the central importance of communication in social life, the impact of changing technology upon culture, and questions regarding the relationship between communication, democracy, and community. These concepts continue to drive scholars today. Many of these concerns are also central to the work of writers such as [[Gabriel Tarde]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]], who have also made significant contributions to the field.

In 1925, Herbert A. Wichelns published the essay "The Literary Criticism of Oratory" in the book ''Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James Albert Winans.''&lt;ref&gt;Herbert A. Wichelns, "The Literary Criticism of Oratory," in ''Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James Albert Winans'' (New York: The Century Co., 1925), 181–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Wicheln's essay attempted to "put rhetorical studies on par with literary studies as an area of academic interest and research."&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Medhurst, "The Academic Study of Public Address: A Tradition in Transition," in ''Landmark Essays in American Public Address,'' ed. Martin J. Medhurst (Hermagoras Press 1993), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Wichelns wrote that oratory should be taken as seriously as literature, and therefore, it should be subject to criticism and analysis. Although the essay is now standard reading in most rhetorical criticism courses, it had little immediate impact (from 1925–1935) on the field of rhetorical studies.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Medhurst, "The Academic Study of Public Address: A Tradition in Transition," in ''Landmark Essays in American Public Address,'' ed. Martin J. Medhurst (Hermagoras Press 1993), p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1930s–50s===
The institutionalization of communication studies in U.S. higher education and research has often been traced to [[Columbia University]], the [[University of Chicago]], and the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]], where early pioneers such as [[Paul F. Lazarsfeld]], [[Harold Lasswell]], and [[Wilbur Schramm]] worked.  The work of Samuel Silas Curry, who founded the School of Expression in 1879 in Boston, is also noted in early communication research.  Today, the School of Expression is known as Curry College, located in Milton, MA, which houses one of the nation's oldest Communication programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curry.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bureau of Applied Social Research]] was established in 1944 at Columbia University by Paul F. Lazarsfeld. It was a continuation of the Rockefeller Foundation-funded Radio Project that he had led at various institutions (University of Newark, Princeton) from 1937, which had been at Columbia as the Office of Radio Research since 1939. In its various incarnations, the Radio Project had involved Lazarsfeld himself, and people like Adorno, [[Hadley Cantril]], [[Herta Herzog]], Gordon Allport, and [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]] (who went on to be president of CBS). Lazarsfeld and the Bureau mobilized substantial sums for research, and produced, with various co-authors, a series of books and edited volumes that helped define the discipline, such as ''Personal Influence'' (1955) which remains a classic in what is called the 'media effects'-tradition.

From the 1940s and onwards, the University of Chicago was home to several committees and commissions on communications, as well as programs that educated communication scholars. In contrast to what took place at Columbia, these programs explicitly claimed the name 'communications' for themselves. The Committee on Communication and Public Opinion, also funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, was staffed with, in addition to Lasswell, people such as [[Douglas Waples]], [[Samuel A. Stouffer]], [[Louis Wirth]], and [[Herbert Blumer]], all of whom held positions elsewhere at the university. They formed a committee that essentially served as a scholarly and educational extension of the federal government's increasing interest in communications during times of war, particularly the [[Office of War Information]]. Chicago later provided an institutional home for The Hutchins Commission on the Freedom of the Press and the Committee on Communication (1947–1960). The latter was a degree-granting program that counted [[Elihu Katz]], [[Bernard Berelson]], [[Edward Shils]], and [[David Riesman]] amongst its faculty, alumni include [[Herbert J. Gans]] and Michael Gurevitch. The committee also produced publications such as Berelson and [[Morris Janowitz|Janowitz]]' ''Public Opinion and Communication'' (1950) and the journal ''Studies in Public Communication''.

The Institute for Communications Research was founded at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1947 by Wilbur Schramm, who was a key figure in the post-war institutionalization of communication studies in the U.S. Like the various Chicago committees, the Illinois program claimed the name 'communications' and granted graduate degrees in the subject. Schramm, who, in contrast to the more social science-inspired figures at Columbia and Chicago, had a background in English literature, developed communication studies partly by merging existing programs in speech communication, rhetoric, and, especially, journalism under the aegis of communication. He also edited a textbook ''The Process and Effects of Mass Communication'' (1954) that helped define the field, partly by claiming Lazarsfeld, Lasswell, [[Carl Hovland]], and [[Kurt Lewin]] as its founding fathers. He also wrote several other manifestos for the discipline, including ''The Science of Human Communication'' 1963. Schramm established three important communication institutes: the Institute of Communications Research (University of Illinois), the Institute for Communication Research (Stanford University), and the East-West Communication Institute (Honolulu). Many of Schramm's students, such as [[Everett Rogers]], went on to make important contributions of their own.

=== 1950s===
Universities combined scholars of speech and mass media together under the term communication, which turned out to be a difficult process. While east coast universities did not see human communication as an important area for research, the field grew in the midwest. The first college of communication was founded at Michigan State University in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E. (2001). The department of communication at Michigan State University as a seed institution for communication course. Communication Studies, 52, 234–248.&lt;/ref&gt; led by scholars from Schramm's original ICR and dedicated to studying communication scientifically. MSU was soon followed by important departments of communication at [[Purdue University]], [[University of Texas-Austin]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Iowa]], and the [[University of Illinois]].  Walter Annenberg endowed three Schools for Communication at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[The University of Southern California]], and [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simonson and John Durham Peters, "Communication and Media Studies, History to 1968," in International Encyclopedia of Communication, ed. Wolfgang Donsbach, Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media had long been studied by Adorno and his colleagues at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]], but German communication research further expanded rapidly at institutions such as the University of Hamburg, which opened the Hans Bredow Institute for Radio and Television in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Simonson, Peter, and John Durham Peters. "Communication and Media Studies, History to 1968." In International Encyclopedia of Communication, edited by Wolfgang Donsbach. Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations related to Communication Studies were founded or expanded during the 1950s. The National Society for the Study of Communication (NSSC) was founded in 1950 to encourage scholars to pursue communication research as a social science.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Eadie, "Communication as an Academic Field: USA and Canada," in International Encyclopedia of Communication, ed. Wolfgang Donsbach, Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This Association launched the Journal of Communication in the same year as its founding. Like many communication associations founded around this decade, the name of the association changed with the field. In 1968 the name changed to the International Communication Association (ICA).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simonson and John Durham Peters, "Communication and Media Studies, History to 1968," in International Encyclopedia of Communication, ed. Wolfgang Donsbach, Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of what has been called 'medium theorists', arguably defined by [[Harold Innis]]' (1950) ''Empire and Communications'' grew increasingly important, and was popularized by [[Marshall McLuhan]] in his ''Understanding Media'' (1964). “McLuhan recognized that the evolution of communication played a crucial role in the human historical development and that social changes following the World Wars were directly connected with the rising of electrical communication technologies, which contributed in transforming the world into a ‘global village.’” &lt;ref&gt;Paolo Magaudda, "Communication Studies," in Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture, ed. Dale Southernton (n.p.: n.p., 2011), [21].&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective informs the later work of [[Joshua Meyrowitz]] (''No Sense of Place'', 1986).

Two developments in the 1940s shifted the paradigm of communication studies in the 1950s and thereafter toward a more quantitative orientation.  One was cybernetics, as formulated by [[Norbert Wiener]] in his ''Cybernetics: Or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine''.&lt;ref&gt;Paris: Librairie Hermann &amp; Cie, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; The other was [[information theory]], as recast in quantitative terms by [[Claude E. Shannon]] and [[Warren Weaver]] in their ''Mathematical Theory of Communication''.&lt;ref&gt;Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1949. {{ISBN|0-252-72548-4}}. Shannon &amp; Weaver's seminal work, which had developed during [[World War II]], originally appeared during 1948 in ''Bell System Technical Journal 27'', 379–423 (July) and 623–656 (October).&lt;/ref&gt; These works were widely appropriated to, and offered for some the prospect of, a general theory of society.

The tradition of [[critical theory]] associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] was, as in Europe, an important source of influence for many researchers. While done out of sociology departments, the work of [[Jürgen Habermas]], the US-based [[Leo Löwenthal]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Siegfried Kracauer]], as well as earlier figures like Adorno and [[Max Horkheimer]] continued to inform a whole tradition of cultural criticism that often focused both empirically and theoretically on the [[culture industry]].

In 1953, to address growing needs in the industry, [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] began offering a [[master of science]] degree in [[technical writing]]. In the 1960s the degree title became [[technical communication]]. It was the brainchild of longtime RPI professor and administrator Jay R. Gould.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard David Ramsey]]. (1990). The life and work of Jay R. Gould. ''Journal of Technical Writing and Communication 20'', 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 1950’s [[Bernard Berelson]] remarked that the field of communication was becoming too disjointed and argued that the field was dying with no new ideas or directions. This is “often referred to as his obituary for communication research.” &lt;ref&gt;Lisa Mullikin Parcell, "Communication and Media Studies, History Since 1968," in International Encyclopedia of Communication, ed. Wolfgang Donsbach, Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, new developments in media technology helped advance the field.

Other advances in communication studies came from the United States Information Agency and the work of Paul R. Conroy, USIA's Chief of Professional Training. As Dr. Conroy detailed in Antioch Review in 1958 &lt;ref&gt; Paul R. Conroy, "On Giving a Good Account of Ourselves," The Antioch Review, Vol. 18, No 4 (Winter 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;, USIA's program to help State Department employees and other personnel position the U.S. in the best possible light helped codify -- in a training environment focused on mock news conferences and other role-playing encounters -- now commonly-accepted media training, crisis communication, and interpersonal communication principles. 

Dr. Conroy was among the first to focus on principles of real-time message delivery - rather than simply message development - and the first to format such principles in a large-scale and repeatable training curriculum on the scale of USIA's global training program for its personnel.  "It is not enough to have a clear concept of the message," Dr. Conroy summarized in Antioch Review, "Communication, after all, is an art. And since any art usually requires practice in the skilled application of sound techniques, it is better if the practice is guided rather than haphazard."

=== 1960s===
In the 1960s, Gould and his colleagues experienced increasing demand for doctoral-level studies in technical and business communication.  As a result, in 1965 RPI began its Ph.D. program in communication and rhetoric.  This Ph.D. degree program became a prototype for other technologically oriented programs in the United States and other industrialized countries.

The 1960s and 1970s saw the development of [[cultivation theory]], pioneered by [[George Gerbner]] at the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania]]. This approach shifted emphasis from the short-term effects that had been the central interest of many earlier media studies, and instead tried to track the effects of exposure across time.

In the early 1960s Communication Studies began to move towards a more independent field, and move out of the departments of [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], and [[English language|English]]. The changes in the department are considered a result of the historical events taking place at the time. “Despite the different interpretations given to the changes around the time of World War II, mostly shaped by increasing technological innovations in the ways people communicate, communication became a relevant and recurrent issue in human and social science, opening the doors to the centrality of communication in social theories in the 1960s and 1970s.” &lt;ref&gt;Magaudda, "Communication Studies," in Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture, [22].&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of many of these sociological changes taking place in society, communication and mass media acquired the role of explaining these changes to the public. In response to the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Vietnam War]], and other dramatic cultural shifts, critics using [[Cultural Marxism|Marxist]] and [[feminist theory]] to study dominant cultures became prominent in scholarly conversations. [[Cultural Studies]] related to mass media and critics asked why a number of big organizations had such an influence on society.

The political turmoil of the 1960s worked to the field’s advantage because mass media scholars began to explore the influence that media had on culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;Parcell, "Communication and Media Studies," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  “Growing recognition of the importance of the media by both industry and the public, as well as increasing respect for the field at the university leveled to increased support for new scholarship.” &lt;ref&gt;Parcell, "Communication and Media Studies," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, national and international communications conferences started to be held and associations such as the Speech Association of America (now [[National Communication Association]]) and [[International Communication Association]] (ICA) increased membership. With each year that passed, the number of communication journals published grew rapidly and by 1970 there were nearly one hundred of them published. After 1968, communication studies started to mature into its own discipline and gained respect in developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;Simonson and Peters, "Communication and Media Studies," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s–80s===
The Journal of Communication referred to the 1970s as a “time of ferment, particularly in the speech field. As social scientists pushed for recognition of ‘communication’ as the dominant term, rhetorical and performance scholars reconsidered and redefined their theories and methodologies.” &lt;ref&gt;Eadie, "Communication as an Academic," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  Speech Criticism combined with other sectors such as journalism and broadcasting to form of Communication Studies. In addition to the subgroups of the field making changes, national associations frequently changed their formal names to adapt to the growing field of communication. For example, in 1970 the Speech Association of America became the Speech Communication Association.&lt;ref&gt;Eadie, "Communication as an Academic," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; Radio and television continued to develop throughout the 1970s and this boom in diversity “forced scholars to adopt a more convergent model of communication.” &lt;ref&gt;Parcell, "Communication and Media Studies," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no longer only one source for each message and there was almost always more than one path from sender to receiver. 
	
[[Neil Postman]] founded the [[media ecology]] program at [[New York University]] in 1971. Media ecologists draw on a wide range of inspirations in their attempts to study media environments in an even broader and more culturally-driven fashion. This perspective is the basis of a separate professional association, the Media Ecology Association.

In 1972, [[Maxwell McCombs]] and [[Donald Shaw (academic)|Donald Shaw]] published a groundbreaking article that offered an [[agenda-setting theory]] that paved a new conception of short-term effects of the media. This approach, organized around additional ideas such as framing, priming, and gatekeeping, has been highly influential, especially in the study of political communication and news coverage.

The 1970s also saw the development of what became known as [[uses and gratifications]] theory, developed by scholars such as Elihu Katz, [[Jay G. Blumler]], and Michael Gurevitch. Instead of seeing audiences as passive entities experiencing effects from a one-way model (sender to receiver), they are analyzed through the paradigm of actively seeking out content based on their own pre-existing communication needs.

In 1980 the [[US Department of Education]] classified “communication” as a practical discipline, which was associated primarily with learning journalism and media production. The same classification system deemed speech and rhetorical studies a subcategory of English.&lt;ref&gt;Eadie, "Communication as an Academic," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
By the 1980s many colleges and universities across the country decided to rename departments to include the word “communication” in the department title. Other schools began titling their departments [[Mass Communication]], or created independent communication departments. “Often these new schools merge the professional fields of print, broadcast, public relations, advertising, information science, and speech with growing research programs more broadly defined communication research.” &lt;ref&gt;Eadie, "Communication as an Academic," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  From this point in time communication studies began to gain recognition in schools worldwide.

Written by S. F. Scudder in the early 1900s, and later published in 1980, "The Universal Communication Law" states that, "All living entities, beings and creatures communicate." In an unpublished interview, Scudder clarified the concept - "All of the living communicate through movements, sounds, reactions, physical changes, gestures, languages, breath, color transformations, etc. Communication is a means of survival, existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge its presence. Examples - the cry of a child (communication that it is hungry, hurt, cold, etc.); the browning of a leaf (communication that it is dehydrated, thirsty per se, dying); the cry of an animal (communicating that it is injured, hungry, angry, etc.). Everything living communicates." [[citation needed]]

==Germany==
Communication studies in Germany has a rich hermeneutic heritage in philology, textual interpretation, and historical studies. The post-World War II era, however, has seen the rise of a number of new paradigms.

[[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]] pioneered work on the [[spiral of silence]] in a tradition that has been widely influential across the world and has proven to be easily compatible with the dominant paradigms in, for instance, the United States.

In the 1970s, [[Karl Deutsch]] came to [[West Germany]], and his [[cybernetics]] inspired work has been widely influential there as elsewhere.

The work of the Frankfurt School has been a cornerstone of much German work on communication, in addition to Horkheimer, Adorno, and Habermas, figures like [[Oskar Negt]] and [[Alexander Kluge]] has been important in the development of this strand of thought.

An important competing paradigm has been the systems theory developed by [[Niklas Luhmann]] and his students.

Finally, from the 1980s and onwards, theorists like [[Friedrich Kittler]] have led the development of a 'new German medium theory', aligned partly with the Canadian medium theory of Innis and McLuhan and partly with [[post-structuralism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2124">The '''Information Security Automation Program''' ('''ISAP''', pronounced “I Sap”) is a U.S. government multi-agency initiative to enable automation and standardization of technical security operations. While a U.S. government initiative, its standards based design can benefit all information technology security operations. The ISAP high level goals include standards based automation of security checking and remediation as well as automation of technical compliance activities (e.g. [[FISMA]]). ISAP’s low level objectives include enabling standards based communication of vulnerability data, customizing and managing configuration baselines for various IT products, assessing information systems and reporting compliance status, using standard metrics to weight and aggregate potential vulnerability impact, and remediating identified vulnerabilities.

ISAP’s technical specifications are contained in the related [[Security Content Automation Protocol]] (SCAP). ISAP’s security automation content is either contained within, or referenced by, the [[National Vulnerability Database]]. 

ISAP is being formalized through a trilateral memorandum of agreement (MOA) between [[Defense Information Systems Agency]] (DISA), the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST).  The [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]] (OSD) also participates and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) funds the operation infrastructure on which ISAP relies (i.e., the National Vulnerability Database).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">The '''Institute of Nautical Archaeology''' (INA) is the world’s oldest organization devoted to the study of humanity’s interaction with the sea through the practice of [[archaeology]].  INA’s founder [[George Bass (archeologist)|Dr. George Bass]] pioneered the science of underwater excavation in the 1960s through work at [[Cape Gelidonya]] and other ancient shipwreck sites off the coast of Turkey.  Since then, INA has expanded its scope and activities to work globally on shipwrecks and submerged sites and worked with [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in [[College Station, Texas]] to establish the [[Nautical Archaeology Program]] there.  Hundreds of archaeologists have received their training at Texas A&amp;M and today, after more than three decades of the Nautical Archaeology Program’s existence, many of the world’s leading scholars have received their degrees from Texas A&amp;M.

INA is a not-for-profit group founded in 1973.  Today it has members all over the world, and counts among them professional archaeologists, students, and many others from all walks of life.  INA’s members are interested in seeking out lost ships, and applying the highest standards of science and art to excavating and studying them to unlock their secrets.  They do so to add to humanity’s understanding of seafaring’s role in the development of civilization.  Three-quarters of the earth is covered by water, and in the fabric of human history, the most pervasive thread is our association with the planet’s oceans, rivers and lakes.

The Institute of Nautical Archaeology works for the public to share what nautical archaeologists do, with anyone with an interest.  INA is also committed to the preservation of the world’s shipwrecks and other archaeological sites, but specifically to finding the most significant sites and excavating them to unlock their secrets.

INA’s professional and volunteer members and affiliates have conducted fieldwork in Africa, Asia, Australia, the Americas, and Europe.  They have worked on the world’s oldest known shipwrecks, and on wrecks as recent as [[World War II]].  Their work has improved the understanding of ancient trade in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the development of the ship, shipbuilding in the Ancient World, the saga of European expansion into the New World, and wars for the control of the Americas.

[[Image:Leo Mechelin 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Leo Mechelin]]
'''Leopold (Leo) Henrik Stanislaus Mechelin''' (24 November 1839 in [[Hamina]], Finland – 26 January 1914 in [[Helsinki]], Finland) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] professor, statesman, senator and [[Liberalism|liberal]] reformer. A leading defender of the [[autonomy]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], and of the rights of women and minorities, Mechelin's 1905–1908 government
("Mechelin's Senate") made Finland the first nation in the world with the [[Universal suffrage|universal right to vote]] and to be elected. During his period in office the freedom of [[freedom of expression|expression]], the [[freedom of press|press]], and of [[freedom of assembly|assembly]] were introduced.

==Career==
He also founded the [[Liberal Party of Finland]] (1880–1885), wrote its program, was one of the founders of the Union Bank of Finland 1862 (now part of Nordea Bank) and co-founded the [[Nokia|Nokia Company]] (1871) with [[Fredrik Idestam]], was the first chairman of the [[town council]] of [[Helsinki]] (1875–1876 and 1892–1899) and an internationally respected expert on politology and member of peace movement. Emperor Alexander II ennobled Mechelin 1876.

Mechelin led the passive resistance in Finland during the [[Russification of Finland|first period of oppression]] (1899–1905) until and even after his banishment (1903), from which officials had to let him return as a member of parliament (House of Nobles) 1904, welcomed by a celebrating crowd of 10,000 people. In a secret meeting of the [[Kagaali]], Mechelin had written a petition against the draft of Finns to the Russian army, which collected almost 500,000 signatures. His coalition, the Constitutionals, managed to end the draft through boycott.

==Biography==
[[File:Leo Mechelin Bust.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Leo Mechelin's bust in [[Helsinki]].]]
Born in [[Hamina]] in 1839, the son of Gustaf Johan Mechelin and Amanda Gustava Costiander, Leo Mechelin studied at the [[University of Helsinki]], gaining his [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree|Master's]] degree's in [[Philosophy]] in 1860, a bachelor's degree in law in 1864, and a [[Licentiate (degree)|License]] and [[Doctorate]] in 1873.

As professor of jurisdiction and politology 1874-82, Mechelin had argued that the tsars were bound by the [[Swedish Constitution of 1772|old constitutional laws]] from the time of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] rule of Finland (before 1809), and hence affirmed that Finland was a separate, constitutional state, which the tsar could only rule by law, whereas in Russia he had absolute power. During the periods of oppression, the tsar tried to impose unconstitutional laws, which Mechelin opposed. The [[Russian Revolution of 1905|unrests in Russia]] and [[Finnish general strike of 1905|Finland]] (1905) finally compelled the tsar to comply with the [[November Manifesto]] written by Mechelin. This allowed Mechelin to form a government (1905–1908) and to transform Finland into what was in many respects the first [[liberal democracy]] (e.g., in [[New Zealand]] women already had the right to vote but not to be voted; in [[Australia]] only white people had those rights) in 1906. In 1907, the first universal elections to the one-chamber [[Parliament of Finland|parliament]] ("eduskunta") were held, and 19 of its 200 first members were women. However, the constitutionals of all parties did not obtain the majority of seats, and the tsar realised that he could carry on with the oppression, starting the [[Russification of Finland|second period of oppression]] (1908–1917). After Mechelin's death (in 1914), the two revolutions in Russia allowed  Finland to declare its independence (1917) and Mechelin's younger co-workers were able to complete his work.

[[Nokia]], once a world-leading [[mobile phone]] corporation, was founded by Mechelin and his student days' roommate [[Fredrik Idestam]] as a [[forestry]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=HugmyrqibtwC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=leo+mechelin+and+nokia&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit75W7ydbVAhXGWBQKHe7YDoYQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=leo%20mechelin%20and%20nokia&amp;f=false|title=Wireless Horizon: Strategy and Competition in the Worldwide Mobile Marketplace|last=Steinbock|first=Dan|date=2003|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|isbn=9780814407141|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Mechelin's wish to expand into the electricity business was at first thwarted by Idestam's opposition, but Mechelin managed to convince most shareholders of his plans and became the company chairman (1898–1914), thus being able to realise his visions.

Mechelin was also active in [[civil society]] and President of the current [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] and of the [[Finnish Art Society]]. As a politician he was always highly respected among all parties and citizens, although after the dissolution of the Liberal Party (1885) he never joined any other party.

Mechelin demanded peaceful [[nonviolent resistance]] and did not bend even during hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kansallisbiografia/henkilo/3553 | title = Mechelin, Leo (1839 - 1914) | author = Tapio Helen | date = 1997-09-16 | publisher = Biografiakeskus | access-date = 2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mechanical engineering''' is the discipline that applies [[engineering]], [[Branches of physics|physics]], [[engineering mathematics]], and [[materials science]] principles to [[design]], analyze, manufacture, and maintain [[mechanical system]]s.  It is one of the oldest and broadest of the [[List of engineering branches|engineering disciplines]].

The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including [[mechanics]], [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]], [[thermodynamics]], [[materials science]], [[structural analysis]], and [[electricity]].  In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM), and [[product life cycle management]] to design and analyze [[manufacturing plants]], [[industrial equipment]] and [[industrial machinery|machinery]], [[HVAC|heating and cooling systems]], [[transport]] systems, [[aircraft]], [[watercraft]], [[robotics]], [[medical devices]], [[weapons]], and others.  It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of [[machine]]ry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mechanical engineering "mechanical engineering"]. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved: 19 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mechanical%20engineering "mechanical engineering"]. Webster dictionary. Retrieved: 19 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Europe in the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world.  In the 19th century, developments in [[physics]] led to the development of mechanical engineering science. The field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in such areas as [[composite material|composites]], [[mechatronics]], and [[nanotechnology]].  It also overlaps with [[aerospace engineering]], [[metallurgical engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], and other engineering disciplines to varying amounts.  Mechanical engineers may also work in the field of [[biomedical engineering]], specifically with [[biomechanics]], [[transport phenomena]], [[biomechatronics]], [[bionanotechnology]], and modeling of biological systems.

==History==
The application of mechanical engineering can be seen in the archives of various ancient and medieval societies. In [[ancient Greece]], the works of [[Archimedes]] (287–212 BC) influenced mechanics in the Western tradition and [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]] (c. 10–70 AD) created the first steam engine ([[Aeolipile]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/263417/Heron-of-Alexandria "Heron of Alexandria"]. Encyclopædia Britannica 2010 - Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Accessed: 9 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[History of China#Han Dynasty|China]], [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139 AD) improved a [[water clock]] and invented a [[seismometer]], and [[Ma Jun]] (200–265 AD) invented a chariot with [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears.  The medieval Chinese horologist and engineer [[Su Song]] (1020–1101 AD) incorporated an [[escapement]] mechanism into his [[astronomical]] [[clock tower]] two centuries before escapement devices were found in medieval European clocks. He also invented the world's first known endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4''. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- More sources needed --&gt;

During the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (7th to 15th century), [[Inventions in medieval Islam|Muslim inventors]] made remarkable contributions in the field of mechanical technology. [[Al-Jazari]], who was one of them, wrote his famous ''Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'' in 1206 and presented many mechanical designs. Al-Jazari is also the first known person to create devices such as the [[crankshaft]] and [[camshaft]], which now form the basics of many mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Jazarí. ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices: Kitáb fí ma'rifat al-hiyal al-handasiyya''. Springer, 1973. {{ISBN|9027703299}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, important breakthroughs in the foundations of mechanical engineering occurred in [[England]].  Sir [[Isaac Newton]] formulated [[Newton's Laws of Motion]] and developed [[Calculus]], the mathematical basis of physics. Newton was reluctant to publish his works for years, but he was finally persuaded to do so by his colleagues, such as Sir [[Edmond Halley]], much to the benefit of all mankind. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] is also credited with creating Calculus during this time period.

During the early 19th century industrial revolution, [[machine tool]]s were developed in England, [[Germany]], and [[Scotland]]. This allowed mechanical engineering to develop as a separate field within engineering. They brought with them manufacturing machines and the engines to power them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9105842/engineering Engineering] – Encyclopædia Britannica, accessed 6 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The first British professional society of mechanical engineers was formed in 1847 [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]], thirty years after the civil engineers formed the first such professional society [[Institution of Civil Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Buchanan. The [[Economy|Economic]] History Review, New Series, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Feb. 1985), pp. 42–60.&lt;/ref&gt; On the European continent, Johann von Zimmermann (1820–1901) founded the first factory for grinding machines in [[Chemnitz]], Germany in 1848.

In the United States, the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) was formed in 1880, becoming the third such professional engineering society, after the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (1852) and the [[American Institute of Mining Engineers]] (1871).&lt;ref&gt;[http://anniversary.asme.org/history.shtml ASME history] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223145123/http://anniversary.asme.org/history.shtml |date=23 February 2011 }}, accessed 6 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The first schools in the United States to offer an engineering education were the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1817, an institution now known as [[Norwich University]] in 1819, and [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1825. Education in mechanical engineering has historically been based on a strong foundation in mathematics and science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/en/engineer.html The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001, engineering], accessed 6 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|right|[[Archimedes' screw]] was operated by hand and could efficiently raise water, as the animated red ball demonstrates.]]

Degrees in mechanical engineering are offered at various universities worldwide. Mechanical engineering programs typically take four to five years of study and result in a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (B.Eng. or B.E.), [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc. or B.S.), Bachelor of Science Engineering (B.Sc.Eng.), [[Bachelor of Technology]] (B.Tech.), Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering (B.M.E.), or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] (B.A.Sc.) degree, in or with emphasis in mechanical engineering. In Spain, Portugal and most of South America, where neither B.Sc. nor B.Tech. programs have been adopted, the formal name for the degree is "Mechanical Engineer", and the course work is based on five or six years of training. In Italy the course work is based on five years of education, and training, but in order to qualify as an Engineer one has to pass a state exam at the end of the course. In Greece, the coursework is based on a five-year curriculum and the requirement of a 'Diploma' Thesis, which upon completion a 'Diploma' is awarded rather than a B.Sc.

In [[Australia]], mechanical engineering degrees are awarded as Bachelor of Engineering (Mechanical) or similar nomenclature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mechanical Engineering|url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/science_engineering/csem/disciplines/mecheng/|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are an increasing number of specialisations. The degree takes four years of full-time study to achieve. To ensure quality in engineering degrees, [[Engineers Australia]] accredits engineering degrees awarded by Australian universities in accordance with the global [[Washington Accord]]. Before the degree can be awarded, the student must complete at least 3 months of on the job work experience in an engineering firm.  Similar systems are also present in South Africa and are overseen by the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA).

In the United States, most [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] mechanical engineering programs are [[School accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) to ensure similar course requirements and standards among universities. The ABET web site lists 302 accredited mechanical engineering programs as of 11 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://main.abet.org/aps/Accreditedprogramsearch.aspx ABET searchable database of accredited engineering programs], Accessed 11 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical engineering programs in Canada are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/acc_programs_1.cfm Accredited engineering programs in Canada by the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510053751/http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/acc_programs_1.cfm |date=10 May 2007 }}, Accessed 18 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and most other countries offering engineering degrees have similar accreditation societies.

In India, to become an engineer, one needs to have an engineering degree like a B.Tech or B.E, have a diploma in engineering, or by completing a course in an engineering trade like fitter from the [[Industrial Training Institute]] (ITIs) to receive a "ITI Trade Certificate" and also pass the All India Trade Test (AITT) with an engineering trade conducted by the National Council of Vocational Training (NCVT) by which one is awarded a "National Trade Certificate".  A similar system is used in Nepal.

Some mechanical engineers go on to pursue a postgraduate degree such as a [[Master of Engineering]], [[Master of Technology]], [[Master of Science]], [[Master of Engineering Management]] (M.Eng.Mgt. or M.E.M.), a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in engineering (Eng.D. or Ph.D.) or an [[engineer's degree]]. The master's and engineer's degrees may or may not include [[research]]. The Doctor of Philosophy includes a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to [[academia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-me.mit.edu/GradProgram/GradDegrees.htm Types of post-graduate degrees offered at MIT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616010925/http://www-me.mit.edu/GradProgram/GradDegrees.htm |date=16 June 2006 }} - Accessed 19 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Engineer's degree exists at a few institutions at an intermediate level between the master's degree and the doctorate.

===Coursework===
Standards set by each country's accreditation society are intended to provide uniformity in fundamental subject [[material]], promote competence among graduating engineers, and to maintain confidence in the engineering profession as a whole.  Engineering programs in the U.S., for example, are required by ABET to show that their students can "work professionally in both thermal and mechanical systems areas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abet.org/Linked%20Documents-UPDATE/Criteria%20and%20PP/E001%2008-09%20EAC%20Criteria%2011-30-07.pdf 2008-2009 ABET Criteria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228132456/http://www.abet.org/Linked%20Documents-UPDATE/Criteria%20and%20PP/E001%2008-09%20EAC%20Criteria%2011-30-07.pdf |date=28 February 2008 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- A more general source would help here to cover non-US universities --&gt; The specific courses required to graduate, however, may differ from program to program. Universities and [[Institute of technology|Institutes of technology]] will often combine multiple subjects into a single class or split a subject into multiple classes, depending on the faculty available and the university's major area(s) of research.

The fundamental subjects of mechanical engineering usually include:
* [[Mathematics]] (in particular, [[calculus]], [[differential equations]], and [[linear algebra]])
* Basic physical sciences (including physics and [[chemistry]])
* [[Statics]] and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]
* [[Strength of materials]] and [[solid mechanics]]
* [[Materials engineering]], [[Composite material|Composites]]
* [[Thermodynamics]], [[heat transfer]], [[energy conversion]], and [[HVAC]]
* [[Fuels]], [[combustion]], [[Internal combustion engine]]
* [[Fluid mechanics]] (including [[fluid statics]] and [[fluid dynamics]])
* [[Mechanism (engineering)|Mechanism]] and [[Machine (mechanical)|Machine]] design (including [[kinematics]] and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]])
* [[Instrumentation]] and [[measurement]]
* [[Manufacturing engineering]], technology, or processes
* [[Vibration]], [[control theory]] and [[control engineering]]
* [[Hydraulics]], and [[pneumatics]]
* [[Mechatronics]], and [[robotics]]
* [[Engineering design]] and [[product design]]
* [[Engineering drawing|Drafting]], [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) and [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.me.utulsa.edu/Undergraduate.html University of Tulsa Required ME Courses – Undergraduate Majors and Minors] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120804111337/http://www.me.utulsa.edu/Undergraduate.html |date=4 August 2012 }}.

Accessed: 19 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical engineers are also expected to understand and be able to apply basic concepts from chemistry, physics, [[chemical engineering]], [[civil engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]]. All mechanical engineering programs include multiple semesters of mathematical classes including [[calculus]], and advanced mathematical concepts including [[differential equations]], [[partial differential equations]], [[linear algebra]], [[abstract algebra]], and [[differential geometry]], among others.

In addition to the core mechanical engineering curriculum, many mechanical engineering programs offer more specialized programs and classes, such as [[control systems]], [[robotics]], [[transport]] and [[logistics]], [[cryogenics]], [[fuel]] technology, [[automotive engineering]], [[biomechanics]], [[vibration]], [[optics]] and others, if a separate department does not exist for these subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m2a.html Mechanical Engineering courses], MIT. Accessed 14 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most mechanical engineering programs also require varying amounts of research or community projects to gain practical problem-solving experience. In the United States it is common for mechanical engineering students to complete one or more [[internship]]s while studying, though this is not typically mandated by the university. [[Cooperative education]] is another option.

===License and regulation===
Engineers may seek [[licensing|license]] by a state, provincial, or national government. The purpose of this process is to ensure that engineers possess the necessary technical knowledge, real-world experience, and knowledge of the local legal system to practice engineering at a professional level. Once certified, the engineer is given the title of [[Professional Engineer]] (in the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Bangladesh and South Africa), [[Chartered Engineer]] (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India and Zimbabwe), ''Chartered Professional Engineer'' (in Australia and New Zealand) or ''European Engineer'' (much of the European Union).

In the U.S., to become a licensed Professional Engineer (PE), an engineer must pass the comprehensive FE (Fundamentals of Engineering) exam, work a minimum of 4 years as an ''Engineering Intern (EI)'' or ''Engineer-in-Training (EIT)'', and pass the "Principles and Practice" or PE (Practicing Engineer or Professional Engineer) exams.  The requirements and steps of this process are set forth by the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]] (NCEES), a composed of engineering and land surveying licensing boards representing all U.S. states and territories.

In the UK, current graduates require a [[BEng]] plus an appropriate master's degree or an integrated [[MEng]] degree, a minimum of 4 years post graduate on the job competency development, and a peer reviewed project report in the candidates specialty area in order to become a Chartered Mechanical Engineer (CEng, MIMechE) through the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]. CEng MIMechE can also be obtained via an examination route administered by the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In most developed countries, certain engineering tasks, such as the design of bridges, electric power plants, and chemical plants, must be approved by a [[professional engineer]] or a [[chartered engineer]]. "Only a licensed engineer, for instance, may prepare, sign, seal and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval, or to seal engineering work for public and private clients."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Why Get Licensed? |work= National Society of Professional Engineers |url= http://www.nspe.org/Licensure/WhyGetLicensed/index.html |accessdate= 6 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement can be written into state and provincial legislation, such as in the Canadian provinces, for example the Ontario or Quebec's Engineer Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineers Act |work=Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) |url=http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html |accessdate=24 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005184956/http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html |archivedate=5 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, such as Australia, and the UK, no such legislation exists; however, practically all certifying bodies maintain a [[Ethical code|code of ethics]] independent of legislation, that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Codes of Ethics and Conduct |work=Online Ethics Center |url=http://onlineethics.org/codes/ |accessdate=24 July 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619081942/http://onlineethics.org/codes/ |archivedate=19 June 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Job duties ==
Mechanical engineers research, design, develop, build, and test mechanical and thermal devices, including tools, engines, and machines.

Mechanical engineers typically do the following:
* Analyze problems to see how mechanical and thermal devices might help solve the problem.
* Design or redesign mechanical and thermal devices using analysis and computer-aided design.
* Develop and test prototypes of devices they design.
* Analyze the test results and change the design as needed.
* Oversee the manufacturing process for the device.

Mechanical engineers design and oversee the manufacturing of many products ranging from medical devices to new batteries.  They also design power-producing machines such as electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam and gas turbines as well as power-using machines, such as refrigeration and air-conditioning systems.

Like other engineers, mechanical engineers use computers to help create and analyze designs, run simulations and test how a machine is likely to work.

==Salaries and workforce statistics==
The total number of engineers employed in the U.S. in 2015 was roughly 1.6 million. Of these, 278,340 were mechanical engineers (17.28%), the largest discipline by size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#17-0000 |title=May 2015 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics | accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the median annual income of mechanical engineers in the U.S. workforce was $80,580. The median income was highest when working for the government ($92,030), and lowest in education ($57,090).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172141.htm Occupational Employment and Wages, 17-2141 Mechanical Engineers].

U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, December 17, 2015.

==Modern tools==
[[File:cad crank.jpg|thumb|250px|An oblique view of a four-cylinder inline crankshaft with pistons]]

Many mechanical engineering companies, especially those in industrialized nations, have begun to incorporate [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) programs into their existing design and analysis processes, including 2D and 3D [[solid modeling]] [[computer-aided design]] (CAD). This method has many benefits, including easier and more exhaustive visualization of products, the ability to create virtual assemblies of parts, and the ease of use in designing mating interfaces and tolerances.

Other CAE programs commonly used by mechanical engineers include [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM) tools and analysis tools used to perform complex simulations. Analysis tools may be used to predict product response to expected loads, including fatigue life and manufacturability. These tools include [[finite element analysis]] (FEA), [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD), and [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM).

Using CAE programs, a mechanical design team can quickly and cheaply iterate the design process to develop a product that better meets cost, performance, and other constraints. No physical prototype need be created until the design nears completion, allowing hundreds or thousands of designs to be evaluated, instead of a relative few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as viscoelasticity, complex contact between mating parts, or [[Non-Newtonian fluid|non-Newtonian flows]].

As mechanical engineering begins to merge with other disciplines, as seen in [[mechatronics]], [[multidisciplinary design optimization]] (MDO) is being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process.  MDO tools wrap around existing CAE processes, allowing product evaluation to continue even after the analyst goes home for the day. They also utilize sophisticated optimization algorithms to more intelligently explore possible designs, often finding better, innovative solutions to difficult multidisciplinary design problems.

==Subdisciplines==
The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized subdisciplines are discussed in this section.

===Mechanics===
[[File:Mohrs circle.svg|thumb|250px|[[Mohr's circle]], a common tool to study [[Stress (physics)|stresses]] in a [[mechanical element]]]]
{{main|Mechanics}}

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of [[force]]s and their effect upon [[matter]]. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both [[Elastic Deformation|elastic]] and [[Plastic Deformation|plastic]]) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or [[Stress (physics)|stresses]]. Subdisciplines of mechanics include
* [[Statics]], the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies
* [[dynamics (mechanics)|Dynamics]] the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations).
* [[Mechanics of materials]], the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress
* [[Fluid mechanics]], the study of how fluids react to forces&lt;ref&gt;Note: fluid mechanics can be further split into fluid statics and fluid dynamics, and is itself a subdiscipline of continuum mechanics. The application of fluid mechanics in engineering is called [[hydraulics]] and [[pneumatics]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kinematics]], the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion.  Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]].
* [[Continuum mechanics]], a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than [[wikt:discrete|discrete]])

Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the [[piston]]s and [[cam]]s as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see [[HVAC]]), or to design the [[intake]] system for the engine.

===Mechatronics and robotics===
[[File:FMS1 small.JPG|thumb|Training FMS with learning robot [[Intelitek|SCORBOT-ER 4u]], workbench CNC Mill and CNC Lathe]]
{{main|Mechatronics|Robotics}}

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics.  It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, [[electrical engineering]] and [[software engineering]] that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems.  In this way, machines can be automated through the use of [[electric motor]]s, [[servomechanism|servo-mechanisms]], and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to [[bit]]s. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in [[industrial engineering]]. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ [[assembly lines]] of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run [[Lights out (manufacturing)|by themselves]]. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, [[space exploration]], and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

===Structural analysis===
{{main|Structural analysis|Failure analysis}}

Structural analysis is the branch of mechanical engineering (and also civil engineering) devoted to examining why and how objects fail and to fix the objects and their performance. Structural failures occur in two general modes: static failure, and fatigue failure. ''Static structural failure'' occurs when, upon being loaded (having a force applied) the object being analyzed either breaks or is deformed [[plastic deformation|plastically]], depending on the criterion for failure. ''Fatigue failure'' occurs when an object fails after a number of repeated loading and unloading cycles. Fatigue failure occurs because of imperfections in the object: a microscopic crack on the surface of the object, for instance, will grow slightly with each cycle (propagation) until the crack is large enough to cause [[ultimate failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/bohr/mse209/chapter8.htm|title=Chapter 8. Failure|website=www.virginia.edu|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure is not simply defined as when a part breaks, however; it is defined as when a part does not operate as intended. Some systems, such as the perforated top sections of some plastic bags, are designed to break. If these systems do not break, failure analysis might be employed to determine the cause.

Structural analysis is often used by mechanical engineers after a failure has occurred, or when designing to prevent failure. Engineers often use online documents and books such as those published by ASM&lt;ref&gt;[http://asmcommunity.asminternational.org/portal/site/asm/ ASM International's site many documents, such as the ''ASM Handbook'' series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901014247/http://asmcommunity.asminternational.org/portal/site/asm/ |date=2007-09-01 }}. [[ASM International (society)|ASM International]].&lt;/ref&gt; to aid them in determining the type of failure and possible causes.

Once theory is applied to a mechanical design, physical testing is often performed to verify calculated results. Structural analysis may be used in an office when designing parts, in the field to analyze failed parts, or in laboratories where parts might undergo controlled failure tests.

===Thermodynamics and thermo-science===
{{main|Thermodynamics}}

[[Thermodynamics]] is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a [[physical system|system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/thermo.html|title=Thermodynamics|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy ([[enthalpy]]) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of [[heat transfer]], [[thermofluids]], and [[energy conversion]]. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design [[engine]]s and [[power plant]]s, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, [[heat exchanger]]s, [[heat sink]]s, [[radiator]]s, [[refrigeration]], [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brighthubengineering.com/thermodynamics/38344-thermodynamics-integral-part-of-our-life/|title=Applications of Thermodynamics Laws. Carnot, Stirling, Ericsson, Diesel cycles|website=Brighthub Engineering|access-date=2018-09-09|date=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and drafting===
[[File:Mech 2 3D.png|thumb|right|A CAD model of a [[mechanical seal|mechanical double seal]] ]]
{{main|Technical drawing|CNC}}

[[Technical drawing|Drafting]] or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for [[manufacture|manufacturing]] parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.solidworks.com/product/solidworks-3d-cad|title=SOLIDWORKS 3D CAD|website=SOLIDWORKS|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09|date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of [[Numerical control#CNC arrives|computer numerically controlled]] (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist [[thermal spray|spray coatings]], surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in [[finite element analysis]] (FEA) and [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD).

==Areas of research==
Mechanical engineers are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible in order to produce safer, cheaper, and more efficient machines and mechanical systems. Some technologies at the cutting edge of mechanical engineering are listed below (see also [[exploratory engineering]]).

===Micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)===
Micron-scale mechanical components such as springs, gears, fluidic and heat transfer devices are fabricated from a variety of substrate materials such as silicon, glass and polymers like [[SU8]]. Examples of [[MEMS]] components are the accelerometers that are used as car airbag sensors, modern cell phones, gyroscopes for precise positioning and microfluidic devices used in biomedical applications.

===Friction stir welding (FSW)===
{{main|Friction stir welding}}

Friction stir welding, a new type of [[welding]], was discovered in 1991 by [[The Welding Institute]] (TWI).  The innovative steady state (non-fusion) welding technique joins materials previously un-weldable, including several [[aluminum]] [[alloy]]s.  It plays an important role in the future construction of airplanes, potentially replacing rivets.  Current uses of this technology to date include welding the seams of the aluminum main Space Shuttle external tank, Orion Crew Vehicle test article, Boeing Delta II and Delta IV Expendable Launch Vehicles and the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket, armor plating for amphibious assault ships, and welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new Eclipse 500 aircraft from Eclipse Aviation among an increasingly growing pool of uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niar.wichita.edu/media/pdf/nationalpublication/Nov2-06.pdf|title=Advances in Friction Stir Welding for Aerospace Applications|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/08/sbir/phase1/SBIR-08-1-A1.02-9322.html?solicitationId=SBIR_08_P1 Proposal Number: 08-1 A1.02-9322] – NASA 2008 SBIR&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntefsw.com/military_applications.htm|title=Military Applications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composites===
[[File:Kohlenstofffasermatte.jpg|thumb|Composite cloth consisting of woven carbon fiber]]
{{main|Composite material}}

Composites or composite materials are a combination of materials which provide different physical characteristics than either material separately. Composite material research within mechanical engineering typically focuses on designing (and, subsequently, finding applications for) stronger or more rigid materials while attempting to reduce [[weight]], susceptibility to corrosion, and other undesirable factors. Carbon fiber reinforced composites, for instance, have been used in such diverse applications as spacecraft and fishing rods.

===Mechatronics===
[[Mechatronics]] is the synergistic combination of mechanical engineering, [[electronic engineering]], and software engineering. The discipline of mechatronics began as a way to combine mechanical principles with electrical engineering. Mechatronic concepts are used in the majority of electro-mechanical systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecpi.edu/blog/what-is-mechatronics-technology|title=What is Mechatronics Technology?|website=www.ecpi.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical electro-mechanical sensors used in mechatronics are strain gauges, thermocouples, and pressure transducers.

===Nanotechnology===
{{main|Nanotechnology}}

At the smallest scales, mechanical engineering becomes nanotechnology—one speculative goal of which is to create a [[molecular assembler]] to build molecules and materials via [[mechanosynthesis]]. For now that goal remains within [[exploratory engineering]].  Areas of current mechanical engineering research in nanotechnology include nanofilters,&lt;ref&gt;Nilsen, Kyle. (2011) [http://soar.wichita.edu/dspace/handle/10057/3997 "Development of Low Pressure Filter Testing Vessel and Analysis of Electrospun Nanofiber Membranes for Water Treatment"]&lt;/ref&gt; nanofilms,&lt;ref&gt;''Mechanical Characterization of Aluminium Nanofilms'', Microelectronic Engineering, Volume 88, Issue 5, May 2011, pp. 844–847.&lt;/ref&gt; and nanostructures,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cise.columbia.edu/nsec/ Columbia University and National Science Foundation, Accessed 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; among others.
{{See also|Picotechnology}}

===Finite element analysis===
{{main|Finite element analysis}}

Finite Element Analysis is a computational tool used to estimate stress, strain, and deflection of solid bodies. It uses a mesh setup with user-defined sizes to measure physical quantities at a node. The more nodes there are, the higher the precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://user.engineering.uiowa.edu/~bme083/lecture/lecture04_020303.pdf|title=Introduction to Finite Element Analysis (FEA) |last=Xia|first=Ting|date=Feb 3, 2003|website=UIOWA Engineering|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Sep 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field is not new, as the basis of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) or Finite Element Method (FEM) dates back to 1941.  But the evolution of computers has made FEA/FEM a viable option for analysis of structural problems. Many commercial codes such as [[NASTRAN]], [[ANSYS]], and [[ABAQUS]] are widely used in industry for research and the design of components. Some 3D modeling and CAD software packages have added FEA modules.  In the recent times, cloud simulation platforms like [[SimScale]] are becoming more common.

Other techniques such as finite difference method (FDM) and finite-volume method (FVM) are employed to solve problems relating heat and mass transfer, fluid flows, fluid surface interaction, etc.

===Biomechanics===
{{main|Biomechanics}}

Biomechanics is the application of mechanical principles to biological systems, such as [[human]]s, [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and [[Cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref&gt;R. McNeill Alexander (2005) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S09609822050090120 "Mechanics of animal movement"], [[Current Biology]] Volume 15, Issue 16, 23 August 2005, pp. R616–R619.&lt;/ref&gt;  Biomechanics also aids in creating prosthetic limbs and artificial organs for humans. Biomechanics is closely related to [[engineering]], because it often uses traditional engineering sciences to analyze biological systems. Some simple applications of [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]] and/or [[materials science]]s can supply correct approximations to the mechanics of many biological systems.

In the past decade, reverse engineering of materials found in nature such as bone matter has gained funding in academia. The structure of bone matter is optimized for its purpose of bearing a large amount of compressive stress per unit weight. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Tensile strength of bone along and across the grain|journal = Journal of Applied Physiology|volume = 16|issue = 2|pages = 355–360|last=Dempster|first=Coleman|date=August 15, 1960|doi=10.1152/jappl.1961.16.2.355|pmid = 13721810}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to replace crude steel with bio-material for structural design.

Over the past decade the [[Finite element method]] (FEM) has also entered the Biomedical sector highlighting further engineering aspects of Biomechanics. FEM has since then established itself as an alternative to [[in vivo]] surgical assessment and gained the wide acceptance of academia. The main advantage of Computational Biomechanics lies in its ability to determine the endo-anatomical response of an anatomy, without being subject to ethical restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;Tsouknidas, A., Savvakis, S., Asaniotis, Y., Anagnostidis, K., Lontos, A., Michailidis, N. (2013) The effect of kyphoplasty parameters on the dynamic load transfer within the lumbar spine considering the response of a bio-realistic spine segment. Clinical Biomechanics 28 (9–10), pp. 949–955.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led FE modelling to the point of becoming ubiquitous in several fields of Biomechanics while several projects have even adopted an open source philosophy (e.g. [[Biospine|BioSpine]]).

===Computational fluid dynamics===
{{main|Computational fluid dynamics}}

Computational fluid dynamics, usually abbreviated as CFD, is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze problems that involve fluid flows. Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by boundary conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simscale.com/docs/content/simwiki/cfd/whatiscfd.html|title=What is CFD {{!}} Computational Fluid Dynamics? — SimScale Documentation|website=www.simscale.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows. Initial validation of such software is performed using a wind tunnel with the final validation coming in full-scale testing, e.g. flight tests.

===Acoustical engineering===
{{main|Acoustical engineering}}

Acoustical engineering is one of many other sub-disciplines of mechanical engineering and is the application of acoustics. Acoustical engineering is the study of [[Sound]] and [[Vibration]]. These engineers work effectively to reduce [[noise pollution]] in mechanical devices and in buildings by soundproofing or removing sources of unwanted noise. The study of acoustics can range from designing a more efficient hearing aid, microphone, headphone, or recording studio to enhancing the sound quality of an orchestra hall. Acoustical engineering also deals with the vibration of different mechanical systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learn.org/articles/What_is_the_Job_Description_of_an_Acoustic_Engineer.html|title=What is the Job Description of an Acoustic Engineer?|work=learn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==
[[Manufacturing engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]] and [[automotive engineering]] are grouped with mechanical engineering at times. A bachelor's degree in these areas will typically have a difference of a few specialized classes.

In his introduction to Islamic Law, Wael B. Hallaq does not use the term ''Muamalat'', but also writes of Islamic law being divided into "four major fields" or "quarters", one of which is "sales". It includes not only laws on buying and selling but also on "partnerships, guaranty, gifts and bequests". &lt;blockquote&gt;"Generally, Muslim jurists gave the main topics of law the title ''kitab'' (“book”), e.g., the Book of Agency, which, in our modern organizational scheme, we recognize as a chapter. A sub-chapter was termed “bab,” which would in turn be broken into a number of fasls (sections). Many jurists conceived of the whole of Islamic law as falling into four major fields, which were called “the four quarters,” i.e., “rituals, sales, marriage and injuries.” Each of these terms, used in this context metaphorically, stands for a staggering variety of subjects that belong to a single quarter. Thus, the “quarter of sales” would encompass, among many other subjects, partnerships, guaranty, gifts and bequests, while that of “marriage” would cover as varied a field as dissolution of matrimony, foster relationships, custody, and wifely and family support. In the same vein, the “quarter of injuries” includes homicide, the Quranic punishments and the laws of war and peace, among other topics. Works generally ended with what we term procedural law, supplemented by coverage of slave manumission. Other works ended instead with inheritance and bequests."&lt;ref name="Hallaq-2009-28"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hallaq|first1=Wael B. |title=An Introduction to Islamic Law |date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-86146-5|page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;|group=Note}}

== Principles ==
[[File:Islamic-organizational-chart-muamalat.jpg|right|600px|Aspects of Islam including fiqh]]
According to Hosein Askar, Zamir Iqbal, and Abbas Mirakhor, a "significant subset" of muamalat "defines the conduct of economic activities" within the economic system, which "ultimately lays down  the rules for commercial, financial and banking system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2V2FBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22Introduction+to+Islamic+Economics%22++a+%22significant+subset%22+of+muamalat+%22defines+the+conduct+of+economic+activities%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Introduction%20to%20Islamic%20Economics%22%20%20a%20%22significant%20subset%22%20of%20muamalat%20%22defines%20the%20conduct%20of%20economic%20activities%22&amp;f=false|title=Introduction to Islamic Economics: Theory and Application|last=Askari|first=Hossein|last2=Iqbal|first2=Zamir|last3=Mirakhor|first3=Abbas|date=2015-02-16|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781118732960|location=|pages=46|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basic principles  ===
According to Aznan Hasan, basic principles of muamalat, are that dealings and contracts in Islam ...&lt;ref name="hasanFSIF" /&gt;
*are permissible until evidence is given proving otherwise;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*must be based on mutual consent;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*must be in accordance with the [[maqasid]] (goals of) al shariah;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*should facilitate the circulation of wealth and property;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*should be transparent;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*must observe justice and fair dealing.&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF&gt;Aznan Hasan, ''Fundamentals of Shariah in Islamic Finance'', pp. 193-199, as cited in {{cite web |url=http://takafuleexam.com/e-content/TBE-A/content/18141053PartAEnglish.pdf |title=CHAPTER A1, INTRODUCTION TO ISLAMIC MUAMALAT |website=Takaful Basic Examination, IBFIM |page=7 |accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of Muamalat===
According to Abdullaah Jalil, Asharaf Mohd Ramli, Syahidawati Shahwan  there are four "theories" that underlie the framework of Mu'amalat dealings:&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7&gt;[[#4IToFM2014|JALIL, et. al., ''FOUR INTRODUCTORY THEORIES OF FIQH MUAMALAT'']]: p.16-7&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Ahliyyah'' (Legal Capacity). Legal capacity refers to whether the person is of sound mind and old enough (puberty) to enter into a legal financial contract.&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7/&gt;   
#''Mal'' (Property) concerns the nature and types of property that the contract deal with.&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7/&gt;
##Property must exist at the time of transaction
##seller must be owner of the merchandise
##merchandise must be Islamically lawful
##must be of some use or value
##must be able to be delivered by the seller to the buyer
##the details of the merchandise must be known to both the seller and buyer&lt;ref name="IBaFiM2013-120"&gt;{{cite book|last1=ABʻAZIZ|first1=MUHAMMAD RIDWAN |title=Islamic Banking and Finance in Malaysia; System, Issues and Challenges |date=2013 |publisher=Al Manhal |page=120 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HWBkCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=muamalat+contracts#v=onepage&amp;q=muamalat%20contracts&amp;f=false |accessdate=5 April 2017|chapter=6. Muamalat Contracts in Islamic Banking and Finance |isbn=9789670393728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
#''Milkiyyah'' (Ownership), concerns the types, methods and scopes of ownership, that affect the relationship between the property and its owner in Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7/&gt; 
#'''Aqd'' (Contract), describes the framework or structure of a contract in fiqh.&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7/&gt;

Jalil, Ramli and Shahwan also note that the development of ''Mu'amalat'' rules is less strict than '''Ibadat''.

|}

=== General Prohibitions ===
According to muamalat, contracts ...
*should not involve the selling or buying of [[Islamic dietary laws#Intoxicants|alcohol]] or any other ''[[haram]]'' substances.&lt;ref name=TBECAIIM2012:8&gt;[[#TBECAIIM2012|TBE, "CHAPTER A1, INTRODUCTION TO ISLAMIC MUAMALAT", 2012]]: p.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IBFIM-intro-1.2.2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://takafuleexam.com/e-content/TBE-A/content/18141053PartAEnglish.pdf |title=CHAPTER A1, INTRODUCTION TO ISLAMIC MUAMALAT |website=Takaful Basic Examination, IBFIM |pages=8| accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*should not include any financial deal on the basis of usury (''[[riba]]'')&lt;ref name=IBFIM-intro-1.2.2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBECAIIM2012:8/&gt;
*should not involve gambling (''[[maisir]]'')&lt;ref name=IBFIM-intro-1.2.2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBECAIIM2012:8/&gt; 
*should not involves major uncertainty (''[[gharar]] fahish'')&lt;ref name=IBFIM-intro-1.2.2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBECAIIM2012:8/&gt; (minor uncertainty is permissible).

=== Contracts ===
At least one source (a scholar identified as "Barbarti") defines ''aqad'' (contract) as a “legal relationship created by the conjunction of two declarations, from which flow legal consequences with regard to the subject matter”.
&lt;ref name=MNCSIF:33&gt;[[#MNCSIF|Chik, ''Shariah in Islamic Finance'']]: p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

The essential elements of a contract are contracting parties (''aqidan'),'' a subject matter ''('Ma'aqud Alaih''), and a legally binding offer and acceptance (''Sighah''). They may be written, verbal or even indicated by signs (in the case of speechless person).&lt;ref name=MNCSIF:34&gt;[[#MNCSIF|Chik, ''Shariah in Islamic Finance'']]: p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Muamalat contracts are prominent in Islamic banking where they are "fundamental factors" that determine whether a "transaction is valid or not".&lt;ref name="IBaFiM2013-117"&gt;{{cite book|last1=ABʻAZIZ|first1=MUHAMMAD RIDWAN |title=Islamic Banking and Finance in Malaysia; System, Issues and Challenges |date=2013 |publisher=Al Manhal |page=117 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HWBkCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=muamalat+contracts#v=onepage&amp;q=muamalat%20contracts&amp;f=false |accessdate=5 April 2017|chapter=6. Muamalat Contracts in Islamic Banking and Finance |isbn=9789670393728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{further|Islamic banking and finance#Islamic financial transaction terminology}}
Some contracts in ''Mu'amalat'' include: 
* Sale Contract; 
* Cost plus profit (''[[murabahah]]'');

'''Nutrient pollution,''' a form of [[water pollution]], refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a primary cause of [[eutrophication]] of [[surface water]]s, in which excess nutrients, usually [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]], stimulate [[algae|algal]] growth. Sources of nutrient pollution include [[surface runoff]] from farm fields and pastures, discharges from [[septic tank]]s and [[feedlot]]s, and [[air pollution|emissions]] from combustion. Excess nutrients have been summarized as potentially leading to:
* Population effects: excess growth of algae (blooms);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/harmful-algal-blooms |title=Harmful Algal Blooms |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-07 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Community effects: species composition shifts (dominant taxa); 
* Ecological effects: food web changes, light limitation; 
* Biogeochemical effects: excess organic carbon (eutrophication); dissolved oxygen deficits ([[hypoxia (environmental)|environmental hypoxia]]); toxin production;&lt;ref name="EPA envir effects"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-environment |title=The Effects: Environment |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-07 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Human health effects: excess nitrate in drinking water ([[blue baby syndrome]]); disinfection by-products in drinking water;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-human-health |title=The Effects: Human Health |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-10 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biodiversity effects: excessive algae blooms ([[biodiversity loss]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/national-nutrient-strategy |title=National Nutrient Strategy |publisher=EPA|date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) report, the agency's Science Advisory Board succinctly stated: “Excess [[reactive nitrogen]] compounds in the environment are associated with many large-scale environmental concerns, including eutrophication of surface waters, toxic algae blooms, hypoxia, acid rain, nitrogen saturation in forests, and global warming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA |title=Reactive Nitrogen in the United States: An Analysis of Inputs, Flows, Consequences, and Management Options, A Report of the Science Advisory Board EPA-SAB-11-013 |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/67057225CC780623852578F10059533D/$File/EPA-SAB-11-013-unsigned.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219045824/http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/67057225cc780623852578f10059533d/%24file/epa-sab-11-013-unsigned.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nutrient sources Gulf-Mex &amp; Chesbay - EPA 2010.png|thumb|Agriculture is the major source of nutrient pollution in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In the [[Chesapeake Bay]], agriculture is a major source, along with urban areas and atmospheric deposition.]]

===Nitrogen===
Use of [[synthetic fertilizer]]s, burning of [[fossil fuel]]s, and agricultural [[animal production]], especially [[concentrated animal feeding operation]]s (CAFO), have added large quantities of reactive nitrogen to the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Galloway |first1=J.N. |last2=Dentener |first2=F.J. |display-authors=1 |date=September 2004 |title=Nitrogen Cycles: Past, Present, and Future |url= |journal=Biogeochemistry |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=153–226 |doi=10.1007/s10533-004-0370-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phosphorus===
Phosphorus pollution is caused by excessive use of fertilizers and [[manure]], particularly when compounded by [[soil erosion]]. Phosphorus is also discharged by municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants and some industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/phosphorus.html |title=Phosphorus and Water |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-03-13 |website=USGS Water Science School |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) |location=Reston, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land uses===
The principal source(s) of nutrient pollution in an individual [[drainage basin|watershed]] depend on the prevailing [[land use]]s. The sources may be [[Point source pollution|point sources]], [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint sources]], or both:
* [[Agricultural pollution|Agriculture]]: animal production or crops
* Urban/suburban: [[Urban runoff|stormwater runoff]] from roads and parking lots; excessive fertilzer use on lawns; municipal sewage treatment plants; motor vehicle emissions
* Industrial: [[air pollution]] emissions (e.g. [[Thermal power station|electric power plants]]), wastewater discharges from various industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions |title=Sources and Solutions |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-10 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nutrient pollution from some air pollution sources may occur independently of the local land uses, due to long-range transport of air pollutants from distant sources.&lt;ref name="EPA envir effects"/&gt;

==Mitigation of nutrient pollutant discharges==
===United States===
Agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution is the largest source of water quality impairments throughout the U.S., based on surveys by state environmental agencies.&lt;ref name="EPA 319 report"&gt;{{cite report |date=October 2016 |title=National Nonpoint Source Program: A catalyst for water quality improvements |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/319-grant-reports-and-project-summaries |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-R-16-009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} NPS pollution is not subject to discharge permits under the federal [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA).&lt;ref name="NPDES basic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-basics |title=NPDES Permit Basics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-07-25 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA and states have used grants, partnerships and demonstration projects to create incentives for farmers to adjust their practices and reduce [[surface runoff]].&lt;ref name="EPA 319 report"/&gt;{{rp|10-11}}

====Discharge permits====
Many [[point source pollution|point source]] dischargers in the U.S., while not necessarily the largest sources of nutrients in their respective watersheds, are required to comply with nutrient [[effluent limitation]]s in their permits, which are issued through the [[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES), pursuant to the CWA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/status-nutrient-requirements-npdes-permitted-facilities |title=Status of Nutrient Requirements for NPDES-Permitted Facilities |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-06-08 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some large municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants, such as the [[Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant]] in Washington, D.C. have installed [[biological nutrient removal]] (BNR) systems to comply with regulatory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dcwater.com/nitrogen-reduction |title=Removing Nitrogen from Wastewater Protects our Waterways |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |access-date=2018-01-15 |publisher=DC Water |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other municipalities have made adjustments to the operational practices of their existing [[secondary treatment]] systems to control nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/national-study-nutrient-removal-and-secondary-technologies |title=National Study of Nutrient Removal and Secondary Technologies |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-01-10 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discharges from large livestock facilities (CAFO) are also regulated by NPDES permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/animal-feeding-operations-afos |title=Animal Feeding Operations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-01-17 |website=NPDES |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface runoff from farm fields, the principal source of nutrients in many watersheds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chesapeakebay.net/issues/agriculture |title=Agriculture |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Learn the Issues |publisher=Chesapeake Bay Program |location=Annapolis, Maryland |access-date=2018-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is classified as NPS pollution and is not regulated by NPDES permits.&lt;ref name="NPDES basic"/&gt;

====TMDL program====
A [[Total Maximum Daily Load]] (TMDL) is a regulatory plan that prescribes the maximum amount of a pollutant (including nutrients) that a body of water can receive while still meeting CWA water quality standards.&lt;ref name="TMDL overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/program-overview-impaired-waters-and-tmdls |title=Overview of Identifying and Restoring Impaired Waters under Section 303(d) of the CWA |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-09-13 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Section 303 of the Act requires each state to generate a TMDL report for each body of water impaired by pollutants. TMDL reports identify pollutant levels and strategies to accomplish pollutant reduction goals. EPA has described TMDLs as establishing a "pollutant budget" with allocations to each of the pollutant's sources.&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |title=Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDLs) at Work: New York: Restoring the Long Island Sound While Saving Money |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/lawsguidance/cwa/tmdl/long_island_sound.cfm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many coastal water bodies, the main pollutant issue is excess nutrients, also termed ''nutrient over-enrichment.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Golen |first=Richard F. |title=Incorporating Shellfish Bed Restoration into a Nitrogen TMDL Implementation Plan |date=2007 |url=http://www.coonamessettfarm.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/Incorporating_Shellfish_Bed_Restoration_into_Nitrogen_TMDL_Implementation_Plan.pdf |publisher=University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth |location=Dartmouth, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TMDL can prescribe the minimum level of [[dissolved oxygen]] (DO) available in a body of water, which is directly related to nutrient levels. (''See'' [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia and Eutrophication|Aquatic Hypoxia]].) In 2010, 18 percent of TMDLs nationwide were related to nutrient levels including organic enrichment/oxygen depletion, noxious plants, algal growth, and ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA|title=Water Quality Standards Academy|url=http://water.epa.gov/learn/training/standardsacademy/upload/module_nutrient.pdf|date=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMDLs identify all point source and nonpoint source pollutants within a watershed. To implement TMDLs with point sources, wasteload allocations are incorporated into their NPDES permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-writers-manual |title=NPDES Permit Writers' Manual |chapter=Chapter 6. Water Quality-Based Effluent Limitations |date=September 2010 |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-833-K-10-001.}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPS discharges are generally in a voluntary compliance scenario.&lt;ref name="TMDL overview"/&gt;

In [[Long Island Sound]], the TMDL development process enabled the [[Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection]] and the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] to incorporate a 58.5 percent nitrogen reduction target into a regulatory and legal framework.&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"/&gt;

==Nutrient remediation==
[[File:Mussels at Strawberry Rocks PC013145.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Mussels are examples of organisms that act as nutrient bioextractors&lt;/center&gt;]]Innovative solutions have been conceived to deal with nutrient pollution in aquatic systems by altering or enhancing natural processes to shift nutrient effects away from detrimental ecological impacts.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Nutrient remediation is a form of environmental remediation, but concerns only biologically active nutrients such as [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]. “Remediation” refers to the removal of pollution or contaminants, generally for the protection of human health. In [[environmental remediation]] nutrient removal technologies include [[biofiltration]], which uses living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants. Examples include green belts, [[riparian]] areas, natural and constructed wetlands, and treatment ponds. These areas most commonly capture anthropogenic discharges such as wastewater, stormwater runoff, or sewage treatment, for land reclamation after mining, refinery activity, or land development.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Biofiltration utilizes [[Assimilation (biology)#Examples of biological assimilation|biological assimilation]] to capture, absorb, and eventually incorporate the pollutants (including nutrients) into living tissue. Another form of nutrient removal is [[bioremediation]], which uses microorganisms to remove pollutants. Bioremediation can occur on its own as natural attenuation or intrinsic bioremediation or can be encouraged by the addition of fertilizers, a strategy called biostimulation.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Nutrient bioextraction is bioremediation involving cultured plants and animals. Nutrient bioextraction or bioharvesting is the practice of farming and harvesting [[shellfish]] and [[seaweed]] for the purpose of removing nitrogen and other nutrients from natural water bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nutrient Bioextraction Overview |url=http://longislandsoundstudy.net/issues-actions/water-quality/nutrient-bioextraction-overview/ |publisher=Long Island Sound Study partnership |location=Stamford, CT |access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that nitrogen removal by oyster reefs could generate net benefits for sources facing nitrogen emission restrictions, similar to other nutrient trading scenarios. Specifically, if oysters maintain nitrogen levels in estuaries below thresholds that would lead to the imposition of emission limits, oysters effectively save the sources the compliance costs they otherwise would incur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kroeger |first=Timm |title=Dollars and Sense: Economic Benefits and Impacts from two Oyster Reef Restoration Projects in the Northern Gulf of Mexico |url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/oyster-restoration-study-kroeger.pdf|publisher=The Nature Conservancy|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have shown that [[oysters]] and [[mussels]] have the capacity to dramatically impact nitrogen levels in estuaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Comparative Roles of Suspension Feeders in Ecosystems, Vol. 47|year=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Netherlands|pages=93–120|author=Newell, R.I.E., Fisher, T.R., Holyoke, R.R., Cornwell, J.C.|edition=NATO Science Series IV: Earth and Environmental Sciences|contribution=Influence of eastern oysters on nitrogen and phosphorus regeneration in Chesapeake Bay, USA|editor=Dame, R., Olenin, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grabowski,J.H., Petersen, C.H.|title=Restoring oyster reefs to recover ecosystem services|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier-Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|pages=281–298|edition=Ecosystem Engineers: Concepts, Theory and Applications|editor=Cuddington, K., Byers, J.E., Wilson, W.G., Hastings, A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Rose JM, Tedesco M, Wikfors GH, Yarish C |title=International Workshop on Bioextractive Technologies for Nutrient Remediation Summary Report|url=http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/nefsc/publications/|publisher=US Dept Commerce, Northeast Fish Sci Cent Ref Doc. 10-19; 12 p.

==History of nutrient policy in the United States==
The basic requirements for states to develop nutrient [[Clean Water Act#Water quality criteria|criteria]] and [[Clean Water Act#Water quality standards|standards]] were mandated in the 1972 Clean Water Act. Implementing this water quality program has been a major scientific, technical and resource-intensive challenge for both EPA and the states, and development is continuing well into the 21st century.

EPA published a wastewater management regulation in 1978 to begin to address the national nitrogen pollution problem, which had been increasing for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kilian |first1=Chris |title=Cracking down on Nutrient Pollution: CLF Fights to Bring New England's Coastal Waters Back to Life |journal=Conservation Matters |date=2010 |volume=16 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the agency published a ''National Nutrient Strategy'' with a focus on developing nutrient criteria.&lt;ref name="EPA-strategy"&gt;{{cite report |date=June 1998 |title=National Strategy for the Development of Regional Nutrient Criteria |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20003NOU.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 822-R-98-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2000 and 2010 EPA published federal-level nutrient criteria for rivers/streams, lakes/reservoirs, estuaries and wetlands; and related guidance. "Ecoregional" nutrient criteria for 14 ecoregions across the U.S. were included in these publications. While states may directly adopt the EPA-published criteria, in many cases the states need to modfiy the criteria to reflect site-specific conditions. In 2004, EPA stated its expectations for numeric criteria (as opposed to less-specific narrative criteria) for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), [[chlorophyll a]](chl-a), and clarity, and established "mutually-agreed upon plans" for state criteria development. In 2007, the agency stated that progress among the states on developing nutrient criteria had been uneven. EPA reiterated its expectations for numeric criteria and promised its support for state efforts to develop their own criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/nutrient-memo-may252007.pdf |title=Nutrient Pollution and Numeric Water Quality Standards |author-last=Grumbles |author-first=Benjamin |date=2007-05-25 |publisher=EPA |id=Memorandum to State and Tribal Water Program Directors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 EPA published a progress report on state efforts to develop nutrient standards. A majority of states had not developed numeric nutrient criteria for rivers and streams; lakes and reservoirs; wetlands and estuaries (for those states that have estuaries).&lt;ref name="EPA-state adoption"&gt;{{cite report |title=State Adoption of Numeric Nutrient Standards (1998–2008) |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P1002TQ0.txt |date=December 2008 |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 821-F-08-007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, EPA also established a Nutrient Innovations Task Group (NITG), composed of state and EPA experts, to monitor and evaluate the progress of reducing nutrient pollution.&lt;ref name="EPA_programmatic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/programmatic-information-numeric-nutrient-water-quality-criteria |title=Programmatic Information on Numeric Nutrient Water Quality Criteria |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-05-16 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the NTIG issued a report, "An Urgent Call to Action," expesssing concern that water quality continued to deteriorate nationwide due to increasing nutrient pollution, and recommending more vigorous development of nutrient standards by the states.&lt;ref name="NTIG"&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2009 |title=An Urgent Call to Action: Report of the State-EPA Nutrient Innovations Task Group |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100U1TD.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 800-R-09-032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 EPA reiterated the need for states to fully develop their nutrient standards, noting that [[Safe Drinking Water Act#Monitoring, compliance and enforcement|drinking water violations]] for nitrates had doubled in eight years, that half of all streams nationwide had medium to high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, and [[harmful algal bloom]]s were increasing. The agency set out a framework for states to develop priorities and watershed-level goals for reductions of nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/memo_nitrogen_framework.pdf |title=Working in Partnership with States to Address Phosphorus and Nitrogen Pollution through Use of a Framework for State Nutrient Reductions |author-last=Stoner |author-first=Nancy K. |date=2011-03-16 |publisher=EPA |id=Headquarters Memorandum to EPA Regional Administrators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrient trading==
After the EPA had introduced watershed-based [[NPDES]] permitting in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watershed-Based NPDES Permitting|url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/basics/Watershed-Based-NPDES-Permitting.cfm|publisher=EPA|accessdate=20 February 2015|date=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; interest in nutrient removal and achieving regional TMDLs led to the development of nutrient trading schemes. Nutrient trading is a type of [[United States regulation of point source water pollution#Water quality trading|water quality trading]], a [[Market-based environmental policy instruments|market-based policy instrument]] used to improve or maintain water quality. Water quality trading arose around 2005 and is based on the fact that different pollution sources in a watershed can face very different costs to control the same pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA Water Quality Trading Webcast Seminar |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/watersheds/trading.cfm|publisher=EPA|date=December 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water quality trading involves the voluntary exchange of pollution reduction credits from sources with low costs of pollution control to those with high costs of pollution control, and the same principles apply to nutrient water quality trading. The underlying principle is “polluter pays”, usually linked with a regulatory driver for participating is the trading program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Genevieve Bennett |author2=Nathaniel Carroll |author3=Katherine Hamilton |title=Charting New Waters, State of Watershed Payments 2012|url=http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/reports/sowp2012|publisher=Forest Trends}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 2013 Forest Trends report summarized water quality trading programs and found three main types of funders: beneficiaries of watershed protection, polluters compensating for their impacts and ‘public good payers’ that may not directly benefit, but fund the pollution reduction credits on behalf of a government or [[NGO]]. As of 2013, payments were overwhelmingly initiated by public good payers like governments and NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Genevieve Bennett |author2=Nathaniel Carroll |author3=Katherine Hamilton |title=Charting New Waters State of Watershed Payments 2012Figure 4b: Watershed Investments by Payer Type, Globally, Excluding China|url=http://www.forest-trends.org/documents/files/doc_3308.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=QqnnVNmuHNGpyAT2wILoCA&amp;ved=0CAYQFjAB&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1eQccAysAnihOB89UutZMKp-K_g|publisher=Forest Trends Association|accessdate=20 February 2015|pages=98|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

== Nutrient source apportionment ==
Nutrient source apportionment is used to estimate the nutrient load from various sectors entering water bodies, following attenuation or treatment. [[Agriculture]] is typically the principal source of nitrogen in water bodies in Europe, whereas in many countries households and industries tend to be the dominant contributors of phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/607736796|title=Source apportionment of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs into the aquatic environment|date=2005|publisher=European Environment Agency|others=European Environment Agency.|isbn=9291677779|location=Copenhagen|oclc=607736796}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where [[water quality]] is impacted by excess nutrients, load source apportionment models can support the proportional and pragmatic management of water resources by identifying the pollution sources.

An '''Ortman key''' is a coupling device used to secure two adjacent cylindrical segments of a [[pressure vessel]] common in tactical [[rocket motor]]s.  An Ortman key is made of elongated rectangular metal bar stock, such as [[steel]], and is inserted into juxtaposed annular grooves around the circumference of the mating parts.  The Ortman key assembly is used in high-pressure applications where packaging, strength and mass are important.

The [[Edmund key]] is a common variant of the Ortman key which is similar except has a feature added to the end of the key to aid in extraction of the key from the assembly.

'''Parasitic computing''' is programming technique where a program in normal authorized interactions with another program manages to get the other program to perform computations of a complex nature. It is, in a sense, a security exploit in that the program implementing the parasitic computing has no authority to consume resources made available to the other program.

It was first proposed by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, Vincent W. Freeh, Hawoong Jeong &amp; Jay B. Brockman from University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA, in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nd.edu/~parasite/ Parasitic Computing]&lt;/ref&gt; The example given by the original paper was two computers communicating over the [[Internet]], under disguise of a standard communications session. The first computer is attempting to solve a large and extremely difficult [[3-SAT]] problem; it has decomposed the original 3-SAT problem in a considerable number of smaller problems. Each of these smaller problems is then encoded as a relation between a [[checksum]] and a [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] such that whether the checksum is accurate or not is also the answer to that smaller problem. The packet/checksum is then sent to another computer. This computer will, as part of receiving the packet and deciding whether it is valid and [[well-formed element|well-formed]], create a checksum of the packet and see whether it is identical to the provided checksum. If the checksum is invalid, it will then request a new packet from the original computer. The original computer now knows the answer to that smaller problem based on the second computer's response, and can transmit a fresh packet embodying a different sub-problem. Eventually, all the sub-problems will be answered and the final answer easily calculated.

The example is based on an exploit of the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), used for internet connections, so in the end, the target computer(s) is unaware that it has performed computation for the benefit of the other computer, or even done anything besides have a normal [[TCP/IP]] session.

The proof-of-concept is obviously extremely inefficient as the amount of computation necessary to merely send the packets in the first place easily exceeds the computations leeched from the other program; and the 3-SAT problem would be solved much more quickly if just analyzed locally. In addition, in practice packets would probably have to be retransmitted occasionally when real checksum errors and network problems occur. However, parasitic computing on the level of checksums is a demonstration of the concept. The authors suggest that as one moves up the [[application stack]], there might come a point where there is a net computational gain to the parasite - perhaps one could break down interesting problems into queries of complex [[cryptographic protocol]]s using [[public key cryptography|public keys]]. If there was a net gain, one could in theory use a number of control nodes for which many hosts on the Internet form a [[distributed computing]] network completely unawares.

Students of the University of Applied Sciences, Bern, Switzerland, extended this concept into a programmable [[virtual machine]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szene.ch/parasit/index.html Diploma thesis on Parasitic Computing]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petrophysics''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πέτρα, ''petra'', "rock" and φύσις, ''[[physis]]'', "nature") is the study of physical and chemical rock properties and their interactions with [[fluid]]s.&lt;ref name="Tiabb"&gt;{{cite book |title= Petrophysics|author1=Tiabb, D.  |author2=Donaldson, E.C. |lastauthoramp=yes |year= 2004|publisher= Elsevier|location= Oxford|isbn= 0-7506-7711-2|page= 1|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pGb6jaa5IVYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major application of petrophysics is in studying [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoirs]] for the [[hydrocarbon industry]].  Petrophysicists are employed to help [[reservoir engineering|reservoir engineers]] and [[Earth science|geoscientists]] understand the rock properties of the reservoir, particularly how pores in the subsurface are interconnected, controlling the accumulation and migration of hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name="Tiabb"/&gt;  Some of the key properties studied in petrophysics are [[lithology]], [[porosity]], [[water saturation]], [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] and [[density]].  A key aspect of petrophysics is measuring and evaluating these rock properties by acquiring [[well log]] measurements – in which a string of measurement tools are inserted in the borehole, [[coring|core]] measurements – in which rock samples are retrieved from subsurface, and [[Seismic exploration|seismic]] measurements.  These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical studies and reservoir engineering to give a complete picture of the reservoir.

While most petrophysicists work in the hydrocarbon industry, some also work in the mining and water resource industries.  The properties measured or computed fall into three broad categories: conventional petrophysical properties, rock mechanical properties, and ore quality.

Petrophysical studies are used by [[petroleum engineering]], [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[exploration geophysics]] and other related studies.

==Conventional petrophysical properties==
Most petrophysicists are employed (SS) to compute what are commonly called conventional (or reservoir) petrophysical properties.  These are:

''[[Lithology]]:'' A description of the rock's physical characteristics, such as grain size, composition and texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lithology|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?term=lithology|work=Earthquake Glossary|publisher=[[US Geological Survey]]|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By studying the lithology of local geological [[outcrop]]s and [[core sample]]s, geoscientists can use a combination of log measurements, such as [[Gamma ray logging|natural gamma]], [[Formation Evaluation Neutron Porosity|neutron]], [[Density logging|density]] and [[Resistivity logging|resistivity]], to determine the lithology down the well.

''[[Porosity]]:'' &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (Anti=tattilization)The percentage of a given volume of rock that is pore space and can therefore contain fluids.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/p/porosity.aspx Porosity]", ''[[Schlumberger]] Oilfield Glossary''. Retrieved 12 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically calculated using data from an instrument that measures the reaction of the rock to bombardment by [[Formation Evaluation Neutron Porosity|neutrons]] or by [[Density logging|gamma rays]] but can also be derived from [[Sonic logging|sonic]] and [[Nuclear magnetic resonance in porous media|NMR]] logging.

''[[Water saturation]]:'' The fraction of the pore space occupied by water.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/w/water_saturation.aspx Water saturation]", ''[[Schlumberger]] Oilfield Glossary''. Retrieved 12 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically calculated using data from an instrument that measures the resistivity of the rock and is known by the symbol &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt;.

''[[Permeability (fluid)|Permeability]]:'' The quantity of fluid (usually hydrocarbon) that can flow through a rock as a function of time and pressure, related to how interconnected the pores are.  [[Drill Stem Test|Formation testing]] is so far the only tool that can directly measure a rock formation's permeability down a well.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  In case of its absence, which is common in most cases, an estimate for permeability can be derived from empirical relationships with other measurements such as [[porosity]], [[Nuclear magnetic resonance in porous media|NMR]] and sonic logging.

''Thickness'' of rock with enough permeability to deliver fluids to a well bore.  This property is often called “''Net reservoir rock''.”  In the oil and gas industry, another quantity “''Net Pay''” is computed which is the thickness of rock that can deliver hydrocarbons to the well bore at a profitable rate.

Reservoir models are built upon their measured and derived properties to estimate the amount of hydrocarbon present in the reservoir, the rate at which that hydrocarbon can be produced to the Earth’s surface through wellbores and the fluid flow in rocks.  In the water resource industry, similar models are used to compute how much water can be produced to the surface over long periods of time, without depleting the aquifer.

==Rock mechanical properties==
Some petrophysicists use acoustic and density measurements of rocks to compute their mechanical properties and strength. They measure the compressional (P) wave velocity of sound through the rock and the shear (S) wave velocity and use these with the density of the rock to compute the rocks' ''compressive strength'', which is the compressive stress that causes a rock to fail, and the rocks' ''flexibility'', which is the relationship between stress and deformation for a rock. [[Converted-wave analysis]] is also used to determine subsurface lithology and porosity.

These measurements are useful to design programs to drill wells that produce oil and gas. The measurements are also used to design dams, roads, foundations for buildings, and many other large construction projects. They can also be used to help interpret seismic signals from the Earth, either man-made seismic signals or those from earthquakes.

==Ore quality==
Bore holes can be drilled into ore bodies (for example coal seams or gold ore) and either rock samples taken to determine the ore or coal quality at each bore hole location or the wells can be wireline logged to make measurements that can be used to infer quality.  Some petrophysicists do this sort of analysis.  The information is mapped and used to make mine development plans.

==Methods of analysis==
''[[Coring]] and [[core analysis]]'' is a direct measurement of petrophysical properties. In the petroleum industry rock samples are retrieved from subsurface and measured by core labs of oil company or some commercial core measurement service companies. This process is time consuming and expensive, thus can not be applied to all the wells drilled in a field.

[[File:wikipedia petrophysics figure 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 1]]
''[[Well logging|Well Logging]]'' is used as a relatively inexpensive method to obtain petrophysical properties downhole. Measurement tools are conveyed downhole using either [[Wireline logging#Wireline log|wireline]] or [[Logging while drilling|LWD]] method.

An example of wireline logs is shown in Figure 1.  The first “track”, shows the natural gamma radiation level of the rock.  The gamma radiation level “log” shows increasing radiation to the right and decreasing radiation to the left.  The rocks emitting less radiation have more yellow shading.  The detector is very sensitive and the amount of radiation is very low.  In clastic rock formations, rocks that have smaller amounts of radiation are more likely to be coarser grained and have more pore space, rocks with higher amounts of radiation are more likely to have finer grains and less pore space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poupon|first=A.|author2=Clavier, C., Dumanoir, J., Gaymard, R., Misk, A.|title=Log Analysis of Sand-Shale SequencesA Systematic Approach|journal=Journal of Petroleum Technology|year=1970|volume=22|issue=7|pages=867–881 |doi=10.2118/2897-PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second track over in the plot records the depth below the reference point which is usually the Kelly bush or rotary table in feet, so these rocks are 11,900 feet below the surface of earth.

In the third track, the electrical resistivity of the rock is presented. The water in this rock is salty and the salt in the water causes the water to be electrically conductive such that lower resistivity is caused by increasing water saturation and decreasing hydrocarbon saturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Brown |first=G. A. |title=A Mathematical Comparison of Common Saturation Equations |conference=SPWLA twenty-seventh annual logging symposium |date=June 1986 |id=1986-T |url=http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=SPWLA-1986-T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth track, shows the computed water saturation, both as “total” water (including the water bound to the rock) in magenta and the “effective water” or water that is free to flow in black.  Both quantities are given as a fraction of the total pore space.

The fifth track shows the fraction of the total rock that is pore space, filled with fluids.  The display of the pore space is divided into green for oil and blue for movable water. The black line shows the fraction of the pore space which contains either water or oil that can move, or be “produced.” In addition to what is included in blackline, the magenta line includes the water that is permanently bound to the rock.

The last track is a representation of the solid portion of the rock.  The yellow pattern represents the fraction of the rock (excluding fluids) that is composed of coarser grained sandstone.  The gray pattern represents the fraction of rock that is composed of finer grained “shale.”  The sandstone is the part of the rock that contains the producible hydrocarbons and water.

==Rock volumetric model for shaly sand formation==
''Symbols and Definitions:''
[[File:wikipedia petrophysics figure 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 2, a petrophysical rock model for clastic rock formation]]

The following definition and petrophysics model are a typical shaly sand formation model which assumes:
1. Shale is composed of silt, clay and their bounded water which will not flow. 
2. Hydrocarbon are stored only in pore space in sand matrix.

ΦT –	Total porosity (PHIT), which includes the pore space in sand and shale.

Sw –	Total water saturation, the fraction of the pore space occupied by water.

Φe –	Effective shale corrected porosity which includes only the pore space in sand. The pore space in shale which is filled with bounded water is excluded.

Swe –	Effective shale corrected water saturation. The volumetric fraction of Φe which is occupied by water.

Vsh – Volumetric fraction of shale.  This includes medium to very fine silt plus clay and the shale bound water.

Φsh – Shale porosity. Volumetric fraction of pore space in shale. These pore space is filled with bounded water by definition.

Key equations:

(1-Φe-Vsh) + Vsh + Φe*Swe + Φe*(1-Swe) = 1

Sandstone matrix volume  +  shale volume  +   water volume in sand   +  hydrocarbon volume in sand  = total rock volume

Φe  = ΦT – Vsh *Φsh

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7521">The '''Pickering series''' (also known as the '''Pickering&amp;ndash;Fowler series''') consists of three lines of singly [[ionized]] [[helium]] found, usually in absorption, in the spectra of hot stars like [[Wolf-Rayet star]]s. The name comes from [[Edward Charles Pickering]]&lt;ref name = Robotti /&gt; and [[Alfred Fowler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes|first = Imre|last = Lakatos|authorlink = Imre Lakatos|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year = 1980|isbn = 9780521280310|editor1-first = John|editor1-last = Worrall|editor2-first = Gregory|editor2-last = Currie|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RRniFBI8Gi4C&amp;pg=PA62|chapter = Bohr: A Research Programme Progressing on Inconsistent Foundations|pages = 55-68}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The lines are produced by transitions from a higher energy level of an electron to a level with [[principal quantum number]] ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4. The lines have wavelengths:

*4551&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]] (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4)
*5411&amp;nbsp;Å (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1550">The '''Polish School''' (also known as '''New Polish School''') is the music of several post-1945 Polish composers who share generational and stylistic similarities. Representatives include [[Tadeusz Baird]], [[Henryk Górecki]], [[Wojciech Kilar]], [[Witold Lutosławski]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], and [[Kazimierz Serocki]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollack p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; According to Polish music scholar Adrian Thomas, [[Zygmunt Mycielski]] used the term at the [[Łagów, Świebodzin County|Łagów]] conference in 1949, and it was later used at the 1956 [[Warsaw Autumn]] festival.&lt;ref name = "Thomas159"&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Their common purpose was in part retrospective, reacting to [[socialist realism]], and in part speculative.&lt;ref name = "Thomas159" /&gt; [[Sound mass]] and [[sonorism]] influenced these post-war composers.&lt;ref&gt;Rappoport-Gelfand pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4537">In [[mathematical optimization]], a '''quadratically constrained quadratic program''' ('''QCQP''') is an [[optimization problem]] in which both the [[objective function]] and the [[constrained optimization|constraints]] are [[quadratic function]]s. It has the form

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \text{minimize} &amp;&amp; \tfrac12 x^\mathrm{T} P_0 x + q_0^\mathrm{T} x \\
&amp; \text{subject to} &amp;&amp; \tfrac12 x^\mathrm{T} P_i x + q_i^\mathrm{T} x + r_i \leq 0 \quad \text{for } i = 1,\dots,m , \\
&amp;&amp;&amp; Ax = b, 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip; ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are ''n''-by-''n'' matrices and ''x'' &amp;isin; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the optimization variable.

If ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip; ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are all [[Positive-definite matrix|positive semidefinite]], then the problem is [[Convex set|convex]]. If these matrices are neither positive nor negative semidefinite, the problem is non-convex. If ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip; ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are all zero, then the constraints are in fact [[Linear map|linear]] and the problem is a [[quadratic program]].

== Hardness ==
Solving the general case is an [[NP-hard]] problem. To see this, note that the two constraints ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − 1) &amp;le; 0 and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − 1) &amp;ge; 0 are equivalent to the constraint ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − 1) = 0, which is in turn equivalent to the constraint ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; {0, 1}. Hence, any [[0–1 integer program]] (in which all variables have to be either 0 or 1) can be formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program. Since 0–1 integer programming is NP-hard in general, QCQP is also NP-hard.

== Relaxation ==
There are two main relaxations of QCQP: using [[semidefinite programming]] (SDP), and using the [[reformulation-linearization technique]] (RLT).

=== Semidefinite programming ===
When ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip; ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are all [[Positive-definite matrix|positive-definite matrices]], the problem is [[Convex optimization|convex]] and can be readily solved using [[interior point method]]s, as done with [[semidefinite programming]].

== Example ==
[[Cut (graph theory)|Max Cut]] is a problem in graph theory, which is NP-hard. Given a graph, the problem is to divide the vertices in two sets, so that as many edges as possible go from one set to the other. Max Cut can be formulated as a QCQP, and SDP relaxation of the dual provides good lower bounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4736">A '''quasi-peak detector''' is a type of electronic [[detector]] or [[rectifier]]. Quasi-peak detectors for specific purposes have usually been standardized with mathematically precisely defined dynamic characteristics of [[attack time]], integration time, and [[decay time]] or fall-back time.

Quasi-peak detectors play an important role in [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) testing of electronic equipment, where allowed levels of [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI), also called radio frequency interference (RFI), are given with reference to measurement by a specified quasi-peak detector. This was originally done because the quasi-peak detector was believed to better indicate the subjective annoyance level experienced by a listener hearing impulsive interference to an [[amplitude modulation|AM]] radio station.&lt;ref name=Bronaugh&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emcs.org/acstrial/newsletters/summer01/pp.bronaugh.htm |title=The Quasi-Peak Detector |author=Edwin L. Bronaugh |year=2001 |accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time standards incorporating quasi-peak detectors as the measurement device were extended to frequencies up to 1 [[GHz]],&lt;ref name=Barnes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbicorporation.com/ite.htm |title= EMC/EMI/ESD STANDARDS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT (ITE) |author=John R. Barnes |date=2003-07-23 |accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there may not be any justification beyond previous practice for using the quasi-peak detector to measure interference to signals other than [[amplitude modulation|AM]] radio.&lt;ref name=Bronaugh/&gt; The quasi-peak detector parameters to be used for [[electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] testing vary with frequency 
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = American National Standard for Electromagnetic Noise and Field Strength Instrumentation, 10 Hz to 40 GHz-Specifications
  | work = ANSI C63.2-1996

  | accessdate =  2007-09-07}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[CISPR]] and the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC)   limit [[electromagnetic interference|EMI]] at frequencies above 1 [[GHz]] with reference to an average-power detector, rather than quasi-peak detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptually, a quasi-peak detector for [[electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] testing works like a peak detector followed by a lossy integrator.
A voltage impulse entering a narrow-band receiver produces a short-duration burst oscillating at the receiver center frequency. The peak detector is a rectifier followed by a [[low-pass filter]] to extract a [[baseband signal]] consisting of the slowly (relative to the receiver center frequency) time-varying amplitude of the impulsive oscillation. The following lossy integrator has a rapid rise time and longer fall time, so the measured output for a sequence of impulses is higher when the pulse repetition rate is higher. The quasi-peak detector is calibrated to produce the same output level as a peak-power detector when the input is a [[continuous wave]] tone
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | first = Henry
  | year = 1987
  | title = Electromagnetic Compatibility Engineering
  | page = 709}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The CISPR quasi-peak detector is used in EMC testing and is defined in Publication 16 of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). 
The CISPR quasi-peak detector is a peak detector with an attack time of 1 ms, a decay time of 500 ms and an IF filter setting of 100 kHz.

In [[audio quality measurement]], quasi-peak rectifiers are specified in several standards. For example [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]] uses a special rectifier incorporating two cascaded charging [[time constant]]s. The PPM or [[peak programme meter]] used to measure programme levels is actually a quasi-peak reading meter, again with precisely defined dynamics. [[Flutter measurement]] also involves a standardised quasi-peak reading meter. In every case the dynamics are chosen to reflect the sensitivity of human hearing to brief sounds, ignoring those so brief that we do not perceive them, and [[weighting]] those of intermediate duration according to audibility.

The '''Research Institute of Crop Production''' ('''RICP''') ({{Lang-cs|Výzkumný ústav rostlinné výroby, VÚRV}}) was established in 1951. During its more than 50 years of existence, the RICP has been the leading crop-production research institution within the [[Czech Republic]]. After most specialised research institutes in the Czech Republic were privatised in 1993, RICP is the only state-independent institution pursuing both research and consulting activities focussed on problems associated with growing crop plants.

RICP is a subsidised organisation. Its basic purpose is the development of scientific knowledge in the field of integrated crop production, the production of wholesome foodstuffs, and the development of conditions for [[sustainable agriculture]] and conservation of the [[natural environment|environment]].

Although the main office of RICP is in Prague, various parts of the Institute (14  experimental or research stations and separate laboratories) are located in different areas in the territory of the Czech Republic.

'''Ribaldry''', or '''blue comedy''', is [[humor]]ous [[entertainment]] that ranges from bordering on indelicacy to gross [[morality|indecency]]. It is also referred to as "bawdiness", "gaminess" or "bawdy".

Sex is presented in ribald material more for the purpose of poking fun at the foibles and weaknesses that manifest themselves in [[human sexuality]], rather than to present sexual stimulation either excitingly or artistically. Also, ribaldry may use sex as a [[metaphor]] to illustrate some non-sexual concern, in which case ribaldry may verge on the territory of [[satire]].

Like any humour, ribaldry may be read as conventional or [[subversive]]. Ribaldry typically depends on a shared background of sexual conventions and values, and its [[comedy]] generally depends on seeing those conventions broken.

The ritual taboo-breaking that is a usual counterpart of ribaldry underlies its controversial nature and explains why ribaldry is sometimes a subject of [[censorship]]. Ribaldry, whose usual aim is ''not'' "merely" to be sexually stimulating, often does address larger concerns than mere sexual appetite. However, being presented in the form of comedy, these larger concerns may be overlooked by censors.

Ribaldry differs from [[black comedy]] (or gallows humor) in that black comedy deals with topics which would normally considered painful or frightening whereas ribaldry deals with topics that would only be considered offensive.

==Examples==
Ribaldry is present to some degree in every culture and has likely been around for all of human history. Works like ''[[Lysistrata]]'' by [[Aristophanes]], ''[[Menaechmi]]'' by [[Plautus]], ''[[Satyricon|Cena Trimalchionis]]'' by [[Petronius]], and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' of [[Apuleius]] are ribald classics from [[Classical Antiquity|ancient Greece and Rome]]. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]" from his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' and ''[[The Crabfish]]'', one of the oldest English traditional ballads, are classic examples. The Frenchman [[François Rabelais]] showed himself to be a master of ribaldry (technically called [[grotesque body]]) in his ''[[Gargantua]]'' and other works. ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' by [[Laurence Sterne]] and ''[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]] are also in this genre; as is [[Mark Twain]]'s long-suppressed ''[[1601 (Mark Twain)|1601]]''.

Another example of ribaldry is "[[De Brevitate Vitae]]", a song which in many [[Europe]]an-influenced universities is both a student beer-drinking song and an anthem sung by official university [[choir]]s at public graduation ceremonies. The private and public versions of the song contain vastly different words. More recent works like ''[[Candy (Southern and Hoffenberg novel)|Candy]]'', ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'', ''[[L'Infermiera]]'', the comedic works of [[Russ Meyer]], ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]'' and [[John Barth]]'s ''[[The Sot-Weed Factor]]'' are probably better classified as ribaldry than as either pornography or erotica.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Bawdy song==&lt;!--[[Bawdy song]] redirects directly here--&gt;
A '''bawdy song''' is a humorous song that emphasises sexual themes and is often rich with [[innuendo]]. Historically these songs tend to be confined to groups of young males, either as students or in an environment where alcohol is flowing freely. An early collection was ''[[Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy]]'', edited by Thomas D'Urfey and published between 1698 and 1720. Selected songs from ''Wit and Mirth'' have been recorded by the [[City Waites]] and other singers. Sailor's songs tend to be quite frank about the exploitative nature of the relationship between men and women. There are many examples of folk songs in which a man encounters a woman in the countryside. This is followed by a short conversation, and then sexual  intercourse, e.g. "The Game of All Fours". Neither side demonstrates any shame or regret. If the woman becomes pregnant, the man will not be there anyway. [[Rugby football|Rugby]] songs are often bawdy. Examples of bawdy folk songs are: "[[Seventeen Come Sunday]]" and "[[The Ballad of Eskimo Nell]]". [[Robert Burns]] compiled ''The Merry Muses of Caledonia'' (the title is not Burns's), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century. In modern times [[Hash House Harriers]] have taken on the role of tradition-bearers for this kind of song. ''The Unexpurgated Folk Songs of Men'' (Arhoolie 4006) is a gramophone record containing a collection of American bawdy songs recorded in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sandberg, L. &amp; Weissman, D. (1976) ''The Folk Music Sourcebook''. New York: Knopf; p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue comedy==
Blue comedy is comedy that is [[off-color]], [[wiktionary:risqué|risqué]], [[morality|indecent]] or [[profanity|profane]], largely about sex. It often contains [[profanity]] or sexual imagery that may shock and offend some audience members.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

"Working blue" refers to the act of using curse words and discussing things that people do not discuss in "polite society". A "blue comedian" or "blue comic" is a [[comedian]] who usually performs risqué routines layered with curse words. 

There is a common belief that comedian [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]] (1894–1963) coined the phrase, after his stage act which involved telling jokes from either a white book or a blue book, chosen by audience preference (the blue book contained ribald jokes). This is not so, as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' contains earlier references to the use of blue to mean ribald: 1890 ''Sporting Times'' 25 Jan. 1/1 "''Shifter wondered whether the damsel knew any novel blue stories.''" and 1900 ''Bulletin'' (Sydney) 20 Oct. 12/4 "''Let someone propose to celebrate [[Geoffery Chaucer|Chaucer]] by publicly reading some of his bluest productions unexpurgated. The reader would probably be locked up.''"

Private events at show business clubs such as the Bob Saget Club and The Masquers often showed this blue side of otherwise cleancut Bob Saget; a recording survives of one Masquers roast from the 1950s with [[Jack Benny]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], [[George Burns]], and [[Art Linkletter]] all using highly risqué material and obscenities. Many comedians who are normally family-friendly might choose to work blue when off-camera or in an adult-oriented environment; [[Bob Saget]] exemplifies this [[dichotomy]]. [[Bill Cosby]]'s 1969 record album [[8:15 12:15]] records both his family-friendly evening standup comedy show, and his blue midnight show, which included a joke about impregnating his wife "right through the old midnight trampoline" (her [[Diaphragm (birth control)|diaphragm]]) and other sexual references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/r234485 |title=Bill Cosby: 8:15 12:15 - Bill Cosby &amp;#124; AllMusic |first=Sean |last=Carruthers |work=allmusic.com |year=2011 |accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some comedians build their careers on blue comedy. Among the best known of these are [[Redd Foxx]], [[Lawanda Page]], and the team of Leroy and Skillet, all of whom later performed on the family-friendly television show [[Sanford and Son]]. Page, Leroy, and Skillet specialized in a particular [[African American]] form of blue spoken word recitation called [[Signifyin'|signifying or toasting]]. [[Dave Attell]] has also been described by his peers as one of the greatest modern-day blue comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MMPC|title=Bill Burr - Christopher Cross / Go See Dave Attell|date=2016-03-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTih1ZnwVs8|accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On [[talk radio]] in the United States, many commentators use blue comedy in their political programs. Examples include [[Neal Boortz]], Eric Von Haessler, [[Phil Hendrie]] and [[Preston and Steve|Steve Morrison]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''''SciShow''''' is a series of science-related videos on [[YouTube]]. The program is mainly  hosted by [[Hank Green]] of the [[VlogBrothers]] and [[Michael Aranda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leib|first=Bart|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/03/scishow-crash-course/|title=Scishow &amp; Crash Course: Why Isn’t School This Cool?|publisher=''Wired''|work=Geekdad|date=March 23, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''SciShow'' was launched as an [[YouTube Original Channel Initiative|original channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eördögh|first=Fruzsina|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/hank-green-vlogbrothers-scishow-youtube/|title=Watch the premiere of Hank Green's SciShow|publisher=''Daily Dot''|date=January 3, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hosting and production==
[[File:Hank Green Vlogbrothers 2016.jpg|thumb|Hank Green, host of ''SciShow'']]
Though Green hosts the majority of episodes, the show has alternate hosts; [[Michael Aranda]] has been with the show since its inception, and Olivia Gordon  of the Missoula Insectarium joined in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Ancient Human Fossils!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqeu49ENGYw|website=SciShow|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to her move to Chicago, [[Emily Graslie]] of ''The Brain Scoop'', also occasionally hosted on the channel. There have also been guest appearances by [[Lindsey Doe]], who hosts ''Sexplanations'', another channel launched by Green; and by longtime SciShow staffer Stefan Chin, who since 2018 has been a regular host. ''SciShow'' has grown since its 2012 launch; since then it has employed a full editorial, production, and operations staff.&lt;ref name=businessinsideradcampaign&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Madeline|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-scishow-and-hank-green-landed-a-national-ad-campaign-from-youtube-2014-10|title=Meet The Science Nerd Whose Face Is About To Be Plastered On YouTube Ads Everywhere|publisher=''Business Insider''|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''SciShow Space'' has three rotating hosts: Hank Green, Reid Reimers, and Caitlin Hofmeister.

''SciShow Kids'' is primarily hosted by Jessi Knudsen Castañeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SciShow Kids|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/scishowkids|website=Youtube|publisher=SciShow|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''SciShow  Psych'' is co-hosted by Hank Green and Brit Garner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Green|first=Hank|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmH9IANu_no

==Promotion and funding==
The channel was launched as an "[[YouTube Original Channel Initiative|original channel]]", which meant that [[YouTube]] funded the channel.&lt;ref name=marketwired1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/vlogbrother-hank-green-launches-science-channel-as-one-youtubes-much-publicized-original-1602880.htm|title=Vlogbrother Hank Green Launches Science Channel as One of YouTube's Much-Publicized Original Programming Channels|publisher=''Market Wired''|date=January 3, 2012|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hale|first=Mike|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/arts/television/youtubes-original-channels-take-on-tv.html|title=Genres Stretch, for Better and Worse, as YouTube Takes On TV|publisher=''New York Times''|date=April 25, 2012|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's initial grant was projected to expire in 2014, and in response, on September 12, 2013 ''SciShow'' joined the viewer-funding site ''Subbable'', created in part by Green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Hank|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GE10lpp8O0|title=SciShow Needs You!|publisher=''YouTube''|work=SciShow|date=September 12, 2013|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eifler|first=Emily|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/multimedia/article.jsp?essid=124879|title=Crowdfunding Matures with a Lesson from Public Broadcasting|publisher=''KQED''|date=August 20, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the channel landed a national advertisement deal with YouTube. The educational program was featured on platforms such as billboards and television commercials, as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeSimone|first=Evan|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/10/hank-green-will-soon-be-stalking-you-with-science/|title=Hank Green Will Soon Be Stalking You With Science|publisher=''New Media Rockstars''|date=October 16, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green details that the advertisements had a positive effect on ''SciShow'', stating, "My Twitter exploded, our followers and subscribers exploded."&lt;ref name=businessinsideradcampaign/&gt;

After [[Patreon]] acquired ''Subbable'', the channel switched over to Patreon where it continues to receive support in exchange for various perks. ''SciShow'' currently has over five thousand patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.patreon.com/scishow|title=SciShow is creating YouTube Videos about Science {{!}} Patreon|work=Patreon|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Several different scientific fields are covered by ''SciShow'', including  [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[zoology]], [[entomology]], [[botany]], [[meteorology]], [[astronomy]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watchdocumentaryfilms.com/scishow-chemistry/|title=SciShow: Chemistry|publisher=''Watch Documentary Films''|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The videos on ''SciShow'' have a vast variety of different topics, such as nutrition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Proefrock|first=Philip|url=http://www.ecogeek.org/agriculture/3739-scishow-the-dark-lord-of-nutrition|title=SciShow: The Dark Lord of Nutrition|publisher=''EcoGeek''|date=April 11, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "science superlatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leroux-Lindsey|first=Angela|url=http://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=23633|title=YouTube's SciShow Hails Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma as "Superlative Science"|publisher=''Brookhaven National Laboratory''|date=January 18, 2013|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2016, ''SciShow'' has released 820 videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyTGFziTw7k|title = SciShow: Winter Compilation|date = December 23, 2015|accessdate = December 27, 2015|website = YouTube|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once enough observations are available, Tempo can deduce the pulsar rotation rate and phase, astrometric position and rates of change, and parameters of [[Binary system (astronomy)|binary systems]], by fitting models to pulse times of arrival measured at one or more terrestrial observatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tempo.sourceforge.net/ |title=Tempo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a non-trivial procedure because much larger effects must be removed before the detailed fit can be performed.  These include:
* Dispersion of the pulses in the Interstellar medium, the solar system, and the [[ionosphere]]
* Observatory motion (including Earth rotation, [[precession]], [[nutation]], [[polar motion]] and [[orbital motion]])
* [[Tropospheric propagation]] delay
* [[Gravitational time dilation]] due to binary companions and Solar system bodies.

Tempo is maintained and distributed on [[SourceForge]].  There is a reference manual available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tempo.sourceforge.net/reference_manual.html|title=Tempo Reference Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no general documentation.

'''Tempo''' is a relatively old program, and is being replaced by '''Tempo2'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0603381 |title=TEMPO2, a new pulsar timing package. I: Overview |author= G. Hobbs |author2= R. Edwards |author3= R.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have developed tempo2, a new pulsar timing package that contains propagation and other relevant effects implemented at the 1ns level of precision (a factor of ~100 more precise than previously obtainable). In contrast with earlier timing packages, tempo2 is compliant with the general relativistic framework of the IAU 1991 and 2000 resolutions and hence uses the [[International Celestial Reference System]], [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] and up-to-date precession, nutation and polar motion models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3651">'''Textile stabilization''' is a [[Conservation and restoration of textiles|conservation method]] used to stabilize weak points in textile pieces and prevent further degradation or damage to the fabric. 

== Methods ==
=== Localized and Overall Support ===
Fabric may be used to provide support for the garment by stabilizing weak sections or by creating a backing or lining for the piece. Darning may be utilized on coarsely-woven fabrics with localized areas of damage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treatment of Textiles|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/TSG_Chapter_VI._Treatment_of_Textiles_-_Section_H._Consolidation/Stabilization_-_Non-adhesive_Methods|website=AIC Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Fabric Properties====  
*Should not cause damage through friction with the original fabric
*Be of similar or lighter weight than the original fabric.
*Match the original fabric with consideration of the loss of color or sheen
*Be of a tight enough weave to exclude dust if being used as a barrier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fabrics Used for Stabilization|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/fabrics_used_for_stabilization_from_aic.pdf|website=Museum Textile Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Overlay ===
Translucent or sheer fabrics are used to stabilize the textile without altering its appearance. This is typically done using nylon netting, silk crepeline, or polyester Tetex. Overlay is generally applied to textiles too fragile to withstand localized stitching methods. Overlay materials may be stitched to a more stable backing fabric. 

== Materials and Techniques ==
=== Conservation Stitching ===
Careful stitching is used to secure stabilizing materials to the original fabric. 
*Whip Stitch
*[[Running stitch|Running Stitch]]
*[[Backstitch|Back Stitch]]
*[[Herringbone stitch|Herringbone Stitch]]
*[[Couching|Laid Couching]]
*[[Darning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation Stitching Guide|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/conservation_stitching_guide.pdf|website=Museum Textile Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nylon Netting ===
Textile Conservators may use either heat set or bobbinet netting, both of which do not fray but are susceptible to degradation and reactions from light. Netting may be used together with a backing fabric. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation Netting|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/conservation_netting.pdf|website=Museum Textile Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Heat Set ====
*Available in a variety of colors
*Some varieties are very stiff
==== Bobbinet====
*Available in fewer colors, but is easily dyed
*Has a better drape than heat set netting or Tetex

=== Silk Crepeline ===
[[Crepe (textile)|Silk Crepeline]]  Silk is less sheer than nylon netting and is also susceptible to reactions to light, but may be used as an overlay technique as well as for patching specific areas and can be easily dyed. Because it can fray, the edges need to be hemmed, which can create less sheer areas. 

=== Polyester Tetex (Stabiltex)=== 
The least sheer overlay material, Tetex also has a sheen and is available in a selected range of colors which are not easily dyed. The material does not require hemming but is the most difficult to drape over fabrics. It is most often chosen for its long term stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Cutting and Applying Sheer Overlays|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/hot_cutting_and_applying_polyester_sheer_overlays.pdf|website=Museum Textile Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20157">The term '''twice exceptional''', often abbreviated as '''2e''',  entered educators' lexicons in mid 1990s and refers to  gifted children who have some form of disability.&lt;ref name="Beckley"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nrcgt.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/953/2015/05/spring98.pdf | title=Gifted and Learning Disabled: Twice Exceptional Students | accessdate=July 23, 2017 | author=Dawn Beckley, University of Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children are considered exceptional both because of their giftedness (e.g., intellectual, creative, perceptual, motor etc.) and because of their [[special needs]] (e.g., specific learning disability, neurodevelopmental disability etc.) Ronksley-Pavia (2015) presents a useful conceptual model of the co-occurrence of disability and giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronksley-Pavia|first=Michelle|date=2015-07-01|title=A Model of Twice-Exceptionality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162353215592499|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=318–340|doi=10.1177/0162353215592499}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2e child usually refers to a child who, alongside being considered gifted in comparison to same age-peers, is formally diagnosed with one or more disabilities.&lt;ref name="National Education Association 2006"&gt;National Education Association, 2006. ''The Twice-Exceptional Dilemma.''Washington D.C.:NEA.&lt;/ref&gt; Although 2e can refer to any general disability, it is often used to refer to students with learning disabilities, although research is not limited to these areas, and a more holistic view of 2e can help move the field forward&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronksley-Pavia|first=Michelle|date=2015-07-01|title=A Model of Twice-Exceptionality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162353215592499|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=318–340|doi=10.1177/0162353215592499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramo|first=Joseph|date=June 2015|title=Gifted Students with Disabilities "Twice Exceptionality in the Classroom"|url=|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=4|pages=62-69|via=nafme.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;The disabilities are varied: [[dyslexia]], visual or [[auditory processing disorder]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[sensory processing disorder]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[Tourette Syndrome]], or any other disability interfering with the student's ability to learn effectively in a traditional environment.&lt;ref name="National Education Association 2006"/&gt; The child might have a diagnosis of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], or diagnoses of [[anxiety]] or [[Clinical depression|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brody|first1=L.E.|last2=Mills|first2=C.J.|title=Gifted Children with Learning Disabilities: A Review of the Issues|date=1997|publisher=Journal of Learning Disabilities|pages=282–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often children with 2e have multiple co-morbid disabilities that present as a paradox to many parents and educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronksley-Pavia|first=Michelle|date=2015-07-01|title=A Model of Twice-Exceptionality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162353215592499|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=318–340|doi=10.1177/0162353215592499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no clear-cut profile of twice-exceptional children because the nature and disabilities of twice exceptionality are so varied.  This variation among twice-exceptional children makes it difficult to determine just how many of them there might be.  Best estimates of prevalence range from 300,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=S.M.|last2=Owen|first2=S.V.|title=To be gifted and learning disabled: Strategies for helping bright students with LD, ADHD and more|date=2004|publisher=Creative Learning Press|location=Mansfield Center, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 360,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Association for Gifted Children &amp; Council of State Directors of Programs for Gifted|title=State of the states in gifted education:  National policy and practical data|date=2011|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. (on the order of 0.5% of the total number of children under 18&lt;ref&gt;"In 2013, there were nearly 74 million children younger than 18 in the United States."

Linda Silverman, Ph.D., the director of the Gifted Development Center has found that fully 1/6 of the gifted children tested at the GDC have a learning difference of some type.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Linda [www.gifteddevelopment.com/What_is_Gifted/learned.htm "What We Have Learned About Gifted Children"],''Gifted Development Center'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, in 2010 a conservative estimate of the prevalence of 2e children was around 40,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270894725_An_Empirical_investigation_of_twice-exceptional_research_in_Australia_Prevalence_estimates_for_gifted_children_with_disability|title=An Empirical investigation of twice-exceptional research in Australia: Prevalence estimates for gifted children with disability (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|doi=10.13140/2.1.1456.4160|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or approximately 10% of gifted Australian children, although other estimates have placed this much higher at 30% of gifted Australian children as being 2e.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Munro|first=DR John|date=2002-06-01|title=Gifted learning disabled students|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19404150209546698|journal=Australian Journal of Learning Disabilities|volume=7|issue=2|pages=20–30|doi=10.1080/19404150209546698|issn=1324-8928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misunderstood children==

Brody and Mills [1997] argue that this population of students "could be considered the most misunderstood of all exceptionalities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brody|first1=L.E.|last2=Mills|first2=C.J.|title=Gifted Children with learning disabilities: a review of the issues|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|date=1997|volume=30|issue=3|pages=282–296|doi=10.1177/002221949703000304|pmid=9146095}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In each situation, the 2e student’s strengths help to compensate for deficits; the deficits, on the other hand, make the child’s strengths less apparent &lt;ref&gt;Baum, S. &amp; Owen, S. (2004). To Be Gifted &amp; Learning Disabled: Strategies for Helping Bright Students with LD, ADHD, and More. Mansfield Center, CT: Creative Learning Press.&lt;/ref&gt; although as yet there is no empirical research to confirm this theory. The interplay of exceptional strengths and weaknesses in a single individual results in inconsistency in performance. They might present any of the three profiles identified by educator and researcher Susan Baum:
* Bright but not trying hard enough
* Learning disabled but with no exceptional abilities
* Average.
In the case of behavioral/socioemotional, rather than cognitive problems, both strengths and deficits can be intensified.
A 2e student’s grades commonly alternate between high and low, sometimes within the same subject. The child might have advanced vocabulary and ideas but be unable to organize those ideas and express them on paper. They might be a skilled artist or builder but turn in assignments that are messy or illegible. They might complete assignments but lose them or forget to turn them in. To the parents and teachers observing this behavior, it may seem that the child just isn’t trying. In fact, many 2e children work as hard if not harder than others, but with less to show for their efforts.
This struggle to accomplish tasks that appear easy for other students can leave 2e children frustrated, anxious, and depressed. It can rob them of their enthusiasm and energy for school and damage their self-esteem.

==Identifying twice exceptionality==
Twice exceptionality is not something that can solidly be diagnosed and therefore is not easily identified in students. Children identified as twice exceptional can exhibit a wide range of traits, many of them typical of gifted children. Like those who are gifted, 2e children often show greater asynchrony than average children (that is, a larger gap between their [[mental age]] and physical age). They are often intense and highly sensitive to their emotional and physical environments. The following chart summarizes characteristics commonly seen in this population.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Twice-Exceptionality: Parents’ Perspectives on 2e Identification|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02783193.2015.1077911|journal = Roeper Review|date = 2015-10-02|issn = 0278-3193|pages = 208–218|volume = 37|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/02783193.2015.1077911|first = Lynn|last = Dare|first2 = Elizabeth Agnes|last2 = Nowicki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twice exceptionality often does not show up until children are in school. In their early years, these children often seem very bright, with varied interests and advanced vocabularies (particularly with reference to same-age peers); and many times parents are unaware that they have a child with 2e. Teachers sometimes spot problems in school; sometimes parents are the first to notice their children's frustrations with school. During the early years it may be social difficulties. The 2e child may find it hard to make friends and fit in. Academic problems often appear later. As work demands increase, teachers may see a drop or inconsistencies in the student’s performance, sometimes accompanied by an increase in problem behaviors. Some 2e students withdraw, showing reluctance to speak out or take other risks in class; while others play the class clown. Some are unable to stay focused, find it hard to sit still and work quietly, and have difficulty controlling anger or frustration.

If these difficulties persist, school personnel or parents may decide that evaluation is needed. Along with a physical examination, children may undergo psycho-educational testing to determine the cause of their struggles. The professionals who take part in the process should be knowledgeable about giftedness. Some characteristics of giftedness can look very much like those of a learning disability or disorder and, as a result, gifted children are sometimes incorrectly diagnosed with disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, J.T.;  Amend, E.R.; Webb, N.E.; Goerss, J.; Beljan, P.; Olenchak, F.R. (2005). The Misdiagnosis and Dual Diagnoses of Gifted Children and Adults: ADHD, Bipolar, OCD, Asperger's, Depression, and Other Disorders. Scottsdale, AZ: Great Potential Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluation results should indicate the child’s areas of strength and weakness and identify whether any disorders or learning disabilities are present. In addition, the results should include information on what the child needs in order to build on the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses that have been identified. Teaching to students' abilities rather than disabilities increases self-concept scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nielsen|first1=M.E.|last2=Mortorff-Albert|first2=S.|title=The effects of special education service on the self-concept and school attitude of learning disabled/gifted students|journal=Roeper Review|date=1989|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29–36|doi=10.1080/02783198909553227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Their strengths are the key to success for twice-exceptional children. They thrive on intellectual challenges in their areas of interest and ability. Many 2e children do best when given work that engages multiple senses and offers opportunities for hands-on learning. However, a requirement for success for these students is support, either given informally as needed or formalized in an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) or 504 plan.

Support can come in several forms. An essential form is encouragement; others include compensation strategies and accommodations in the child’s areas of weakness. For example, 2e students may benefit from learning time-management skills and organizational techniques; and they may need to have extra time on tests and reduced homework. It should be remembered, however, that the student's strengths should not merely be viewed as means through which they can compensate for their areas of weakness. Proper support for a twice-exceptional student must include accommodations to allow them to develop and challenge their gifts as well. It is essential for these students to feel as though they are being noticed for their gifts more than just their weaknesses, otherwise the student may fall into negative behavioral patterns such as the ones aforementioned. In sum, appropriate interventions should address both the academic and social emotional needs of 2e learners.

==Education==
Twice-exceptional education is a movement that started in the early 1970s with "gifted-handicapped" education,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Maker |first = C. June |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL4559927M/Providing_programs_for_the_gifted_handicapped |title = Providing programs for the gifted handicapped |year = 1977 |publisher=Council for Exceptional Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term essentially referring to the same population. 2e education is an education approach backed by 35 years of research and best practices tailored to the unique needs of 2e students. It is a marriage between special education and gifted education—a strengths-based, differentiated approach that provides special educational supports. Many argue that talent development is the most critical aspect of their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=S.M.|last2=Owen|first2=S.V.|title=To be gifted and learning disabled: Meeting the needs of gifted students with LD, ADHD and more|date=2004|publisher=Creative Learning Press|location=Mansfield Center, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When teaching 2e students there are methods an educator should avoid. Twice exceptionality students do not respond well to lectures, and tend to gravitate more toward "big picture" learning. It's also important to understand that these students have a hard time following unnecessarily strict rules, and should not be expected to conform to them. Instead, being flexible with them, and focusing more on holistic, big-picture learning is recommended. 

Still, finding schools that can meet the needs of twice exceptional children can be a challenge for many parents. Public and private schools with programs that combine the appropriate levels of challenge and support for these learners are in the minority. For this reason, a number of parents choose alternative educational options for their 2e children, including [[homeschooling]] and [[virtual schools]].&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, L. C. (2008). No One Said It was Easy – Challenges of Parenting Twice-Exceptional Children. In M. W. Gosfield, (Ed.), ''Expert Approaches to Support Gifted Learners: Professional Perspectives, Best Practices, and Positive Solutions'' (pp. 269-276). Minneapolis: Free Spirit Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a handful of schools in United States offer a curriculum specifically tailored to 2e children. Some public schools offer part-time programs for twice exceptional students, where they can progress in subjects like math at their own pace, and meet other students like themselves.

A '''vacuum chamber''' is a rigid enclosure from which air and other gases are removed by a [[vacuum pump]]. This results in a low-pressure environment within the chamber, commonly referred to as a [[vacuum]]. A vacuum environment allows researchers to conduct physical experiments or to test mechanical devices which must operate in [[outer space]] (for example) or for processes such as vacuum drying or vacuum coating. Chambers are typically made of metals which may or may not shield applied external magnetic fields depending on wall thickness, [[frequency]], [[resistivity]], and [[Permeation|permeability]] of the material used. Only [[Materials for use in vacuum|some materials]] are suitable for vacuum use.

Chambers often have multiple ports, covered with [[vacuum flange]]s, to allow instruments or windows to be installed in the walls of the chamber. In low to medium-vacuum applications, these are sealed with [[elastomer]] [[o-ring]]s. In higher vacuum applications, the flanges have knife edges machined onto them, which cut into a copper [[gasket]] when the flange is bolted on.

A type of vacuum chamber frequently used in the field of [[spacecraft]] engineering is a [[thermal vacuum chamber]], which provides a thermal environment representing what a spacecraft would experience in space.

==Vacuum chamber materials==
Vacuum chambers can be constructed of many materials. "Metals are arguably the most prevalent vacuum chamber materials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Danielson|first=PHil|title=Choosing the Right Vacuum Materials|url=http://www.vacuumlab.com/Articles/VacLab36.pdf|publisher=The Vacuum Lab|accessdate=February 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724150040/http://www.vacuumlab.com/Articles/VacLab36.pdf|archive-date=July 24, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The strength, pressure, and permeability are considerations for selecting chamber material.
Common materials are:
* Stainless Steel
* Aluminum
* Mild Steel
* Brass
* High density ceramic
* Glass
* Acrylic
*hard steel

==Vacuum degassing==
"Vacuum degassing is the process of using vacuum to remove gases from compounds which become entrapped in the
mixture when mixing the components."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vacuum Degassing Epoxy &amp; Silicone|url=http://www.lacotech.com/ProductFiles/SMT-04-1013%20revA1%20(App%2006-14%20Vacuum%20Degassing%20Epoxy%20and%20Silicone).pdf|publisher=LACO Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To assure a bubble-free mold when mixing resin and silicone rubbers and slower-setting harder resins, a vacuum chamber is required. A small vacuum chamber is needed for de-airing (eliminating air bubbles) for materials prior to their setting. The process is fairly straightforward. The casting or molding material is mixed according to the manufacturers directions.

===Process===
Since the material may expand 4–5 times under a vacuum, the mixing container must be large enough to hold a volume of four to five times the amount of the original material that is being vacuumed to allow for the expansion; if not, it will spill over the top of the container requiring clean-up that can be avoided. The material container is then placed into the vacuum chamber; a vacuum pump is connected and turned on. Once the vacuum reaches {{nowrap|29 inches}} (at sea level) of mercury, the material will begin to rise (resembling [[foam]]). When the material falls, it will plateau and stop rising. The vacuuming is continued for another 2 to 3 minutes to make certain all of the air has been removed from the material. Once this interval is reached, the vacuum pump is shut off and the vacuum chamber release valve is opened to equalize air pressure. The vacuum chamber is opened, the material is removed and is ready to pour into the mold.

Though a maximum vacuum one can theoretically achieve at sea level is 29.921 inches of mercury (Hg,) this will vary significantly as altitude increases. For example, for a mold making in ''[[Denver, Colorado]]'', which sits at 5280 feet above sea level, one can only achieve a vacuum on the mercury scale of 24.896 Hg in their vacuum chamber. 

To keep the material air-free, it must be slowly poured in a high and narrow stream starting from the corner of the mold box, or mold, letting the material flow freely into the box or mold cavity. Usually, this method will not introduce any new bubbles into the vacuumed material. To ensure that the material is totally devoid of air bubbles, the entire mold/mold box may be placed in the chamber for an additional few minutes; this will assist the material in flowing into difficult areas of the mold/mold box.

==Vacuum drying==
Water and other liquids may accumulate on a product during the production process. "Vacuum is often employed as a process for removing bulk and absorbed water (or other solvents) from a product. Combined
with heat, vacuum can be an effective method for drying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vacuum Drying|url=http://www.lacotech.com/ProductFiles/SMT-04-1011%20revA1%20(App%2005-07%20Vacuum%20Drying).pdf|publisher=LACO Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World's largest vacuum chamber==

[[NASA]]'s [[Space_Power_Facility#Thermal-Vacuum_Test_Chamber|Space Power Facility]] houses the world's largest vacuum chamber. It was built in 1969 and stands {{convert|122|ft|m}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m}} in diameter, enclosing a [[bullet]]-shaped space. It was originally commissioned for nuclear-electric power studies under vacuum conditions, but was later decommissioned. Recently, it was recommissioned for use in testing [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems. Recent uses include testing the airbag landing systems for the [[Mars Pathfinder]] and the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, Spirit and Opportunity, under simulated Mars atmospheric conditions.
