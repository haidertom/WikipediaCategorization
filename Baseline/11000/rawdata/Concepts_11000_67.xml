[[Image:Heterojunction variables in equilibrium.png|300px|thumb|right|[[Band diagram]]s for a straddling-gap type heterojunction, as understood by Anderson's rule. The junction alignment at equilibrium (bottom) is predicted based on a hypothetical flat-vacuum alignment (top).]]
'''Anderson's rule''' is used for the construction of [[energy band diagram]]s of the [[heterojunction]] between two [[semiconductor material]]s. Anderson's rule states that when constructing an energy band diagram, the [[vacuum level]]s of the two semiconductors on either side of the heterojunction should be aligned (at the same energy).&lt;ref&gt;Borisenko, V. E. and Ossicini, S. (2004). ''What is What in the Nanoworld: A Handbook on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology''. Germany: Wiley-VCH.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also referred to as the '''electron affinity rule''', and is closely related to the [[Schottky-Mott rule]] for [[metal-semiconductor junction]]s. 

Anderson's rule was first described by R. L. Anderson in 1960.&lt;ref name="Anderson1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=R. L.|title=Germanium-Gallium Arsenide Heterojunctions [Letter to the Editor]|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=4|issue=3|year=1960|pages=283–287|issn=0018-8646|doi=10.1147/rd.43.0283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the vacuum levels are aligned it is possible to use the [[electron affinity]] and [[band gap]] values for each semiconductor to calculate the [[conduction band]] and [[valence band]] offsets.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, J. H., (1997). ''The Physics of Low-Dimensional Semiconductors''. UK: [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; The electron affinity (usually given by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; in [[solid state physics]]) gives the energy difference between the lower edge of the conduction band and the [[vacuum level]] of the semiconductor.  The band gap (usually given the symbol &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm g}&lt;/math&gt;) gives the energy difference between the lower edge of the conduction band and the upper edge of the valence band. Each semiconductor has different electron affinity and band gap values. For semiconductor [[alloys]] it may be necessary to use [[Vegard's law]] to calculate these values.

Once the relative positions of the conduction and valence bands for both semiconductors are known, Anderson's rule allows the calculation of the [[band offset]]s of both the valence band (&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{\rm v}&lt;/math&gt;) and the conduction band (&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{\rm c}&lt;/math&gt;).
After applying Anderson's rule and discovering the bands' alignment at the junction, [[Poisson’s equation]] can then be used to calculate the shape of the [[band bending]] in the two semiconductors.

=== Example: straddling gap ===

Consider a heterojunction between semiconductor 1 and semiconductor 2. Suppose the conduction band of semiconductor 2 is closer to the vacuum level than that of semiconductor 1. The conduction band offset would then be given by the difference in electron affinity (energy from upper conducting band to vacuum level) of the two semiconductors:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{\rm c} = (\chi_{2} - \chi_{1})\,&lt;/math&gt;

Next, suppose that the band gap of semiconductor 2 is large enough that the valence band of semiconductor 1 lies at a higher energy than that of semiconductor 2. Then the valence band offset is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{\rm v} = (\chi_{\rm 1} + E_{\rm g1}) - (\chi_{\rm 2} + E_{\rm g2})\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Limitations of Anderson's rule==

{{details|topic=other models of heterojunction band alignment|Heterojunction}}

In real semiconductor heterojunctions, Anderson's rule fails to predict actual band offsets.
In Anderson's idealized model the materials are assumed to behave as they would in the limit of a large vacuum separation, yet where the vacuum separation is taken to zero.
It is that assumption that involves the use of the vacuum [[electron affinity]] parameter, even in a solidly filled junction where there is no vacuum.
Much like with the [[Schottky-Mott rule]], Anderson's rule ignores the real [[chemical bonding]] effects that occur with a small or nonexistent vacuum separation: interface states which may have a very large electrical [[polarization density|polarization]] and defect states, dislocations and other perturbations caused by imperfect crystal lattice matches.

To try to improve the accuracy of Anderson's rule, various models have been proposed.
The ''common anion rule'' guesses that, since the valence band is related to anionic states, materials with the same anions should have very small valence band offsets.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
Tersoff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. Tersoff|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.30.4874|title=Theory of semiconductor heterojunctions: The role of quantum dipoles|year=1984|journal=Physical Review B|volume=30|issue=8|pages=4874|bibcode = 1984PhRvB..30.4874T }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the presence of a [[dipole]] layer due to induced gap states, by analogy to the [[metal-induced gap states]] in a [[metal-semiconductor junction]].
Practically, heuristic corrections to Anderson's rule have found success in specific systems, such as the ''60:40 rule'' used for the GaAs/AlGaAs system.&lt;ref name="Debbar"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.40.1058|title=Conduction-band offsets in pseudomorphic InxGa1-xAs/Al0.2Ga0.8As quantum wells (0.07≤x≤0.18) measured by deep-level transient spectroscopy|year=1989|last1=Debbar|first1=N.|last2=Biswas|first2=Dipankar|last3=Bhattacharya|first3=Pallab|journal=Physical Review B|volume=40|issue=2|pages=1058|bibcode = 1989PhRvB..40.1058D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10771">The '''anti-lynching movement''' was a [[civil rights movement]] in the [[United States]] that aimed to eradicate the practice of [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]]. Lynching was used as a tool to repress [[African American]]s.&lt;ref name="Robinson1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cedric J.

The movement was composed mainly of African Americans who tried to persuade politicians to put an end to the practice, but after the failure of this strategy, they pushed for anti-lynching legislation. African-American women helped in the formation of the movement&lt;ref name="Ford2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynne E.

The first anti-lynching movement was characterized by black convention meets, which were organized in the immediate aftermath of individual incidents. The movement gained wider national support in the 1890s. During this period, two organizations spearheaded the movement - the [[National Afro-American League|Afro-American League]] (AAL) and the National Equal Rights Council (NERC).&lt;ref name="Finkelman2007"/&gt;

On January 4, 1935, Democratic Senators  [[Edward P. Costigan]] and Robert F. Wagner together worked and set out a new bill that stated “To assure to persons within the jurisdiction of every state the equal protection of the crime of lynching.” The bill was composed with many sections that protected people from all types of lynching crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=David O.|date=June–July 1935|title="Previous Attempts to Pass a Federal Anti-Lynching Law."|url=http://0-eds.b.ebscohost.com.library.4cd.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=57&amp;sid=00f2f6ba-b7ec-4aaf-8489-3393686a6a93%40sessionmgr102&amp;hid=103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=12142810&amp;db=aph|journal=Congressional Digest|volume= 14| issue =  6/7|pages=169–171|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) ==
In 1909, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) was established. The NAACP formed a special committee in 1916 in order to push for anti-lynching legislation and to enlighten the public about lynching.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2007" /&gt;

The NAACP youth were part of many rallies. They attended many protest against lynching and wore black in memory of all who had been murdered. They also sold anti-lynching buttons to raise money for the NAACP. The money they raised was to keep the fight against lynching going. They sold a huge amount of buttons that said "Stop Lynching" and made about $869.25. The youth also contributed by having demonstrations to raise awareness about the horrors of lynching. They had these demonstrations in seventy eight different cities all over the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=NAACP Youth and the Fight for Black Freedom, 1936–1965|last=Bynum|first=Thomas|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|year=2013|isbn=1-57233-982-9|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Noralee Frankel, the anti-lynching movement had its origin in the freedom movements after the end of the [[American Civil War]], and that it cannot be described only as a result of the [[Progressive Era#Political reform|reforms]] during the [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref name="Frankel1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Noralee Frankel|title=Gender, Class, Race, and Reform in the Progressive Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=btZ7N4qAJhYC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=12 April 2012|date=22 December 1994|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-0841-4|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's Contributions ==
Many women contributed to the anti-lynching movement through the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill|Dyer Bill]] including Ida B. Wells, Mary Burnett Talbert and Angelina Grimké. The bill was a foundation that exposed both lynching, and the affects it had on the people.

=== Ida B. Wells ===
[[Ida B. Wells]] was a significant figure in the anti-lynching movement. After the lynchings of her three friends, she condemned the lynchings in the newspapers ''Free Speech'' and ''Headlight'', both owned by her. Wells wrote to reveal the abuse, and race violence African Americans had to go through. She was part of many civil rights organizations such as the NAACP, the Niagara Movement and the Afro-American Council.&lt;ref name="Finkelman20072"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gbQHxb_P0QC&amp;pg=PA80|title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present: From the Age of Segregation to the Twenty-First Century|date=November 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516779-5|pages=78–82|author=Paul Finkelman|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells encourage black women to help work for the Anti-lynching laws to be passed. She was also part of the “First Suffrage Club for Black Women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/odyssey/educate/barnett.html|title=Woman Journalist Crusades Against Lynching|last=|first=|date=December 10, 1998|website=Library of Congress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ida B. Wells asked ''“Is Rape the ‘Cause’ of Lynching?”'' in their circular titled “The Shame of America,” that emphasized the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, when they were in the Anti-Lynching Campaigns. Due to the number of 83 women being lynched in a time frame of 30 years plus 3,353 men that were also lynched.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of her anti-lynching campaigning she received death threats from racist rioters.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2007" /&gt; After having her children she got out of the organizations but she kept on protesting against lynching. In 1899 she protested the [[Sam Hose|Sam Hose's lynching]] in Georgia.

=== Mary Burnett Talbert ===
Mary B. Talbert was president of the National Association of Colored Women from 1916 to 1920. In 1923 she became vise president of the NAACP and her last contribution was leading the Anti- lynching Crusaders during the anti lynching movement .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strangers in the Land of Paradise: Creation of an African American Community, Buffalo New York|last=Williams|first=Lillian|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0253335524|location=Blooming IN|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 Talbert and all the Negro women part of the anti-lynching crusaders raise $10,000 for the NAACP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Patriotism in Jim Crow America|last=Morgan|first=Francesca|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Angelina Grimké ===
[[Angelina Weld Grimké|Angelina Grimké]], one of the many New Negro poets, was one of the many women that wrote about the effects, of lynching. Grimké wrote ''[[Rachel (play)}Rachel]]'', one of her most famous plays in which she addresses both the lynching problem and the psychological affects it had on innocence Negro people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of American Race Riots, Volume 1|last=Rucker and Upton|first=Walter and James|publisher=|date=November 30, 2006|isbn=978-0313333019|location=Greenwood|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; This anti-lynching play was first performed in NAACP anti lynching Drama Committee. One of Grimke's main goals she wanted to accomplish with her play ''Rachel'' was to make white women empathize with the Negro women who witnessed the lynching of their husbands and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women of Color: Mother-Daughter Relationships in 20th-Century Literature|last=Brown- Guillory|first=Elizabeth|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-292-70847-1|location=|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Juanita Jackson Mitchell ===
Juanita Jackson was part of the NAACP. She was their national youth director. Mitchell worked mostly with the youth, and did absolutely everything she could to try and get them involved in the NAACP and protesting against lynching. She got the youth to campaign for anti-lynching legislation.She also got to send anti-lynching messages through a radio broadcast. In 1937 Juanita Jackson convinced the National Broadcasting Company to broadcast fifteen minutes on the need for anti-lynching laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=NAACP Youth and the Fight for Black Freedom, 1936–1965|last=Bynum|first=Thomas|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|year=2012|isbn=1-57233-982-9|location=|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anti-Lynching Crusaders ==
The Anti-Lynching Crusaders was a group of women dedicated to stopping lynching. Before the Anti-Lynching Crusaders was founded all these group of Crusaders were involved church that helped them learn how to lead with gender problems and power.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The organization was under the guidance of the NAACP and was founded in 1922. The Crusaders women organization started with sixteen members that widened to nine hundred members within three months since the organization was founded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This organization focused specifically on fundraising money to pass the Dyer Bill.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN RACE RIOTS|last=Rucker|first=Walker|publisher=Geenwood Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary Talbert was the leader of the group, her objective was to unite 700 state workers, specifically women, but of no distinguishing color or race. Talbert was an active fundraiser for the Crusaders and affirmed the organizations desire "to raise at least one million dollars... to help us put over the Dyer Anti Lynching Bill."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Press, Platform, Pulpit: Black Feminist Publics in the Era of Reform|last=Zackodnik|first=Teresa|publisher=The University of Tennessee Press/Knoxville|year=2011|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They raised over $10,803.38 by the spring of 1923.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Bad faith''' ([[French language|French]]: ''mauvaise foi'') is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept utilized by [[existentialist]] philosophers [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to describe the phenomenon in which human beings, under pressure from social forces, adopt false values and disown their innate freedom, hence acting [[Authenticity (philosophy)|inauthentically]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the concepts of [[self-deception]] and ''[[ressentiment]]''.

==Freedom and choice==
A critical claim in [[existentialism|existentialist]] thought is that individuals are always [[Free will|free to make choices]] and guide their lives towards their own chosen goal or "project". The claim holds that individuals cannot escape this freedom, even in overwhelming circumstances. For instance, even an empire's colonized victims possess choices: to submit to rule, to negotiate, to commit suicide, to resist nonviolently, or to counter-attack.

Although external circumstances may limit individuals (this limitation from the outside is called [[facticity]]), they cannot force a person to follow one of the remaining courses over another. In this sense the individual still has some freedom of choice. For this reason, individuals choose in ''[[anguish]]'': they know that they must make a choice, and that it will have consequences. For Sartre, to claim that one amongst many conscious possibilities takes undeniable precedence (for instance, "I cannot risk my life, because I must support my family") is to assume the role of an object in the world, not a free agent, but merely at the mercy of circumstance (a ''[[being-in-itself]]'' that is only its own facticity, i.e., it "is" inside itself, and acts there as a limitation).&lt;ref&gt;Jack Reynolds, ''Understanding Existentialism'' (2006) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;. For Sartre, this attitude is manifestly self-deceiving. 

==Intentional consciousness and freedom==
As conscious humans, we are always aware that we are more than what we are aware of, so we are not whatever we are aware of. We cannot, in this sense, be defined as our "intentional objects" of consciousness, including our restrictions imposed by (facticity) our personal history, character, bodies, or objective responsibility. Thus, as Sartre often repeated, "Human reality is what it is not, and it is not what it is." An example of what he means is being a doctor but wishing to "transcend" that to become a pig farmer. One is who one is not: a pig farmer, not who one is, a doctor. 

One can only define oneself negatively, as "what it is not", and this negation is the only positive definition of "what it is."

From this we are aware of a host of alternative reactions to our freedom to choose an objective situation, since no situation can dictate a single response. We pretend that these possibilities are denied to us by assuming social roles and value systems external to this nature {{clarification needed|date=June 2018}}. But this is itself a decision made possible by our freedom and our separation from these things. 

"Bad faith" is the paradoxical free decision to deny to ourselves this inescapable freedom.

==Examples==
===Sartre===
Sartre cites a café waiter, whose movements and conversation are a little too "waiter-esque". His voice oozes with an eagerness to please; he carries food rigidly and ostentatiously; "his movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid".&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, quoted in [[R. D. Laing]], ''Self and Others'' (1969) p 44&lt;/ref&gt; His exaggerated behaviour illustrates that he is play acting as a waiter, as an object in the world: an automaton whose essence is to be a waiter. But that he is obviously acting belies that he is aware that he is not (merely) a waiter, but is rather consciously deceiving himself.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul, ''Essays in Existentialism'', Citadel Press. 1993, pp. 167-169&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Sartre's examples involves a young woman on a first date. She ignores the obvious sexual implications of her date's compliments to her physical appearance, but accepts them instead as words directed at her as a human consciousness. As he takes her hand, she lets it rest indifferently in his, "neither consenting nor resisting&amp;nbsp;– a thing"&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, quoted in [[Erving Goffman]], ''Relations in Public'' (1972)in p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– refusing either to return the gesture or to rebuke it. Thus she delays the moment when she must choose either to acknowledge and reject his advances, or submit to them. She conveniently considers her hand only a thing in the world, and his compliments as unrelated to her body, playing on her dual human reality as a physical being, and as a consciousness separate and free from this physicality.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul, ''Essays in Existentialism'', Citadel Press. 1993, pp. 160-164&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre suggests that by acting in bad faith the waiter and the woman are denying their own freedom, but by actively using this freedom itself. They manifestly know they are free, but refuse to acknowledge it. Bad faith is paradoxical in this regard: when acting in bad faith, a person is actively denying their own freedom, however rely on it to perform the denial.

===De Beauvoir===
De Beauvoir described three main types of women acting in bad faith: the ''[[Narcissist]]'' who denies her freedom by construing herself as a desirable object; the ''Mystic'', who invests her freedom in an absolute; and the ''Woman in Love'', who submerges her identity in that of her male object.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

She also considered what she called the ''Serious Man'', who subordinated himself to some outside cause, to be in bad faith inasmuch as he denies his own freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 150 and p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two modes of consciousness==
Sartre claims that the consciousness with which we generally consider our surroundings is different from our reflecting on this consciousness, i.e., the consciousness of "ourselves being conscious of these surroundings". The first kind of consciousness, before we think about, or reflect on, our previous consciousness, is called ''pre-reflective''. Reflecting on the pre-reflective consciousness is called ''reflective'' consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/sartre-ex/#SH3a|title=Sartre, Jean Paul: Existentialism - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this cannot be called unconsciousness, as Freud used the term. Sartre gives the example of running after a bus: one does not become conscious of "one's running after the bus" until one has ceased to run after it, because until then one's consciousness is focused on the bus itself, and not one's chasing it.

In this sense consciousness always [[logical consequence|entails]] being self-aware (''being for-itself''). Since for Sartre consciousness also entails a consciousness of our separation from the world, and hence freedom, we are also always aware of this. But we can manipulate these two levels of consciousness, so that our reflective consciousness interprets the factual limits of our objective situation as insurmountable, whilst our pre-reflective consciousness remains aware of alternatives.

==Freedom and morality==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
One convinces oneself, in some sense, to be bound to act by external circumstance, in order to escape the anguish of freedom. Sartre says that man is "condemned to be free": whether he adopts an "objective" moral system to do this choosing for him, or follows only his pragmatic concerns, he cannot help but be aware that they are not&amp;nbsp;– fundamentally&amp;nbsp;– part of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/80180903|title=Existentialism is a Humanism|last=Sartre|first=Jean-Paul|publisher=Yale University Press|others=|year=2007|isbn=9780300115468|location=New Haven|pages=29|oclc=80180903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as possible intentional objects of one's consciousness, one is fundamentally ''not'' part of oneself, but rather exactly what one, as consciousness, defines oneself in opposition to; along with everything else one could be conscious of.

Fundamentally, Sartre believes mankind cannot escape responsibility by adopting an external moral system, as the adoption of such is in itself a choice that we endorse, implicitly or explicitly, for which we must take full responsibility. Sartre argues that one cannot escape this responsibility, as each attempt to part one's self from the freedom of choice is in itself a demonstration of choice, and choice is dependent on a person's wills and desires.

As a human, one cannot claim his actions are determined by external forces; this is the core statement of existentialism. One is "condemned" to this eternal freedom; human beings exist before the definition of human identity exists. One cannot define oneself as a thing in the world, as one has the freedom to be otherwise. One is not "a philosopher", as at some point one must/will cease the activities that define the self as "a philosopher". Any role that one might adopt does not define one as there is an eventual end to one's adoption of the role; i.e. other roles will be assigned to us, "a chef", "a mother". The self is not constant, it cannot be a thing in the world. Though one cannot assign a positive value to definitions that may apply to oneself, one remains able to say what one is not.

This inner anguish over moral uncertainty is a central underlying theme in existentialism, as the anguish demonstrates a personal feeling of responsibility over the choices one makes throughout life. Without an emphasis on personal choice, one may make use of an external moral system as a tool to moralize otherwise immoral acts, leading to negation of the self. According to existentialism, dedicated professionals of their respective moral codes&amp;nbsp;– priests interpreting sacred scriptures, lawyers interpreting the [[Constitution]], doctors interpreting the [[Hippocratic oath]]&amp;nbsp;– should, instead of divesting the self of responsibility in the discharge of one's duties, be aware of one's own significance in the process. This recognition involves the questioning of the morality of all choices, taking responsibility for the consequences of one's own choice and therefore; a constant reappraisal of one's own and others' ever-changing humanity. One must not exercise bad faith by denying the self's freedom of choice and accountability. Taking on the burden of personal accountability in all situations is an intimidating proposition&amp;nbsp;– by pointing out the freedom of the individual, Sartre seeks to demonstrate that the social roles and moral systems we adopt protect us from being morally accountable for our actions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10127">Countries regulate the marketing and sale of [[beef]] by observing criteria of [[Cattle]] [[Cadaver|Carcasses]] at the [[Abattoir]] and classifying the carcasses. This classification, sometimes optional, can suggest a market demand for a particular animal's attributes and therefore the price owed to the producer.

== United States grading system ==
In the United States, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s (USDA's) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) operates a voluntary beef grading program that began in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=United States Standards for Grades of carcass Beef|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meat processor pays for a trained AMS meat grader to grade whole carcasses at the [[abattoir]]. Such processors are required to comply with Food Safety and Inspection Service ([[FSIS]]) grade labeling procedures. The official USDA grade designation can appear as markings on retail containers, individual bags,  or on USDA shield stamps, as well as on legible roller brands appearing on the meat itself.  

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] grading system uses eight different grades to represent various levels of marbling in beef: Prime, Choice, Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter and Canner. The grades are based on two main criteria: the degree of marbling ([[intramuscular fat]]) in the beef, and the maturity (estimated age of the animal at [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]).  Prime has the highest marbling content when compared to other grades, and is capable of fetching a premium at [[restaurant]]s and [[supermarket]]s. As of June 2009, about 2.9% of carcasses grade as Prime.&lt;ref&gt;Salvage, B. (2009) "Leading the Herd", Meat Processing, June 2009, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Choice is the most common grade sold in retail outlets, and represents roughly half of all graded beef.  Select is sold as a cheaper, leaner option in many stores and is the lowest grade typically found for consumer purchase as a steak. Younger cattle (under 42 months of age) tend to be graded as Prime, Choice, Select or Standard, while older cattle are more likely to be graded Commercial, Utility, Canner or Cutter.  These latter grades of beef are used for ground products rather than for consumer sale or food service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beef inspection USDA.jpg|thumb|Inspected carcasses tagged by the USDA]]
Some [[meat science|meat scientists]] {{Who|date=September 2010}} object to the current scheme of USDA grading since it is not based on direct measurement of tenderness, although marbling and maturity are indicators of tenderness. Most other countries' beef grading systems mirror the U.S. model, except for those in the European Union (EU). The EU employs a grading scheme that emphasizes carcass shape and amount of fat covering&lt;ref&gt;Council Regulation (EEC) No 1208/81 of 28 April 1981 determining the Community scale for the classification of carcases of adult bovine animals (OJ L 123, 7 May 1981, p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt; instead of marbling and aging. The differences in grading yield incompatible value judgments of beef value in the United States and the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contrasting appraisals of quality and value of beef carcasses in Spain and the United States|author=Beriain, M. J. |journal=Revue Méd. Vét. Vét.|year= 2013|volume= 164|issue= 7|pages= 337–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most beef offered for sale in [[supermarket]]s in the United States is graded U.S. Choice or Select. U.S. Prime beef is sold to hotels and upscale restaurants, and usually marketed as such.

In 1997, the official standards were revised to restrict the Select grade to A maturity carcasses, and to raise the minimum marbling score to qualify for Choice to modest for B maturity cattle.  These changes were implemented to improve the uniformity and consistency of the grading system.
Yield grades are intended to estimate the pounds of boneless closely trimmed retail cuts from the carcass. Closely trimmed refers to approximately ¼ inch of external fat. Yield grade is determined by considering 4 carcass characteristics: external fat, Kidney, pelvic and heart fat (KPH), Ribeye area (REA), and Hot carcass weight (HCW). The amount of external fat is measured at the ribbed surface between the 12th and 13th ribs. The ribbing of carcasses is described in the U.S. standards for beef grading.  External fat is measured at a distance of ¾ the length of the ribeye from the chine bone end.  This initial number can be adjusted up or down depending on any abnormal fat deposits. As the amount of external fat increases, the percent of retail cuts decreases.

Kidney fat is assessed subjectively and is expressed as a percentage of the carcass weight. As the percentage of KPH increases, the percent of retail cuts decreases. The ribeye area is measured at the ribbed surface, it can be estimated subjectively or measured with a device approved by the AMS.  As ribeye area increase, percent retail cuts increases.  Hot carcass weight is used to determine yield grade. As carcass weight increases, percent retail cuts decrease. The following equation is used to determine yield grade:

:&lt;math&gt;{\text{YG} = 2.5
+ \left(2.5 \times \text{adjusted fat thickness}\right)
+ \left(0.2 \times \text{percent KPH}\right)
+ \left(0.0038 \times \text{HCW}\right)
- \left(0.32 \times \text{REA}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

There are five grades, 1-5.  Yield grade one carcasses are of the highest cutability, while yield grade 5 yields the lowest cutability.

Beef sold in U.S. restaurants and supermarkets is usually described by its USDA grade; however, in the early twenty-first century many restaurants and retailers began selling beef on the strength of [[brand name]]s and the reputation of a specific breed of cattle, such as [[Angus cattle|black Angus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== European Union EUROP Classification ==
The  [[EUROP grid]] method of carcass classification was implemented in 1981. European Economic Community Regulations (EEC) No. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1981R1208:19910429:EN:PDF 1208/81] and No. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1981R2930:19910730:EN:PDF 2930/81] were enacted to facilitate the application of a community scale for the classification of carcases of adult bovine animals. This was to ensure the uniform classification of the carcases of adult bovine animals in the EEC and make the definitions of conformation classes and fat classes more precise. The need arose for a common grading scale when member states of the EEC began operating in the common beef market in 1968 (EEC) No. 805/68 and price reporting to the EC became mandatory.

In the UK, the Meat and Livestock Commission ([https://web.archive.org/web/20101127052714/http://www.mlcsl.co.uk/ MLC Services Ltd]) is responsible for the classification of over 80% of the cattle slaughtered in Britain. The EUROP grid consists of a 5-point scale in which each conformation and fat class is subdivided into low medium and high classes resulting in 15 classes. In the UK, the fat classes range from 1-5 with classes 4 and 5 having a high and low sub-class which results in a seven-point scale for fatness (figure 1). It is argued by the MLC that this subdivision allows a more precise description of the carcase.

The price a farmer receives for a beast sent for slaughter is calculated by multiplying the carcase weight by the classification price for a particular category of animal (heifer, steer, bull, cow etc.). This classification is subjectively assigned by the meat grader according to the EUROP system where E is excellent, U is Very Good, R is Good, O is Fair and P is Poor. Likewise for the fat class, where 1 is Low, 2 is Slight, 3 is Average, 4 is High, and 5 is Very High. A typical classification would be R4L where the R refers to a "Good” carcass with an “Average” to “High” covering of fat according to the [http://www.mlcsl.co.uk/pdf/Beef%20Carcase%20Classification%2021Apr.pdf MLC].

The grader is usually an independent classifier who also monitors carcass dressing specification. Most classifiers are employed by MLC services and they are audited quarterly by the [[Rural Payments Agency|Rural Payments Agency (RPA)]] which is a government organisation. More recently Video [[Image analysis]] has been used to classify beef carcasses according to the EUROP scale. There are several machines that can do this, several of which were [http://www.teagasc.ie/research/reports/foodprocessing/4659/eopr-4659.asp trialled in Ireland]. The [[Republic of Ireland]] has used video image analysis for assignment of the EUROP classification grid since 2004.

Two main problems that are often cited in reference to the EUROP grid are its subjective application and its lack of consideration for meat eating quality.{{Citation needed |date= August 2013}}

[[File:Algae hydrogen production.jpg|thumb|Microbial hydrogen production.]]
'''Biohydrogen''' is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is produced biologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biohydrogen|editor=M. Rögner|year=2015|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-033673-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interest is high in this technology because H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a clean fuel and can be readily produced from certain kinds of biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Y.-H. Percival Zhang "Hydrogen Production from Carbohydrates: A Mini-Review" in "Sustainable Production of Fuels, Chemicals, and Fibers from Forest Biomass" ACS Symposium Series, 2011, Volume 1067, pages=203-216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many challenges characterize this technology, including those intrinsic to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as storage and transportation of a noncondensible gas.  Hydrogen producing organisms are poisoned by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Yields of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are often low.

==Biochemical principles==
The main reactions involve [[fermentation]] of sugars.  Important reactions start with [[glucose]], which is converted to [[acetic acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;Thauer, R. K., "Biochemistry of Methanogenesis: a Tribute to Marjory Stephenson", Microbiology 1998, 144, 2377-2406.  {{DOI|10.1099/00221287-144-9-2377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
A related reaction gives [[formate]] instead of [[carbon dioxide]]:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 HCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
These reactions are exergonic by 216 and 209 kcal/mol, respectively.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production is catalyzed by two [[hydrogenase]]s.  One is called [FeFe]-hydrogenase; the other is called [NiFe]-hydrogenase.  Many organisms express these enzymes.  Notable examples are members of the genera [[Clostridium]], [[Desulfovibrio]], [[Ralstonia]], and the pathogen ''[[Helicobacter]]''.  ''[[E. coli]]'' is the workhorse for genetic engineering of hydrogenases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Cammack, R.; Frey, M.; Robson, R.|title=Hydrogen as a Fuel: Learning from Nature|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|place=London|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that 99% of all organisms utilize [[dihydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Most of these species are microbes and their ability to use H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a metabolite arises from the expression of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[metalloenzyme]]s known as hydrogenases.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogenases are sub-classified into three different types based on the active site metal content: iron-iron hydrogenase, nickel-iron hydrogenase, and iron hydrogenase.

==History==
In 1933, [[Marjory Stephenson]] and her student Stickland reported that cell suspensions catalysed the reduction of [[methylene blue]] with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Six years later, [[Hans Gaffron]] observed that the green photosynthetic alga ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'', would sometimes  produce hydrogen.  Gaffron and many other scientists failed to elucidate how it induced hydrogen production. In the late 1990s [[Anastasios Melis]] discovered that deprivation of sulfur induces the alga to switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis) to the production of hydrogen. He found that the [[enzyme]] responsible for this reaction is [[hydrogenase]], but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis also discovered that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted their internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5 Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chlamydomonas moewusii'' is also a promising strain for the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/127/3/740 |vauthors=Melis A, Happe T|lastauthoramp=yes |year = 2001 | title = Hydrogen Production.

==Industrial hydrogen==
Competing for biohydrogen, at least for commercial applications, are many mature industrial processes.

{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}
In science, computing, and engineering, a '''black box''' is a device, system or object which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs (or [[Transfer function|transfer characteristics]]), without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is "opaque" (black). Almost anything might be referred to as a black box: a [[transistor]], an [[algorithm]], or the [[human brain]].

[[File:Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png|thumb|centre|595x595px|&lt;center&gt;Black box model&lt;/center&gt;]]

To analyse something modeled as an [[open system (systems theory)|open system]], with a typical "black box approach", only  the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) ''box''. The usual representation of this ''black box system''  is a [[data flow diagram]] centered in the box.

The opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic are available for inspection, which is most commonly referred to as a [[white box (software engineering)|white box]] (sometimes also known as a "clear box" or a "glass box"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Holzinger|first=Andreas|last2=Plass|first2=Markus|last3=Holzinger|first3=Katharina|last4=Crisan|first4=Gloria Cerasela|last5=Pintea|first5=Camelia-M.|last6=Palade|first6=Vasile|date=2017-08-03|title=A glass-box interactive machine learning approach for solving NP-hard problems with the human-in-the-loop|eprint=1708.01104|class=cs.AI}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==History==

The modern meaning of the term "black box" seems to have entered the English language around 1945. In electronic [[circuit theory]] the process of [[network synthesis filters|network synthesis]] from [[transfer function]]s, which led to electronic circuits being regarded as "black boxes" characterized by their response to signals applied to their [[Port (circuit theory)|ports]], can be traced to [[Wilhelm Cauer]] who published his ideas in their most developed form in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Cauer, Wilhelm; ''Theorie der linearen Wechselstromschaltungen'', '''Vol.I''', Akademische Verlags-Gesellschaft Becker und Erler, Leipzig, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Cauer did not himself use the term, others who followed him certainly did describe the method as black-box analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Cauer, Emil; Mathis, Wolfgang; and Pauli, Rainer; "Life and Work of Wilhelm Cauer (1900&amp;nbsp;– 1945)", ''Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Symposium of Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS2000)'', p4, Perpignan, June, 2000. [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall03/cs323/links/cauer.pdf Retrieved online] 19 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vitold Belevitch]]&lt;ref&gt;Belevitch, Vitold; "Summary of the history of circuit theory", ''Proceedings of the IRE'', '''vol 50''', Iss 5, pp. 848-855, May 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; puts the concept of black-boxes even earlier, attributing the explicit use of [[two-port network]]s as black boxes to [[Franz Breisig]] in 1921 and argues that 2-terminal components were implicitly treated as black-boxes before that.

In [[cybernetics]], a full treatment was given by [[Ross Ashby]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="ash56"&gt;Ashby, W. Ross; ''An introduction to cybernetics'', London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1956, chapter 6: ''The black box'', pp. 86{{ndash}}117.&lt;/ref&gt; A black box was described by [[Norbert Wiener]] in 1961 as an unknown system that was to be identified using the techniques of [[system identification]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Norbert; ''Cybernetics: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine'', MIT Press, 1961, {{ISBN|0-262-73009-X}}, page xi&lt;/ref&gt;  He saw the first step in [[Self organization#Self-organization in cybernetics|self-organization]] as being to be able to copy the output behavior of a black box. Many other engineers, scientists and epistemologists, as [[Mario Bunge]],&lt;ref name="Bunge63"/&gt;  used and perfected the black box theory in the 1960s.

==System theory==
[[File:OpenSystemRepresentation.svg|thumb|252px|The ''[[Open system (systems theory)|open system theory]]'' is the foundation of ''black box theory''. Both have focus on input and output flows, representing exchanges with the surroundings.]]
The ''black box'' is an abstraction representing a class of concrete [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] which can be viewed solely in terms of its ''stimuli inputs'' and ''output reactions'':
{{Quotation|The constitution and structure of the box are altogether irrelevant to the approach under consideration, which is purely external or phenomenological. In other words, only the behavior of the system will be accounted for.|[[Mario Bunge|Bunge]]&lt;ref name="Bunge63"&gt;Bunge, Mario; "A general black-box theory", Philosophy of Science, Vol. 30, No. 4, 1963, pp. 346-358. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/186066 jstor/186066]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The understanding of a ''black box'' is based on the "explanatory principle", the [[hypothesis]] of a [[causal relation]] between the ''input'' and the ''output'', and:&lt;ref name="gla09"&gt;Glanville, Ranulph; "Black Boxes", Cybernetics and Human Knowing, 2009, pp. 153-167.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''input'' and ''output'' being believed to be distinct,
* having observable (and relatable) inputs and outputs,
* being black to the observer (non-openable).

=== Recording of observed states ===
[[File:Hidrograma.png|thumb|252px|The observed [[hydrograph]] is a graphic of the response of a [[Drainage basin|watershed]] (a blackbox) with its [[Surface runoff|runoff]] (red) to an input of rainfall (blue).]]

An observer makes observations over time. All observations of inputs and outputs of a ''black box'' can be written in a table with the form:
{|border="1"
!↓Time
!States of input and output
|-
|...
|... ...
|-
|...
|... ...
|}

in which, at each of a sequence of times, the states of the ''box’s'' various parts, input and output, are recorded. Thus, using an example from [[William Ross Ashby|Ashby]], examining a box that has fallen from a [[flying saucer]] might lead to this protocol:&lt;ref name="ash56" /&gt;

{|border="1"
!↓Time
!States of input and output
|-
|11:18&amp;nbsp;a.m.
|I did nothing—the Box emitted a steady hum at 240&amp;nbsp;Hz.
|-
|11:19
|I pushed over the switch marked K: the note rose to 480&amp;nbsp;Hz and remained steady.
|-
|11:20
|I accidentally pushed the button marked “!”—the Box increased in temperature by 20&amp;nbsp;°C.
|-
|...
|... Etc.
|}
[[File:Blackbox3D-obs.png|thumb|252px|When the observer (an [[Multi-agent system|agent]]) can also do some stimulus (input), the relation with the black box is not only an observation, but an [[experiment]].]]

Thus every system, fundamentally, is investigated by the collection of a long protocol, drawn out in time, showing the sequence of input and output states. From this there follows the fundamental deduction that all knowledge obtainable from a Black Box (of given input and output) is such as can be obtained by re-coding the protocol (the ''observation table''); all that, and nothing more.&lt;ref name="ash56" /&gt;

If the observer also controls input, the investigation turns into an [[experiment]] (illustration), and hypotheses about [[Causality|cause and effect]] can be tested directly.

When the experimenter is also motivated to control the box, there is an active feedback in the box/observer relation, promoting what in [[Control system|control theory]] is called a [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] architecture.

===Modeling ===
The ''modeling process'' is the construction of a predictive [[mathematical model]], using existing historic data (observation table).

=== Testing the black box model===
A developed ''black box model'' is a validated model when ''[[black-box testing]]'' methods&lt;ref name="BS7925"&gt;See for ex. the British standard BS 7925-2 (Software component testing), or its 2001 work draft,&lt;br /&gt;BCS SIGIST (British Computer Society Specialist Interest Group in Software Testing), "Standard for Software Component Testing", Working Draft 3.4, 27 April 2001 [http://www.testingstandards.co.uk/bs_7925-2.htm webpage].&lt;/ref&gt; ensures that it is, based solely on [[Observation#Observation in science|observable]] elements.

With [[backtesting]], inputs for past events (not used in the "modeling effort") are entered into the model to see how well the output matches the known results.

==Other theories==
''Black box theories'' are things defined only in terms of their function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/black-box-theory Definition from Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O98-blackboxtheory.html definition from highbeam]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''black box theory'' is applied to any field, [[philosophy]] and [[science]] or otherwise where some inquiry or definition is made into the relations between the appearance of something (exterior/outside), i.e. here specifically the thing's black box state, related to its  characteristics and behaviour within (interior/inner).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new-science-theory.com/isaac-newton.html Black box theory applied briefly to Isaac Newton]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 374288 | volume=9 | issue=2 | title=What's inside the black box: a case study of allocative politics in the Hill-Burton program | journal=Int J Health Serv | pages=313–39 | last1 = Feshbach | first1 = D | doi=10.2190/ltd9-c9c7-x1lf-pmnm| year=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, the inquiry is focused upon a thing that has no immediately apparent characteristics and therefore has only factors for consideration held within itself hidden from immediate observation. The observer is assumed ignorant in the first instance as the majority of available [[data]] is held in an inner situation away from [[wikt:facile|facile]] investigations. The ''black box'' element of the definition is shown as being characterised by a system where observable elements enter a perhaps imaginary box with a set of different outputs emerging which are also observable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/186066 Physics dept, Temple University, Philadelphia]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adoption in humanities ===
In [[Humanities|humanities disciplines]] such as [[philosophy of mind]] and [[behaviorism]], one of the uses of black box theory is to describe and understand [[psychological]] factors in fields such as marketing when applied to an analysis of [[consumer behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcbowles.com/courses/adv_dip/module12/chapter4/amc12_ch4_two.htm Institute for working futures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626014001/http://www.marcbowles.com/courses/adv_dip/module12/chapter4/amc12_ch4_two.htm |date=26 June 2012 }} part of Advanced Diploma in Logistics and Management.

==Examples==
* In [[computer programming]] and [[software engineering]], ''[[black box testing]]'' is used to check that the output of a program is as expected, given certain inputs.&lt;ref&gt;Beizer, Boris; ''Black-Box Testing: Techniques for Functional Testing of Software and Systems'', 1995, {{ISBN|0-471-12094-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "black box" is used because the actual program being executed is not examined.
* In [[computing]] in general, a ''black box program'' is one where the user cannot see the inner workings (perhaps because it is a [[closed source]] program) or one which has no side effects and the function of which need not be examined, a routine suitable for re-use.
* Also in [[computing]], a black box refers to a piece of equipment provided by a vendor, for the purpose of using that vendor's product. It is often the case that the vendor maintains and supports this equipment, and the company receiving the black box typically is hands-off.
* In [[neural network]]ing or [[heuristic algorithm]]s (computer terms generally used to describe 'learning' computers or 'AI simulations'), a black box is used to describe the constantly changing section of the program environment which cannot easily be tested by the programmers. This is also called a [[White box (software engineering)|white box]] in the context that the program code can be seen, but the code is so complex that it is functionally equivalent to a black box.
* In [[physics]], a black box is a system whose internal structure is unknown, or need not be considered for a particular purpose.
* In [[mathematical model]]ing, a limiting case.
* In [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]], the school of [[behaviorism]] sees the human mind as a black box;&lt;ref name="FriSil06"&gt;"Mind as a Black Box: The Behaviorist Approach", pp. 85-88, in Friedenberg, Jay; and Silverman, Gordon; ''Cognitive Science: An Introduction to the Study of Mind'', Sage Publications, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; see ''[[#Other theories|other theories]]''.
* In [[neorealism in international relations|neorealist]] [[international relations theory]], the [[sovereign state]] is generally considered a black box: states are assumed to be unitary, [[homo economicus|rational, self-interested actors]], and the actual decision-making processes of the state are disregarded as being largely irrelevant. [[Liberalism in international relations|Liberal]] and [[constructivism in international relations|constructivist]] theorists often criticize neorealism for the "black box" model, and refer to much of their work on how states arrive at decisions as "breaking open the black box".
* In [[cryptography]] to capture the notion of knowledge obtained by an algorithm through the execution of a [[cryptographic protocol]] such as a [[zero-knowledge proof]] protocol. If the output of an algorithm when interacting with the protocol matches that of a simulator given some inputs, it 'need not know' anything more than those inputs.

''Black Box theory'' is, however, even wider in application than these professional studies:

{{Quotation|The child who tries to open a door has to manipulate the handle (the input) so as to produce the desired movement at the latch (the output); and he has to learn how to control the one by the other without being able to see the internal mechanism that links them. In our daily lives we are confronted at every turn with systems whose internal mechanisms are not fully open to inspection, and which must be treated by the methods appropriate to the Black Box.|Ashby&lt;ref name="ash56" /&gt;}}

{{Quotation|(...) This simple rule proved very effective and is an illustration of how the Black Box principle in cybernetics can be used to control situations that, if gone into deeply, may seem very complex. &lt;br&gt;A further example of the Black Box principle is the treatment of mental patients. The human brain is certainly a Black Box, and while a great deal of neurological research is going on to understand the mechanism of the brain, progress in treatment is also being made by observing patients' responses to stimuli.|Duckworth, Gear and Lockett&lt;ref&gt;WE Duckworth, AE Gear and AG Lockett (1977), "A Guide to Operational Research". {{DOI|10.1007/978-94-011-6910-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other uses of the term==
* In [[aviation]], the [[flight recorder]] is often called a "black box", especially by the media, although it is usually bright orange to facilitate its discovery after a crash. In an [[airplane]] or [[helicopter]], the flight recorder consists of two independent devices that are usually combined in a single unit. The flight [[data recorder]] logs information about controls and sensors, and the [[cockpit]] voice recorder preserves the most recent sounds in the cockpit, including conversation of the pilots. If an accident happens, investigators can use the recordings to assist in the investigation.
** Similarly, the [[train event recorder]] in [[rail transport]] and the [[voyage data recorder]] in maritime transport are often called "black boxes".
* In [[amateur radio]] the term "black box operator" is a disparaging or self-deprecating description of someone who operates factory-made radios without having a good understanding of how they work. Such operators do not build their own equipment (an activity called "homebrewing") or repair their own "black boxes".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.g3ngd.talktalk.net/1950.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chord diagram''' is a graphical method of displaying the inter-relationships between data in a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The data are arranged radially around a circle with the relationships between the data points typically drawn as arcs connecting the data.

The format can be aesthetically pleasing, making it a popular choice in the world of [[data visualization]].

== Name ==

Chord diagrams get their name from terminology used in [[geometry]]. A [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] of a circle is a geometric line segment whose endpoints both lie on the circle. Chord diagrams are also known as '''radial network diagrams''' and may sometimes be referred to as a type of [[circular layout]].

== Hierarchical edge bundling ==
While a small amount of data could be represented in a circular diagram using straight lines to show the interconnections, a diagram featuring numerous lines would quickly become illegible. 
To reduce the visual complexity, chord diagrams employ a technique called [[hierarchical edge bundling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Clark is a veteran of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Black Power movement]], and [[Pan-African]] movement. She was a field secretary for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] and played a key role establishing equal [[Selma to Montgomery marches|voting rights in Selma]], Alabama.  She was also an organizer with the [[Birmingham campaign]], as well as throughout Mississippi. Her work has included activism in the fields of [[women's rights]] and [[Labor rights|workers' rights]], as well as activism and advocacy for homeless people and youth. She worked with the [[Cynthia McKinney]] for President campaign with "Power to the People". Clark is a member of the Reconstruction Party (USA), and is a chair of Grandmothers for the Release of [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]].

==Civil Rights==
Clark was a student at [[Tougaloo College]], an [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black college]] in [[Tougaloo, Mississippi]] when she became involved with the Civil Rights Movement. An activist with the [[NAACP]], she was involved with voter registration efforts.&lt;ref name="CRDL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crdl.usg.edu/people/c/clark_colia_liddell/?Welcome|title=Clark, Colia Liddell|work=Civil Rights Digital Library|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the guidance of Medgar Evers and John Salter, Clark founded the [[NAACP Youth Council]] in [[North Jackson, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name="Rosche"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themaneater.com/stories/2006/2/7/civil-rights-leader-talk-today/|title=Civil rights leader to talk today|last=Rosche|first=Jedd|date=February 7, 2006|work=[[The Maneater]]|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working with the NAACP, she became special assistant to [[Medgar Evers]], [[field secretary]] for the [[NAACP]]. In 1962 Clark resigned from the NAACP and joined the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) to do voter registration work alongside her then husband, [[Bernard Lafayette]], in Alabama. This project laid essential groundwork for the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma voting rights campaign]] of 1965. She was eventually named executive secretary of SNCC.&lt;ref name="Rosche"/&gt; She also participated in street demonstrations and experienced police brutality in the [[Birmingham campaign]] of 1963.

In 1964, she helped found the Southern Organizing Committee at Fisk University.&lt;ref name="crmvet.org"&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/vet/colial.htm "Colia Liddell Lafayette Clark" Civil Rights Movement Veterans website]&lt;/ref&gt; She was an organizer in the [[Black Power]] movement, including the [[Republic of New Afrika]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3758873/The_Malcolm_X_Doctrine_The_Republic_of_New_Afrika_and_National_Liberation_on_U.S._Soil Dan Berger "The Malcolm X Doctrine: The Republic of New Afrika and National Liberation on U.S. Soil" in ''New World Coming: The Sixties and the Shaping of Global Consciousness'']&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1973, she returned to Mississippi and worked on a number of other projects including the editorship of the ''[[Jackson Advocate]]''.&lt;ref name="crmvet.org"/&gt;

Clark has been critical of the way in which the Civil Rights Movement has been portrayed in popular media, particularly in the film ''[[Selma film|Selma]]'', arguing it belittles student activism and does nothing to address the legacy of inequality. She is a vocal supporter of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement, seeing it (along with the Black Power movement) as a successor to the Civil Rights Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialistorganizer.org/interview-with-colia-lafayette-clark-we-have-to-finish-the-march-of-the-civil-rights-movement/ Anthony Palmer "Interview with Colia LaFayette Clark: We Have to Finish the March of the Civil Rights Movement!”  Socialist Organizer, March 3, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111604/http://socialistorganizer.org/interview-with-colia-lafayette-clark-we-have-to-finish-the-march-of-the-civil-rights-movement/ |date=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Green Party==
She was co-chair of the New York delegation to the Green Party of the United States presidential nominating convention, where Cynthia McKinney was nominated as the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] Presidential candidate. Clark is currently working on writing, activism and advocacy about Haiti.

==Education==
Clark attended [[Tougaloo College]] and earned a M.A. from [[Albany State University]] in [[Albany, GA]], where she later worked as a professor.&lt;ref name="Rosche"/&gt;

'''Ecological modernization''' is a school of thought in the social sciences that argues that the [[economy]] benefits from moves towards [[environmentalism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} It has gained increasing attention among scholars and policymakers in the last several decades internationally. It is an analytical approach as well as a policy strategy and [[environmentalism|environmental]] [[discourse]] (Hajer, 1995).

==Origins and key elements==
Ecological modernization emerged in the early 1980s within a group of scholars at Free University and the Social Science Research Centre in Berlin, among them [[Joseph Huber (economist)|Joseph Huber]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Martin Jänicke|de}} and {{ill|Udo E. Simonis|de}}. Various authors pursued similar ideas at the time, e.g. [[Arthur H. Rosenfeld]], [[Amory Lovins]], Donald Huisingh, René Kemp, or [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker]]. Further substantial contributions were made by [[Arthur P.J. Mol]], [[Gert Spaargaren]] and [[David A Sonnenfeld]] (Mol and Sonnenfeld, 2000; Mol, 2001).

One basic assumption of ecological modernization relates to environmental readaptation of economic growth and industrial development. On the basis of [[enlightened self-interest]], economy and ecology can be favourably combined: Environmental [[productivity]], i.e. productive use of natural resources and environmental media (air, water, soil, ecosystems), can be a source of future growth and development in the same way as [[labour productivity]] and capital productivity. This includes increases in energy and resource efficiency as well as product and process innovations such as environmental management and sustainable [[supply chain management]], [[clean technology|clean technologies]], benign substitution of hazardous substances, and product design for environment. Radical innovations in these fields can not only reduce quantities of resource turnover and emissions, but also change the quality or structure of the [[industrial metabolism]]. In the co-evolution of humans and nature, and in order to upgrade the environment’s [[carrying capacity]], ecological modernization gives humans an active role to play, which may entail conflicts with nature conservation.

There are different understandings of the scope of ecological modernization - whether it is just about techno-industrial progress and related aspects of policy and economy, and to what extent it also includes cultural aspects (ecological modernization of mind, value orientiations, attitudes, behaviour and lifestyles). Similarly, there is some pluralism as to whether ecological modernization would need to rely mainly on government, or markets and entrepreneurship, or civil society, or some sort of [[multi-level governance]] combining the three. Some scholars explicitly refer to general [[modernization theory]] as well as non-Marxist [[world-systems approach|world-system theory]], others don’t.

Ultimately, however, there is a common understanding that ecological modernization will have to result in innovative structural change. So research is now still more focused on environmental innovations, or eco-innovations, and the interplay of various societal factors (scientific, economic, institutional, legal, political, cultural) which foster or hamper such innovations (Klemmer et al., 1999; Huber, 2004; Weber and Hemmelskamp, 2005; Olsthoorn and Wieczorek, 2006).

Ecological modernization shares a number of features with neighbouring, overlapping approaches. Among the most important are
*the concept of [[sustainable development]]
*the approach of [[industrial metabolism]] ([[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Ayres]] and [[Udo Simonis|Simonis]], 1994)
*the concept of [[industrial ecology]] ([[Robert H. Socolow|Socolow]], 1994)

==Additional elements==
A special topic of ecological modernization research during recent years was ''sustainable household'', i.e. environment-oriented reshaping of lifestyles, consumption patterns, and demand-pull control of supply chains (Vergragt, 2000; OECD 2002). 
Some scholars of ecological modernization share an interest in [[industrial symbiosis]], i.e. inter-site recycling that helps to reduce the consumption of resources via increasing efficiency (i.e. pollution prevention, waste reduction), typically by taking externalities from one economic production process and using them as raw material inputs for another (Christoff, 1996). 
Ecological modernization also relies on product life-cycle assessment and the analysis of materials and energy flows. In this context, ecological modernization promotes 'cradle to cradle' manufacturing ([[Michael Braungart|Braungart]] and [[William McDonough|McDonough]], 2002), contrasted against the usual 'cradle to grave' forms of manufacturing - where waste is not re-integrated back into the production process. 
Another special interest in the ecological modernization literature has been the role of [[social movement]]s and the emergence of civil society as a key agent of change ([[Dana R. Fisher|Fisher]] and Freudenburg, 2001).

As a [[strategy]] of change, some forms of ecological modernization may be favored by [[business]] interests because they seemingly meet the triple bottom line of economics, society, and environment, which, it is held, underpin sustainability, yet do not challenge [[free market]] principles. This contrasts with many [[environmental movement]] perspectives, which regard [[free trade]] and its notion of business self-regulation as part of the problem, or even an origin of [[environmental degradation]]. Under ecological modernization, the [[State (polity)|state]] is seen in a variety of roles and capacities: as the enabler for [[Market (economics)|market]]s that help produce the technological advances via competition; as the regulatory (see [[regulation]]) medium through which [[corporation]]s are forced to 'take back' their various wastes and re-integrate them in some manner into the production of new goods and services (e.g. the way that [[Automobile|car]] corporations in Germany are required to accept back cars they manufactured once those vehicles have reached the end of their product lifespan); and in some cases as an institution that is incapable of addressing critical local, national, and global environmental problems. In the latter case, ecological modernization shares with [[Ulrich Beck]] (1999, 37-40) and others notions of the necessity of emergence of new forms of [[environmental governance]], sometimes referred to as subpolitics or political modernization, where the [[environmental movement]], community groups, businesses, and other stakeholders increasingly take on direct and leadership roles in stimulating environmental transformation. Political modernization of this sort requires certain supporting norms and institutions such as a free, independent, or at least critical press, basic [[human rights]] of expression, organization, and assembly, etc.  [[New media]] such as the [[Internet]] greatly facilitate this.

==Criticisms==
Critics argue that ecological modernization will fail to protect [[environment (biophysical)|the environment]] and does nothing to alter the  impulses within the capitalist economic mode of production (see [[capitalism]]) that inevitably lead to environmental degradation (Foster, 2002). As such, it is just a form of '[[green-washing]]'. Critics question whether [[technology|technological]] advances alone can achieve resource conservation and better [[environmental protection]], particularly if left to business [[self-regulatory organization|self-regulation]] practices (York and Rosa, 2003). For instance, many technological improvements are currently feasible but not widely utilized. The most [[environmentally friendly]] product or manufacturing process (which is often also the most economically efficient) is not always the one automatically chosen by self-regulating corporations (e.g. [[hydrogen]] or [[biofuel]] vs. [[peak oil]]). In addition, some critics have argued that ecological modernization does not redress gross [[injustices]] that are produced within the capitalist system, such as [[environmental racism]] - where [[people of color]] and low income earners bear a disproportionate burden of environmental harm such as pollution, and lack access to environmental benefits such as [[parks]], and [[social justice]] issues such as eliminating [[unemployment]] (Bullard, 1993; Gleeson and Low, 1999; Harvey, 1996) - [[environmental racism]] is also referred to as issues of the asymmetric distribution of environmental resources and services (Everett &amp; Neu, 2000). Moreover, the theory seems to have limited global efficacy, applying primarily to its countries of origin - [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]], and having little to say about the [[developing world]] (Fisher and Freudenburg, 2001). Perhaps the harshest criticism though, is that ecological modernization is predicated upon the notion of 'sustainable growth', and in reality this is not possible because growth entails the consumption of natural and human capital at great costs to [[ecosystem]]s and societies.

Ecological modernization, its effectiveness and applicability, strengths and limitations, remains a dynamic and contentious area of environmental social science research and policy discourse in the early 21st century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26195">In [[psychology]] and [[behavioral economics]], the '''endowment effect''' (also known as '''divestiture aversion''' and related to the [[mere ownership effect]] in [[social psychology]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url =|title = On the social nature of nonsocial perception: The mere ownership effect|last = Beggan|first = J.|date = 1992|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.62.2.229|pmid = |access-date =|volume=62|issue = 2|pages=229–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the hypothesis that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them.&lt;ref name="Roeckelein2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=J. E. |last=Roeckelein |title=Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Yn6NZgxvssC&amp;pg=PA147 |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=0-08-046064-X |page=147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015" /&gt;

This is typically illustrated in two ways.&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Explanations of the endowment effect: an integrative review|url = |journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date = 2015|pages = 339–348|volume = 19|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2015.04.004|pmid = 25939336|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Colleen E.|last2 = Giblin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a valuation paradigm, [[willingness to pay|people will tend to pay more]] to retain something they own than to obtain something they do not own—even when there is no cause for attachment, or even if the item was only obtained minutes ago. In an exchange paradigm, people given a good are reluctant to trade it for another good of similar value. For example, participants first given a Swiss chocolate bar were generally unwilling to trade it for a coffee mug, whereas participants first given the coffee mug were generally unwilling to trade it for the chocolate bar.

A more controversial third paradigm used to elicit the endowment effect is the [[Mere ownership effect|mere ownership]] paradigm, primarily used in experiments in psychology, marketing, and organizational behavior. In this paradigm, people who are randomly assigned to receive a good ("owners") evaluate it more positively than people who are not randomly assigned to receive the good ("controls").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015" /&gt; The distinction between this paradigm and the first two is that it is not [[incentive compatibility|incentive-compatible]]. In other words, participants are not explicitly incentivized to reveal the extent to which they truly like or value the good.

The endowment effect can be equated to the behavioural model [[willingness to accept|Willingness to Accept or Pay (WTAP)]], a formula sometimes used to find out how much a consumer or person is willing to put up with or lose for different outcomes.

==Examples==
One of the most famous examples of the endowment effect in the literature is from a study by [[Daniel Kahneman]], [[Jack Knetsch]] &amp; [[Richard Thaler]],&lt;ref name="KahnemanKnetschThaler" /&gt; in which participants were given a mug and then offered the chance to sell it or trade it for an equally valued alternative (pens). They found that the amount participants required as compensation for the mug once their ownership of the mug had been established ("willingness to accept") was approximately twice as high as the amount they were willing to pay to acquire the mug ("willingness to pay").

Other examples of the endowment effect include work by [[Ziv Carmon]] and [[Dan Ariely]],&lt;ref name="Carmon" /&gt; who found that participants' hypothetical selling price ([[willingness to accept]] or WTA) for NCAA final four tournament tickets were 14 times higher than their hypothetical buying price ([[willingness to pay]] or WTP). Also, work by Hossain and List (Working Paper) discussed in the Economist in 2010,&lt;ref name="Carrots" /&gt; showed that workers worked harder to maintain ownership of a provisional awarded bonus than they did for a bonus framed as a potential yet-to-be-awarded gain. In addition to these examples, the endowment effect has been observed using different goods&lt;ref name="Hoffman" /&gt; in a wide range of different populations, including children,&lt;ref name="Harbaugh" /&gt; great apes,&lt;ref name="Kanngiesser" /&gt; and new world monkeys.&lt;ref name="Lakshminaryanan" /&gt;

==Background==
The endowment effect has been observed from ancient times:

{{quote|text=For most things are differently valued by those who have them and by those who wish to get them: what belongs to us, and what we give away, always seems very precious to us.|author=Aristotle|source=[[The Nicomachean Ethics]] book IX (F.H. Peters translation)}}

Psychologists first noted the difference between consumers' WTP and WTA as early as the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Coombs" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SlovicLichtenstein1968 /&gt; The term ''endowment effect'' however was first explicitly coined by the economist [[Richard Thaler]] in reference to the under-weighting of [[opportunity costs]] as well as the inertia introduced into a consumer's choice processes when goods included in their endowment become more highly valued than goods that are not.&lt;ref name="Thaler" /&gt; In the years that followed, extensive investigations into the endowment effect have been conducted producing a wealth of interesting empirical and theoretical findings.&lt;ref name="Hoffman" /&gt;

==Theoretical explanations==

===Loss aversion===
It was proposed by Kahneman and his colleagues that the endowment effect is, in part, due to the fact that once a person owns an item, forgoing it feels like a loss, and humans are loss-averse.&lt;ref name="KahnemanKnetschThaler" /&gt; They go on to suggest that the endowment effect, when considered as a facet of loss-aversion, would thus violate the [[Coase theorem]], and was described as inconsistent with standard [[economic]] theory which asserts that a person's [[willingness to pay]] (WTP) for a good should be equal to their [[willingness to accept]] (WTA) compensation to be deprived of the good, a hypothesis which underlies [[consumer theory]] and [[indifference curves]]. However, these claims have been disputed and other researchers claim that ownership (attribution of the item to self) and not loss aversion is the key to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Morewedge2009" /&gt;

===Reference-dependent accounts===
According to reference-dependent theories, consumers first evaluate the potential change in question as either being a gain or a loss. In line with [[prospect theory]] (Tversky and Kahneman, 1979&lt;ref name="KahnemanTversky1979" /&gt;), changes that are framed as losses are weighed more heavily than are the changes framed as gains. Thus an individual owning "A" amount of a good, asked how much he/she would be willing to pay to acquire "B', would be willing to pay a value (B-A) that is lower than the value that he/she would be willing to accept to sell (C-A) units; the value function for perceived gains is not as steep as the value function for perceived losses.

Figure 1 presents this explanation in graphical form.  An individual at point A, asked how much he/she would be willing to accept (WTA) as compensation to sell X units and move to point C, would demand greater compensation for that loss than he/she would be willing to pay for an equivalent gain of X units to move him/her to point B. Thus the difference between (B-A) and (C-A) would account for the endowment effect. In other words, he/she expects more money while selling; but wants to pay less while buying the same amount of goods.

===Neoclassical explanations===
Hanemann (1991),&lt;ref name="Hanemann" /&gt; develops a [[neoclassical economic theory|neoclassical]] explanation for the endowment effect, accounting for the effect without invoking [[prospect theory]].

Figure 2 presents this explanation in graphical form. In the figure, two [[indifference curves]] for a particular good X and wealth are given. Consider an individual who is given goods X such they move from point A (where they have X&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of good X) to point B (where they have the same wealth and X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of good X). Their WTP represented by the vertical distance from B to C, because (after giving up that amount of wealth) the individual is indifferent about being at A or C. Now consider an individual who gives up goods such that they move from B to A. Their WTA represented by the (larger) vertical distance from A to D because (after receiving that much wealth) they are indifferent about either being at point B or D. Shogren et al. (1994)&lt;ref name="Shogren" /&gt; has reported findings that lend support to Hanemann's hypothesis.  However, Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1991)&lt;ref name="KKT91" /&gt; find that the endowment effect continues even when wealth effects are fully controlled for.

===Connection-based, or "psychological ownership" theories===
Connection-based theories propose that the attachment or association with the self-induced by owning a good is responsible for the endowment effect (for a review, see Morewedge &amp; Giblin, 2015&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015" /&gt;). Work by Morewedge, Shu, Gilbert and Wilson (2009)&lt;ref name="Morewedge2009" /&gt; provides support for these theories, as does work by Maddux et al. (2010).&lt;ref name=Maddux /&gt; For example, research participants who were given one mug and asked how much they would pay for a second mug ("owner-buyers") were WTP as much as "owners-sellers," another group of participants who were given a mug and asked how much they were WTA to sell it (both groups valued the mug in question more than buyers who were not given a mug).&lt;ref name="Morewedge2009" /&gt;  Others have argued that the short duration of ownership or highly prosaic items typically used in endowment effect type studies is not sufficient to produce such a connection, conducting research demonstrating support for those points (e.g. Liersch &amp; Rottenstreich, Working Paper).

Two paths by which attachment or self-associations increase the value of a good have been proposed (Morewedge &amp; Giblin, 2015).&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015" /&gt; An [[attachment theory]] suggests that ownership creates a non-transferrable valenced association between the self and the good. The good is incorporated into the self-concept of the owner, becoming part of her identity and imbuing it with attributes related to her self-concept. Self-associations may take the form of an emotional attachment to the good. Once an attachment has formed, the potential loss of the good is perceived as a threat to the self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A real-world example of this would be an individual refusing to part with a college T-shirt because it supports one's identity as an alumnus of that university. A second route by which ownership may increase value is through a [[Self-referential encoding|self-referential memory effect]] (SRE) – the better encoding and recollection of stimuli associated with the self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Symons|first1=Cynthia S.|last2=Johnson|first2=Blair T.|title=The self-reference effect in memory: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1997|volume=121|issue=3|pages=371–394|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.121.3.371|pmid=9136641}}&lt;/ref&gt; People have a better memory for goods they own than goods they do not own. The self-referential memory effect for owned goods may act thus as an endogenous framing effect. During a transaction, attributes of a good may be more accessible to its owners than are other attributes of the transaction. Because most goods have more positive than negative features, this accessibility bias should result in owners more positively evaluating their goods than do non-owners.&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015" /&gt;

=== Biased information processing theories ===
Several cognitive accounts of the endowment effect suggest that it is induced by the way endowment status changes the search for, attention to, recollection of, and weighting of information regarding the transaction. Frames evoked by acquisition of a good (e.g., buying, choosing it rather than another good) may increase the cognitive [[Spreading activation|accessibility]] of information favoring the decision to keep one's money and not acquire the good. By contrast, frames evoked by disposition of the good (e.g., selling) may increase the cognitive accessibility of information favoring the decision to keep the good rather than trade or dispose of it for money (for a review, see Morewedge &amp; Giblin, 2015).&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015" /&gt; For example, [[Query theory|Johnson and colleagues]] (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Eric J.|last2=Häubl|first2=Gerald|last3=Keinan|first3=Anat|title=Aspects of endowment: A query theory of value construction|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=2007|volume=33|issue=3|pages=461–474|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.33.3.461}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that prospective mug buyers tended to recall reasons to keep their money before recalling reasons to buy the mug, whereas sellers tended to recall reasons to keep their mug before reasons to sell it for money.

===Evolutionary arguments===
Huck, Kirchsteiger &amp; Oechssler (2005)&lt;ref name="Huck" /&gt; have raised the hypothesis that natural selection may favor individuals whose preferences embody an endowment effect given that it may improve one's bargaining position in bilateral trades. Thus in a small tribal society with a few alternative sellers (i.e. where the buyer may not have the option of moving to an alternative seller), having a predisposition towards embodying the endowment effect may be evolutionarily beneficial. This may be linked with findings (Shogren, et al., 1994&lt;ref name="Shogren" /&gt;) that suggest the endowment effect is less strong when the relatively artificial sense of scarcity induced in experimental settings is lessened. Countervailing evidence for an evolutionary account is provided by studies showing that the endowment effect is moderated by exposure to modern exchange markets (e.g., hunter gatherer tribes with market exposure are more likely to exhibit the endowment effect than tribes that do not),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evolutionary Origins of the Endowment Effect: Evidence from Hunter-Gatherers|date=2014|url = |journal = American Economic Review|pages = 1793–1805|volume = 104|issue = 6|doi = 10.1257/aer.104.6.1793|first = Coren L.|last = Apicella|first2 = Eduardo M.|last2 = Azevedo|first3 = Nicholas A.|last3 = Christakis|first4 = James H.|last4 = Fowler}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the endowment effect is moderated by culture (Maddux et al., 2010&lt;ref name="Maddux" /&gt;).

==Criticisms==
Some economists have questioned the effect's existence. Hanemann (1991)&lt;ref name="Hanemann" /&gt; noted that [[economic theory]] only suggests that WTP and WTA should be equal for goods which are close substitutes, so observed differences in these measures for goods such as environmental resources and personal health can be explained without reference to an endowment effect. Shogren, et al. (1994)&lt;ref name="Shogren" /&gt; noted that the experimental technique used by Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (1990)&lt;ref name="KahnemanKnetschThaler" /&gt; to demonstrate the endowment effect created a situation of artificial scarcity. They performed a more robust experiment with the same goods used by Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (chocolate bars and mugs) and found little evidence of the endowment effect. Others have argued that the use of hypothetical questions and experiments involving small amounts of money tells us little about actual behavior (e.g. Hoffman and Spitzer, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;69, n. 23&lt;ref name="Hoffman" /&gt;
) with some research supporting these points (e.g., Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler, 1990,&lt;ref name="KahnemanKnetschThaler" /&gt; Harless, 1989&lt;ref name="Harless" /&gt;) and others not (e.g. Knez, Smith and Williams, 1985)&lt;ref name="Knez" /&gt;

==Implications==
[[Herbert Hovenkamp]] (1991)&lt;ref name="Hovenkamp" /&gt; has argued that the presence of an endowment effect has significant implications for [[law]] and [[economics]], particularly in regard to [[welfare economics]]. He argues that the presence of an endowment effect indicates that a person has no [[indifference curve]] (see however Hanemann, 1991&lt;ref name="Hanemann" /&gt;) rendering the neoclassical tools of welfare analysis useless, concluding that courts should instead use WTA as a measure of value. Fischel (1995)&lt;ref name="Fischel" /&gt; however, raises the counterpoint that using WTA as a measure of value would deter the development of a nation's infrastructure and [[economic growth]]. The endowment effect changes the shape of the indifference curves substantially &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=http://docplayer.net/46319513-Behavioural-indifference-curves.html |title=“Behavioral Indifference Curves,” Australasian Journal of Economics Education. 2015, 2: 1-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The endowment effect has also been raised as a possible explanation for the lack of demand for [[reverse mortgage]] opportunities in the United States (contracts in which a home owner sells back her/his property to the bank in exchange for an annuity) (Huck, Kirchsteiger &amp; Oechssler, 2005).&lt;ref name="Huck" /&gt;

'''Failure bias''' is the [[logical error]] of concentrating on the people or things that failed to make it past some selection process and overlooking those that did, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of [[selection bias]].

In several of these cases, one measure of success is precisely the lack of [[public awareness]] of people or things that are undergoing such selection process, which means that, in the possibility that there is at least one agent who is interested in the success of the people or things that are going through the selection process, the agent(s) will be interested into keeping the subject out of the public eye, and thus, to raise the likelihood of the failure bias happening

[[Hong Kong]] has three main systems of [[units of measurement]] in current use:

* The [[Chinese units of measurement]] of the [[Qing Empire]] (no longer in widespread use in mainland China);{{cn|date=July 2015}}
* British [[Imperial units]]; and
* The [[metric system]].

In 1976 the [[Hong Kong Government]] started the conversion to the metric system, and as of 2012 measurements for government purposes, such as road signs, are almost always in metric units. However, all three systems are officially permitted for trade,&lt;ref name="Ordinance"&gt;[http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/68/sch2.html Cap 68 Sched 2 UNITS OF MEASUREMENT AND PERMITTED SYMBOLS OR ABBREVIATIONS OF UNITS OF MEASUREMENT LAWFUL FOR USE FOR TRADE]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the wider society a mixture of all three systems prevails.

==Length==

The Chinese system's most commonly used units were 里 (li), 丈 (tseung/cheung), 尺 (tsek/[[Shaku (unit)|chek]]), 寸 ([[tsun]]/chun), 分 ([[fen]]/fan) in descending scale order. These units are now rarely used in daily life, the Imperial and metric systems being preferred.

The Imperial system's units are written with the same basic Chinese characters as the Chinese system. In order to distinguish between the units of the two systems, the units can be prefixed with ''ying'' ({{zh|t=英|y=Yīng}}) for the British Imperial system and ''wa'' ({{zh|t=華|y=Wàh}}) for the Chinese system. In writing, derived characters are often used, with an additional 口(mouth) [[Kangxi radicals|radical]] to the left of the original Chinese character, for writing Imperial units. The most commonly used units are the [[mile]] or ''li'' ({{zh|t=哩|y=léih}}), the [[yard]] or ''ma'' ({{zh|t=碼|y=máh}}), the [[Foot (unit)|foot]] or ''chek'' ({{zh|t=呎|y=chek}}), and the [[inch]] or ''tsun'' ({{zh|t=吋|y=chyun}}).

==Weight==

Chinese, Imperial and metric weight units are all used in Hong Kong. The choice of system depends on the type of goods and their origins. Metric is used for all official purposes, for example the Post Office and Road signs.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;[http://www.hongkongpost.com/eng/postage/index.htm Hong Kong Post Pricing by Weight]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Driving"&gt;[http://www.td.gov.hk/en/road_safety/road_users_code/index/chapter_5_for_all_drivers/index.html Hong Kong Road Rules]&lt;/ref&gt; Packaged food weights and volumes may be given using any of the three systems of units.&lt;ref name="Labeling"&gt;
[http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/sch3.html Cap 132W Sched 3 MARKING AND LABELLING OF PREPACKAGED FOODS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional weights are still ''de facto'' standard in certain areas. For example, [[vegetables]], [[meats]], and [[Chinese medicine]]s are usually measured in Chinese units, while some [[fruits]] are normally measured using the Imperial system.

[[Precious metal]]s ([[gold]], [[silver]] and [[platinum]]) are traded in the Chinese troy weight system, which differs from other goods.

==Area==

The traditional measure of flat area is in [[square feet]] ({{zh|t=方呎, 平方呎|y=fōng chek, pìhng fōng chek}}) of the Imperial system. Apartment or office size is generally still given in square feet.  Traditionally, the measurement of agricultural plots and fields are conducted in 畝 (mau) of the Chinese system.

==Volume==
In Chinese system, the measurement of volume of [[rice]] is 斗 (tau) but it is replaced by packaged rice in weight.  The volume of [[water]] and [[fuel]] is the litre. The [[gallon]] (加侖, ka-lun) of the Imperial system is still occasionally used.

==Time==
Time measurement follows the international system. [[Gregorian calendar]] is usually used, but the [[Chinese calendar]] also plays a very important role in everyday life and in telling the dates of [[Public holidays in Hong Kong|traditional festivals]].

In the following table, multiple Chinese names are listed in the order of usage frequency.

'''Idempotence''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|,|ɪ|d|ɛ|m|ˈ|p|əʊ|t|ən|s}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=idempotence |dictionary=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/273873 |date=2010 |edition= 3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|aɪ|d|ə|m|-}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=idempotent |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idempotent |dictionary=[[Merriam-Webster]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019143953/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idempotent |archivedate=2016-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the property of certain [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. The concept of idempotence arises in a number of places in [[abstract algebra]] (in particular, in the theory of [[projector (linear algebra)|projector]]s and [[closure operator]]s) and [[functional programming]] (in which it is connected to the property of [[Referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]]).

The term was introduced by [[Benjamin Peirce]]&lt;ref&gt;Polcino &amp; Sehgal (2002), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of elements of algebras that remain invariant when raised to a positive integer power, and literally means "(the quality of having) the same power", from {{wikt-lang|la|idem}} + ''[[wikt:potence|potence]]'' (same + power).

== Definition ==
An element ''x'' of a [[Magma (algebra)|magma]] (''M'', •) is said to be ''idempotent'' if:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Valenza |first=Robert |date=2012 |title=Linear Algebra: An Introduction to Abstract Mathematics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7x8MCAAAQBAJ |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |page=22 |isbn=9781461209010 |quote=An element ''s'' of a magma such that ''ss'' = ''s'' is called ''idempotent''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Doneddu |first=Alfred |date=1976 |title=Polynômes et algèbre linéaire |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=5Ry7AAAAIAAJ |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=Vuibert |page=180 |isbn=|quote=Soit ''M'' un magma, noté multiplicativement. On nomme idempotent de ''M'' tout élément ''a'' de ''M'' tel que ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''x'' = ''x''}}.
If all elements are idempotent with respect to •, then • is called idempotent.
The formula ∀''x'', {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''x'' = ''x''}} is called the idempotency law for •.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=George Grätzer | title=General Lattice Theory | location=Basel | publisher=Birkhäuser | year=2003 }} Here: Sect.1.2, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Garrett Birkhoff | title=Lattice Theory | location=Providence | publisher=Am. Math. Soc. | series=Colloquium Publications | volume=25 | year=1967 }}. Here: Sect.I.5, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* The natural number 1 is an idempotent element with respect to [[multiplication]] (since 1[[multiplication|×]]1 = 1), and so is 0 (since 0×0=0), but no other natural number is (e.g. 2×2=2 does not hold). For the latter reason, multiplication of natural numbers is ''not'' an idempotent operation. More formally, in the [[monoid]] ([[Natural number|ℕ]], ×), idempotent elements are just 0 and 1.
* In a magma (''M'', •), an [[identity element]] ''e'' or an [[absorbing element]] ''a'', if it exists, is idempotent. Indeed, {{nowrap|1=''e'' • ''e'' = ''e''}} and {{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''a'' = ''a''}}.
* In a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] (''G'', •), the identity element ''e'' is the only idempotent element. Indeed, if ''x'' is an element of ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''x'' = ''x''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''x'' = ''x'' • ''e''}} and finally ''x'' = ''e'' by multiplying on the left by the [[inverse element]] of ''x''.

* Taking the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] ''x''[[intersection (set theory)|∩]]''y'' of two sets ''x'' and ''y'' is an idempotent operation, since ''x''∩''x'' always equals ''x''. This means that the idempotency law ∀''x'', ''x''∩''x'' = ''x'' is true. Similarly, taking the union of two sets is an idempotent operation. Formally, in the monoids (𝒫(''E''), ∪) and (𝒫(''E''), ∩) of the [[power set]] of the set ''E'' with the [[Union (set theory)|set union]] ∪ and [[Intersection (set theory)|set intersection]] ∩ respectively, all elements are idempotent; hence ∪ and ∩ are idempotent operations on 𝒫(''E'').
* In the monoids ({0, 1}, ∨) and ({0, 1}, ∧) of the [[Boolean domain]] with the [[logical disjunction]] ∨ and the  [[logical conjunction]] ∧ respectively, all elements are idempotent.

===Idempotent functions===
In the monoid (''F&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;'', ∘) of the [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from a set ''E'' to a [[subset]] ''F'' of ''E'' with the [[function composition]] ∘, idempotent elements are the functions {{nowrap|''f'': ''E'' → ''F''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''f'' = ''f''}}, in other words such that for all ''x'' in ''E'', {{nowrap|1=''f''(''f''(''x'')) = ''f''(''x'')}} (the image of each element in ''E'' is a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of ''f''). For example:
* Taking the [[absolute value]] ''abs''(''x'')&lt;ref&gt;A more common notation for this is &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt;, however, it is harder to read when expressions are nested.&lt;/ref&gt; of an [[integer number]] ''x'' is an idempotent function for the following reason: ''abs''(''abs''(''x'')) = ''abs''(''x'') is true for each integer number ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, this equation holds for all [[rational number|rational]], [[real number|real]] and even [[complex number]]s, too.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that ''abs'' [[function composition|∘]] ''abs'' = ''abs''&lt;ref&gt;This an an equation between functions. Two functions are equal if their domains and ranges agree, and their output values agree on their whole domain.&lt;/ref&gt; holds, that is, ''abs'' is an idempotent element in the set of all functions (from integers to integers)&lt;ref&gt;This set of functions is formally denoted as [[integer number|ℤ]]&lt;sup&gt;ℤ&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; with respect to function composition. Therefore, ''abs'' satisfies the above definition of an idempotent function.
Other examples include:
* the [[Identity function|identity]] function is idempotent;
* [[Constant function|constant]] functions are idempotent;
* the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]], [[Floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]] and [[fractional part]] functions are idempotent;
* the [[Generating set of a group|subgroup generated]] function from the power set of a group to itself is idempotent;
* the [[convex hull]] function from the power set of an [[affine space]] over the [[Real number|reals]] to itself is idempotent;
* the [[Closure (topology)|closure]] and [[Interior (topology)|interior]] functions of the power set of a [[topological space]] to itself are idempotent;
* the [[Kleene star]] and [[Kleene plus]] functions of the power set of a monoid to itself are idempotent;
* the idempotent [[endomorphism]]s of a [[vector space]] are its [[Projection (linear algebra)|projections]].

If the set ''E'' has ''n'' elements, we can partition it into ''k'' chosen fixed points and {{nowrap|''n'' − ''k''}} non-fixed points under ''f'', and then ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is the number of different idempotent functions. Hence, taking into account all possible partitions,
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} k^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;
is the total number of possible idempotent functions on the set. The [[integer sequence]] of the number of idempotent functions as given by the sum above for ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, … starts  with 1, 1, 3, 10, 41, 196, 1057, 6322, 41393, … {{OEIS|A000248}}.

Neither the property of being idempotent nor that of being not is preserved under function composition.&lt;ref&gt;If ''f'' and ''g'' commute, i.e. if {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''g'' = ''g'' ∘ ''f''}}, then idempotency of both ''f'' and ''g'' implies that of {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}}, since {{nowrap|1=(''f'' ∘ ''g'') ∘ (''f'' ∘ ''g'') = (''f'' ∘ ''f'') ∘ (''g'' ∘ ''g'') = ''f'' ∘ ''g''}}, using the associativity of composition.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example for the former, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''}} [[modulo arithmetic|mod]] 3 and ''g''(''x'') = max(''x'', 5) are both idempotent, but {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} is not,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''f''(''g''(7)) = ''f''(7) = 1, but ''f''(''g''(1)) = ''f''(5) = 2 ≠ 1&lt;/ref&gt; although {{nowrap|''g'' ∘ ''f''}} happens to be.&lt;ref&gt;also showing that commutation of ''f'' and ''g'' is not a [[necessary condition]] for idempotency preservation&lt;/ref&gt; As an example for the latter, the negation function ¬ on the Boolean domain is not idempotent, but {{nowrap|¬ ∘ ¬}} is. Similarly, unary negation {{nowrap|−( )}} of real numbers is not idempotent, but  {{nowrap|−( ) ∘ −( )}} is.

== Computer science meaning ==
{{See also|Referential transparency (computer science)|Reentrant (subroutine)|Stable sort}}
In [[computer science]], the term ''idempotence'' may have a different meaning depending on the context in which it is applied:
* in [[imperative programming]], a [[subroutine]] with [[Side effect (computer science)|side effects]] is idempotent if the system state remains the same after one or several calls, in other words if the function from the system state space to itself associated to the subroutine is idempotent in the mathematical sense given in the [[#Definition|definition]];
* in [[functional programming]], a [[pure function]] is idempotent if it is idempotent in the mathematical sense given in the [[#Definition|definition]].

This is a very useful property in many situations, as it means that an operation can be repeated or retried as often as necessary without causing unintended effects. With non-idempotent operations, the algorithm may have to keep track of whether the operation was already performed or not.

=== Computer science examples ===
A function looking up a customer's name and address in a [[database]] is typically idempotent, since this will not cause the database to change.  Similarly, changing a customer's address is typically idempotent, because the final address will be the same no matter how many times it is submitted. However, placing an order for a car for the customer is typically not idempotent, since running the call several times will lead to several orders being placed. Canceling an order is idempotent, because the order remains canceled no matter how many requests are made.

A composition of idempotent methods or subroutines, however, is not necessarily idempotent if a later method in the sequence changes a value that an earlier method depends on – ''idempotence is not closed under composition''.  For example, suppose the initial value of a variable is 3 and there is a sequence that reads the variable, then changes it to 5, and then reads it again.  Each step in the sequence is idempotent: both steps reading the variable have no side effects and changing a variable to 5 will always have the same effect no matter how many times it is executed.  Nonetheless, executing the entire sequence once produces the output (3, 5), but executing it a second time produces the output (5, 5), so the sequence is not idempotent.&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} please discuss this on talk page before reinstating --&gt;

In the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), idempotence and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Safe methods|safety]] are the major attributes that separate [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request methods|HTTP verbs]].  Of the major HTTP verbs, GET, PUT, and DELETE should be implemented in an idempotent manner according to the standard, but POST need not be.&lt;ref name="httpStd-methods"&gt;IETF, [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.2 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608213403/http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 |date=2014-06-08 }}.  See also [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HyperText Transfer Protocol]].&lt;/ref&gt;  GET retrieves a resource; PUT stores content at a resource; and DELETE eliminates a resource.  As in the example above, reading data usually has no side effects, so it is idempotent (in fact [[wiktionary:nullipotent|''nullipotent'']]).  Storing and deleting a given set of content are each usually idempotent as long as the request specifies a location or identifier that uniquely identifies that resource and only that resource again in the future.  The PUT and DELETE operations with unique identifiers reduce to the simple case of assignment to an immutable variable of either a value or the null-value, respectively, and are idempotent for the same reason; the end result is always the same as the result of the initial execution, even if the response differs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF|title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content |rfc=7231 |section=4.2.2 |sectionname=Idempotent Methods |quote=It knows that repeating the request will have the same intended effect, even if the original request succeeded, though the response might differ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violation of the unique identification requirement in storage or deletion typically causes violation of idempotence.  For example, storing or deleting a given set of content without specifying a unique identifier: POST requests, which do not need to be idempotent, often do not contain unique identifiers, so the creation of the identifier is delegated to the receiving system which then creates a corresponding new record.  Similarly, PUT and DELETE requests with nonspecific criteria may result in different outcomes depending on the state of the system - for example, a request to delete the most recent record. In each case, subsequent executions will further modify the state of the system, so they are not idempotent. 

In [[Event stream processing]], idempotence refers to the ability of a system to produce the same outcome, even if the same file, event or message is received more than once.

In a [[load-store architecture]], instructions that might possibly cause a [[page fault]] are idempotent. So if a page fault occurs, the OS can load the page from disk and then simply re-execute the faulted instruction.  In a processor where such instructions are not idempotent, dealing with page faults is much more complex.{{fact|date=August 2016}}

When reformatting output, [[Prettyprint|pretty-printing]] is expected to be idempotent. In other words, if the output is already "pretty", there should be nothing to do for the pretty-printer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Applied examples ==
[[File:Colección de hombres cruzando.JPG|thumb|A typical crosswalk button is an example of an idempotent system]]
Applied examples that many people could encounter in their day-to-day lives include [[elevator]] call buttons and [[crosswalk button]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110523081716/http://www.nclabor.com/elevator/geartrac.pdf  For example, this design specification includes detailed algorithm for when elevator cars will respond to subsequent calls for service&lt;/ref&gt; The initial activation of the button moves the system into a requesting state, until the request is satisfied. Subsequent activations of the button between the initial activation and the request being satisfied have no effect, unless the system is designed to adjust the time for satisfying the request based on the number of activations.

The '''International IUPAC Conferences on Green Chemistry''' (ICGCs) gather several hundreds scientists, technologists, and experts from all over the world with the aim to exchange and disseminate new ideas, discoveries, and projects on [[green chemistry]] and a [[sustainable development]]. After mid twentieth century, an increasingly general consensus acknowledges that these subjects play a unique role in mapping the way ahead for the humankind progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sdgoverview/post-2015-development-agenda.html|title=Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical topics discussed in these IUPAC Conferences are: 
* bio-based [[Renewable resource|renewable chemical resources]], bio-inspired materials and [[nanomaterials]], bio-based [[polymer]]s; 
* polymer composites and natural surfactants;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00221139/177|title=C. Pigliacelli, A. D'Elicio, R. Milani, G. Terraneo, G.

* green solvents, catalysts, and synthetic methodologies (e.g., microwaves, ultrasounds, solid state synthesis), [[biocatalysis]] and [[biotransformation]]s; 
* [[biofuel]]s and chemistry for improved energy harvesting; 
* materials for sustainable construction and [[cultural heritage]]; 
* [[pollution]] prevention; 
* metrics, evaluation, education, and communication of green chemistry.

== History ==

In 2006 the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) promoted the organization of the 1st International IUPAC Conference on Green-Sustainable Chemistry (ICGC-1). This conference, started in collaboration with the [[Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker|German Chemical Society]] (GDCh), was a major acknowledgement by IUPAC of the relevance of green chemistry. The Special Topic Issue on Green Chemistry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/72/7/|title=''Pure Appl. Chem.'' 2000, 72(7), 1207-1403}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Pure and Applied Chemistry'' and the starting of a [https://iupac.org/who-we-are/committees/committee-details/?body_code=303 Subcommittee on Green Chemistry,]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iupac.org/nc/home/about/members-and-committees/db/division-committee.html?tx_wfqbe_pi1%5Btitle%5D=Subcommittee%20on%20Green%20Chemistry&amp;tx_wfqbe_pi1%5Bpublicid%5D=303|title=Division III, Subcommittee on Green Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; operating in the IUPAC Division of Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry, were two important landmarks towards that acknowledgement. 
ICGC-1 registered the presence of over 450 participants from 42 countries and proceedings were published in ''[https://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/conferences/family/ICGC/index.html Pure and Applied Chemistry]''. This Conference then became a biannual appointment that continuously attracted several hundreds scientists and technologists from academia, research institutes, and industries.

On 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of July 2017, IUPAC established the '''[https://iupac.org/body/041 Interdivisional Committee on Green Chemistry for Sustainable Development ICGCSD]''' that supersedes the former Subcommittee on Green Chemistry and has the aim to assist IUPAC in initiating, promoting, and coordinating the work of the Union in the area of green and sustainable chemistry. 

ICGCSD will continue to organize the ICGCs Series. The next 8th Conference will take place in Bangkok, Thailand, in September 2018.

'''Interpretive bias''' or '''interpretation bias''' is an [[cognitive bias|information-processing bias]], the tendency to inappropriately analyze ambiguous stimuli, scenarios and events.&lt;ref name="undefined"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Mathews, A.|author2=MacLeod, C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title=Cognitive vulnerability to emotional disorders|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=1|pp=167–195|doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.143916|pmid=17716086}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of interpretive bias is [[hostile attribution bias]], wherein individuals perceive benign or ambiguous behaviors as hostile. For example, a situation in which one friend walks past another without acknowledgement. The individual may interpret this behavior to mean that their friend is angry with them.

==Anxiety==

It has been hypothesized that individuals with [[anxiety]] are more likely to experience interpretive bias.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yoon, K.L.|author2=Zinbarg, R.E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2008|title=Interpreting neutral faces as threatening is a default mode for social anxious individuals|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=117|issue=3|pp=680–685|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.117.3.680|pmid=18729619|url=http://www.psychology.northwestern.edu/documents/zinbarg-faces.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study considered the interpretation of neutral facial expressions in individuals with high and low [[social anxiety]] and found that socially anxious participants perceived neutral faces as negative regardless of the context.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In contrast, the study found that non-anxious participants only showed interpretive bias in situations that created anxiety, rather than as a function of their [[personality]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Homographs==

Another studied considered how anxiety influenced which meaning of [[homograph]]s was chosen. Homographs are words with at least two meanings.&lt;ref name="undefined"/&gt; They found that anxious personalities are more likely to produce threatening interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Grey, S. J.|author2=Mathews, A.M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Cognitive bias modification – Priming with an ambiguous homograph is necessary to detect an interpretation training effect|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|volume=4|issue=2|pp=338–343|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2009.01.003|pmid=19249014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that interpretive bias depends on subsequent controlled processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Calvo, M.G.|author2=Castillo, M.D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1996|title=Predictive inferences occur on-line, but with delay: Convergence of naming and reading times|journal=Discourse Processes|volume=22|issue=1|pp=57–78|doi=10.1080/01638539609544966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Airline position.svg|thumb|The 'Jetliner Position' or 'The Chair' is a [[Stress position|Stress Position]] used for [[torture]] or punishment.]]
The '''jetliner position''', also known as the '''captain's chair''', is a form of [[torture|physical torment]] used in cases where the tormentor is unable or unwilling to inflict [[corporal punishment]] on the subject.  The recipient is made to put his back against a wall or pole and place their feet eighteen inches or so from the base of the object.  The feet are usually kept close together.  The subject must then slide down the wall or pole until his [[thigh]]s are parallel to the ground, so that his profile is of someone sitting in a [[chair]].  He may also be required to slide his feet back until his [[shinbone|shin]]s and thighs are at right-angles to each other, which makes the stresses upon the [[knee]] joints and thigh muscles much greater.

Variations include placing weight on the subject's head or thighs, or making him hold his arms straight out in front of him, perhaps with a weight clasped in his hands.  The result is increasing amounts of pain in the thigh muscles, as well as pain in the knees and ankles.  The benefit for the perpetrator is that this kind of punishment causes pain without any lasting marks or, under all but the most extreme conditions, lasting damage to the subjects.

It was a very common form of torture and humiliation during China's [[Cultural Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In India this method of punishment is often referred to as the chair and was or is used in correcting juvenile delinquents. Also in other countries it was a commonly used punishment.

[[File:Jiv.jpg|thumb|Classification of ''Jivas'']]
In [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], a '''jiva''' ({{lang-sa|जीव}}, {{IAST|jīva}}, alternative spelling ''jiwa''; {{lang-hi|जीव}}, {{IAST|jīv}}, alternative spelling ''jeev'') is a living being, or any entity imbued with a life force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Hall|title=Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqzkqnETEVYC|year=2011|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3430-8|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, ''jiva'' is the immortal essence or soul of a living organism (human, animal, fish or plant etc.) which survives physical death.&lt;ref name=jajinixxii/&gt; The concept of ''Ajiva'' in Jainism means "not soul", and represents matter (including body), time, space, non-motion and motion.&lt;ref name=jajinixxii&gt;{{cite book|author=J Jaini|title=Outlines Of Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54A9AAAAIAAJ|year=1940|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=xxii–xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jainism, a ''Jiva'' is either ''samsari'' (mundane, caught in cycle of rebirths) or ''mukta'' (liberated).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qN82XwAACAAJ|title=Gommatsara Jiva-kanda|first1=Jagmandar-lāl|last1=Jaini|archive-url=https://archive.org/download/sacredbooksofthe029558mbp|archive-date=2006|year=1927|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-0852-2_100397|title=Buddhism and Jainism|last=|first=|date=2017|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789402408515|editor-last=Sarao|editor-first=K. T. S.|series=Encyclopedia of Indian Religions|location=|pages=594–594|language=en|chapter=Jīva (Jainism)|doi=10.1007/978-94-024-0852-2_100397|editor-last2=Long|editor-first2=Jeffery D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''jiva'' in Jainism is similar to ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' in Hinduism. However, some Hindu traditions differentiate between the two concepts, with ''jiva'' considered as individual self, while atman as that which is universal unchanging self that is present in all living beings and everything else as the metaphysical [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=varenne46&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Varenne|title=Yoga and the Hindu Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meUWxDDqzuAC&amp;pg=PA46|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0543-9|pages=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Myers|title=Brahman: A Comparative Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfvaAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-83565-0|pages=140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kO8-980xGk8C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=hiranyagarba&amp;ei=gCnrSaGyLZLQMu3AmaQB ''The Philosophy of Person: Solidarity and Cultural Creativity'', Jozef Tichner and George McClean, 1994, p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is sometimes referred to as ''jiva-atman'' (a soul in a living body).&lt;ref name=varenne46/&gt;

The word itself originates from the [[Sanskrit]] ''jivás'', with the root ''jīv-'' "to breathe". It has the same Indo-European root as the Latin word ''vivus'', meaning "alive".

A '''knowledge arena''' is a virtual space where individuals can manipulate [[concept]]s and relationships to form a [[concept map]]. Individuals using a computer with appropriate software can represent concepts and the relationships between concepts in a node-relationship-node formalism. The process of thinking about the concepts and making associations between them has been called "off-loading" by McAleese.&lt;ref&gt;McAleese, R ( 1988) The Knowledge Arena as an Extension to the Concept Map: reflection in action, ''Interactive Learning Environments'', 6,1,1&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[concept map]] is a form of  a semantic network or semantic graph. It is formally based on [[graph theory]]. In the concept map, concepts are represented by nodes. The relationship between nodes are represented by ''typed links'' or ''edges''.  (See [[Graph theory]].) In creating a map or graphic representation of what is known an individual intentionally interacts with the graphical interface or map and through a reflective process adds nodes (concepts) and /or adds relationships (edges or typed links) or modifies existing node-relationship-node instances. It is likely that the process of engaging with concepts and relationships between concepts brings about the creation of understandings as well as making the understandings explicit.

Many different claims have been made for the utility of the [[concept map]]. The interactive and reflective nature of map creation is highlighted by the use of the description Knowledge Arena. Although maps may represent what an individual knows at a point in time; it is likely that by interacting with the concepts and relationships in the knowledge arena individual continues to create and modify what that individual ''knows''.

'''''Le Jeu de la Mort''''' ''(The Game of Death)'' is a [[France|French]]/[[Switzerland|Swiss]] television [[documentary]] broadcast by the French public television channel [[France 2]]. It was presented as a [[social commentary]] on the effects of obeying orders and humiliation in [[reality television]], and its broadcast was followed by a studio discussion on the programme.&lt;ref name="bbc-jeudelamort"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8573755.stm|title=Row over 'torture' on French TV|last=Chazan|first=David|date=March 18, 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary focused on a modern version of the [[Milgram experiment]], with the additional factor of reality television's popularity and influence on the general public. The experiment was performed in the guise of a [[game show]] known as ''La Zone Xtrême''. Volunteers were given €40 to take part as contestants in a "[[Television pilot|pilot]]" for the fictitious show, where they had to administer increasingly stronger electric shocks to trained actors posing as players as punishment for incorrect answers, as encouraged to do so by the host and audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35918059/ns/entertainment-television/|title=Fake TV show has players electrocuting others|last=Keaton, Jamey|date=March 17, 2010|accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 16 of 80 "contestants" chose to end the game before delivering the highest voltage punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124838091|title=Fake TV Game Show 'Tortures' Man, Shocks France|website=[[npr.org]]|accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100317-disturbing-tv-docu-game-tests-limits-small-screen-power-france-game-of-death |title=Fake torture TV 'game show' reveals willingness to obey |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323051311/http://www.france24.com/en/20100317-disturbing-tv-docu-game-tests-limits-small-screen-power-france-game-of-death |archivedate=2010-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Money For Nothing''''' is a British television programme hosted by Sarah Moore, Jay Blades and Ethan-James Osborne that airs on [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvkev.co.uk/content/money-nothing-show-was-unsalvageable|title=Money For Nothing: this show was unsalvageable|author=Kevin O'Sullivan|publisher= tvkev.co.uk|date=20 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903073829/http://www.tvkev.co.uk/content/money-nothing-show-was-unsalvageable|archivedate = 3 September 2017|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b077nzdc|title=Money for Nothing - BBC One|website=BBC|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The premise of the programme is to take items that other people have disposed of and which the presenter rescues from council refuse collection sites. With the help of a designer they are turned into desirable items, which are then sold. Any profit made is then returned to the individual(s) who disposed of the item originally. The show voice-over is provided by comedian and writer [[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]]. ''Celebrity Money for Nothing'' is a related program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frielkeanfilms.com/?page=productions/celebrity-money-for-nothing|title=Celebrity Money for Nothing|website=Friel Kean Films|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular designers and craftspeople include: Norman Wilkinson, Rupert Blanchard, Forge Creative (Josh Kennard &amp; Oliver "Oli" Milne), Sarah Peterson, Neil Wragg, Ray Clarke, Daniel Health, Mark 'Horse' Philips, Bex Simon, The Rag and Bone Man, Guy Trench.

The '''Movable cellular automaton (MCA)''' method is a method in [[Computational mechanics|computational solid mechanics]] based on the discrete concept. It provides advantages both of classical [[cellular automaton]] and [[discrete element method|discrete element]] methods. Important advantage of the МСА method is a possibility of direct [[Computer simulation|simulation]] of materials fracture including damage generation, crack propagation, fragmentation and mass mixing. It is difficult to simulate these processes by means of [[continuum mechanics]] methods (For example: [[finite element method]], [[finite difference method]], etc.), so some new concepts like [[peridynamics]] are required. [[Discrete element method]] is very effective to simulate granular materials, but mutual forces among movable cellular automata provides simulating solids behavior. If size of automaton will be close to zero then MCA behavior becomes like classical [[continuum mechanics]] methods.

==Keystone of the movable cellular automaton method==

[[File:MCA elements.png|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Object (at left) is described as set of interacted automata (at center). At right is shown velocity field of automata.&lt;/center&gt;]]
In framework of the '''MCA''' approach an object under modeling is considered as a set of interacting elements/automata. The dynamics of the set of automata are defined by their mutual forces and rules for their relationships. This system exists and operates in time and space. Its evolution in time and space is governed by the equations of motion. The mutual forces and rules for inter-elements relationships are defined by the function of the automaton response. This function has to be specified for each automaton. Due to mobility of automata the following new parameters of cellular automata have to be included into consideration: ''R&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;ndash; radius-vector of automaton; ''V&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;ndash; velocity of automaton; '''ω&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''' &amp;ndash; rotation velocity of automaton; ''θ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;ndash; rotation vector of automaton; ''m&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;ndash; mass of automaton; ''J&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;ndash; moment of inertia of automaton.

==New concept: neighbours==

[[File:MCA neighbors.gif|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Each automaton has some neighbors&lt;/center&gt;]]
The new concept of the MCA method is based on the introducing of the '''state of the pair of automata''' (relation of interacting pairs of automata) in addition to the conventional one &amp;ndash; the state of a separate automaton. Note that the introduction of this definition allows to go from the static net concept to the '''concept of neighbours'''. As a result of this, the automata have the ability to change their neighbors by switching the states (relationships) of the pairs.

==Definition of the parameter of pair state==

The introducing of new type of states leads to new parameter to use it as criteria for '''switching relationships'''.  It is defined as an automaton overlapping parameters&amp;nbsp;''h&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;''. So the relationship of the cellular automata is characterised by the value of their '''overlapping'''.

[[File:MCA sh1.gif]] [[File:MCA sh2.gif]]

The initial structure is formed by setting up certain relationships among each pair of neighboring elements.

==Criterion of switching of the state of pair relationships==

[[File:MCA switch.gif|thumb|&lt;center&gt;At left pair of automata ij is linked. At right pair of automata ij is unlinked.&lt;/center&gt;]]
In contrast to the classical cellular automaton method in the MCA method not only a single automaton but also a '''relationship of pair of automata can be switched'''. According with the bistable automata concept there are two types of the pair states (relationships):
    
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
| '''linked'''
| – both automata belong to a solid
|-
| '''unlinked'''
| – each automaton of the pair belongs to different bodies or parts of damaged body.
|}

So the '''changing of the state of pair relationships''' is controlled by relative movements of the automata and the media formed by such pairs can be considered as bistable media.

==Equations of MCA motion==

The evolution of MCA media is described by the following '''equations of motion for translation''':

:&lt;math&gt;{d^2 h^{ij} \over dt^2} = \left( {1 \over m^i} + {1 \over m^j} \right) p^{ij} + \sum_{k\neq j} C(ij,ik) \psi(\alpha_{ij,ik}) {1 \over m^i} p^{ik} + \sum_{l \neq i} C(ij,jl) \psi(\alpha_{ij,jl}) {1 \over m^j} p^{jl}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:MCA neighbour in pair.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Forces between automata ij coming from their neighbors.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Here m&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the mass of automaton i, p&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt; is central force acting between automata i and j, C(ij,ik) is certain coefficient associated with transferring the h parameter from pair '''ij''' to pair '''ik''', ψ(α&lt;sub&gt;ij,ik&lt;/sub&gt;) is angle between directions '''ij''' and '''ik'''.

Due to finite size of movable automata the rotation effects have to be taken into account. The '''equations of motion for rotation''' can be written as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;{d^2 \theta^{ij} \over dt^2} = \left( {q^{ij} \over J^i} + {q^{ji} \over J^j} \right) \tau^{ij} + \sum_{k\neq j} S(ij,ik) {q^{ik} \over J^i} \tau^{ik} + \sum_{l\neq j} S(ij,jl) {q^{jl} \over J^j} \tau^{jl}&lt;/math&gt;

Here Θ&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt; is the angle of relative rotation (it is a switching parameter like h&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt; for translation), q&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt; is the distance from center of automaton '''i''' to contact point of automaton '''j''' (moment arm), τ&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt; is the pair tangential interaction, S(ij,ik) is certain coefficient associated with transferring the  Θ parameter from one pair to other (it is similar to C(ij,ik) from the equation for translation).

It should be noted that these equations are completely similar to the equations of motion for the many&amp;ndash;particle approach.

==Definition of deformation in pair of automata==

[[File:Deformation_in_movable_cellular_automatation.svg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Rotation of body as whole not caused to deformation in pair of automata&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Translation of the pair automata'''
The dimensionless deformation parameter for translation of the '''i j''' automata pair can be presented as:

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon^{ij} = {h^{ij} \over r_{0}^{ij}} = { \left( q^{ij} + q^{ji} \right) - \left( d^{i} + d^{j} \right) \big / 2 \over \left( d^{i} + d^{j} \right) \big / 2 }&lt;/math&gt;

In this case:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \Delta{\varepsilon^{i(j)}} + \Delta{\varepsilon^{j(i)}} \right)  
{ \left( d^{i} + d^{j} \right) \over 2} = V_{n}^{ij} \Delta{t}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''Δt''' time step, '''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;''' &amp;ndash; relative velocity.

Rotation of the pair automata can be calculated by analogy with the last translation relationships.

==Modeling of irreversible deformation in the MCA method==

[[File:MCA Irreversible Deformation.gif|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Deformation is determine by value of distance from the center of automaton&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:MCA response function of automata.gif|thumb|&lt;center&gt;There are two types of the response function of automata&lt;/center&gt;]]

The '''ε&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;''' parameter is used as a measure of deformation of automaton '''i''' under its interaction with automaton '''j'''. Where '''q&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;''' &amp;ndash; is a distance from the center of automaton '''i''' to its contact point with automaton '''j''';  '''R&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = d&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;/2''' ('''d&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''' &amp;ndash; is the size of automaton '''i''').

'''As an example''' the titanium specimen under cyclic loading (tension &amp;ndash; compression) is considered. The loading diagram is shown in the next figure:

==Advantages of MCA method==

Due to mobility of each automaton the MCA method allows to take into account directly such actions as:

* mass mixing
* penetration effects
* chemical reactions
* intensive deformation
* phase transformations
* accumulation of damages
* fragmentation and fracture
* cracks generation and development

Using boundary conditions of different types (fixed, elastic, viscous-elastic, etc.) it is possible to imitate different properties of surrounding medium, containing the simulated system. It is possible to model different modes of mechanical loading (tension, compression, shear strain, etc.) by setting up additional conditions at the boundaries.

The '''Musha Incident''' ({{CJKV|c=霧社事件|j=霧社事件|r=Musha Jiken|w=Wu&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-she&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Shih&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-chien&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;|p=Wùshè Shìjiàn}}; {{zh|poj=Bū-siā Sū-kiāⁿ}}), also known as the '''Wushe Rebellion''' and several other similar names, began in October 1930 and was the last major [[Rebellion|uprising]] against colonial [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces in [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese Taiwan]]. In response to long-term oppression by Japanese authorities, the [[Seediq people|Seediq]] indigenous group in Musha (Wushe) attacked the village, killing over 130 Japanese. In response, the Japanese led a relentless counter-attack, killing over 600 Seediq in retaliation. The handling of the incident by the Japanese authorities was strongly criticised, leading to many changes in aboriginal policy.

==Background==
Previous armed resistance to Japanese imperial authority had been dealt with sternly, as evident in responses to previous uprisings such as the [[Tapani Incident]], which resulted in a cycle of rebel attacks and strict Japanese retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roy |first1=Denny |year=2003|title=Taiwan: A Political History |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |isbn=9780801488054 |page= 35|ref=harv |chapter=The Japanese Occupation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the 1930s, armed resistance had largely been replaced by organised political and social movements among the younger Taiwanese generation. Direct police involvement in local administration had been relaxed, many stern punishments were abolished, and some elements of self-government, albeit of questionable effectiveness, had been introduced to colonial Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Harry J.|last=Lamley|chapter=Taiwan Under Japanese Rule, 1895-1945: The Vicissitudes of Colonialism |year=2007 |title=Taiwan: A New History |editor=Rubinstein, Murry A. |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |place=New York |isbn=9780765614940 |edition=expanded|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a different approach was used in order to control Taiwan's indigenous peoples. Formosa Island aborigines were still designated as {{nihongo||生蕃|seiban|"raw barbarians" or "wild tribespeople"}}, and treated as savages rather than equal subjects. Tribes were 'tamed' through assimilation, the process of disarming traditional hunting tribes and forcing them to relocate to the plains and lead an agrarian existence. Further resistance was then dealt with by military campaigns, isolation and containment.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=49}} In order to access natural resources in mountainous and forested indigenous-controlled areas, Governor-General [[Sakuma Samata]] adopted a more aggressive terrain policy, attempting to pacify or eradicate aboriginal groups in areas scheduled for logging within five years; by 1915, this policy had been largely successful, although resistance still existed in more remote areas.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=51}}

===Proximal causes===
The Seediq aborigines in the vicinity of Musha had been considered by Japanese authorities to be one of the most successful examples of this "taming" approach, with [[Tribal chief|Chief]] [[Mouna Rudao]] being one of 43 indigenous leaders selected for a tour of Japan a few years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Chien-Chao|last1=Hung|title=A history of Taiwan|date=2000|publisher=Il Cerchio|location=Rimini|isbn=9788886583800|page=222|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, resentment still lingered, due largely to police misconduct, the continuing practice of forced labor, and the ill treatment of indigenous beliefs and customs.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=51}}

In the days immediately prior to the incident, chief Mona Rudao held a traditional wedding banquet for his son Daho Mona, during which animals were slaughtered and wine was prepared and drunk. A Japanese police officer named Katsuhiko Yoshimura was on patrol in the area, and was offered a cup of wine by Daho Mona as a symbolic gesture. The officer refused, saying that Daho Mona's hands were soiled with blood from the slaughtered animals. Daho Mona attempted to take hold of the officer, insisting he participate, and the officer struck him with his stick. Fighting ensued, and the officer was injured. Chief Mona Rudao attempted to apologize by presenting a flagon of wine at the officer's house, but was rejected.&lt;ref name=TakaoClub&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wushe Incident|publisher=The Takao Club|url=http://www.takaoclub.com/monaludao/wusheincident.htm|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simmering resentment among the Seediq in Musha was finally pushed to the limit.

==Incident==
[[File:Commander and Staff of Musha Punitive force.JPG|thumb|200px|Commander and staff of the Musha Punitive force.]]

On 27 October 1930, hundreds of Japanese converged on Musha for an athletics meet at the Musyaji Elementary School. Shortly before dawn, Mona Rudao led over 300 Seediq warriors in a raid of strategic police sub-stations to capture weapons and ammunition. They then moved on the elementary school, concentrating their attack on the Japanese in attendance. A total of 134 Japanese, including women and children, were killed in the attack. Two [[Han Taiwanese]] dressed in Japanese clothing were also mistakenly killed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=11 Mar 2014 |title=Wushe Incident |website=Encyclopedia of Taiwan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325180546/http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=3722 |archivedate=25 March 2014 |url=http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=3722 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of whom was a girl wearing a Japanese kimono.{{sfnp|Hung|2000|p=222}} The Aboriginals aimed to only kill Japanese specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heé|first1=Nadin|title=Taiwan under Japanese Rule. Showpiece of a Model Colony? Historiographical Tendencies in Narrating Colonialism|journal=History Compass|date=August 2014|volume=12|issue=8|pages=632–641|doi=10.1111/hic3.12180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
The Japanese authorities responded with unprecedentedly harsh military action. A press blackout was enforced, and [[Governor-General of Taiwan|Governor General]] Eizo Ishizuka ordered a counter-offensive of two thousand troops to be sent to Musha, forcing the Seediq to retreat into the mountains and carry out guerrilla attacks by night. Unable to root out the Seediq despite their superior numbers and firepower, the Japanese faced a political need for a faster solution. Consequently, Japan's army air corps in Taiwan ordered bombing runs over Musha to smoke out the rebels, dropping [[mustard gas]] bombs in violation of the [[Geneva Protocol]] in what was allegedly the first such use of chemical warfare in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Croddy, "China's Role in the Chemical and Biological Disarmament Regimes", The Nonproliferation Review Spring 2002: 16, &lt;http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/91crod.pdf&gt;, accessed 24 September 2011, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TakaoClub /&gt; The uprising was swiftly quelled, with any remaining resistance suppressed by the third week of December 1930;&lt;ref name=TakaoClub /&gt; Mona Rudao had committed suicide on November 28, but the uprising had continued under other leaders.{{sfnp|Hung|2000|p=223}} Of the 1,200 Seediq directly involved in the uprising, 644 died, 290 of whom committed suicide to avoid dishonor.

Due to internal and external criticism of their handling of the incident, Governor-General Kamiyama and Goto Fumio, his chief civil administrator, were forced to resign in January 1931. However, Kamiyama's replacement, Ota Masahiro, also took a harsh approach to controlling Taiwan's indigenous peoples: certain tribes were disarmed and left unprotected, giving their aboriginal enemies an opportunity to annihilate them on behalf of the Japanese administration.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=51}} Around 500 of the Seediq involved in the Musha Incident surrendered and were subsequently confined to a village near Musha. However, on 25 April 1931, indigenous groups working with the Japanese authorities attacked the village, [[Taiwanese aborigines#Headhunting|beheading]] all remaining males over the age of 15. This came to be known as the "Second Musha Incident".

However, the uprising did affect a change in the authorities' attitudes and approaches towards aborigines in Taiwan. Musha had been regarded as the most "enlightened and compliant" of the aboriginal territories, and the colonial power's inability to prevent the massacre provoked a fear of similar nationalist movements starting in Taiwan, Korea, and Japan itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ching|first1=L.|title=Savage Construction and Civility Making: The Musha Incident and Aboriginal Representations in Colonial Taiwan|journal=positions: east asia cultures critique|date=1 December 2000|volume=8|issue=3|page=799|doi=10.1215/10679847-8-3-795|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A change in policy was clearly needed. Ching suggests that the ideology of imperialisation (''kominka'') became the dominant form of colonial control; aborigines became represented as imperial subjects on equal footing with other ethnic groups in Taiwan, and were upgraded in status from "raw savages"  to {{nihongo4||高砂族|takasagozoku|"tribal peoples of Taiwan"}}. Furthermore, Japanization education was intensified, promoting Japanese culture and loyalty to the emperor in the younger generation.

During the Musha Incident Seediq Tkdaya under Mona Rudao revolted against the Japanese while the Truku and Toda did not. The rivalry between the Seediq Tkdaya vs the Toda and Truku (Taroko) was aggravated by Musha Incident, since the Japanese had long played them off against each other. Tkdaya land was given to the Truku (Taroko) and Toda by the Japanese after the incident.

==In the media==
The Musha Incident has been depicted three times in movies, in 1957 in the film ''Qing Shan bi xue'' ({{lang|zh|青山碧血}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Daw-Ming|title=Historical dictionary of Taiwan cinema|date=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=9780810879225|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2003 TV drama {{Interlanguage link multi|Dana Sakura|zh|3=風中緋櫻}}, and in the 2011 Taiwanese film ''[[Seediq Bale]]''. 

The Chinese novel ''Remains of Life'' (originally published in Chinese in 1999, published in English translation in 2017) is a fictionalized account of the aftermath of this incident.&lt;ref&gt;Wu He (2017).

'''Negative cutting'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Case|first=Dominic|title=Film Technology in Post Production|publisher=CRC Press, 2012|isbn= 9781136049774}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''negative matching''' and '''negative conforming''') is the process of cutting motion picture negative to match precisely the final edit as specified by the [[film editor]]. [[Original camera negative]] (OCN) is cut with scissors and joined using a [[film splicer]] and [[film cement]]. Negative cutting is part of the [[post-production]] process and occurs after editing and prior to striking [[internegative]]s and release prints. The process of negative cutting has changed little since the beginning of cinema in the early 20th century. In the early 1980s computer software was first used to aid the cutting process.  Kodak introduced barcode on motion picture negative in the mid-1990s. This enabled negative cutters to more easily track shots and identify film sections based on [[keykode]].

Toward the late 1990s and early 2000s negative cutting changed due to the advent of [[digital cinema]] technologies such as [[digital intermediate]] (DI), digital projection and [[high-definition television]]. In some countries, due to the high cost of online suites, negative cutting is still used for commercials by reducing footage. Increasingly feature films are bypassing the negative cutting process altogether and are being scanned directly from the uncut [[Dailies|rushes]].

The existence of [[digital intermediate]]s (DI) has created a new demand for negative cutters to extract [[selected takes]] which are cut from the [[Dailies|rushes]] and re-spliced into new rolls (in edit order) to reduce the volume of footage for scanning.

== Basic ==
After a film shoot, the [[original camera negative]] (OCN) is sent to a film laboratory for processing. Two or three {{convert|400|ft|m|sing=on}} camera rolls are spliced together to create a lab roll approximately {{convert|1200|-|1500|ft|m|abbr=on}} long. After developing the lab roll, it is put through a [[telecine]] to create a [[Dailies|rushes]] transfer tape. This [[Dailies|rushes]] transfer tape is of lower quality than film and is used for editing purposes only.

The [[Dailies|rushes]] tape is sent to the Editor who loads it into an offline edit suite. The lab rolls are sent to the negative cutter for logging and storage.

After the Editor finishes the Edit it is exported to an offline [[edit decision list|EDL list]] and the EDL list is sent to the negative cutter. The negative cutter will translate the Timecode in the EDL list to edge numbers ([[keykode]]) using specially designed negative cutting software to find which shot is needed from the [[Juncaceae|rushes]] negative.

Traditionally a negative cutter would then fine cut the negative to match the Editor's final edit frame accurately. Negative would be spliced together to create rolls less than {{convert|2000|ft|m}} which would then be sent to the film laboratory to print release prints.

Today most feature films are extracted full takes (as [[selected takes]]) and scanned digitally as a [[digital intermediate]]. Television series and commercials shot on film follow the same extraction process but are sent for [[telecine]]. Each required shot is extracted from the lab roll as a full take and [[Film splicer|respliced]] together to create a new selected roll of negative. This reduces the negative required by up to 1/10 of the footage shot, saving considerable time during scanning or telecine. The negative cutter will create a new Online EDL list replacing the [[Dailies|rushes]] roll timecode with the new selected roll timecode.

In the case of feature films the selected roll and Online EDL are sent to a post production facility for scanning as a [[digital intermediate]]. For television commercials or series the selected takes and EDL are sent to a post production facility for re-telecine and compiled in an Online Suite for final grading.

== Software ==

There have been a number of dedicated software systems that have been developed for and by negative cutters to manage the process of cutting motion picture negative. A number of individual proprietary software systems have been developed starting in the early 1980s. Stan Sztaba developed a system for World Cinevision Services Inc (New York) in 1983 using Apple II DOS and then [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], this system is still used today. Elliott Gamson of Immaculate Matching (New York) developed a system using [[MS-DOS]]. Computamatch was one of the first [[MS-DOS]]-based systems developed and is still in use today in several countries.

The first commercially available software product was OSC/R (pronounced "Oscar"), a DOS-based application developed in Toronto, Canada by The Adelaide Works. OSC/R was very widely used and at the time was the only negative cutting software on the market until Adelaide Works ceased operation in 1993. OSC/R is still used today in some negative cutting facilities but has been mostly replaced by newer and more advanced systems. Excalibur was a later Windows 98 based product developed by FilmLab Engineering in Britain. Film Fusion is one of the most recent developments and is a Windows XP and Vista based system developed in Sydney, Australia by Popsoft IT.

== Hardware ==

Negative cutters use various hardware tools such as film [[Synchronizer (film editing)|synchronizers]], re-winders, [[film splicer]]s, scissors, [[film cement]] and film keykode readers. [[DigiSync]], a purpose built keykode reader is used by most negative cutters in conjunction with software for logging the keykode from film. [[DigiSync]] was developed by [[Research In Motion]] and in 1998 it won a Technical Achievement Academy Award for the design and development of the [[DigiSync]] Film Keykode Reader. [[Research In Motion]] later moved on to bigger things and invented the [[BlackBerry]] Wireless Email Phone and is now a publicly listed company. Other brands of  barcode scanners are also in use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3454">A native system of weights and measures was used by [[Tatars]] until 1924, but became obsolete when the [[Soviet Union]] adopted the [[metric system]].

The Tatar system shares many units with the [[Obsolete Russian weights and measures|Russian system]] (e.g. ''sajın'' and ''disätinä''), which is close to the English (The [[Obsolete Russian weights and measures|Russian system]] existed since [[ancient Rus']], but under [[Peter the Great]], the Russian units were redefined relative to the [[English unit|English system]].), therefore a ''duym'' is relatively equal to an inch.  This list includes their [[Tatar language]] names.

The '''origin of speech''' refers to the more general problem of the [[origin of language]] in the context of the physiological
development of the human [[speech organs]] such as the   [[tongue]], [[lip]]s and [[Place of articulation|vocal organs]] used to produce [[Phoneme|phonological units]] in [[human universal|all human languages]].

==Background==
Although related to the more general problem of the [[origin of language]], the [[evolution]] of distinctively human [[speech]] capacities has become a distinct and in many ways separate area of scientific research.&lt;ref name="Hockett 1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hockett|first1=Charles F. | author1link = Charles F.

Speech is in this sense optional, although it is the default modality for language.[[Image:Places of articulation.svg|thumb|250px|Places of articulation (passive and active):&lt;br /&gt;1.

Uncontroversially, monkeys, apes and humans, like many other animals, have evolved specialised mechanisms for producing ''sound'' for purposes of social communication.&lt;ref&gt;Kelemen, G. (1963). Comparative anatomy and performance of the vocal organ in vertebrates. In R. Busnel (ed.), ''Acoustic behavior of animals.'' Amsterdam:  Elsevier, pp. 489–521.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, no monkey or ape uses its ''tongue'' for such purposes.&lt;ref name="Riede 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Riede | first1 = T. | last2 = Bronson | first2 = E. | last3 = Hatzikirou | first3 = H. | last4 = Zuberbühler | first4 = K. | title = Vocal production mechanisms in a non-human primate: morphological data and a model. | journal = [[J Hum Evol]] | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–96 |date=Jan 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.10.002 | PMID = 15656937 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riede Bronson 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Riede|first1=T.| last2=Bronson|first2=E.|last3=Hatzikirou |first3=H.| last4=Zuberbühler| first4=K.|title=Multiple discontinuities in nonhuman vocal tracts&amp;nbsp;— A reply|journal=Journal of Human Evolution| volume=50| issue=2|year=2006| pages=222–225|url=https://www.academia.edu/335565/Multiple_discontinuities_in_nonhuman_vocal_tracts_-_A_response_to_Lieberman|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our species' unprecedented use of the tongue, lips and other moveable parts seems to place speech in a quite separate category, making its evolutionary emergence an intriguing theoretical challenge in the eyes of many scholars.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2000" /&gt;

==Modality-independence==
[[Image:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[angular gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[supramarginal gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green and the [[auditory cortex|primary auditory cortex]] is represented in pink.]]
The term ''[[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]'' means the chosen representational format for encoding and transmitting information. A striking feature of language is that it is ''modality-independent.'' Should an impaired child be prevented from hearing or producing sound, its innate capacity to master a language may equally find expression in signing. Sign languages of the deaf are independently invented and have all the major properties of spoken language except for the modality of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, W. C. 1960. ''Sign language structure: an outline of the communicative systems of the American deaf.'' Silver Spring, MD: Linstock Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bellugi, U. and E. S. Klima 1975. Aspects of sign language and its structure. In J. F. Kavanagh and J. E. Cutting (eds), ''The Role of Speech in Language.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, pp. 171 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickok 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hickok | first1 = G. | last2 = Bellugi | first2 = U. | last3 = Klima | first3 = ES. | title = The neurobiology of sign language and its implications for the neural basis of language. | journal = Nature | volume = 381 | issue = 6584 | pages = 699–702 |date=Jun 1996 | doi = 10.1038/381699a0 | pmid = 8649515 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kegl 1999"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Kegl| first1 = Judy | last2 = Senghas| first2 = Ann | last3 = Coppola| first3 = Marie | title = Creation through Contact: Sign Language Emergence and Sign Language Change in Nicaragua / Judy Kegl, Ann Senghas, Marie Coppola| editors = Michel DeGraff | work = Language creation and language change : creolization, diachrony, and development| year = 1999 | publisher = MIT Press| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| isbn = 978-0-262-04168-3| oclc = 39508250}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this it appears that the [[language center|language centres]] of the human brain must have evolved to function optimally irrespective of the selected modality.

This feature is extraordinary. Animal communication systems routinely combine visible with audible properties and effects, but not one is modality-independent. No vocally impaired whale, dolphin or songbird, for example, could express its song repertoire equally in visual display. Indeed, in the case of animal communication, message and modality are not capable of being disentangled. Whatever message is being conveyed stems from intrinsic properties of the signal.

Modality independence should not be confused with the ordinary phenomenon of multimodality. Monkeys and apes rely on a repertoire of species-specific "gesture-calls"&amp;nbsp;— emotionally expressive vocalisations inseparable from the visual displays which accompany them.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Goodall | first1 = Jane | title = The chimpanzees of Gombe : patterns of behavior | year = 1986 | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-11649-8 | oclc = 12550961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burling | first1 = R | year = 1993 | title = Primate calls, human language, and nonverbal communication | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 25–53 | doi=10.1086/204132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans also have species-specific gesture-calls&amp;nbsp;— laughs, cries, sobs and so forth&amp;nbsp;— together with involuntary gestures accompanying speech.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin. C. 1872. ''The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.'' London: Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, P. 1982. ''Emotion in the Human Face,'' 2nd Edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, D. 1992. ''Hand and Mind. What gestures reveal about thought.'' Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many animal displays are polymodal in that each appears designed to exploit multiple channels simultaneously.

The human linguistic property of "modality independence" is conceptually distinct from this. It allows the speaker to encode the informational content of a message in a single channel, while switching between channels as necessary. Modern city-dwellers switch effortlessly between the spoken word and writing in its various forms&amp;nbsp;— handwriting, typing, e-mail and so forth. Whichever modality is chosen, it can reliably transmit the full message content without external assistance of any kind. When talking on the telephone, for example, any accompanying facial or manual gestures, however natural to the speaker, are not strictly necessary. When typing or manually signing, conversely, there's no need to add sounds. In many Australian Aboriginal cultures, a section of the population&amp;nbsp;— perhaps women observing a ritual taboo&amp;nbsp;— traditionally restrict themselves for extended periods to a silent (manually signed) version of their language.&lt;ref&gt;Kendon, A. 1988. ''Sign Languages of Aboriginal Australia.''

==Evolution of the speech organs==
[[Image:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Human vocal tract]]
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. Humans' first recourse is to encode our thoughts in sound&amp;nbsp;— a method which depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus.

The speech organs, everyone agrees, evolved in the first instance not for speech but for more basic bodily functions such as feeding and breathing. Nonhuman primates have broadly similar organs, but with different neural controls.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | title = The evolution of speech: a comparative review. | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 258–267 |date=Jul 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01494-7 | pmid = 10859570 | url = http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic151491.files/Fitch2000TICS.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apes use their highly flexible, maneuverable tongues for eating but not for vocalizing.   When an ape is not eating, fine motor control over its tongue is deactivated.&lt;ref name="Riede 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riede Bronson 2006" /&gt; ''Either'' it is performing gymnastics with its tongue ''or'' it is vocalising; it cannot perform both activities simultaneously. Since this applies to mammals in general, ''Homo sapiens'' is exceptional in harnessing mechanisms designed for respiration and ingestion to the radically different requirements of articulate speech.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, Peter, 2008. ''The Origin of Speech.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tongue===
[[Image:Spectrogram -iua-.png|250px|thumb|[[Spectrogram]] of American English vowels {{IPA|[i, u, ɑ]}} showing the formants ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
The word "language" derives from the Latin ''lingua,'' "tongue". Phoneticians agree that the tongue is the most important speech articulator, followed by the lips. A natural language can be viewed as a particular way of using the tongue to express thought.

The human tongue has an unusual shape. In most mammals, it's a long, flat structure contained largely within the mouth. It is attached at the rear to the [[hyoid bone]], situated below oral level in the [[pharynx]]. In humans, the tongue has an almost circular [[Sagittal plane|sagittal]] (midline) contour, much of it lying vertically down an extended [[pharynx]], where it is attached to a hyoid bone in a lowered position. Partly as a result of this, the horizontal (inside-the-mouth) and vertical (down-the-throat) tubes forming the supralaryngeal vocal tract (SVT) are almost equal in length (whereas in other species, the vertical section is shorter). As we move our jaws up and down, the tongue can vary the cross-sectional area of each tube independently by about 10:1, altering formant frequencies accordingly. That the tubes are joined at a right angle permits pronunciation of the vowels '''[i], [u]''' and '''[a]''', which nonhuman primates cannot do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = P. | last2 = Crelin | first2 = E.

N. 1972. The quantal nature of speech: Evidence from articulatory-acoustic data. In P. B. Denes and E. E. David, Jr. (eds.), ''Human Communication: A unified view.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, pp. 51–66.&lt;/ref&gt; It may not be coincidental that '''[i], [u]''' and '''[a]''' are the most common vowels in the world's languages.&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. and Maddieson, I. 1996. ''The Sounds of the World's Languages.'' Malden: MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lips===
In humans, the lips are important for the production of [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]], in addition to [[vowel]]s. Nothing, however, suggests that the lips evolved for those reasons. During primate evolution, a shift from nocturnal to diurnal activity in [[tarsier]]s, monkeys and apes (the [[Haplorhini|haplorhines]]) brought with it an increased reliance on vision at the expense of olfaction. As a result, the snout became reduced and the [[rhinarium]] or "wet nose" was lost. The muscles of the face and lips consequently became less constrained, enabling their co-option to serve purposes of facial expression. The lips also became thicker. "Hence", according to one major authority, "the evolution of mobile, muscular lips, so important to human speech, was the exaptive result of the evolution of diurnality and visual communication in the common ancestor of haplorhines".&lt;ref&gt;MacLarnon, A. 2012. The anatomical and physiological basis of human speech production: adaptations and exaptations. In M. Tallerman and K. .Gibson (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 224-235.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether our lips have undergone more recent adaptation to the specific requirements of speech.

===Respiratory control===
Compared with nonhuman primates, humans have significantly enhanced control of breathing, enabling exhalations to be extended and inhalations shortened as we speak. While we are speaking, intercostal and interior abdominal muscles are recruited to expand the thorax and draw air into the lungs, and subsequently to control the release of air as the lungs deflate. The muscles concerned are markedly more innervated in humans than in nonhuman primates.&lt;ref&gt;MacLarnon, A. M. (1993). The vertebral canal. In A. Walker and R. Leakey (eds.), ''The Nariokotome ''Homo erectus'' skeleton.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 359–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from fossil hominins suggests that the necessary enlargement of the vertebral canal, and therefore spinal cord dimensions, may not have occurred in ''Australopithecus'' or ''Homo erectus''  but was present in the Neanderthals and early modern humans.&lt;ref name="MacLarnon 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=MacLarnon AM, Hewitt GP |title=The evolution of human speech: the role of enhanced breathing control |journal=Am.

===Larynx===
[[File:Illu larynx.jpg]]

The '''[[larynx]]''' or '''voice box''' is an organ in the neck housing the [[vocal folds]], which are responsible for [[phonation]]. In humans, the larynx is ''descended''. Our species is not unique in this respect: goats, dogs, pigs and tamarins lower the larynx temporarily, to emit loud calls.&lt;ref name="Fitch. WT 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | title = The phonetic potential of nonhuman vocal tracts: comparative cineradiographic observations of vocalizing animals. | journal = Phonetica | volume = 57 | issue = 2–4 | pages = 205–18  | year = 2000  | doi =  10.1159/000028474| pmid = 10992141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several deer species have a permanently lowered larynx, which may be lowered still further by males during their roaring displays.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | last2 = Reby | first2 = D. | title = The descended larynx is not uniquely human. | journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 268 | issue = 1477 | pages = 1669–75 |date=Aug 2001 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2001.1704 | pmid = 11506679 | pmc = 1088793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lions, jaguars, cheetahs and domestic cats also do this.&lt;ref name="Weissengruber 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Weissengruber | first1 = GE. | last2 = Forstenpointner | first2 = G. | last3 = Peters | first3 = G. | last4 = Kübber-Heiss | first4 = A. | last5 = Fitch | first5 = WT. | title = Hyoid apparatus and pharynx in the lion (Panthera leo), jaguar (Panthera onca), tiger (Panthera tigris), cheetah (Acinonyxjubatus) and domestic cat (Felis silvestris f. catus). | journal = J Anat | volume = 201 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–209 |date=Sep 2002 | doi = 10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00088.x | pmid = 12363272 |pmc = 1570911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, laryngeal descent in nonhumans (according to Philip Lieberman) is not accompanied by descent of the hyoid; hence the tongue remains horizontal in the oral cavity, preventing it from acting as a pharyngeal articulator.&lt;ref name="Lieberman 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lieberman|first1=Philip|title=The Evolution of Human Speech: Its Anatomical and Neural Bases|journal=Current Anthropology| volume=48| issue=1| year=2007 |pages=39–66| url=http://www.cog.brown.edu/people/lieberman/pdfFiles/Lieberman%20P.%202007.%20The%20evolution%20of%20human%20speech,%20Its%20anatom.pdf| doi=10.1086/509092}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Larynx external en.svg|thumb|Anatomy of the larynx, [[anatomical terms of location|anterolateral]] view]]

Despite all this, scholars remain divided as to how "special" the human vocal tract really is. It has been shown that the larynx does descend to some extent during development in chimpanzees, followed by hyoidal descent.&lt;ref name="Nishimura 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the hyoid in chimpanzees: evolution of face flattening and speech. | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–54 |date=Sep 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.03.005 | pmid = 16730049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the epiglottis and velum is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing. Since this entails substantial costs&amp;nbsp;— increasing the risk of choking while swallowing food&amp;nbsp;— we are forced to ask what benefits might have outweighed those costs. The obvious benefit&amp;nbsp;— so it is claimed&amp;nbsp;— must have been speech. But this idea has been vigorously contested. One objection is that humans are in fact ''not'' seriously at risk of choking on food: medical statistics indicate that accidents of this kind are extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;M. Clegg 2001. The Comparative Anatomy and Evolution of the Human Vocal Tract Unpublished thesis, University of London.&lt;/ref&gt; Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of ''Homo sapiens.''&lt;ref name="Perreault 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity. | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35289 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 | pmid = 22558135| pmc = 3338724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was ''initially'' driven by selection pressures for speech.

At least one [[orangutan]] has demonstrated the ability to control the voice box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orangutan's Vocal Feats Hint At Deeper Roots of Human Speech |author=Jon Hamilton |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/14/518170608/orangutans-vocal-feats-hint-at-deeper-roots-of-human-speech |date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The size exaggeration hypothesis ====
To lower the larynx is to increase the length of the vocal tract, in turn lowering [[formant]] frequencies so that the voice sounds "deeper"&amp;nbsp;— giving an impression of greater size. John Ohala argues that the function of the lowered larynx in humans, especially males, is probably to enhance threat displays rather than speech itself.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Ohala, 2000. [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~ohala/papers/lowered_larynx.pdf The irrelevance of the lowered larynx in modern Man for the development of speech.] Paris, ENST: ''The Evolution of Language,'' pp. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohala points out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, we would expect adult human males to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low. In fact, females invariably outperform males in verbal tests, falsifying this whole line of reasoning. W. Tecumseh Fitch likewise argues that this was the original selective advantage of laryngeal lowering in our species. Although (according to Fitch) the initial lowering of the larynx in humans had nothing to do with speech, the increased range of possible formant patterns was subsequently co-opted for speech. Size exaggeration remains the sole function of the extreme laryngeal descent observed in male deer. Consistent with the size exaggeration hypothesis, a second descent of the larynx occurs at puberty in humans, although only in males. In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalising to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability.&lt;ref&gt;Fitch, W. T. (2002). Comparative vocal production and the evolution of speech: Reinterpreting the descent of the larynx. In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 21–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Could the Neanderthals speak?===
[[File:Gray186.png|thumb|Hyoid bone&amp;nbsp;— anterior surface, enlarged]]
[[File:Gray1194.png|thumb|Anterolateral view of head and neck]]

Most specialists credit the Neanderthals with speech abilities not radically different from those of modern ''Homo sapiens''. An indirect line of argument is that their tool-making and hunting tactics would have been difficult to learn or execute without some kind of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn &amp; Coolidge, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; A recent extraction of [[DNA]] from Neanderthal bones indicates that Neanderthals had the same version of the [[FOXP2]] gene as modern humans. This gene, once mistakenly described as the "grammar gene", plays a role in controlling the orofacial movements which (in modern humans) are involved in speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Nicholas |last=Wade |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |date=19 October 2007 |title=Neanderthals Had Important Speech Gene, DNA Evidence Shows |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/science/19speech-web.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, it was widely believed that the Neanderthals lacked modern speech capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Philip |last=Lieberman |author2=Edmund S. Crelin |date=Spring 1971 |title=On the Speech of Neanderthal Man |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=203–222 |doi= |doi-broken-date=22 May 2009 |jstor=4177625}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that they possessed a hyoid bone so high up in the vocal tract as to preclude the possibility of producing certain vowel sounds.

The hyoid bone is present in many [[mammal]]s. It allows a wide range of tongue, pharyngeal and laryngeal movements by bracing these structures alongside each other in order to produce variation.&lt;ref name="Nishimura 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the larynx in chimpanzee infants. | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 100 | issue = 12 | pages = 6930–3 | date=Jun 2003 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1231107100 | pmid = 12775758 | pmc = 165807}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now realised that its lowered position is not unique to ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', while its relevance to vocal flexibility may have been overstated: although men have a lower larynx, they do not produce a wider range of sounds than women or two-year-old babies.

The morphology of the [[outer ear|outer]] and [[middle ear]] of [[Middle Pleistocene]] hominins from [[Atapuerca, Province of Burgos|Atapuerca]] SH in Spain, believed to be proto-Neanderthal, suggests they had an auditory sensitivity similar to modern humans and very different from chimpanzees.

The hypoglossal nerve plays an important role in controlling movements of the tongue. In 1998, one research team used the size of the hypoglossal canal in the base of fossil skulls in an attempt to estimate the relative number of nerve fibres, claiming on this basis that Middle Pleistocene hominins and Neanderthals had more fine-tuned tongue control than either [[australopithecine]]s or apes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kay | first1 = R.

==Origin of speech sounds==

===Distinctive features theory===
{{IPA vowels|class=infobox}}
According to one influential school,&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R., Gunnar, C., Fant, M. and Halle, M. 1952. ''Preliminaries to Speech Analysis.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. and M. Halle 1956. ''Fundamentals of Language.'' The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; the human vocal apparatus is intrinsically digital on the model of a keyboard or digital computer. If so, this is remarkable: nothing about a chimpanzee's vocal apparatus suggests a digital keyboard, notwithstanding the anatomical and physiological similarities. This poses the question as to when and how, during and the course of human evolution, the transition from analog to digital structure and function occurred.

The human supralaryngeal tract is said to be digital in the sense that it is an arrangement of moveable toggles or switches, each of which, at any one time, must be in one state or another. The vocal cords, for example, are either vibrating (producing a sound) or not vibrating (in silent mode). By virtue of simple physics, the corresponding [[distinctive feature]]&amp;nbsp;— in this case, "voicing"&amp;nbsp;— cannot be somewhere in between. The options are limited to "off" and "on". Equally digital is the feature known as "[[Nasalization|nasalisation]]". At any given moment the [[soft palate]] or velum either allows or doesn't allow sound to resonate in the nasal chamber. In the case of lip and tongue positions, more than two digital states may be allowed. '''(To experiment with this, click on [http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~danhall/phonetics/sammy.html Interactive Saggital Section]).'''

The theory that speech sounds are composite entities constituted by complexes of binary phonetic features was first advanced in 1938 by the Russian linguist [[Roman Jakobson]].&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. 1938. "Observations sur le classement phonologiques des consonnes", in ''Proceedings of the 3rd International Congress of Phonetic Sciences,'' Ghent.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent early supporter of this approach was [[Noam Chomsky]], who went on to extend it from phonology to language more generally, in particular to the study of syntax and semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1957. ''Syntactic Structures.'' The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1964 [1962]. The logical basis of linguistic theory. In H.G. Lunt (ed.), The Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Linguists. The Hague: Mouton, pp. 914-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. and Halle, M. 1968. ''The Sound Pattern of English.'' New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1965 book, ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax,''&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, pp. 148-192.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky treated semantic concepts as combinations of binary-digital atomic elements explicitly on the model of distinctive features theory. The lexical item "bachelor", on this basis, would be expressed as [+ Human], [+ Male], [- Married].

Supporters of this approach view the vowels and consonants recognised by speakers of a particular language or dialect at a particular time as cultural entities of little scientific interest. From a natural science standpoint, the units which matter are those common to ''Homo sapiens'' by virtue of our biological nature. By combining the atomic elements or "features" with which all humans are innately equipped, anyone may in principle generate the entire range of vowels and consonants to be found in any of the world's languages, whether past, present or future. The distinctive features are in this sense atomic components of a universal language.

====Criticism====
In recent years, the notion of an innate "universal grammar" underlying phonological variation has been called into question. The most comprehensive monograph ever written about speech sounds, ''Sounds of the World's Languages,'' by [[Peter Ladefoged]] and [[Ian Maddieson]],&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. and Maddieson, I. 1996. ''The Sounds of the World's Languages.'' Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; found virtually no basis for the postulation of some small number of fixed, discrete, universal phonetic features. Examining 305 languages, for example, they encountered vowels that were positioned basically everywhere along the articulatory and acoustic continuum. Ladefoged concludes that phonological features are not determined by human nature: "Phonological features are best regarded as artifacts that linguists have devised in order to describe linguistic systems."&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. 2006. Features and Parameters for Different Purposes. http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/ladefoge/PLfeaturesParameters.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy remains unresolved.

===Self-organization theory===
[[Image:Fugle, ørnsø 073.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Birds flocking, an example of [[Biological organisation|self-organization in biology]]]]

[[Self-organization]]  characterizes systems where macroscopic structures are spontaneously formed out of local interactions between the many components of the system.&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Oudeyer | first1 = Pierre-Yves | title = Self-organization in the evolution of speech | date = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford University Press; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-928915-8 | oclc = 65203001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In self-organized systems, global organizational properties are not to be found at the local level. In colloquial terms, self-organisation is roughly captured by the idea of "bottom-up" (as opposed to "top-down") organisation. Examples of self-organized systems range from ice crystals to galaxy spirals in the inorganic world, and from spots on the leopard skins to the architecture of termite nests or shape of a flock of starlings.

According to many phoneticians, the sounds of language arrange and re-arrange themselves through self-organization&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom, B., MacNeilage, P. and Studdert-Kennedy, M. 1984. Self-organizing processes and the explanation of language universals. In M. Butterworth, B. Comrie and Ö Dahl (eds), ''Explanations for language universals.'' Berlin: Walter de Gruyter and Co., pp. 181-203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Boer, B. 2005b. Self-organisation in language. In C. Hemelrijk (ed.), ''Self-organisation and evolution of social systems.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 123–139.&lt;/ref&gt; Speech sounds have both perceptual ("how you hear them") and articulatory ("how you produce them") properties, all with continuous values. Speakers tend to minimise effort, favouring ease of articulation over clarity. Listeners do the opposite, favouring sounds which are easy to distinguish even if difficult to pronounce. Since speakers and listeners are constantly switching roles, the syllable systems actually found in the world's languages turn out to be a compromise between acoustic distinctiveness on the one hand, and articulatory ease on the other.

How, precisely, do systems of vowels, consonants and syllables arise? Agent-based computer models take the perspective of self-organisation at the level of the speech community or population. The two main paradigms here are (1) the iterated learning model and (2) the language game model. Iterated learning focuses on transmission from generation to generation, typically with just one agent in each generation.&lt;ref name="Hurford 2000"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hurford, J.

R. |  title = Social transmission favours linguistic generalization.| editors = Chris Knight; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; James R Hurford|  work = The Evolutionary emergence of language : social function and the origins of linguistic form | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-78157-2 | oclc = 807262339 | pages = 324–352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the language game model, a whole population of agents simultaneously produce, perceive and learn language, inventing novel forms when the need arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steels | first1 = L | year = 1995 | title = A self-organizing spatial vocabulary | url = | journal = Artificial Life | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 319–332 | doi=10.1162/artl.1995.2.319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steels, L. and Vogt, P. 1997. Grounding adaptive language games in robotic agents. In P. Harvey and P. Husbands (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Artificial Life.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 474–482.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several models have shown how relatively simple peer-to-peer vocal interactions, such as imitation, can spontaneously self-organize a system of sounds shared by the whole population, and different in different populations. For example, models elaborated by Berrah et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Berrah A-R., Glotin H., Laboissière R., Bessière P., Boë L-J. 1996. From Form to Formation of Phonetic Structures: An Evolutionary Computing Pers- pective, in Proc. ICML 1996 Workshop on Evolutionary Computing and Machine Learning, pp. 23-29, Bari, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as de Boer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Boer | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = Self-organization in vowel systems | url = | journal = Journal of Phonetics | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 441–465 | doi=10.1006/jpho.2000.0125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recently reformulated using Bayesian theory,&lt;ref&gt;Moulin-Frier C., Laurent R., Bessière P., Schwartz J.-L., and Diard J. 2012 Adverse Conditions Improve Distinguishability of Auditory, Motor and Perceptuo- Motor Theories of Speech Perception: an Exploratory Bayesian Modeling Study. Language and Cognitive Processes, 27(7–8):1240–1263.&lt;/ref&gt; showed how a group of individuals playing imitation games can self-organize repertoires of vowel sounds which share substantial properties with human vowel systems. For example, in de Boer's model, initially vowels are generated randomly, but agents learn from each other as they interact repeatedly over time. Agent A chooses a vowel from its repertoire and produces it, inevitably with some noise. Agent B hears this vowel and chooses the closest equivalent from its own repertoire. To check whether this truly matches the original, B produces the vowel ''it thinks it has heard'', whereupon A refers once again to its own repertoire to find the closest equivalent. If this matches the one it initially selected, the game is successful, otherwise it has failed. "Through repeated interactions," according to de Boer, "vowel systems emerge that are very much like the ones found in human languages."&lt;ref&gt;de Boer, B. 2012. Self-organization and language evolution. In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), 2012. ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 612-620.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different model, the phonetician [[Björn Lindblom]]&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom. B. 1986. Phonetic universals in vowel systems. In J. J. Ohala and J. J. Jaeger (eds.), ''Experimental Phonology.'' Orlando: Academic Press, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; was able to predict, on self-organizational grounds, the favoured choices of vowel systems ranging from three to nine vowels on the basis of a principle of optimal perceptual differentiation.

Further models studied the role of self-organization in the origins of phonemic coding and combinatoriality, that is the existence of phonemes and their systematic reuse to build structured syllables. [[Pierre-Yves Oudeyer]] developed models which showed that basic neural equipment for adaptive holistic vocal imitation, coupling directly motor and perceptual representations in the brain, can generate spontaneously shared combinatorial systems of vocalizations, including phonotactic patterns, in a society of babbling individuals.&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oudeyer P-Y. 2005. The Self-Organization of Speech Sounds, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 233(3), pp. 435–449.&lt;/ref&gt; These models also characterized how morphological and physiological innate constraints can interact with these self-organized mechanisms to account for both the formation of statistical regularities and diversity in vocalization systems.

===Gestural theory===
The gestural theory states that speech was a relatively late development, evolving by degrees from a system that was originally gestural.

Two types of evidence support this theory:
# Gestural language and vocal language depend on similar neural systems. The regions on the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] that are responsible for mouth and hand movements border each other.
# Nonhuman [[primates]] minimise vocal signals in favour of manual, facial and other visible gestures in order to express simple concepts and communicative intentions in the wild. Some of these gestures resemble those of humans, such as the "begging posture", with the hands stretched out, which humans share with chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;Premack, David &amp; Premack, Ann James. ''The Mind of an Ape'', {{ISBN|0-393-01581-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found strong support for the idea that spoken language and signing depend on similar neural structures. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-[[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] [[lesion]], showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neuromotor Mechanisms in Human Communication |author=Kimura, Doreen |year=1993 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-505492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Critical Period for Right Hemisphere Recruitment in American Sign Language Processing |author=Newman, A. J.|year=2002 |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=5 |pages=76–80 |doi=10.1038/nn775 |pmid=11753419 |issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans spontaneously use hand and facial gestures when formulating ideas to be conveyed in speech.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, D. 1992. ''Hand and mind.'' Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, D. (ed.) 2000. ''Language and gesture.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also, of course, many [[sign languages]] in existence, commonly associated with [[deaf]] communities; as noted above, these are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language. The main difference is that the "phonemes" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing.

====Criticism====

Critics note that for mammals in general, sound turns out to be the best medium in which to encode information for transmission over distances at speed. Given the probability that this applied also to early humans, it's hard to see why they should have abandoned this efficient method in favour of more costly and cumbersome systems of visual gesturing&amp;nbsp;— only to return to sound at a later stage.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, P. 1998. Evolution of the mechanism of language output: comparative neurobiology of vocal and manual communication. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C. Knight (eds), ''Approaches to the Evolution of Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 222 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

By way of explanation, it has been proposed that at a relatively late stage in human evolution, our ancestors' hands became so much in demand for making and using tools that the competing demands of manual gesturing became a hindrance. The transition to spoken language is said to have occurred only at that point.&lt;ref&gt;Corballis, M. C. 2002. Did language evolve from manual gestures? In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 161-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Since humans throughout evolution have been making and using tools, however, most scholars remain unconvinced by this argument. (For a different approach to this puzzle&amp;nbsp;— one setting out from considerations of signal reliability and trust&amp;nbsp;— see "from pantomime to speech" below).

==When did speech evolve?==
{{Human timeline}}
Little is known about the timing of language's emergence in  the human species. Unlike writing, speech leaves no material trace, making it archaeologically invisible. Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins have resorted to the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. While such studies may provide information as to whether pre-modern ''Homo'' species had speech ''capacities'', it is still unknown whether they actually spoke. While they may have communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech.

Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages today, [[Johanna Nichols]]&amp;nbsp;— a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley&amp;nbsp;— argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in our species at least 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols, 1998. The origin and dispersal of languages: Linguistic evidence. In Nina Jablonski and Leslie C. Aiello, eds., ''The Origin and Diversification of Language,''  pp. 127-70. (Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences, 24.) San Francisco: California Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently&amp;nbsp;— in 2012&amp;nbsp;— anthropologists Charles Perreault and Sarah Mathew used phonemic diversity to suggest a date consistent with this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | year = 2012 | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4| page = e35289 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Phonemic diversity" denotes the number of perceptually distinct units of sound&amp;nbsp;— consonants, vowels and tones&amp;nbsp;— in a language. The current worldwide pattern of phonemic diversity potentially contains the statistical signal of the expansion of modern ''Homo sapiens'' out of Africa, beginning around 60-70 thousand years ago. Some scholars argue that phonemic diversity evolves slowly and can be used as a clock to calculate how long the oldest African languages would have to have been around in order to accumulate the number of phonemes they possess today. As human populations left Africa and expanded into the rest of the world, they underwent a series of bottlenecks&amp;nbsp;— points at which only a very small population survived to colonise a new continent or region. Allegedly such population crash led to a corresponding reduction in genetic, phenotypic and phonemic diversity. [[African languages]] today have some of the largest phonemic inventories in the world, while the smallest inventories are found in South America and Oceania, some of the last regions of the globe to be colonized. For example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]], a language of New Guinea, and [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]], spoken in South America, both have just 11 phonemes,&lt;ref&gt;Maddieson, I. 1984. ''Patterns of Sounds.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maddieson | first1 = I. | last2 = Precoda | first2 = K. | year = 1990 | title = Updating UPSID | url = | journal = UCLA Working Papers in Phonetics | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 104–111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while !Xun, a language spoken in Southern Africa has 141 phonemes.
The authors use a natural experiment&amp;nbsp;— the colonization of mainland Southeast Asia on the one hand, the long-isolated [[Andaman Islands]] on the other&amp;nbsp;— to estimate the rate at which phonemic diversity increases through time. Using this rate, they estimate that the world's languages date back to the [[Middle Stone Age]] in Africa, sometime between 350 thousand and 150 thousand years ago. This corresponds to the speciation event which gave rise to ''Homo sapiens''.

These and similar studies have however been criticized by linguists who argue that they are based on a flawed analogy between genes and phonemes, since phonemes are frequently transferred laterally between languages unlike genes, and on a flawed sampling of the world's languages, since both Oceania and the Americas also contain languages with very high numbers of phonemes, and Africa contains languages with very few. They argue that the actual distribution of phonemic diversity in the world reflects recent language contact and not deep language history - since it is well demonstrated that languages can lose or gain many phonemes over very short periods. In other words, there is no valid linguistic reason to expect genetic founder effects to influence phonemic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hunley, Claire Bowern, and Meghan Healy ("Rejection of a serial founder effects model of genetic and linguistic coevolution", Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 2/1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowern, Claire. 2011 Out of Africa?

==Speculative scenarios==

===Early speculations===
{{quotation|"I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries."|{{Citation|title=''Charles Darwin, 1871.'' The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex.}}&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. (1871). The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, 2 vols. London: Murray, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}In 1861, historical linguist Max Müller published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language:&lt;ref&gt;Müller, F. M. 1996 [1861]. The theoretical stage, and the origin of language. Lecture 9 from Lectures on the Science of Language. Reprinted in R. Harris (ed.), ''The Origin of Language.'' Bristol: Thoemmes Press, pp. 7-41.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bow-wow'''. The ''[[Bow-wow theory|bow-wow]]'' or ''cuckoo'' theory, which Müller attributed to the German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], saw early words as imitations of the cries of beasts and birds.
* '''Pooh-pooh'''. The ''Pooh-Pooh'' theory saw the [[Interjectional theory|first words as emotional interjections and exclamations]] triggered by pain, pleasure, surprise and so on.
* '''Ding-dong'''. Müller suggested what he called the ''Ding-Dong'' theory, which states that all things have a vibrating natural resonance, echoed somehow by man in his earliest words.
* '''Yo-he-ho'''. The ''yo-he-ho'' theory saw language emerging out of collective rhythmic labour, the attempt to synchronise muscular effort resulting in sounds such as ''heave'' alternating with sounds such as ''ho''.
* '''Ta-ta'''. This did not feature in Max Müller's list, having been proposed in 1930 by [[Sir Richard Paget, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Paget]].&lt;ref&gt;Paget, R. 1930. ''Human speech: some observations, experiments, and conclusions as to the nature, origin, purpose and possible improvement of human speech.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''ta-ta'' theory, humans made the earliest words by tongue movements that mimicked manual gestures, rendering them audible.

Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong&amp;nbsp;— they occasionally offer peripheral insights&amp;nbsp;— as comically naïve and irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J. R. 1964. ''The Tongues of Men and Speech.'' London: Oxford University Press, pp. 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stam, J. H. 1976. ''Inquiries into the origins of language.'' New York: Harper and Row, p. 243-44.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with these theories is that they are so narrowly mechanistic. They assume that once our ancestors had stumbled upon the appropriate ingenious ''mechanism'' for linking sounds with meanings, language automatically evolved and changed.

===Problems of reliability and deception===
From the perspective of modern science, the main obstacle to the evolution of speech-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is that symbols&amp;nbsp;— arbitrary associations of sounds with corresponding meanings&amp;nbsp;— are unreliable and may well be false.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A | year = 1993 | title = The fallacy of conventional signalling | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 340 | issue = | pages = 227–230 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1993.0061}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the saying goes, "words are cheap".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = J | year = 1994 | title = Must reliable signals always be costly? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1115–1120 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of reliability was not recognised at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionist theorists.

Animal vocal signals are for the most part intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state. One can "trust" the signal not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just can't fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable,&lt;ref&gt;Slocombe, K. 2012. Have we underestimated great ape vocal capacities? In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 90-95.&lt;/ref&gt; but they remain reliable for the same reason&amp;nbsp;— because they are hard to fake.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986" /&gt; Primate social intelligence is ''Machiavellian''&amp;nbsp;— self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples. Monkeys and apes often attempt to deceive one another, while at the same time constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R. and A. Whiten (eds) 1988. ''Machiavellian Intelligence. Social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, it is precisely primates' resistance to deception that blocks the evolution of their vocal communication systems along language-like lines. Language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable. Words automatically fail this test.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998" /&gt;

Words are easy to fake. Should they turn out to be lies, listeners will adapt by ignoring them in favour of hard-to-fake indices or cues. For language to work, then, listeners must be confident that those with whom they are on speaking terms are generally likely to be honest.&lt;ref name="Power 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 =  Power| first1 =  Camilla|title = Old wives' tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 111–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; A peculiar feature of language is "displaced reference", which means reference to topics outside the currently perceptible situation. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate "here" and "now". For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. A theory of the origins of language must therefore explain why humans could begin trusting cheap signals in ways that other animals apparently cannot (see [[signalling theory]]).

==== "Kin selection" ====
The "mother tongues" hypothesis was proposed in 2004 as a possible solution to this problem.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2004"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fitch| first1 = W. T.| title = Kin selection and "mother tongues" : a neglected component in language evolution | editors =  Ulrike Griebel; D Kimbrough Oller | work = Evolution of communication systems : a comparative approach | year = 2004 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-262-15111-5 |oclc = 845673575| pages = 275–296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]] suggested that the Darwinian principle of "kin selection"&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1964a"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = WD. | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I. | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 |date=Jul 1964 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4| PMID = 5875341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1964b"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = WD. | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour.

Fitch suggests that spoken languages were originally "mother tongues". If speech evolved initially for communication between mothers and their own biological offspring, extending later to include adult relatives as well, the interests of speakers and listeners would have tended to coincide. Fitch argues that shared genetic interests would have led to sufficient trust and cooperation for intrinsically unreliable vocal signals&amp;nbsp;— spoken words&amp;nbsp;— to become accepted as trustworthy and so begin evolving for the first time.

=====Criticism=====
Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans. Ape mothers also share genes with their offspring, as do all animals, so why is it only humans who speak? Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that early humans restricted linguistic communication to genetic kin: the incest taboo must have forced men and women to interact and communicate with non-kin. So even if we accept Fitch's initial premises, the extension of the posited "mother tongue" networks from relatives to non-relatives remains unexplained.&lt;ref&gt;Tallerman, M. In press.

==== "Reciprocal altruism" ====

L. | year = 1971 | title = The evolution of reciprocal altruism | url = | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 35–57 | doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— to explain the unusually high levels of intentional honesty necessary for language to evolve. 'Reciprocal altruism' can be expressed as the principle that ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.'' In linguistic terms, it would mean that ''if you speak truthfully to me, I'll speak truthfully to you.'' Ordinary Darwinian reciprocal altruism, Ulbæk points out, is a relationship established between frequently interacting individuals. For language to prevail across an entire community, however, the necessary reciprocity would have needed to be enforced universally instead of being left to individual choice. Ulbæk concludes that for language to evolve, early society as a whole must have been subject to moral regulation.

=====Criticism=====
Critics point out that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom "obligatory reciprocal altruism" could possibly have been enforced. Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect.&lt;ref name="Knight 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  |last1=Knight|first1=Chris| title=Language co-evolved with the rule of law| editors = Angelo Cangelosi; Andrew D M Smith; Kenny Smith | work = The evolution of language : proceedings of the 6th international conference (EVOLANG6) , Rome, Italy, 12–15 April 200 | year = 2006 | publisher = World Scientific | location = New Jersey | isbn = 9789812566560 | oclc = 70797781| doi=10.1007/s11299-007-0039-1|url = http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/knight-springer-online-fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further criticism is that language doesn't work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups don't withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to advertise to the world their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting it to anyone who will listen without thought of return.&lt;ref&gt;Dessalles, J.-L. 1998.

==== "Gossip and grooming" ====
Gossip, according to [[Robin Dunbar]], does for group-living humans what manual [[Social grooming|grooming]] does for other primates&amp;nbsp;— it allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances. As humans began living in larger and larger social groups, the task of manually grooming all one's friends and acquaintances became so time-consuming as to be unaffordable. In response to this problem, humans invented "a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming"&amp;nbsp;— ''vocal grooming''.  To keep your allies happy, you now needed only to "groom" them with low-cost vocal sounds, servicing multiple allies simultaneously while keeping both hands free for other tasks. Vocal grooming (the production of pleasing sounds lacking syntax or combinatorial semantics) then evolved somehow into syntactical speech.&lt;ref name="Dunbar 1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dunbar | first = R.

=====Criticism=====
Critics of this theory point out that the very efficiency of "vocal grooming"&amp;nbsp;— that words are so cheap&amp;nbsp;— would have undermined its capacity to signal commitment of the kind conveyed by time-consuming and costly manual grooming.&lt;ref name="Power 1998" /&gt; A further criticism is that the theory does nothing to explain the crucial transition from vocal grooming&amp;nbsp;— the production of pleasing but meaningless sounds&amp;nbsp;— to the cognitive complexities of syntactical speech.

According to another school of thought, language evolved from [[mimesis]]&amp;nbsp;— the "acting out" of scenarios using vocal and gestural pantomime.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, M. 1998.

==== "Ritual/speech coevolution" ====
The ritual/speech coevolution theory was originally proposed by the distinguished social anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]]&lt;ref name="Rappaport,_R._A._1999"&gt;Rappaport, R. A. 1999. ''Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; before being elaborated by anthropologists such as Chris Knight,&lt;ref name="Knight 1998" /&gt; Jerome Lewis,&lt;ref name="Lewis 2009" /&gt; Nick Enfield,&lt;ref name="Enfield 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Enfield | first1 = N.

These scholars argue that there can be no such thing as a "theory of the origins of language". This is because language is not a separate adaptation but an internal aspect of something much wider&amp;nbsp;— namely, human [[symbolic culture]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2010. [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/The-Origins-of-Symbolic-Culture.pdf The origins of symbolic culture.] In Ulrich J. Frey, Charlotte Störmer and Kai P. Willfuhr (eds) 2010. ''Homo Novus&amp;nbsp;— A Human Without Illusions.'' Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag, pp. 193-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to explain language independently of this wider context have spectacularly failed, say these scientists, because they are addressing a problem with no solution. Can we imagine a historian attempting to explain the emergence of credit cards independently of the wider system of which they are a part? Using a credit card makes sense only if you have a bank account institutionally recognised within a certain kind of advanced capitalist society&amp;nbsp;— one where communications technology has already been invented and fraud can be detected and prevented. In much the same way, language would not work outside a specific array of social mechanisms and institutions. For example, it would not work for an ape communicating with other apes in the wild. Not even the cleverest ape could make language work under such conditions.

{{quotation|"Lie and alternative, inherent in language, ... pose problems to any society whose structure is founded on language, which is to say all human societies. I have therefore argued that if there are to be words at all it is necessary to establish ''The Word,'' and that The Word is established by the invariance of liturgy."&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, R. A. 1979. ''Ecology, Meaning, and Religion.'' Berkeley, California: North Atlantic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Advocates of this school of thought point out that words are cheap. As digital hallucinations, they are intrinsically unreliable. Should an especially clever ape, or even a group of articulate apes, try to use words in the wild, they would carry no conviction. The primate vocalisations that ''do'' carry conviction&amp;nbsp;— those they actually use&amp;nbsp;— are unlike words, in that they are emotionally expressive, intrinsically meaningful and reliable because they are relatively costly and hard to fake.

Speech consists of digital contrasts whose cost is essentially zero. As pure social conventions, signals of this kind cannot evolve in a Darwinian social world&amp;nbsp;— they are a theoretical impossibility.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993" /&gt; Being intrinsically unreliable, language works only if you can build up a reputation for trustworthiness within a certain kind of society&amp;nbsp;— namely, one where symbolic cultural facts (sometimes called "institutional facts") can be established and maintained through collective social endorsement.&lt;ref name="Searle 1995"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Searle | first1 = John R. | title = The construction of social reality | year = 1995 | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-02-928045-4 | oclc = 31411549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In any [[hunter-gatherer]] society, the basic mechanism for establishing trust in symbolic cultural facts is collective ''ritual''.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1947 [1915].

Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, pp. 205-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the task facing researchers into the origins of language is more multidisciplinary than is usually supposed. It involves addressing the evolutionary emergence of human symbolic culture as a whole, with language an important but subsidiary component.&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/anthropology-news/wild-voices Chris Knight and Jerome Lewis, 2017.

=====Criticism=====
Critics of the theory include [[Noam Chomsky]], who terms it the "non-existence" hypothesis&amp;nbsp;— a denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky (2011): [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15475441.2011.584041 Language and Other Cognitive Systems. What Is Special About Language?], Language Learning and Development, 7:4, 263-278&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky's own theory is that language emerged in an instant and in perfect form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N | year = 2005 | title = Three factors in language design | url = | journal = Linguistic Inquiry | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 1–22 | doi=10.1162/0024389052993655}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting his critics in turn to retort that only something that doesn't exist&amp;nbsp;— a theoretical construct or convenient scientific fiction&amp;nbsp;— could possibly emerge in such a miraculous way.&lt;ref name="Knight 2008" /&gt; The controversy remains unresolved.

===Twentieth century speculations===

====Festal origins====
The essay "The festal origin of human speech", though published in the late nineteenth century,&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;Donovan, J. 1891-92. The festal origin of human speech, part I. ''Mind'' '''16'''(64), pp. 495-506.&lt;/ref&gt; made little impact until the American philosopher [[Susanne Langer]] re-discovered and publicised it in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, S. 1957 [1941]. ''Philosophy in a New Key.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|"In the early history of articulate sounds they could make no meaning themselves, but they preserved and got intimately associated with the peculiar feelings and perceptions that came most prominently into the minds of the festal players during their excitement."|{{Citation|title=''J. Donovan, 1891.'' The Festal Origin of Human Speech.}}&lt;ref name="Donovan" /&gt;}}
The theory sets out from the observation that primate vocal sounds are above all ''emotionally'' expressive. The emotions aroused are socially contagious. Because of this, an extended bout of screams, hoots or barks will tend to express not just the feelings of this or that individual but the mutually contagious ups and downs of everyone within earshot.

Turning to the ancestors of ''Homo sapiens'', the "festal origin" theory suggests that in the "play-excitement" preceding or following a communal hunt or other group activity, everyone might have combined their voices in a comparable way, emphasising their mood of togetherness with such noises as rhythmic drumming and hand-clapping. Variably pitched voices would have formed conventional patterns, such that choral singing became an integral part of communal celebration.

Although this was not yet speech, according to Langer, it developed the vocal capacities from which speech would later derive. There would be conventional modes of ululating, clapping or dancing appropriate to different festive occasions, each so intimately associated with ''that kind of occasion'' that it would tend to collectively uphold and embody the concept of it. Anyone hearing a snatch of sound from such a song would recall the associated occasion and mood. A melodic, rhythmic sequence of syllables conventionally associated with a certain type of celebration would become, in effect, its vocal mark. On that basis, certain familiar sound sequences would become "symbolic".

In support of all this, Langer cites ethnographic reports of tribal songs consisting entirely of "rhythmic nonsense syllables". She concedes that an English equivalent such as "hey-nonny-nonny", although perhaps suggestive of certain feelings or ideas, is neither noun, verb, adjective, nor any other syntactical part of speech. So long as articulate sound served only in the capacity of "hey nonny-nonny", "hallelujah" or "alack-a-day", it cannot yet have been speech. For that to arise, according to Langer, it was necessary for such sequences to be emitted increasingly ''out of context''&amp;nbsp;— outside the total situation that gave rise to them. Extending a set of associations from one cognitive context to another, completely different one, is the secret of ''metaphor''. Langer invokes an early version of what is nowadays termed "grammaticalisation" theory to show how, from, such a point of departure, syntactically complex speech might progressively have arisen.

Langer acknowledges [[Emile Durkheim]] as having proposed a strikingly similar theory back in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1976 [1912]. ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life.''

===="Musilanguage"====
The term "musilanguage" (or "hmmmmm") refers to a pre-linguistic system of vocal communication from which (according to some scholars) ''both'' music ''and'' language later derived. The idea is that rhythmic, melodic, emotionally expressive vocal ritual helped bond coalitions and, over time, set up selection pressures for enhanced volitional control over the speech articulators. Patterns of synchronised choral chanting are imagined to have varied according to the occasion. For example, "we're setting off to find honey" might sound qualitatively different from "we're setting off to hunt" or "we're grieving over our relative's death". If social standing depended on maintaining a regular beat and harmonising one's own voice with that of everyone else, group members would have come under pressure to demonstrate their choral skills.

Archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]] speculates that the Neanderthals possessed some such system, expressing themselves in a "language" known as "Hmmmmm", standing for '''H'''olistic, '''m'''anipulative, '''m'''ulti-'''m'''odal, '''m'''usical and '''m'''imetic.&lt;ref name="Mithen 2006" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;169-175&lt;/sup&gt; In Bruce Richman's earlier version of essentially the same idea,&lt;ref name="Richman 2000" /&gt; frequent repetition of the same few songs by many voices made it easy for people to remember those sequences as whole units. Activities that a group of people were doing while they were vocalising together&amp;nbsp;— activities that were important or striking or richly emotional&amp;nbsp;— came to be associated with particular sound sequences, so that each time a fragment was heard, it evoked highly specific memories. The idea is that the earliest lexical items (words) started out as abbreviated fragments of what were originally communal songs.

{{quotation|"Whenever people sang or chanted a particular sound sequence they would remember the concrete particulars of the situation most strongly associated with it: ah, yes! we sing this during this particular ritual admitting new members to the group; or, we chant this during a long journey in the forest; or, when a clearing is finished for a new camp, this is what we chant; or these are the keenings we sing during ceremonies over dead members of our group."|{{Citation|title=''Richman, B. 2000. How music fixed "nonsense" into significant formulas: on rhythm, repetition, and meaning. In N. L. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown (eds), ''The Origins of Music: An introduction to evolutionary musicology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, pp. 301-314.}}}}

As group members accumulated an expanding repertoire of songs for different occasions, interpersonal call-and-response patterns evolved along one trajectory to assume linguistic form. Meanwhile, along a divergent trajectory, polyphonic singing and other kinds of music became increasingly specialised and sophisticated.

To explain the establishment of syntactical speech, Richman cites English "I wanna go home". He imagines this to have been learned in the first instance not as a combinatorial sequence of free-standing words, but as a single stuck-together combination&amp;nbsp;— the melodic sound people make to express "feeling homesick". Someone might sing "I wanna go home", prompting other voices to chime in with "I need to go home", "I'd love to go home", "Let's go home" and so forth. Note that one part of the song remains constant, while another is permitted to vary. If this theory is accepted, syntactically complex speech began evolving as each chanted mantra allowed for variation at a certain point, allowing for the insertion of an element from some other song. For example, while mourning during a funeral rite, someone might want to recall a memory of collecting honey with the deceased, signalling this at an appropriate moment with a fragment of the "we're collecting honey" song.  Imagine that such practices became common. Meaning-laden utterances would now have become subject to a distinctively linguistic creative principle&amp;nbsp;— that of recursive embedding.

====Hunter-gatherer egalitarianism====
[[File:Mbendjele meat sharing.jpg|thumb|Mbendjele hunter-gatherer meat sharing]]
Many scholars associate the evolutionary emergence of speech with profound social, sexual, political and cultural developments. One view is that primate-style dominance needed to give way to a more cooperative and egalitarian lifestyle of the kind characteristic of modern hunter-gatherers.&lt;ref name="Whiten, A 1999. pp. 173-193"&gt;Whiten, A. 1999. The evolution of deep social mind in humans. In M. Corballis and S. E. G. Lea (eds), ''The Descent of Mind. Psychological perspectives on hominid evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 173-193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. and C. Power (2011). Social conditions for the evolutionary emergence of language. In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), ''Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 346-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"/&gt;

=====Intersubjectivity=====
According to [[Michael Tomasello]], the key cognitive capacity distinguishing ''Homo sapiens'' from our ape cousins is "[[intersubjectivity]]". This entails [[turn-taking]] and role-reversal: your partner strives to read your mind, you simultaneously strive to read theirs, and each of you makes a conscious effort to assist the other in the process. The outcome is that each partner forms a representation of the other's mind in which their own can be discerned by reflection.

Tomasello argues that this kind of bi-directional cognition is central to the very possibility of linguistic communication. Drawing on his research with both children and chimpanzees, he reports that human infants, from one year old onwards, begin viewing their own mind as if from the standpoint of others. He describes this as a cognitive revolution. Chimpanzees, as they grow up, never undergo such a revolution. The explanation, according to Tomasello, is that their evolved psychology is adapted to a deeply competitive way of life. Wild-living chimpanzees form despotic social hierarchies, most interactions involving calculations of dominance and submission. An adult chimp will strive to outwit its rivals by guessing at their intentions while blocking them from reciprocating. Since bi-directional intersubjective communication is impossible under such conditions, the cognitive capacities necessary for language don't evolve.&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 1999"&gt;Tomasello, M. 1999. ''The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M. 2006, Why don't apes point? In N. J. Enfield &amp; S. C. Levinson (eds), ''Roots of Human Sociality: Culture, cognition and interaction.'' Oxford &amp; New York: Berg, pp. 506-524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 2008"&gt;Tomasello, M. 2008. ''Origins of Human Communication.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Counter-dominance=====
In the scenario favoured by David Erdal and Andrew Whiten,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erdal | first1 = D. | last2 = Whiten | first2 = A. | year = 1994 | title = On human egalitarianism: an evolutionary product of Machiavellian status escalation? | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 175–183 | doi=10.1086/204255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erdal, D. and A. Whiten 1996. Egalitarianism and Machiavellian intelligence in human evolution. In P. Mellars and K. Gibson (eds), ''Modelling the Early Human Mind.'' Cambridge: McDonald Institute Monographs, pp. 139-150.&lt;/ref&gt; primate-style dominance provoked equal and opposite coalitionary resistance&amp;nbsp;— ''counter-dominance.'' During the course of human evolution, increasingly effective strategies of rebellion against dominant individuals led to a compromise. While abandoning any attempt to dominate others, group members vigorously asserted their personal autonomy, maintaining their alliances to make potentially dominant individuals think twice. Within increasingly stable coalitions, according to this perspective, status began to be earned in novel ways, social rewards accruing to those perceived by their peers as especially cooperative and self-aware.&lt;ref name="Whiten, A 1999. pp. 173-193" /&gt;

=====Reverse dominance=====
While counter-dominance, according to this evolutionary narrative, culminates in a stalemate, anthropologist Christopher Boehm&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 1997. Egalitarian behaviour and the evolution of political intelligence. In A. Whiten and R. W. Byrne (eds), ''Machiavellian Intelligence II: Extensions and evaluations.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 341-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 2001. ''Hierarchy in the Forest. The evolution of egalitarian behavior.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extends the logic a step further. Counter-dominance tips over at last into full-scale "reverse dominance". The rebellious coalition decisively overthrows the figure of the primate alpha-male. No dominance is allowed except that of the self-organised community as a whole.

As a result of this social and political change, hunter-gatherer egalitarianism is established. As children grow up, they are motivated by those around them to reverse perspective, engaging with other minds on the model of their own. Selection pressures favour such psychological innovations as imaginative empathy, joint attention, moral judgment, project-oriented collaboration and the ability to evaluate one's own behaviour from the standpoint of others. Underpinning enhanced probabilities of cultural transmission and cumulative cultural evolution, these developments culminate in the establishment of hunter-gatherer-style egalitarianism in association with intersubjective communication and cognition. It is in this social and political context that language evolves.&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"/&gt;

====Scenarios involving mother-infant interactions====

====="Putting the baby down"=====
According to Dean Falk's "putting the baby down" theory, vocal interactions between early hominin mothers and infants sparked a sequence of events that led, eventually, to our ancestors' earliest words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Falk | first1 = D | year = 2004 | title = Prelinguistic evolution in early Hominins: Whence motherese? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 491–503 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x04000111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their monkey and ape counterparts, couldn't move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed reassurance that they were not being abandoned. Mothers responded by developing "motherese"&amp;nbsp;— an infant-directed communicative system embracing facial expressions, body language, touching, patting, caressing, laughter, tickling and emotionally expressive contact calls. The argument is that language somehow developed out of all this.

;Criticism
While this theory may explain a certain kind of infant-directed "protolanguage"&amp;nbsp;— known today as "motherese"&amp;nbsp;— it does little to solve the really difficult problem, which is the emergence among adults of syntactical speech. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The fundamental problem is that ape mothers (unlike monkey mothers who may often babysit) do not have female relatives nearby. The strong implication is that, in the course of ''Homo'' evolution, allocare could develop because ''Homo'' mothers did have female kin close by&amp;nbsp;— in the first place, most reliably, their own mothers. Extending the [[Grandmother hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="Hawkes 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hawkes | first1 = K. | last2 = O'Connell | first2 = JF. | last3 = Jones | first3 = NG. | last4 = Alvarez | first4 = H. | last5 = Charnov | first5 = EL. | title = Grandmothering, menopause, and the evolution of human life histories. | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 1336–9 |date=Feb 1998 | pmc = 18762 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/95/3/1336.full | PMID = 9448332 | doi=10.1073/pnas.95.3.1336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hrdy argues that evolving ''[[Homo erectus]]'' females necessarily relied on female kin initially; this novel situation in ape evolution of mother, infant and mother's mother as allocarer provided the evolutionary ground for the emergence of intersubjectivity. She relates this onset of "cooperative breeding in an ape" to shifts in life history and slower child development, linked to the change in brain and body size from the 2 million year mark.

Primatologist Klaus Zuberbühler&lt;ref&gt;Zuberbühler, K. 2012. Cooperative breeding and the evolution of vocal flexibility. In Tallerman, M. and K. Gibson (eds), ''The Oxford Handbook of Human Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 71-81.&lt;/ref&gt; uses these ideas to help explain the emergence of vocal flexibility in the human species. Co-operative breeding would have compelled infants to struggle actively to gain the attention of caregivers, not all of whom would have been directly related. A basic primate repertoire of vocal signals may have been insufficient for this social challenge. Natural selection, according to this view, would have favoured babies with advanced vocal skills, beginning with babbling (which triggers positive responses in care-givers) and paving the way for the elaborate and unique speech abilities of modern humans.

=====Was "mama" the first word?=====
These ideas might be linked to those of the renowned structural linguist Roman Jakobson, who claimed that "the sucking activities of the child are accompanied by a slight nasal murmur, the only phonation to be produced when the lips are pressed to the mother's breast&amp;nbsp;... and the mouth is full".&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. 1960. "Why 'Mama' and 'Papa'". In B. Caplan and S. Wagner (eds), ''Essays in Honor of Heinz Werner.'' New York: International Universities Press, pp. 124-134; p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that later in the infant's development, "this phonatory reaction to nursing is reproduced as an anticipatory signal at the mere sight of food and finally as a manifestation of a desire to eat, or more generally, as an expression of discontent and impatient longing for missing food or absent nurser, and any ungranted wish." So, the action of opening and shutting the mouth, combined with the production of a nasal sound when the lips are closed, yielded the sound sequence "Mama", which may therefore count as the very first word. Peter MacNeilage sympathetically discusses this theory in his major book, The ''Origin of Speech'', linking it with Dean Falk's "putting the baby down" theory (see above).&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, P. 2008. ''The Origin of Speech.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 144-154.&lt;/ref&gt; Needless to say, other scholars have suggested completely different candidates for ''Homo sapiens''' very first word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Kenneally | first1 = Christine. | title = The first word : the search for the origins of language | year = 2007 | publisher = Viking | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-670-03490-1 | oclc = 80460757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Niche construction theory====
[[File:Beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego. Beavers adapt to an environmental niche which they shape by their own activities.]]While the biological language faculty is genetically inherited, actual languages or dialects are culturally transmitted, as are social norms, technological traditions and so forth.

''Not by Genes Alone: How culture transformed human evolution.'' Chicago: Chicago University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals capable of rudimentary forms of protolanguage would have enjoyed enhanced access to cultural understandings, while these, conveyed in ways that young brains could readily learn, would in turn have become transmitted with increasing efficiency.

In some ways like beavers as they construct their dams, humans have always engaged in [[niche construction]], creating novel environments to which they subsequently become adapted. Selection pressures associated with prior niches tend to become relaxed as humans depend increasingly on novel environments created continuously by their own productive activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laland | first1 = K.

==Conceptual frameworks==

===Structuralism===
{{quotation|"Consider a knight in chess. Is the piece by itself an element of the game? Certainly not. For as a material object, separated from its square on the board and the other conditions of play, it is of no significance for the player. It becomes a real, concrete element only when it takes on or becomes identified with its value in the game. Suppose that during a game this piece gets destroyed or lost. Can it be replaced? Of course it can. Not only by some other knight, but even by an object of quite a different shape, which can be counted as a knight, provided it is assigned the same value as the missing piece."|{{Citation|title=Saussure, F. de 1983 [1916]. ''Course in General Linguistics.'' Translated by R. Harris. London: Duckworth, pp. 108-09.}}}}  The Swiss scholar [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] founded linguistics as a twentieth-century professional discipline. Saussure regarded a language as a rule-governed system, much like a board game such as chess. In order to understand chess, he insisted, we must ignore such external factors as the weather prevailing during a particular session or the material composition of this or that piece. The game is autonomous with respect to its material embodiments. In the same way, when studying language, it's essential to focus on its internal structure as a social institution. External matters (''e.g.'', the shape of the human tongue) are irrelevant from this standpoint. Saussure regarded 'speaking' ''(parole)'' as individual, ancillary and more or less accidental by comparison with "language" ''(langue)'', which he viewed as collective, systematic and essential.

Saussure showed little interest in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Nor did he consider it worthwhile to speculate about how language might originally have evolved. Saussure's assumptions in fact cast doubt on the validity of narrowly conceived origins scenarios. His structuralist paradigm, when accepted in its original form, turns scholarly attention to a wider problem: how our species acquired the capacity to establish [[social institutions]] in general.

===Behaviourism===
{{Main|Behaviourism}}
{{quotation|"The basic processes and relations which give verbal behaviour its special characteristics are now fairly well understood. Much of the experimental work responsible for this advance has been carried out on other species, but the results have proved to be surprisingly free of species restrictions. Recent work has shown that the methods can be extended to human behaviour without serious modification."|{{Citation|title=Skinner, B.F. 1957. ''Verbal Behavior.'' New York: Appleton Century Crofts, p. 3.}}}} In the United States, prior to and immediately following World War II, the dominant psychological paradigm was [[behaviourism]]. Within this conceptual framework, language was seen as a certain kind of behaviour&amp;nbsp;— namely, verbal behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. 1957. ''Verbal Behavior.'' New York: Appleton Century Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; to be studied much like any other kind of behaviour in the animal world. Rather as a laboratory rat learns how to find its way through an artificial maze, so a human child learns the verbal behaviour of the society into which it is born. The phonological, grammatical and other complexities of speech are in this sense "external" phenomena, inscribed into an initially unstructured brain. Language's emergence in ''Homo sapiens,'' from this perspective, presents no special theoretical challenge. Human behaviour, whether verbal or otherwise, illustrates the malleable nature of the mammalian&amp;nbsp;— and especially the human&amp;nbsp;— brain.

===Chomskyan Nativism===
[[File:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumb|left|The [[modularity of mind]] is an idea which was prefigured in some respects by the 19th-century movement of [[phrenology]].]]
{{Main|Jerry Fodor on mental architecture}}{{Main|Cognitive revolution}}Nativism is the theory that humans are born with certain specialised [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitive]] [[modularity|modules]] enabling us to acquire highly complex bodies of knowledge such as the grammar of a language.

{{quotation|"There is a long history of study of origin of language, asking how it arose from calls of apes and so forth. That investigation in my view is a complete waste of time, because language is based on an entirely different principle than any animal communication system." |{{Citation|title=Chomsky, N., 1988. ''Language and Problems of Knowledge.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, p. 183.}}}}

From the mid-1950s onwards, [[Noam Chomsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N | year = 1959 | title = Review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior | url = | journal = Language | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 26–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1966. ''Cartesian Linguistics. A chapter in the history of rationalist thought.'' New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Fodor]]&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Fodor, 1983. ''The Modularity of Mind: An Essay on Faculty Psychology'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and others mounted what they conceptualised as a 'revolution' against behaviourism. Retrospectively, this became labelled 'the [[cognitive revolution]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. 1985. ''The Mind's New Science. A history of the cognitive revolution.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. and C. E. Erneling (eds.), 1997. ''The Future of the Cognitive Revolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas behaviourism had denied the scientific validity of the concept of "mind", Chomsky replied that, in fact, the concept of "body" is more problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 2002. ''On Nature and Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 45-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviourists tended to view the child's brain as a ''tabula rasa'', initially lacking structure or cognitive content. According to B. F. Skinner, for example, richness of behavioural detail (whether verbal or non-verbal) emanated from the environment. Chomsky turned this idea on its head. The linguistic environment encountered by a young child, according to Chomsky's version of [[psychological nativism]], is in fact hopelessly inadequate. No child could possibly acquire the complexities of grammar from such an impoverished source.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1980. ''Rules and Representations.'' New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Far from viewing language as wholly external, Chomsky re-conceptualised it as wholly internal. To explain how a child so rapidly and effortlessly acquires its natal language, he insisted, we must conclude that it comes into the world with the essentials of grammar already pre-installed.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; No other species, according to Chomsky, is genetically equipped with a language faculty&amp;nbsp;— or indeed with anything remotely like one.&lt;ref name="Chomsky, N 2000"&gt;Chomsky, N. 2000. ''The Architecture of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of such a faculty in ''Homo sapiens'', from this standpoint, presents biological science with a major theoretical challenge.

===Speech act theory===
{{Main|Speech act theory}}One way to explain biological complexity is by reference to its inferred function. According to the influential philosopher [[J. L. Austin|John Austin]],&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. 1978 [1955]. ''How to Do Things with Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; speech's primary function is action in the social world.

[[Speech acts]], according to this body of theory, can be analysed on three different levels: locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary. An act is ''locutionary'' when viewed as the production of certain linguistic sounds&amp;nbsp;— for example, practicing correct pronunciation in a foreign language. An act is ''illocutionary'' insofar as it constitutes an intervention in the world as jointly perceived or understood. Promising, marrying, divorcing, declaring, stating, authorising, announcing and so forth are all speech acts in this ''illocutionary'' sense. An act is ''perlocutionary'' when viewed in terms of its direct psychological effect on an audience. Frightening a baby by saying 'Boo!' would be an example of a "perlocutionary" act.

For Austin, "doing things" with words means, first and foremost, deploying ''illocutionary'' force. The secret of this is community participation or collusion. There must be a 'correct' (conventionally agreed) procedure, and all those concerned must accept that it has been properly followed. {{quotation|"One of our examples was, for instance, the utterance 'I do' (take this woman to be my lawful wedded wife), as uttered in the course of a marriage ceremony. Here we should say that in saying these words we are ''doing'' something&amp;nbsp;— namely, marrying, rather than ''reporting'' something, namely ''that'' we are marrying."|{{Citation|title=Austin, J. L. 1962. ''How To Do Things With Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 12-13.}}}} In the case of a priest declaring a couple to be man and wife, his words will have illocutionary force only if he is properly authorised and only if the ceremony is properly conducted, using words deemed appropriate to the occasion. Austin points out that should anyone attempt to baptize a penguin, the act would be null and void. For reasons which have nothing to do with physics, chemistry or biology, baptism is inappropriate to be applied to penguins, irrespective of the verbal formulation used.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. 1962. ''How To Do Things With Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This body of theory may have implications for speculative scenarios concerning the origins of speech. "Doing things with words" presupposes shared understandings and agreements pertaining not just to language but to social conduct more generally. Apes might produce sequences of structured sound, influencing one another in that way. To deploy ''illocutionary'' force, however, they would need to have entered a non-physical and non-biological realm&amp;nbsp;— one of shared contractual and other intangibles. This novel cognitive domain consists of what philosophers term "institutional facts"&amp;nbsp;— objective facts whose existence, paradoxically, depends on communal faith or belief.&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Searle, J 1969" /&gt; Few primatologists, evolutionary psychologists or anthropologists consider that nonhuman primates are capable of the necessary levels of joint attention, sustained commitment or collaboration in pursuit of future goals.&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M. 2006, Why don't apes point?

===Biosemiotics===
[[File:ADN animation.gif|thumb|The structure of part of a DNA [[double helix]]]]{{Main|Biosemiotics}}

{{quotation|"the deciphering of the genetic code has revealed our possession of a language much older than hieroglyphics, a language as old as life itself, a language that is the most living language of all&amp;nbsp;— even if its letters are invisible and its words are buried in the cells of our bodies."|{{Citation|title=Beadle, G. and M. Beadle, 1966. ''The Language of Life. An introduction to the science of genetics.'' Doubleday and Co, New York.}}}}

Biosemiotics is a relatively new discipline, inspired in large part by the discovery of the genetic code in the early 1960s. Its basic assumption is that ''Homo sapiens'' is not alone in its reliance on codes and signs. Language and symbolic culture must have biological roots, hence [[Semiotics|semiotic]] principles must apply also in the animal world.

The discovery of the molecular structure of DNA apparently contradicted the idea that life could be explained, ultimately, in terms of the fundamental laws of physics. The letters of the genetic alphabet seemed to have "meaning", yet meaning is not a concept which has any place in physics. The natural science community initially solved this difficulty by invoking the concept of "information", treating information as independent of meaning. But a different solution to the puzzle was to recall that the laws of physics in themselves are never sufficient to explain natural phenomena. To explain, say, the unique physical and chemical characteristics of the planets in our solar system, scientists must work out how the laws of physics became constrained by particular sequences of events following the formation of the Sun.

According to Howard Pattee&amp;nbsp;— a pioneering figure in biosemiotics&amp;nbsp;— the same principle applies to the evolution of life on earth, a process in which certain "frozen accidents" or "natural constraints" have from time to time drastically reduced the number of possible evolutionary outcomes. Codes, when they prove to be stable over evolutionary time, are constraints of this kind. The most fundamental such "frozen accident" was the emergence of DNA as a self-replicating molecule, but the history of life on earth has been characterised by a succession of comparably dramatic events, each of which can be conceptualised as the emergence of a new code.&lt;ref&gt;Barbieri, M. 2003. ''The Organic Codes. An Introduction to Semantic Biology.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, the evolutionary emergence of spoken language was one more event of essentially the same kind.&lt;ref&gt;Pattee, H.

===The Handicap principle===
{{Main|Handicap principle}}

[[Image:Peacock front02 - melbourne zoo.jpg|thumb|A peacock's tail: a classic example of costly signalling]]

In 1975, the Israeli theoretical biologist [[Amotz Zahavi]]&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1975"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = Mate selection-a selection for a handicap. | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 205–14 |date=Sep 1975 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3| pmid = 1195756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1977"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = The cost of honesty (further remarks on the handicap principle). | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 603–5 |date=Aug 1977 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(77)90061-3| pmid = 904334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zehavi 1997"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Zehavi | first1 = Amots. | last2 = Zahavi | first2 = Avishag. | title = The handicap principle : a missing piece of Darwin's puzzle | year = 1997 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-510035-8 | oclc = 35360821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a novel theory which, although controversial, has come to dominate Darwinian thinking on how signals evolve. Zahavi's "handicap principle" states that to be effective, signals must be reliable; to be reliable, the bodily investment in them must be so high as to make cheating unprofitable.

Paradoxically, if this logic is accepted, signals in nature evolve not to be efficient but, on the contrary, to be elaborate and wasteful of time and energy. A peacock's tail is the classic illustration. Zahavi's theory is that since peahens are on the look-out for male braggarts and cheats, they insist on a display of quality so costly that only a genuinely fit peacock could afford to pay. Needless to say, not all signals in the animal world are quite as elaborate as a peacock's tail. But if Zahavi is correct, all require some bodily investment&amp;nbsp;— an expenditure of time and energy which "handicaps" the signaller in some way.

Animal vocalisations (according to Zahavi) are reliable because they are faithful reflections of the state of the signaller's body. To switch from an honest to a deceitful call, the animal would have to adopt a different bodily posture. Since every bodily action has its own optimal starting position, changing that position to produce a false message would interfere with the task of carrying out the action really intended. The gains made by cheating would not make up for the losses incurred by assuming an improper posture&amp;nbsp;— and so the phony message turns out to be not worth its price.&lt;ref name="Zehavi 1997" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/sup&gt; This may explain, in particular, why ape and monkey vocal signals have evolved to be so strikingly inflexible when compared with the varied speech sounds produced by the human tongue. The apparent inflexibility of chimpanzee vocalisations may strike the human observer as surprising until we realise that being inflexible is necessarily bound up with being perceptibly honest in the sense of "hard-to-fake".

If we accept this theory, the emergence of speech becomes theoretically impossible. Communication of this kind just cannot evolve.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993" /&gt; The problem is that words are cheap. Nothing about their acoustic features can reassure listeners that they are genuine and not fakes. Any strategy of reliance on someone else's tongue&amp;nbsp;— perhaps the most flexible organ in the body&amp;nbsp;— presupposes unprecedented levels of honesty and trust. To date, Darwinian thinkers have found it difficult to explain the requisite levels of community-wide cooperation and trust.

An influential standard textbook is ''Animal Signals,'' by [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[David Harper (biologist)|David Harper]].&lt;ref name="Maynard Smith 2003"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = John | last2 = Harper | first2 = David | title = Animal signal | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-852685-8 | oclc = 54460090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors divide the costs of communication into two components, (1) the investment necessary to ensure transmission of a discernible signal; (2) the investment necessary to guarantee that each signal is reliable and not a fake. The authors point out that although costs in the second category may be relatively low, they are not zero. Even in relatively relaxed, cooperative social contexts&amp;nbsp;— for example, when communication is occurring between genetic kin&amp;nbsp;— some investment must be made to guarantee reliability. In short, the notion of super-efficient communication&amp;nbsp;— eliminating all costs except those necessary for successful transmission&amp;nbsp;— is biologically unrealistic. Yet speech comes precisely into this category.

===Cognitive linguistics===
{{Main|Cognitive linguistics}}Cognitive linguistics views linguistic structure as arising continuously out of usage. Speakers are forever discovering new ways to convey meanings by producing sounds, and in some cases these novel strategies become conventionalised. Between phonological structure and semantic structure there is no causal relationship. Instead, each novel pairing of sound and meaning involves an imaginative leap.

In their book, ''Metaphors We Live By,'' [[George Lakoff]] and Mark Johnson helped pioneer this approach, claiming that ''[[metaphor]]'' is what makes human thought special. All language, they argued, is permeated with metaphor, whose use in fact ''constitutes'' distinctively human&amp;nbsp;— that is, distinctively abstract&amp;nbsp;— thought. To conceptualise things which cannot be directly perceived&amp;nbsp;— intangibles such as time, life, reason, mind, society or justice&amp;nbsp;— we have no choice but to set out from more concrete and directly perceptible phenomena such as motion, location, distance, size and so forth. In all cultures across the world, according to Lakoff and Johnson, people resort to such familiar metaphors as ''ideas are locations, thinking is moving'' and ''mind is body''. For example, we might express the idea of "arriving at a crucial point in our argument" by proceeding as if literally travelling from one physical location to the next.

Metaphors, by definition, are not literally true. Strictly speaking, they are fictions&amp;nbsp;— from a pedantic standpoint, even falsehoods. But if we couldn't resort to metaphorical fictions, it's doubtful whether we could even form conceptual representations of such nebulous phenomena as "ideas", thoughts", "minds", and so forth.

The bearing of these ideas on current thinking on speech origins remains unclear. One suggestion is that ape communication tends to resist metaphor for social reasons. Since they inhabit a Darwinian (as opposed to morally regulated) social world, these animals are under strong competitive pressure ''not'' to accept patent fictions as valid communicative currency. Ape vocal communication tends to be inflexible, marginalising the ultra-flexible tongue, precisely because listeners treat with suspicion any signal which might prove to be a fake. Such insistence on perceptible veracity is clearly incompatible with metaphoric usage. An implication is that neither articulate speech nor distinctively human abstract thought could have begun evolving until our ancestors had become more cooperative and trusting of one another's communicative intentions.&lt;ref name="Knight 2008" /&gt;

===Natural science or social science?===

====Social reality====
{{Main|Social reality}}When people converse with one another, according to the American philosopher [[John Searle]], they're making moves, not in the real world which other species inhabit, but in a shared virtual realm peculiar to ourselves. Unlike the deployment of muscular effort to move a physical object, the deployment of [[illocutionary force]] requires no physical effort (except movement of the tongue/mouth to produce speech) and produces no effect which any measuring device could detect. Instead, our action takes place on a quite different level&amp;nbsp;— that of ''social'' reality. This kind of reality is in one sense hallucinatory, being a product of collective intentionality. It consists, not of "brute facts"&amp;nbsp;— facts which exist anyway, irrespective of anyone's belief&amp;nbsp;— but of "institutional facts", which "exist" only if you believe in them. Government, marriage, citizenship and money are examples of "institutional facts". One can distinguish between "brute" facts and "institutional" ones by applying a simple test. Suppose no one believed in the fact&amp;nbsp;— would it still be true? If the answer is "yes", it's "brute". If the answer is "no", it's "institutional".&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;

{{quotation|"Imagine a group of primitive creatures, more or less like ourselves&amp;nbsp;... Now imagine that, acting as a group, they build a barrier, a wall around the place where they live&amp;nbsp;... The wall is designed to keep intruders out and keep members of the group in&amp;nbsp;... Let us suppose that the wall gradually decays. It slowly deteriorates until all that is left is a line of stones. But let us suppose that the inhabitants continue to treat the line of stones as if it could perform the function of the wall. Let us suppose that, as a matter of fact, they treat the line of stones just as if they understood that it was not to be crossed&amp;nbsp;... This shift is the decisive move in the creation of institutional reality. It is nothing less than the decisive move in the creation of what we think of as distinctive in human, as opposed to animal, societies."|{{Citation| title = ''John R. Searle, 1995.'' The construction of social reality, ''Free Press, pp.134''}}&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;}}

The facts of language in general and of speech in particular are, from this perspective, "institutional" rather than "brute". The semantic meaning of a word, for example, is whatever its users imagine it to be. To "do things with words" is to operate in a virtual world which seems real because we share it in common. In this incorporeal world, the laws of physics, chemistry and biology do not apply. That explains why illocutionary force can be deployed without exerting muscular effort. Apes and monkeys inhabit the "brute" world. To make an impact, they must scream, bark, threaten, seduce or in other ways invest bodily effort. If they were invited to play chess, they would be unable to resist throwing their pieces at one another. Speech is not like that. A few movements of the tongue, under appropriate conditions, can be sufficient to open parliament, annul a marriage, confer a knighthood or declare war.&lt;ref name="Searle, J 1969"&gt;Searle, J. 1969.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To explain, on a Darwinian basis, how such apparent magic first began to work, we must ask how, when and why ''Homo sapiens'' succeeded in establishing the wider domain of institutional facts.

====Nature or society?====
{{Main|Evolutionary linguistics}}
"[[Brute fact#Searle|Brute facts]]", in the terminology of speech act philosopher [[John Searle]],&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt; are facts which are true anyway, regardless of human belief. Suppose you don't believe in gravity: jump over a cliff and you'll still fall. [[Natural science]] is the study of facts of this kind. "Institutional facts" are fictions accorded factual status within human [[social institutions]]. Monetary and commercial facts are fictions of this kind. The complexities of today's global currency system are facts only while we believe in them: suspend the belief and the facts correspondingly dissolve. Yet although institutional facts rest on human belief, that doesn't make them mere distortions or hallucinations. Take my confidence that these two five-pound banknotes in my pocket are worth ten pounds. That's not merely my subjective belief: it's an objective, indisputable fact. But now imagine a collapse of public confidence in the currency system. Suddenly, the realities in my pocket dissolve.

Scholars who doubt the scientific validity of the notion of "institutional facts" include [[Noam Chomsky]], for whom language is not social. In Chomsky's view, language is a natural object (a component of the individual brain) and its study, therefore, a branch of natural science. In explaining the origin of language, scholars in this intellectual camp invoke non-social developments&amp;nbsp;— in Chomsky's case, a random genetic mutation.&lt;ref name="Chomsky, N 2000" /&gt; Chomsky argues that language might exist inside the brain of a single mutant gorilla even if no one else believed in it, even if no one else existed apart from the mutant&amp;nbsp;— and even if the gorilla in question remained unaware of its existence, never actually speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 2000. ''The Architecture of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 17-18..&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite philosophical camp are those who, in the tradition of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], argue that if no one believed in words or rules, they simply would not exist. These scholars, correspondingly, regard language as essentially institutional, concluding that linguistics should be considered a topic within [[social science]]. In explaining the evolutionary emergence of language, scholars in this intellectual camp tend to invoke profound changes in social relationships.&lt;ref name="Knight 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dessalles 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dessalles | first1 = Jean-Louis. | title = Why we talk : the evolutionary origins of language | year = 2007 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-927623-3 | oclc = 71329834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism.''' Darwinian scientists today see little value in the traditional distinction between "natural" and "social" science. [[Darwinism]] in its modern form is the study of cooperation and competition in nature&amp;nbsp;— a topic which is intrinsically social.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1985. ''Social Evolution.'' Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt; Against this background, there is an increasing awareness among evolutionary linguists and Darwinian anthropologists that traditional inter-disciplinary barriers can have damaging consequences for investigations into the origins of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hurford | first1 = James R. | last2 = Studdert-Kennedy | first2 = Michael. | last3 = Knight | first3 = Chris | title = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dunbar | first1 = Robin I.M.  | last2 = Knight | first2 = Chris | last3 = Power | first3 = Camilla. | title = The evolution of culture : an interdisciplinary vie | year = 1999 | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | location = Edinburgh | isbn = 978-0-7486-1076-1 | oclc = 807340111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Knight | first1 = Chris | last2 = Studdert-Kennedy | first2 = Michael. | last3 = Hurford | first3 = James R. | title = The Evolutionary emergence of language : social function and the origins of linguistic form | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-78157-2 | oclc = 807262339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Osage Indian murders''' is a series of murders of [[Osage Nation|Osage]] people in [[Osage County, Oklahoma]] in the early 1920s; newspapers described the increasing number of unsolved murders as the "Reign of Terror".  Estimates are that 60 or more wealthy, full-blood Osage native Americans were killed from 1921 to 1925.&lt;ref name="Jefferson"/&gt; The murders appear to have been committed by people intent on taking over the great wealth of the Osage, whose land was producing valuable [[petroleum|oil]], and who each had [[headright]]s that earned lucrative annual [[royalty payment|royalties]]. Investigation by law enforcement, including the predecessor to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], also revealed extensive corruption among local officials involved in the Osage guardian program. Most of the murders were never prosecuted, but some men were convicted and sentenced.

Congress changed the law to prohibit non-Osage from inheriting headrights from Osage with half or more Native American ancestry. The US government continued to manage the leases and royalties from oil-producing lands, and the tribe became concerned about these assets. In 2000 the Osage Nation filed a suit against the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], alleging that it had not adequately managed the assets and paid people the royalties they were due. The suit was settled in 2011 for $380 million and commitments to improve program management.&lt;ref name="doj"&gt;[https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/historic-settlement-osage-tribe-oklahoma "A Historic Settlement with the Osage Tribe of Oklahoma"], Department of Justice, 21 October 2011; accessed 3 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="howell"/&gt;

==Overview==
In 1907 each tribal member received an allotment of {{convert|657 |acres}}, and they and their legal heirs, whether or not Osage, earned royalties on the "headrights" from their portion of oil-producing land. The tribe held the [[mineral rights]] communally, and paid its members by a percentage related to their holdings. By a law of 1921, Congress required most Osage of half or more Native American ancestry to have court-appointed guardians until they demonstrated "competency"; all minors were required to have guardians appointed by the court, whether or not they had living parents. The guardians were generally local white lawyers and businessmen, who made money off their fees and sometimes set up criminal means to defraud the Osage of their wealth. The Osage wealth attracted many other opportunists, some of whom had criminal intent.

In 1925 the tribal elders, with the help of James Monroe Pyle, a local law officer, sought assistance from the [[Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation#Background|Bureau of Investigation]] (which later developed as the FBI) when local and state officials could not solve the rising number of murders. Pyle presented his evidence of murder and conspiracy and requested an investigation. In its undercover investigation, the Bureau found that several murders in one family were found to have been committed by a gang led by [[William Hale (cattleman)|William "King of Osage Hills" Hale]]. His goal was to gain the oil royalty headrights and wealth of several tribe members, including his nephew's Osage wife, the last survivor of her family. Three men were convicted and sentenced in this case, but most murders went officially unsolved. A late twentieth-century investigation by the journalist Dennis McAuliffe revealed deep corruption among white officials in the county at the time. Incidents included failure of law enforcement to conduct [[post-mortem]] exams, falsified [[death certificate]]s issued by the coroner's office, and other activities among white officials to cover up the murders.

Osage County officials sought revenge against Pyle for his role in bringing the murders to light. Fearing for his life, Pyle and his wife fled to [[Arizona]], where he again served as an officer of the law. He died there in 1942.

In 1925, Congress passed a law prohibiting inheritance of headrights by non-natives from Osage of half or more Native American ancestry, to reduce the threat to the Osage. From 1926–1929, Hale and an associate were convicted of the murders, with one nephew pleading guilty. They were sentenced to life in prison, but later received [[parole]], although the Osage objected.

==Background==
In 1897 oil was first discovered in Osage County.  The [[United States federal government]]'s [[US Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] managed leases for [[oil exploration]] and [[oil production|production]] on land owned by the Osage Nation through the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and later managed royalties, paying individual allottees.  As part of the process of preparing [[Oklahoma]] for statehood, the federal government allotted {{convert|657 |acres}} to each Osage on the tribal rolls in 1907; thereafter, they and their legal [[heir]]s, whether Osage or not, had "headrights" to royalties in oil production, based on their allotments of lands.&lt;ref name="McAuliffe"/&gt; The headrights could be inherited by legal heirs, including non-Osage.

By 1920 the market for oil had grown dramatically and the Osage were wealthy. In 1923 alone "the tribe took in more than thirty million dollars, the equivalent today of more than four hundred million dollars."&lt;ref name="grann"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-marked-woman David Grann, "The Marked Woman", excerpt from ''Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the F.B.I.,'' to be published in April 2017; published in ''The New Yorker'', 1 March 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

People all across the [[United States]] read about the Osage, called "the richest nation, clan or social group of any race on earth, including the whites, man for man."&lt;ref name="Jefferson"/&gt; Some Osage used their royalties to send their children to private schools; others bought fancy cars, clothes and jewelry, and traveled in Europe; and newspapers across the country covered their activities.&lt;ref name="Jefferson"/&gt; Along with tens of thousands of oil workers, the oil wealth attracted many white opportunists to Osage County; as the writer [[Robert Allen Warrior]] characterized them, some were entrepreneurial, while others were criminal, seeking to separate the Osage from their wealth, by murder if necessary.&lt;ref name="Warrior"/&gt;

Believing the Osage would not be able to manage their new wealth, or lobbied by whites who wanted a piece of the action, by 1921 the [[United States Congress]] passed a law requiring that courts appoint [[legal guardian|guardians]] for each Osage of half-blood or more in ancestry, who would manage their royalties and financial affairs until they demonstrated "competency". Under the system, even minors who had less than half-Osage blood had to have guardians appointed, regardless of whether the minors had living parents. The courts appointed the guardians from local white lawyers or businessmen.  The incentives for criminality were overwhelming; such guardians often maneuvered legally to steal Osage land, their headrights or royalties; others were suspected of murdering their charges to gain the headrights.&lt;ref name="McAuliffe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warrior"/&gt;

At that time, 80 lawyers were working in [[Pawhuska, Oklahoma|Pawhuska]], the Osage County seat, which had 8,000 residents; the number of lawyers was said to be as great as in the state capital, which had 140,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe, ''Bloodland,'' pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924 the Department of Interior charged two dozen guardians of Osage with corruption in the administration of their duties related to their charges, but all avoided punishment by settling out of court. They were believed to have swindled their charges out of millions of dollars.  I{{efn| In 1925, each Osage headright was worth $1 million in equivalent 1994 dollars, according to the work by journalist [[Dennis McAuliffe]].&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe, ''Bloodland,'' p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;}}  In 1929 $27 million was reported as still being held by the "Guardian System", the organization set up to protect the financial interests of 883 Osage families in Osage County.&lt;ref&gt;Garrick Bailey, ''Art of the Osage,'' (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2004), 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders in Osage County==
In the early 1920s, the [[Western United States]] was shaken by the murders of eighteen Osage Indians and three non-natives in [[Osage County, Oklahoma]] within a short period of time. Regional [[Colorado]] newspapers reported the murders as the "Reign of Terror" on the Osage reservation. Some murders seemed associated with several members of one family.

On May 27, 1921, local hunters discovered the decomposing body of 25-year-old Anna (Kyle) Brown in a remote ravine of Osage County {{citation needed|date=July 2018}} . Unable to find the killer, local authorities ruled her death as accidental, due to alcohol poisoning, and put the case aside.&lt;ref name="NMAI"&gt;[http://blog.nmai.si.edu/main/2011/03/the-osage-murders-oil-wealth-betrayal-and-the-fbis-first-big-case.html "The Osage Murders: Oil Wealth, Betrayal and the FBI’s First Big Case."

The body of another Osage, Charles Whitehorn (also known as Charles Williamson), was discovered near Pawhuska on the same day. Williamson, a cousin of Anna (Kyle) Brown, had been shot to death.&lt;ref name="Howell"/&gt; Two months later, Brown's mother, Lizzie Q.

On March 10, 1923, a bomb demolished the [[Fairfax, Oklahoma]] house of Anna's sister Rita Smith and her husband Bill.  The blast instantly killed Rita Smith and her servant, Nettie Brookshire.  On March 14, Bill Smith died of massive injuries from the blast (but not before he had given a statement to investigators).

George Bigheart (1876–1923 ) was dying at home, on June 28, 1923, when he was put on a train and taken to a hospital in Oklahoma City by William "Bill" King Hale and Ernest George Burkhart.{{efn|George Bigheart was the son of James Bigheart, the last hereditary Osage chief.&lt;ref name="FOF"&gt;[http://www.fofweb.com/History/MainPrintPage.asp?iPin=ENAIT382&amp;DataType=Indian&amp;WinType=Free Ewen, Alexander and Jeffrey Wollock.

Thirteen other deaths of full-blooded Osage men and women, who had guardians appointed by the courts, occurred between 1921 and 1923. By 1925, 60 wealthy Osage had been killed, and their land had been inherited or deeded to their guardians: local white lawyers and businessmen.&lt;ref name="Jefferson"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/31/books/books-of-the-times-digging-up-a-tale-of-terror-among-the-osages.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm MARGO JEFFERSON, "BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Digging Up a Tale of Terror Among the Osages"], ''New York Times'', 31 August 1994, accessed 2 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI found a low-level market in murderers for hire to kill the Osage for their wealth.&lt;ref name="Jefferson"/&gt; In 1995, the writer Robert Allen Warrior wrote about walking through an Osage cemetery and seeing "the inordinate number of young people who died during that time."&lt;ref name="Warrior"/&gt;

In 1925, tribal elders of the [[Osage Nation]] hired the assistance of the infant organization [[Bureau of Investigation]], (in 1935, the Bureau of Investigation became the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI)) at the Department of Justice, under its director [[J. Edgar Hoover]].&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2005/january/osage_012605 "A Byte Out of History: Murder and Mayhem in the Osage Hills"], FBI website, 26 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Bureau of Indian Affairs police from the US Department of Interior had not solved the murders.

==Murder investigation and trials==
The Osage Tribal Council suspected that rancher [[William Hale (cattleman)|William Hale]] was responsible for many of the deaths. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior sent four agents to act as undercover investigators. Working undercover for two years, the agents discovered a crime ring of petty criminals led by Hale, known in Osage County as the "King of the Osage Hills". He and his nephews, Ernest and Bryan Burkhart, had migrated from [[Texas]] to Osage County to find jobs in the oil fields. Once there, they discovered the immense wealth of members of the Osage Nation from royalties being paid from leases on oil-producing lands.

To gain part of the wealth, Hale persuaded his nephew Ernest to marry Mollie Kyle, a full-blooded Osage. She was the sister of Anna (Kyle) Brown and Rita (Kyle) Smith.&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;Louis F. Burns, ''A History of the Osage People,'' (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1989) pp. 439–442&lt;/ref&gt; As the evidence revealed, Hale had arranged for the murders of Mollie’s sister Anna (Kyle) Brown; the Smiths; and her mother, Lizzie Q. Kyle; as well as her cousin, Henry Roan, to cash in on the insurance policies and oil headrights of each family member.&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt; Other witnesses and participants were murdered as investigation of the conspiracy expanded. Mollie and Ernest Burkhart inherited all of the headrights from her family. Investigators found when they entered the case that Mollie was already being poisoned.&lt;ref name="OHS"&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS005.html "Osage Murders"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729090945/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS005.html |date=July 29, 2013 }}, Oklahoma Historical Society, accessed 2 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges and trials==
Due to the investigation of the FBI, Hale, his Burkhart nephews, and one of the ranch hands they hired were charged with the murder of Mollie's family. Hale was formally charged with the murder of Henry Roan, who had been killed on the Osage Reservation land, making it a federal crime.&lt;ref name="NMAI"/&gt; Two of his accomplices had died before the FBI investigation was completed. Hale and his associates were finally convicted in state and federal trials from 1926 to 1929, which had changes of venue, hung juries, appeals, and overturned verdicts. In 1926, Ernest George Burkhart pleaded guilty to being part of the conspiracy.

Finally Hale and his accomplice, John Ramsey, were convicted. Ramsey was described as a "cowboy-farmer". Ramsey confessed to participation in the murder of Roan as soon as he was arrested. He said that Hale had promised him five hundred dollars and a new car for killing Roan. Ramsey met Roan on a road outside of Fairfax, and they drank whiskey together. Then Ramsey shot Roan in the head. Subsequently Ramsey changed his story, claiming that the actual killer was Curly Johnson.  His accomplice, Byran Bradford  Burkhart, another nephew, had turned state's evidence. The trials, with their deadlocked juries, appeals, and overturned verdicts, received national newspaper and magazine coverage. Sentenced to life imprisonment, Hale, Ramsey, and Ernest Burkhart later received [[parole]] despite protests from the Osage.&lt;ref name="OHS"/&gt;

Various residents of Pawhuska petitioned Oklahoma Governor [[Jack C. Walton]] to conduct a full investigation of the deaths of Charles Bigheart and Bigheart’s attorney, Vaughan. Walton assigned Herman Fox Davis to the investigation. Shortly after the assignment, Davis was convicted of bribery. Although Walton later pardoned Davis, the investigation of Bigheart and Vaughan was never completed.&lt;ref name="Farris"/&gt;{{efn|Governor Walton was impeached in November 1923, although the charges had nothing to do with the Osage County murders.&lt;ref name="Farris"/&gt;}}

In the case of the Smith murders, Ernest George Burkhart was soon convinced that even his wife's money and his uncle's political influence could not save him. He changed his plea to guilty and asked to be sentenced to life imprisonment rather than the death penalty. He turned state's evidence, naming his uncle as responsible for the murder conspiracy. Ernest said that he had used a person named Henry Grammer as a go-between to hire a professional criminal named Ace Kirby to perform the killings. Both Grammer and Kirby were killed before they could testify.&lt;ref name="DL Fixico"/&gt;

Ernest Burkhart's attempt to kill his wife failed. Mollie, a devout Catholic, had told her priest that she feared she was being poisoned at home. The priest told her not to touch liquor under any circumstances. He also alerted one of the FBI agents. Mollie recovered from the poison she had already consumed and (after the trials) divorced Ernest. Mollie (Kyle) Burkhart Cobb died of unrelated causes on June 16, 1937. Her children inherited all of her estate.&lt;ref name="Howell"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, journalist [[Dennis McAuliffe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' investigated the suspicious death of his grandmother Sybil Beekman Bolton, an Osage with headrights who died at the age of 21 in 1925, during the "Reign of Terror." As a youth he had been told she died of kidney disease, then as a [[suicide]].  His doubts arose from a variety of conflicting evidence. In his investigation, McAuliffe found that the FBI of the time believed that the murders of several Osage women "had been committed or ordered by their husbands."&lt;ref name="McAuliffe"/&gt; Most murders of the Osage during the early 1920s went unsolved.&lt;ref name=McAuliffe&gt;Dennis McAuliffe (1994), ''The Deaths of Sybil Bolton: An American History,'' Times Books; republished as [https://books.google.com/books/about/Bloodland.html?id=7J7zbQDV9BgC (1994), ''Bloodland: A Family Story of Oil, Greed and Murder on the Osage Reservation''], Council Oak Books {{ISBN|978-1-57178-083-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; McAuliffe found that when Sybil was a minor, the court had appointed her white stepfather, attorney Arthur "A.T." Woodward, as her guardian. Woodward also served as the federally appointed ([[?]]) Tribal Counsel,&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe, Bloodland, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; and he had guardianship of four other Osage charges, each of whom had died by 1923.&lt;ref name="Jefferson"/&gt; McAuliffe learned that his grandmother's murder had been covered up by a false death certificate. He came to believe that Woodward was responsible for her death.&lt;ref name=McAuliffe/&gt; His book about his investigation, ''Bloodland: A Family Story of Oil, Greed and Murder on the Osage Reservation'' (1994), presents an account of the corruption and murders during this period.&lt;ref name="Jefferson"/&gt;

==Change in law==
To try to prevent further criminality and to protect the Osage, in 1925 Congress passed a law prohibiting non-Osage from inheriting headrights from Osage who had half or more Native American ancestry.&lt;ref name="OHS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS005.html Jon D. May, "Osage Murders" ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729090945/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS005.html |date=July 29, 2013 }}, Oklahoma Historical Society, accessed 2 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trust management lawsuit==
The Department of Interior continued to manage the trust lands and pay fees to Osage with headrights. In 2000, the tribe filed a lawsuit against the department, alleging that federal government management of the trust assets had resulted in historical losses to its trust funds and interest income.&lt;ref name="doj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="howell"&gt;[http://newsok.com/article/3921909 Melissa Howell, "The Reign of Terror"], ''The Oklahoman'' (OKNews), 12 January 2014; accessed 3 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This was after [[Cobell v. Salazar|a major class-action suit]] had been filed against the departments of Interior and Treasury in 1996 by [[Elouise P. Cobell|Elouise Cobell]] ([[Piegan Blackfeet|Blackfeet]]) on behalf of other Native Americans, for similar reasons.

In 2011, the US government settled with the Osage for $380 million. The settlement also strengthened management of the tribe's trust assets and improved communications between the Department of Interior and the tribe.&lt;ref name="doj"/&gt; The law firm representing the Osage said it was the largest trust settlement with one tribe in US history.&lt;ref name="howell"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9403">[[File:Porphyrian Trees Gallery small.png|thumb|300px|Three Porphyrian trees by [[:Image:Arbor porphyrii (from Purchotius' Institutiones philosophicae I, 1730).png|Purchotius]] (1730), [[:Image:Arbor porphyrii (probably from one of Boethius' translations).png|Boethius]] (6th century), and [[:Image:Arbor scientiae (Ramon Llull) using A porphyrii structure.png|Ramon Llull]] (ca. 1305).]]

The  '''Tree of Porphyry'''  is a classic device for illustrating what is also called a "scale of being". It was suggested—if not first, then most famously in the European philosophical tradition—by the 3rd century [[Common Era|CE]] Greek [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonist]] philosopher and logician [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]].&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, "Aristotle on Species Variation", ''Philosophy'', 61:236 (April 1986), pp. 245-252.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as ''scala praedicamentalis''.

[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] suggests the Porphyrian tree in [[Isagoge|his introduction (in Greek, "''Isagoge''")]] to [[Aristotle]]'s [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]. Porphyry presented Aristotle's classification of categories in a way that was later adopted into tree-like diagrams of dichotomous divisions, which indicate that a species is defined by [[genus-differentia|a genus and a differentia]] and that this logical process continues until the lowest species is reached, which can no longer be so defined.  No illustrations or diagrams occur in editions of Porphyry's original work.  But, diagrams were eventually made, and became associated with the scheme that Porphyry describes, following Aristotle.

[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_isagogue_01_intro.htm Porphyry's ''Isagoge''] was originally written in Greek, but was translated into Latin in the early 6th century CE by [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]].  Boethius's translation became the standard philosophical logic textbook in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-categories/#WilOckBCa128D134 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] - Medieval Theories of the Categories&lt;/ref&gt;   Until the late 19th century, theories of categories based on Porphyry's work were still being taught to students of [[logic]].

The following very helpful passage by philosopher [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]] gives some hint as to the history of the Porphyrian tree:

:In medieval education, the standard introduction to Aristotle's works was via Porphyry's ''Isagoge'', and division entered the educated consciousness in the form of 'Porphyry's Tree'. It is not clear that Porphyry himself, in the relevant passage,&lt;ref&gt;Franklin's note:  "Porphyry, ''Isagoge'', trans. E. W. Warren (Toronto:  Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1975), 34."&lt;/ref&gt; went any further than Aristotle in recommending division. But his brief comment was developed into the Tree by medieval logicians. It appears in [[William of Sherwood|William of Sherwood's]] ''Introduction to Logic'' and is given the name '''arbor Porphyrii''' in the most popular medieval logic, [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]]'s ''Summulae Logicales''.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin's note:  "[[Norman Kretzmann|N. Kretzmann]], ''William of Sherwood's Introduction to Logic'' (Minneapolis:  University of Minnesota Press, 1966), 54; Peter of Spain, ''Summulae Logicales'', [[Józef Maria Bocheński|I. M. Boche&amp;#324;ski]] (ed.) (Turin:  Marietti, 1947), 17-18."&lt;/ref&gt;  Linnaeus's system of static and discrete species was simply the result of filling in the abstract Tree with the names of actual species.&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, "Aristotle on Species Variation", ''Philosophy'', 61:236 (April 1986), pp. 245-252.  The passage quoted here is from pp. 251-252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the notion of the Porphyrian tree as an actual diagram comes later than Porphyry himself.  Still, scholars do speak of Porphyry's tree as in the ''Isagoge'' and they mean by this only that the idea of dividing genera into species via differentiae is found in the ''Isagoge''.  But, of course, Porphyry was only following what was already in Aristotle, and Aristotle was following what was already in his teacher, [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;A number of Plato's dialogs contain the idea of division in them:  see [[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]], [[Philebus]], [[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]], [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] (book VII), and [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] for starters.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
The following Porphyrian tree consists of three columns of words; the middlemost (in boldface) contains the series of [[Genus|genera]] and [[species]], and we can take as analogous to the trunk of a tree. The extremes (the terms that jut out to the left and right), containing the [[differentia]]e, we can take as analogous to the branches of a tree:

[[File:Porphyrian Tree.png|frameless|center|400px|This image is an illustration of the notion of a Porphyrian Tree as it comes down to us today through the European philosophical and logical tradition.]]

The diagram shows the highest genus to be substance.  (Whether substance is a highest genus, really, is not in question here:  right now we are only going to discuss what the diagram shows, not whether what it shows is true or false.)  The technical term for a highest substance is "[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/summum_genus ''summum genus'']".  So, substance is the ''summum genus'' as far as this diagram goes.  The diagram shows that the genus substance to have two differentia, namely, "thinking" and "extended".  This indicates that there are two species of the genus substance, thinking substance and extended substance.  The diagram does not give a term for the species of thinking substance (this would be "mind"), but it does give the term for the species of extended substance, namely, body.  That is, body is a species of the genus substance; body is that species of the genus substance that is extended.

Now that we have seen body as a species of substance, we treat body as a genus itself.  As a genus, it has two differentia of its own, inanimate and animate.  So, there are two species of body, inanimate body and animate body.  The diagram does not tell us what the term for inanimate body is, but it indicates a term for animate body, namely, animal.  Animal is an animate species of the genus body.

And, again, now that we have looked at animal as a species of the genus body, we look at animal now as a genus and consider its differentia, which are shown on the diagram to be irrational and rational.  Thus, according to the diagram there are two species of the genus animal, irrational animal and rational animal.  We are not told by the diagram what a term for irrational animal is, but the diagram indicates that a rational animal is a human.  Thus, human is a rational species of the genus animal.

Beneath human, however, there are no further species.  "This" and "that" if they are considered differentiae, are of a special kind that map the species human not onto a new species but onto particular humans.,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of "this" and "that" as universals/differentia, see [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', "A. Consciousness", "I. Sense-Certainty:  or the 'this' and 'meaning' [Meinen]", translated by A. V. Miller, Oxford University Press, pp. 58-66.&lt;/ref&gt;   The particular human Plato is named in the diagram.  Plato is not a species (that is why his name is not in bold, unlike the species above).  So, human is the lowest species in this diagram.  The technical name for the lowest species in such a scheme is the "[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infima_species ''infima species'']".  So, for this diagram, human is the ''infima species''.

'''''Orange Prince (1984)''''' is a painting by American artist [[Andy Warhol]], of [[Prince (musician)|Prince Rogers Nelson]] (1958–2016), the American singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, actor, and director.

''Orange Prince'' ''(1984)'' is considered an important late work referencing Warhol's portraits from the early 1960s, of movie stars and celebrity icons, such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]. Art historian and Warhol expert [[Thomas E. Crow]] believes that Warhol's portrait of Prince shows much greater freedom of expression, as in the early portraits. This is especially evident when compared to Warhol's more 'factory-line' style of portraits from the 1970s onwards, which were mainly commissions.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

Prince did not commission the Warhol portraits, which stayed in Warhol's private collection until he died. Crow believes Warhol was fascinated by Prince, who was not in Warhol's direct circle. He says that Warhol was drawn to Prince's edgy image, which acted as inspiration for the art work:&lt;blockquote&gt;"(Warhol's) evident fascination with Prince, known for sexual frankness in his music and an androgynous style in his clothes, make-up, and hairstyle, echoed similar traits among those he famously gathered around himself in the [[The Factory|Factory]] entourage of the 1960s."&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/44T6MBA/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0032.3.pdf |title=Expert analysis of Warhol's painting of Prince (1984) |author=Thomas E.

== Composition ==
''Orange Prince'' uses a photograph as its source image, which depicts Prince in the burgeoning stages of his career in 1981, three years before the painting was created. The original color photograph shows Prince in a full length pose, from which Warhol isolated the head only for the portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photographs/xx5frv/Prince-1981|title=Prince, 1981|website=www.morrisonhotelgallery.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;

The composition of ''Orange Prince'' makes direct reference to the portraits Warhol produced in the 1960s, as Crow points out in his 2018 analysis of the painting, and is similar in composition to Warhol's Marilyn series where the subject's head 'floats' in day-glo color.

According to Crow, the composition is distinct from other late portraits, the majority of which were commissions and followed a commercial formula, such as Warhol's portrait of [[Michael Jackson]] which was commissioned and created a few months before ''Orange Prince.'' As Crow says: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Warhol’s 1984 portrait (of Prince)...harked back to the independently conceived celebrity likenesses of his earlier career (from the 1960s). As Prince had not commissioned any of the paintings, Warhol could experiment with far more variations in background patterns and colors."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The face of the subject is depicted in a neon orange color, the same as the background. The facial outline, features and hair are in black. Highlights of green and blue are woven onto the screen amongst the black line around the subject's facial features, hair and ears. The overall effect is to make the subject [[Luminescence|luminesce]], with a trade-mark Warhol flatness to the image, due partly to the very little graduation of shading.

== Prince and Andy Warhol ==
Prince and Andy Warhol were personally acquainted, as Warhol's diary entries show.&lt;ref name="1928–1987" /&gt;

On a number of occasions in the early 1980s Prince had appeared in [[Interview (magazine)|''Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine'']]. In the April 1980 edition Prince appears in a full-page photograph by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/remembering-prince|title=Remembering Prince - Interview Magazine|date=2016-04-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glasstire.com/2016/04/22/prince-1958-2016/|title=Prince (1958-2016) – Glasstire|website=glasstire.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol attended a number of Prince concerts in the 1980s, including one of the very earliest in New York. On December 9, 1980, Prince played [[The Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in New York as part of his ''[[Dirty Mind Tour]]''. The club was only half-full, but as music critic [[Nik Cohn]] reported, "Andy Warhol and his claque showed up, and so did a number of music-biz faces. Before the show, they lounged in poses of practised cool. Then Prince appeared, and cool went up in flames".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/prince-interview-quotes|title=Prince, the godfather of R&amp;B, had his fingerprints everywhere|last=Cohn|first=Nik|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the December 1981 edition of Warhol's ''Interview'' magazine Prince appears in a controversial image showing him in the shower, and a crucifix on the wall behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/prince-showers-for-controversy|title=Flashback: Prince Showers for Controversy - Interview Magazine|date=2012-09-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 1984, Warhol created ''Orange Prince''. Prince had released the ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' album and movie that year and was well known internationally. 

On August 2, 1986, Warhol was in the front row at Prince's concert at [[Madison Square Garden]]. In his diary entry of their meeting, Warhol described sitting down at the concert "...just as Prince jumps out naked, or almost, and it's the greatest concert I've ever seen there, just so much energy and excitement."&lt;ref name="1928–1987"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Andy Warhol diaries |last=Warhol |first=Andy |editor-last=Hackett |editor-first=Pat |isbn=9781455561452 |publisher=Twelve |location=New York, NY |oclc=881024850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards at the New York dance club, [[Palladium (New York City)|The Palladium]], Warhol reported that he was very excited to be invited to an after-party hosted by Prince, and fascinated by him. Warhol described arriving at the party and seeing Prince appear in the near-empty club "...in a white coat and pink bellbottoms, like a Puerto Rican at a prom, all by himself". He also stated Prince was a gracious host who remembered the names of the many individuals in Warhol's entourage that night, and how Prince made sure he danced with everyone.

The same party was also attended by [[Billy Idol]]; seeing Prince and Idol together, Warhol observed that "Hollywood glamour girls" such as [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] had been supplanted by "glamour boys" such as Prince and Idol—a development that Warhol found completely fascinating and "...so weird".&lt;ref name="1928–1987"/&gt;

That night, Prince agreed to appear on the December 1986 cover of Warhol's Interview magazine, which Warhol described in his diary:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We asked Prince if he would be our December cover and he said we'd have to talk to his manager and we said that we'd asked the manager and the manager said to ask him, and so they said they'd work it out. We were just shaking, it was so exciting."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Warhol's portrait of Prince was created in 1984, two years before their post-concert meeting in 1986, and remained in Warhol's own collection until he died in 1987.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

== Technique ==
''Orange Prince'' was created using a complex tracing and [[Screen printing|silkscreening]] process, using layers of colors of silkscreen ink on top of a hand-painted orange ground of acrylic polymer paint, applied to [[Canvas print|canvas]]. The technique was popularised by Warhol, and is synonymous with the artist from the 1960s onwards, when he produced his early portraits of [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Marlon Brando]], and other Hollywood movie stars and celebrities of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/21-days-of-andy-warhol/2013/11/andy-warhol-and-his-process.html|title=Andy Warhol &amp; His Process|last=Sotheby's|first=|date=10 Nov 2013|website=sothebys.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1989 MoMA catalogue of Warhol's work, includes a comprehensive description of Warhol's silkscreening technique, provided by the British curator and author Marco Livingstone under the title, “Do It Yourself: Notes on Warhol’s Technique.”&lt;blockquote&gt;A pencil tracing was taken from the full sized [transparent] acetate prepared for the photographic screen. Either by transferring the penciled line by pressing onto the front of the acetate or sheet of paper, or by placing a sheet of carbon paper beneath the tracing and then drawing the line one section at a time, a rough guide was established for each color area, for example, the lips and the eyelids. The colors were then brushed on by hand, often with the use of masking tape to create a clean junction between them, with the eventual imposition of the black screened image also serving to obscure any unevenness in the line. The acetates were examined by Warhol before they were made into screens, so that he could indicate by means of instructions, written and drawn with china-marking crayon, any changes to be made: for example, to increase the tonal contrast by removing areas of half-tone, thereby flattening the image. The position of the image would be established by taping the four corners of the acetate to the canvas and then tearing off the tape along the corner edges of the acetate; the fragments of tape remaining on the canvas would serve as a guide in locating the screen on top. The position of the screen would be confirmed by eye, and it would then be printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_1815_300161087.pdf |title=Andy Warhol, a retrospective : [brochure] the Museum of Modern Art, New York, February 6 to May 2, 1989 |date=1989 |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Orange Marilyn, 1962, silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol.jpeg|thumb|''Orange Marilyn'', 1962, is a silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol from the Marilyn Flavors series.

== Warhol's orange paintings ==
A number of important silkscreen works by Andy Warhol use the color orange. Some of the first silkscreen works from the 1960s use orange as the dominant color, and Warhol continued to use orange in his paintings throughout his lifetime. ''Orange Prince'' shares a compositional style to ''Orange Marilyn'', 1962. A number of orange paintings by Warhol are in museum collections around the world:

The effect of bright colors in Warhol's work is to draw renewed focus to the subject matter. In the ''Death and Disaster'' series of paintings the graphic images Warhol took from tabloid newspaper stories of the time are a stark counterpoint to the candy-color palette. Another example of this is ''Twelve Electric Chairs'' from 1964, which consists of twelve highly contrasting colored images of the electric chair, including ''Orange Little Electric Chair,'' 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/306853/death-and-death-and-death-by-warhol/|title=Death and Death and Death by Warhol|date=2016-06-22|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2017, a leading art industry newsletter, Baer Faxt, reported that Warhol’s Orange Marilyn sold in a private transaction for $250 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://assets2.pacermonitor.com/filings/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0060.1.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=FQoGZXIvYXdzEIj%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDFbY044zFyY8bD2myiK3A68z6LvG76TbkfqGMpaaBS8m7uWWyVK5eCsEv%2FpI4Fnl7OjzcrzGEM21YaPitEAgKuEDBdDqovfp%2BV9TJ76lgbD%2FTNqp0POody5rediUNetECE2vNsLgWc2amy1ZOu3biDw4A%2FpXn1cbWZYUhTsUK3yKRcJ3RZ%2FTIpDrna9udqcgsYXSLdurozjAWQzsue5lxtWDVcBiaz9Ig4Xn3ytNO80slqq7DItFcrrxOv7Ywq6bdgx6hP0bptqayCko2tvQdUbAP2FXT6kjS8AFPpCFvmEDlv9hPDtshqNO2M%2BSHR%2F1EP3JwOoPmzaQxH%2Fg6zplJfq8jQYI8bS6hUOoftnD4ht5L1Ddg5WBajvIWXkHWLKuytWc4SC6jAOrsrBj%2FWoLyHGN6sOF1GcAMjr9axS6YqD%2Bk4shA2GTFBk1kJC%2F0CwursUeNaiJh1iyDGdKOEEe9CvwTuXAVvD6Ga7xs0FP%2Beca9hGlR%2BFuwoBqPIfkNzP98Ip%2BEshAtgoguAC%2Beh7EP99XLk4wXbGYL3HwNX%2B7Tp3jDwpJ50z%2FsW7tW3rAmh6KzBxyDdnlAlTuSSNjt%2FP4PVRcz88miwwo%2Fs2n3gU%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20181019T145627Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIA5OSMEZQHIX2MTBXV%2F20181019%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=03c5bd1110bde5df7cf53549731be259c6e59561b57eab01bbe6a38e78bda18d|title=Warhol expert, Laura Paulson, on Warhol's paintings of Prince|last=Laura|first=Paulson|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prince's favorite color was orange ==
In 2017 Prince's sister, Tyka Nelson, confirmed that Prince's favorite color was ''orange'', and not purple, as assumed. Also that Prince often wore all-orange stage outfits, had orange sets for concerts and his favorite item was his custom-built orange Cloud guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/08/prince-orange-favorite-color-purple/|title=Prince’s Sister Says His Favorite Color Was Actually Orange, Not Purple|date=2017-08-29|work=Spin|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern-day icon ==
Art historian, Thomas Crow, believes Warhol depicts Prince as a "modern-day icon" in his painting, referencing religious iconographic paintings: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Warhol's portrait of Prince] returned Warhol to the origins of his art-critical credibility, that is, the flattened, emblematic, minimally descriptive manner that had characterized his first, definitive phase as an artist."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Marilyn Diptych'', 1962, is an early example of iconography in Warhol's work, the image repeated many times to emphasise the ubiquity of celebrity and references a form of religious painting in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/later-europe-and-americas/modernity-ap/a/warhol-marilyn-diptych|title=Warhol, Marilyn Diptych|website=Khan Academy|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marilyn "Flavors" portraits – thirteen unique paintings of Marilyn Monroe with different color backgrounds – are also amongst the first examples of Warhol's iconographic style, and graphic use of saturated block color, held by art historians to highlight a manufactured celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/andy-warhol-1928-1987-orange-marilyn-4806391-details.aspx|title=Essay by Trevor Fairbrother on the iconographic style of Warhol's portraits including the Marilyn single portrait series from 1962|last=|first=|date=|website=www.christies.com|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1=George Frei |editor2=Neil Printz |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Catalogue-Raisonn%C3%A9-Paintings-Sculptures-1961-1963/dp/0714840866/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519842007&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=andy+warhol+catalogue+raisonne |title=Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonné, Paintings and Sculptures 1961–1963 |author=Andy Warhol Foundation |date=11 Mar 2002 |publisher=Phaidon Press |isbn=9780714840864 |edition=Slp |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Robert Rosenblum was personally close to Warhol and wrote about Warhol's Catholic religious observance, which informed Rosenblum's observation about the 1962 ''Gold Marilyn'' in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art: &lt;blockquote&gt;"When Warhol took a photographic silkscreen of Marilyn Monroe’s head, set it on gold paint, and let it float high in a timeless, spaceless heaven..., he was creating, in effect, a secular saint for the 1960s that might well command as much earthly awe and veneration as, say, a Byzantine Madonna hovering for eternity on a gold mosaic ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://laurel.lso.missouri.edu:2083/iii/encore/record/C__Rb13563936__Sjoe%20rosenblum__P0%2C17__Orightresult__X1;jsessionid=4912A4D75A4FD6B390E943219B91FEC2?lang=eng&amp;suite=mobum-sso |title=Robert Rosenblum selected writings on Andy Warhol and other artists|last=Rosenblum|first=R|date=1999|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Geralyn Huxley, curator of film and video at the [[The Andy Warhol Museum|Andy Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh, believes Warhol's preoccupation with celebrity portraits and the style in which he depicts them, stems from the artist's religious upbringing. As a child Warhol attended a local Catholic church which featured an [[iconostasis]], a screen situated in front of the altar featuring large-scale depictions of the faces of the [[Saint]]s.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Andy-Warhol-Treasures-Geralyn-Huxley/dp/1847960049|title=Andy Warhol Treasures|last=Huxley|first=Geralyn|last2=Wrbican|first2=Matt|date=2009-05-14|publisher=Goodman Books|isbn=9781847960047|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Jane Daggett Dillenberger, in her book ''The Religious Art of Andy Warhol'', points out that Warhol's portraits of celebrities have a strong affinity with the sacred icons at the [[St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church]] in Pittsburgh: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Andy's earliest experience of art was of religious art...for Andy, art and religion were linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Religious-Art-Andy-Warhol/dp/082641334X |title=The Religious Art of Andy Warhol |last=Dillenberger |first=Jane Daggett |date=2001-05-10 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd. |isbn=9780826413345 |location=New York; London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his New York Times review of the 1989 Warhol retrospective exhibition at [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]], art critic Michael Brenson says that Warhol's portraits, at their best, bring together diametrically opposite values, such as sensual excess and the purity of an icon, as seen in the portrait of Prince:&lt;blockquote&gt;“[Andy Warhol's] flat images, painted in a flat tone, existing in a non-space from which past and future have been banished ... make the present seem absolute and eternal—in other words, transcendent. Part of Warhol’s achievement was to legitimize his love of secular, profane subjects by attaching to them traditional religious values. ... Warhol argues that self-effacement and sensual excess, purity and trash, the moment and eternity can exist together.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/03/arts/review-art-looking-back-at-warhol-stars-super-heroes-and-all.html|title=Review/Art; Looking Back at Warhol, Stars, Super-Heroes and All|last=Brenson|first=Michael|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Publications ==
''Orange Prince'' painting has been reproduced in books, magazines and other media, most notably as the cover of a commemorative magazine published by [[Condé Nast]] just after Prince's death in 2016.

=== ''Vanity Fair'' ===
The portrait was featured in both the November 1984 and the April 2016 editions of [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']], reproduced in color on a full page to illustrate the article entitled ''Purple Fame'', about Prince's rise to fame in the wake of his celebrated [[1984]] album and movie ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]],'' the inspiration for Warhol's portrait.

The ''Vanity Fair'' article claims that Warhol's portrait of Prince captures the recording artist "...at the height of his powers"&lt;ref name="CondeNast"&gt;{{Cite magazine|date=2016|title=The Genius of Prince|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Genius-of-Prince/dp/B01F27Q48M|magazine=Condé Nast}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the first global pieces written as a critical appreciation of the musician, coinciding with the start of the recording artist's 98-date [[Purple Rain Tour]]. ''Purple Rain'' is frequently regarded as Prince's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]; declaring that Prince had "...finally arrived", and Warhol's portrait shows Prince as a confident and celebrated musician, now on a world stage and internationally renowned.

=== ''The Genius of Prince'' ===
''Orange Prince (1984)'' was reproduced on the front cover of ''The Genius of Prince'', a commemorative magazine published in the wake of the musician's sudden death just months before. The magazine was published as a US edition by [[Condé Nast]], in June 2016, to wide acclaim and distributed internationally.&lt;ref name=CondeNast/&gt;

=== ''Andy Warhol Treasures'' ===
The portrait also features in ''Andy Warhol Treasures'', a book published in 2009 by Geralyn Huxley.&lt;ref name="Amazon" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9485">'''Privacy engineering''' is an emerging discipline within, at least, the [[software]] or information systems domain which aims to provide methodologies, tools, and techniques such that the engineered systems provide acceptable levels of [[privacy]]. In the US acceptable level of privacy is defined in terms of compliance to the functional and non-functional requirements set out through a [[privacy policy]], while in the EU, the [[General Data Protection Regulation]] sets the requirements that need to be fulfilled. In the rest of the world, the requirements change depending on local implementations of [[privacy law|privacy]] and [[data protection]] laws.

== Definition and scope ==

The definition of privacy engineering given by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Engineering at NIST|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/privacy_engineering/index.html|publisher=NIST|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation | ''Focuses on providing guidance that can be used to decrease privacy risks, and enable organizations to make purposeful decisions about resource allocation and effective implementation of controls in information systems.''|sign=|source=}}

While privacy has been developing as a legal domain, privacy engineering has only really come to the fore in recent years as the necessity of implementing said privacy laws in information systems has become a definite requirement to the deployment of such information systems. For example, IPEN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Internet Privacy Engineering Network|title=Background and purpose|url=https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/IPEN|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines their position in this respect as:

{{quotation | One reason for the lack of attention to privacy issues in development is the lack of appropriate tools and best practices. Developers have to deliver quickly in order to minimize time to market and effort, and often will re-use existing components, despite their privacy flaws. There are, unfortunately, few building blocks for privacy friendly applications and services, and security can often be weak as well.}}

Privacy engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oliver|first1=Ian|title=Privacy Engineering: A Dataflow and Ontological Approach|date=July 2014|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=978-1497569713|edition=1st|url=http://www.privacyengineeringbook.net|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves aspects such as process management, [[security]], [[ontology]] and [[software engineering]]. The actual application&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gürses|first1=Seda|last2=Troncoso|first2=Carmela|last3=Diaz|first3=Claudia|title=Engineering Privacy by Design|date=2011|publisher=International Conference on Privacy and Data Protection (CPDP) Book|url=https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/publications/article-1542.pdf|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of these derives from necessary legal compliances, privacy policies and `manifestos' such as [[Privacy by Design|Privacy-by-Design]].

[[File:Pbdmanifestoengineering.png|thumb|Relationship between PbD and Privacy Engineering]]

Towards the more implementation levels, privacy engineering employs [[Privacy-enhancing technologies|privacy enhancing technologies]] to enable [[anonymisation]] and [[de-identification]] of data. Privacy engineering requires suitable security engineering practices to be deployed, and some privacy aspects can be implemented using security techniques. A privacy impact assessment is another tool within this context and its use does not imply that privacy engineering is being practiced.

One area of concern is the proper definition and application of terms such as personal data, personally identifiable information, anonymisation and [[pseudo-anonymisation]] which lack sufficient and detailed enough meanings when applied to software, information systems and data sets.

Another facet of information system privacy has been the ethical use of such systems with particular concern on [[surveillance]], [[big data]] collection, [[artificial intelligence]] etc. Some members of the privacy and privacy engineering communication advocate the idea of [[Ethics engineering]] or reject the possibility of engineering privacy into systems intended for surveillance.

== Core practices ==
As this particular field is still in its infancy and somewhat dominated by the legal aspects, the following list just outlines the primary areas on which privacy engineering is based:

* [[Data flow diagram|Data flow modelling]]
* [[Semantics]]
* [[Requirements engineering]]
* [[Risk assessment]]
* Privacy management and processes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennedy, Fox, Finneran|title=The Privacy Engineer's Manifesto|publisher=APress|isbn=978-1-4302-6355-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MITRE Corp|title=Privacy Engineering Framework|url=http://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/privacy-engineering-framework|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Development of suitable terminologies/ontologies for expressing types, usages, purposes etc. of information
* Privacy impact assessment

Despite the lack of a cohesive development of the above areas, courses already exist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSIT-Privacy Engineering|url=http://privacy.cs.cmu.edu|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oliver|first1=Ian|title=Introduction to Privacy and Privacy Engineering|url=http://www.slideshare.net/ianoliver79/introduction-to-privacy-and-privacy-engineering|publisher=EIT Summer School, University of Brighton|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the training of privacy engineering. The International Workshop on Privacy Engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Workshop on Privacy Engineering|url=http://ieee-security.org/TC/SPW2017/IWPE/|publisher=IEEE Security}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-located with [[IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic|IEEE Symposium]] on Security and Privacy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy|url=http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2017/index.html|publisher=IEEE Security}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a venue to address "the gap between research and practice in systematizing and evaluating approaches to capture and address privacy issues while engineering information systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurses, Del Alamo|title=Privacy Engineering: Shaping an Emerging Field of Research and Practice|publisher= IEEE Security and Privacy|date=Mar 2016|volume=14|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects of information ==
As an area privacy engineering is particular concerned with the processing of information over the following aspects or [[Upper ontology|ontologies]] and their relations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Semantic Conceptions of Information|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-semantic/|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to their implementation in software:

* Information Type Ontologies (as opposed to PII or machine types)
* Data Processing Ontologies
* [[Semantic data model|Semantics of information]] and data sets (see also noise and [[Data anonymization|anonymisation]])
* Provenance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paul Groth, Luc Moreau|title=An Overview of the PROV Family of Documents|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/|publisher=W3C|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of information, including the notion of data subject
* Usage of information
* Purpose of information, viz: primary vs [[Secondary data|secondary]] collection
* Notions of controller and processor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Article 29 Data Protection Working Party|title=Opinion 1/2010 on the concepts of "controller" and "processor"|date=16 February 2010|volume=00264/10/EN WP 169}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The notions of authority and identity (ostensibly of the source(s) of data)

Further to this how the above then affect the security classification, risk classification and thus the levels of protection and flow within a system can then the metricised or calculated.

== Definitions of privacy ==

As already stated, privacy is an area dominated by legal aspects but requiring implementation using, ostensibly, engineering techniques, disciplines and skills. Privacy Engineering as an overall discipline takes its basis from considering privacy not just as a legal aspect or engineering aspect and their unification but also utilising the following areas:

* Privacy as a philosophical aspect
* Privacy as an economic aspect, particular game theory
* Privacy as a sociological aspect

==Legal basis==
The impetus for technological progress in privacy engineering stems from general [[privacy law]]s and various particular legal acts:
*[[Privacy Act of 1974]]
*[[Privacy Protection Act of 1980]]
*[[Video Privacy Protection Act]]
*[[Online Privacy Protection Act]]
*[[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]]
*[[Driver's Privacy Protection Act]]
*[[Intimate Privacy Protection Act]]
*[[Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006]]
*[[General Data Protection Regulation]]

The '''Reign of Terror''', or '''The Terror''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|la Terreur}}), is the label given by most historians to a period during the [[French Revolution]] after the [[First French Republic]] was established.

Several historians consider the "reign of terror" to have begun in 1793, placing the starting date at either 5 September,&lt;ref name=EncBrit&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.britannica.com/event/Reign-of-Terror |title=Reign of Terror |accessdate=19 April 2017| publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica (2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt; June&lt;ref name=Linton,port.ac/&gt; or March (birth of the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]), while some consider it to have begun in September 1792 ([[September Massacres]]), or even July 1789 (when the first lynchings took place),&lt;ref name=maudite&gt;The dates July 1789, September 1792, March 1793 as starting date for the Reign of Terror ({{lang-fr|link=no|la Terreur}}) are given in the French Wikipedia, referring to source: Jean-Clément Martin, ''La Terreur, part maudite de la Révolution'' ('The Terror, the cursed part of the Revolution'), coll. [[Découvertes Gallimard]] (n° 566), Paris: Gallimard, 2010, p. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a consensus that it ended with [[Fall of Robespierre|the fall of Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794]].&lt;ref name=EncBrit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Linton,port.ac/&gt;

Between June 1793 and the end of July 1794, there were 16,594 official death sentences in France, of which 2,639 were in Paris.&lt;ref name=Linton,port.ac&gt;{{cite web|last=Linton|first=Marisa|title=The Terror in the French Revolution|url=http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter1/interviews/filetodownload,20545,en.pdf|publisher=Kingston University|accessdate=2 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117152123/http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter1/interviews/filetodownload%2C20545%2Cen.pdf|archivedate=17 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History Today"/&gt;

[[File:Barere.jpg|thumb|[[Bertrand Barère]]]]

There was a sense of emergency among leading politicians in France in the summer of 1793 between the widespread civil war and counter-revolution.

[[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] in February 1794 in a speech explained the necessity of terror:
{{quote|sign=|source=|If the basis of popular government in peacetime is virtue, the basis of popular government during a revolution is both virtue and terror; virtue, without which terror is baneful; terror, without which virtue is powerless. Terror is nothing more than speedy, severe and inflexible justice; it is thus an emanation of virtue; it is less a principle in itself, than a consequence of the general principle of democracy, applied to the most pressing needs of the ''patrie'' &lt;small&gt;[homeland, fatherland]&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1794robespierre.asp|title=Maximilien Robespierre: On the Principles of Political Morality, February 1794|last1=Halsall |first1=Paul|date=1997 |publisher=Fordham University |access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History Today"/&gt;}}

Some historians argue that such terror was a necessary reaction to the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathiez|first1=Albert|title=La Révolution Française|publisher=Librairie Armand Colin|isbn=978-7-100-07058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest there were additional causes, including ideological&lt;ref&gt;Furet, Francois.

== Influences on the Terror ==
=== Enlightenment Thought ===

[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought emphasized the importance of rational thinking and began challenging legal and moral foundations of society, providing the leaders of the Terror with new ideas about the role and structure of government.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Church, "Introduction", in ''The Influence of the Enlightenment on the French Revolution'', ed. William F. Church (Boston: D.C. Heath and Company, 1964), vii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s [[The Social Contract|Social Contract]] argued that each person was born with rights, and they would come together to form a government that would then protect those rights. Under the social contract, the government was required to act for the [[General will|general will]], which represented the interests of everyone rather than a few factions.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, "Ideal Empires and Republics. Rousseau's ''Social Contract'', More's ''Utopia'', Bacon's ''New Atlantis'', Campanella's ''City of the Sun'' with an Introduction by Charles M. Andrews", (Washington: M. Walter Dunne, 1901), 92–94, Online Library of Liberty, http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/rousseau-ideal-empires-and-republics.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from the idea of a general will, [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] felt that the [[French Revolution]] could result in a Republic built for the general will but only once those who fought this ideal were expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Peyre, "The Influence of Eighteenth Century Ideas on the French Revolution", in ''The Influence of the Enlightenment on the French Revolution'', ed. William F. Church (Boston: D.C. Heath and Company, 1964), 99-101.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Maximilien Robespierre, "Justification of the Use of Terror", July 28, 1794, ''Modern History Sourcebook'', Fordham University, accessed May 1, 2018, https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-terror.asp. &lt;/ref&gt; Those who resisted the government were deemed "tyrants" fighting against the virtue and honor of the general will. The leaders felt their ideal version of government was threatened from the inside and outside of France, and terror was the only way to preserve the dignity of the Republic created from French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilien Robespierre, "Justification of the Use of Terror", July 28, 1794, ''Modern History Sourcebook'', Fordham University, accessed May 1, 2018, https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-terror.asp. &lt;/ref&gt;

Robespierre's ideology was not strictly derived from Rousseau. The writings of another Enlightenment thinker of the time, [[Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]], greatly influenced Robespierre. One of Montesquieu’s writings, ''The Spirit of the Laws'',  defines a core principle of a democratic government: virtue. He describes it as “the love of laws and of our country.”&lt;ref&gt;Montesquieu. "Modern History Sourcebook: Montesquieu: The Spirit of the Laws, 1748." Internet History Sourcebooks. https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/montesquieu-spirit.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Robespierre’s speech to the[[National_Convention| National Convention]] on February 5, 1794, ''On Political Morality'', he talks about virtue being the “fundamental principle of popular or democratic government."&lt;ref&gt;“Robespierre, "On Political Morality",” ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity''. http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/413.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was, in fact, the same virtue defined by Montesquieu almost 50 years earlier. Robespierre believed that the virtue needed for any democratic government was extremely lacking in the French people. As a result, he decided to weed out those he believed could never possess this virtue. The result was a continual push towards Terror. The Convention used this as justification for the course of action to “crush the enemies of the revolution, ... let the laws be executed, … and let liberty be saved.”&lt;ref&gt;“"Terror Is the Order of the Day",” ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'', accessed October 26, 2018, http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/416.&lt;/ref&gt;

These members of the Enlightenment movement greatly influenced revolutionary leaders; however, cautions from other Enlightenment thinkers were blatantly ignored.   [[Voltaire|Voltaire’s]] warnings were often overlooked, though some of his ideas were used for justification of the Revolution and the start of the Terror. He protested against Catholic Dogmas and the ways of Christianity stating, “of all religions, the Christian should of course inspire the most toleration, but till now the Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.”&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire. "Voltaire, Selections from the Philosophical Dictionary." Omeka RSS. http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/273/.&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms were often used by Robespierre and other leaders as justification for their anti-religious reforms. Voltaire also laid down some warnings. In his [[Dictionnaire_philosophique|''Philosophical Dictionary'']], he states, “we are all steeped in weakness and error; let us forgive each other our follies; that is the first law of nature” and “every individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of his opinion, is a monster."&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of forgiveness and understanding the failings of the human conditions were obviously lost on Robespierre and other leaders as they pursued Terror.

===Threats of Foreign Invasion===

After the beginning of the French Revolution, the surrounding monarchies did not show great hostility towards the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution''. 6th ed. London: Routledge, 2016. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Though mostly ignored, [[Louis_XVI_of_France|Louis XVI]] was later able to find support in Leopold II of Austria (Marie Antionette’s brother) and Frederick William II of Prussia. On August 27, 1791, these foreign leaders made the [[Declaration_of_Pillnitz|Pillnitz Declaration]] saying they would restore the French monarch if other European rulers joined.  In response to what they viewed to be the meddling of foreign powers, France declared war on April 20, 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther E. Rothenberg "The Origins, Causes, and Extension of the Wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon." ''The Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 18, no. 4 (1988): 771-93. doi:10.2307/204824. https://www.jstor.org/stable/204824.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at this point, the war was only Prussia and Austria against France. France began this war with a large series of defeats which set a precedent of fear of invasion in the people that would last throughout the war. Massive reforms of military institutions, while very effective in the long run, presented the initial problems of inexperienced forces and leaders of questionable political loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In the time it took for officers of merit to use their new freedoms to climb the chain of command, France suffered. Many of the early battles were definitive losses for the French.&lt;ref&gt;"Battle of Valmy, (20 September 1792)." Weapons and Warfare. April 09, 2018. Accessed October 30, 2018. https://weaponsandwarfare.com/2018/04/10/battle-of-valmy-20-september-1792/.&lt;/ref&gt; There was the constant threat of the Austro-Prussian forces which were advancing easily toward the capital, threatening to destroy Paris if the monarch was harmed.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold II, and Frederick William. "The Declaration of Pillnitz (1791)." French Revolution. February 27, 2018. Accessed October 26, 2018. https://alphahistory.com/frenchrevolution/declaration-of-pillnitz-1791/.&lt;/ref&gt; This series of defeats, coupled with militant uprisings and protests within the borders of France pushed the government to resort to drastic measures to ensure the loyalty of every citizen to not only France but more importantly to the Revolution.

While this series of losses was eventually broken, the reality of what might have happened if they persisted hung over France. The tide would not turn from them until September of 1792 when the French won a critical victory at Valmy preventing the Austro-Prussian invasion.&lt;ref&gt; Jermemy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; While the French military had stabilized and was producing victories by the time the Reign of Terror officially began, the pressure to succeed in this international struggle acted as justification for the government to pursue its tyrannical actions. It was not until after the execution of Louis XVI and the annexation of the [[Rhineland#French_Revolution|Rhineland]] that the other monarchies began to feel threatened enough to form the [[War_of_the_First_Coalition|First Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Bloy. "The First Coalition 1793-1797." A Web of English History. https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/montesquieu/.&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition, consisting of Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain, Holland, and Sardinia, began attacking France from all directions besieging and capturing ports and retaking ground lost to France.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; With so many similarities to the first days of the [[French_Revolutionary_Wars|Revolutionary Wars]], the French government with threats on all sides, unification of the country became a top priority.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 64.&lt;/ref&gt; As the war continued and the Reign of Terror began, leaders saw a correlation between using terror and achieving victory. Well phrased by [[Albert_Soboul|Albert Soboul]], “terror, at first an improvised response to defeat, once organized became an instrument of victory.”&lt;ref&gt;Soboul cited in Mona Ozouf. "War and Terror in French Revolutionary Discourse (1792-1794)." ''The Journal of Modern History'' 56, no. 4 (1984): 580-97. http://www.jstor.org.du.idm.oclc.org/stable/1880323.
&lt;/ref&gt; The threat of defeat and foreign invasion may have helped spur the origins of the terror, but the timely success of the Terror with French victories added justification to its growth and continuation.

=== Popular Pressure ===

During the Reign of Terror, the [[Sans-culottes|sans-culottes]] and the [[Hébertists]] put pressure on the [[National Convention]] delegates and contributed to the overall instability of France. The National Convention was bitterly split between the [[Montagnard (French Revolution)|Montagnards]] and the [[Girondins]]. The Girondins were more conservative leaders of the National Convention, while the Montagnards supported radical violence and pressures of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin, A Short History of the French Revolution, (London: Routledge, 2016), 64. &lt;/ref&gt; Once the Montagnards gained control of the National Convention, they began demanding radical measures. Moreover, the sans-culottes, the scrappy, urban workers of France, agitated leaders to inflict punishments on those who opposed the interests of the poor. The sans-culottes’ violent demonstrations pushing their demands, created constant pressure for the Montagnards to enact reform.&lt;ref&gt;"Terror, Vengeance, and Martyrdom in the French Revolution: THE CASE OF THE SHADES - Oxford Scholarship", 2014, accessed May 1, 2018, http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199959853.001.0001/acprof-9780199959853-chapter-8. 2014. &lt;/ref&gt; The sans-culottes fed the frenzy of instability and chaos by utilizing popular pressure during the Revolution. For example, the sans-culottes sent letters and petitions to the [[Committee of Public Safety]] urging them to protect their interests and rights with measures such as taxation of foodstuffs that favored workers over the rich. They advocated for arrests of those deemed to oppose reforms against those with privilege, and the more militant members would advocate pillage in order to achieve the desired equality.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Soboul, ''The Sans-culottes; the Popular Movement and Revolutionary Government, 1793–1794'', (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Books, 1972), 5–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting instability caused problems that made forming the new Republic and achieving full political support even more critical.

=== Religious Upheaval ===

The Reign of Terror was characterized by a dramatic rejection of long-held religious authority, its hierarchical structure, and the corrupt and intolerant influence of the aristocracy and clergy. Religious elements that long stood as symbols of stability for the French people, were replaced by reason and scientific thought.&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Pressense, John Lacroix,  ''Religion and the reign of terror, or, The church during the French revolution'' (World constitutions illustrated), (New York : Cincinnati: Carlton &amp; Lanahan ; Hitchcock &amp; Walden, 1869).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emmet Kennedy. A Cultural History of the French Revolution. (Yale University Press, 1989), 343. {{ISBN|9780300044263}}. &lt;/ref&gt; The radical revolutionaries and their supporters desired a cultural revolution that would rid the French state of all Christian influence.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Hunt, ''Politics, Culture and Class in the French Revolution''; chp 3, "The Imagery of Radicalism", 1984, 87–119. &lt;/ref&gt; This process began with the fall of the [[Absolute monarchy in France|monarchy]], an event that effectively defrocked the State of its sanctification by the clergy via the [[Divine right of kings|doctrine of Divine Right]] and ushered in an era of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin, ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', (London: Routledge, 2016), 72–73. &lt;/ref&gt;

Many long-held rights and powers were stripped from the Church and given to the State. In 1789, church lands were expropriated and priests killed and forced to leave France.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Hunt, ''Politics, Culture and Class in the French Revolution''; chp 3, "The Imagery of Radicalism", 1984, 87–119. &lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cult of Reason|Festival of Reason]] was held in the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]], which was renamed "The Temple of Reason", and the old traditional calendar was replaced with a new revolutionary one.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin, ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', (London: Routledge, 2016), 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the Terror tried to address the call for these radical, revolutionary aspirations, while at the same time trying to maintain tight control on the de-Christianization movement that was threatening to the clear majority of the still devoted Catholic population of France. The tension sparked by these conflicting objectives laid a foundation for the "justified" use of terror to achieve revolutionary ideals and rid France of the religiosity that revolutionaries believed was standing in the way.

[[File:Robespierre crop.jpg|thumb|[[Maximilien Robespierre]], member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]]]]

On 10 March 1793 the National Convention created the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. Among those charged by the tribunal, about a half were acquitted (though the number dropped to about a quarter after the enactment of the [[Law of 22 Prairial]]). In March rebellion broke out in the [[Vendée]] in response to mass conscription, which developed into a civil war that lasted until after the Terror.

On 6 April the [[Committee of Public Safety]] was created, which gradually became the de facto war-time government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-link= Hilary Mantel |last= Mantel |first= Hilary |url= http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n15/hilary-mantel/he-roared |title= He Roared |work= London Review of Books |date= 6 August 2009 |volume= 3 |issue= 15 |pages= 3–6 |accessdate= 16 January 2010 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June, the Parisian sans-culottes surrounded the National Convention, calling for administrative and political purges, a low fixed price for bread, and a limitation of the electoral [[suffrage|franchise]] to sans-culottes alone. With the backing of the [[National Guard (France)|national guard]], they persuaded the convention to arrest 29 Girondist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Peter. ''The French Revolution 1787–1804''. Pearson Education, 2003, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to the imprisonment of the Girondin deputies, some thirteen departments started the [[Federalist revolts]] against the National Convention in Paris, which were ultimately crushed. 

On 24 June, the convention adopted the first republican constitution of France, the [[French Constitution of 1793]]. It was ratified by public [[referendum]], but never put into force.

On 13 July the assassination of [[Jean-Paul Marat]] – a [[Jacobin]] leader and journalist – resulted in a further increase in Jacobin political influence. [[Georges Danton]], the leader of the [[10 August (French Revolution)|August 1792 uprising]] against the [[Louis XVI of France|king]], was removed from the committee. On July 27, 1793, Robespierre became part of the Committee of Public Safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maximilien-Robespierre|title=Maximilien Robespierre {{!}} Biography, Facts, &amp; Execution|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 23 August, the National Convention decreed the [[levée en masse]], "The young men shall fight; the married man shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn all lint into linen; the old men shall betake themselves to the public square in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic."

[[File:La fournée des Girondins 10-11-1793.jpg|thumb|left|The execution of the [[Girondins]]]]
On 9 September, the convention established paramilitary forces, the "revolutionary armies", to force farmers to surrender grain demanded by the government. On 17 September, the [[Law of Suspects]] was passed, which authorized the imprisonment of vaguely defined "suspects". This created a mass overflow in the prison systems. On 29 September, the convention extended [[price fixing]] from grain and bread to other essential goods, and also fixed wages.

On 10 October, the Convention decreed that "the provisional government shall be revolutionary until peace." On 24 October, the [[French Republican Calendar]] was enacted. The trial of the Girondins started on the same day and they were executed on 31 October.

Anti-clerical sentiments increased during 1793 and a campaign of dechristianization occurred. On 10 November (20 Brumaire Year II of the French Republican Calendar), the Hébertists organized a [[Cult of Reason|Festival of Reason]].

[[File:Olympe gouges.jpg|thumb|upright|The execution of [[Olympe de Gouges]], feminist writer close to the Girondins]]
On 14 Frimaire (5 December 1793) was passed the [[Law of Frimaire]], which gave the central government more control over the actions of the representatives on mission.

On 16 Pluviôse (4 February 1794), the National Convention decreed that slavery be abolished in all of France and French colonies.

On 8 and 13 Ventôse (26 February and 3 March), [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] proposed decrees to confiscate the property of exiles and opponents of the revolution, known as the [[Ventôse Decrees]].

By the end of 1793, two major factions had emerged, both threatening the Revolutionary Government: the Hébertists, who called for an intensification of the Terror and threatened insurrection, and the Dantonists, led by [[Georges Danton]], who demanded moderation and clemency. The Committee of Public Safety took actions against both. The major Hébertists were tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed on 24 March. The Dantonists were arrested on 30 March, tried on 3 to 5 April and executed on 5 April.

On 20 Prairial (8 June) was celebrated across the country the Festival of the Supreme Being, which was part of the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]], a deist national religion. On 22 Prairial (10 June), the National Convention passed a law proposed by [[Georges Couthon]], known as the [[Law of 22 Prairial]], which simplified the judicial process and greatly accelerated the work of the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. With the enactment of the law, the number of executions greatly increased, and the period from this time to the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] became known as "The Grand Terror".

On 8 Messidor (26 June), the French army won the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]], which marked a turning point in France's military campaign and undermined the necessity of wartime measures and the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Government.

[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|right|thumb|The execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]]]]

The fall of Robespierre was brought about by a combination of those who wanted more power for the Committee of Public Safety (and a more radical policy than he was willing to allow) and the moderates who completely opposed the revolutionary government. They had, between them, made the Law of 22 Prairial one of the charges against him, so that, after his fall, to advocate terror would be seen as adopting the policy of a convicted enemy of the republic, putting the advocate's own head at risk. Between his arrest and his execution, Robespierre may have tried to commit suicide by shooting himself, although the bullet wound he sustained, whatever its origin, only shattered his jaw. Alternatively, he may have been shot by the gendarme Merda. The great confusion that arose during the storming of the municipal Hall of Paris, where Robespierre and his friends had found refuge, makes it impossible to be sure of the wound's origin.
In any case, Robespierre was guillotined the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Merriman, John (2004). "Thermidor" (2nd ed.). ''A history of modern Europe: from the Renaissance to the present'', p 507. W.W. Norton &amp; Company Ltd. {{ISBN|0-393-92495-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reign of the standing Committee of Public Safety was ended. New members were appointed the day after Robespierre's execution, and limits on terms of office were fixed (a quarter of the committee retired every three months). The Committee's powers were gradually eroded.

'''Robotic expressionism''' is an artistic theory that was formulated in 2012 by [[roboticist]]s in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The originators of the theory, Joshua Price and Zoie MacDougall, demonstrated robotic expressionism in practice for the first time at the 2012 International [[RoboGames]] in a competition to create a robot artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Sweeney|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/dublin/ci_20742517/artistic-robot-has-flair-painting |title='&amp;#39;Artistic robot has a flair for painting'&amp;#39;. Retrieved 1 July 2015, from Contra Costa Times |publisher=contracostatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to the traditional forms of [[Computer Art|precision and randomized robotic artwork]], robotic expressionists embraces the "mood" of the robot – the state of its environment, internal stresses, battery level, and other factors – to create an art piece with creative contributions from both the human roboticist and the robot painter.

==Origins==
While robotic expressionism may have existed in undocumented forms before them, Price and MacDougall are credited with being the first roboticists to publicly display art that aligned with the theory of robotic expressionism. They began work on their first robot artist, named RobART, in the Spring of 2012. RobART was composed primarily of VEX Robotics components and had several appendages holding paint brushes, foam brushes, a foam stamp, and spray paint cans. RobART painted on the ground and moved around on its paintings with twelve wheels; it was programmed using the [[RobotC]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joshua Price, Zoie MacDougall|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cd2DcAkKIolwnKOt9UaqulNXc0W8GwmSjjoo3Ncpwrc/edit |title='&amp;#39;Building Robart'&amp;#39;. Retrieved 1 July 2015, from Google Drive |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Price and MacDougall entered RobART into the ArtBot – Paint category 2012 International RoboGames competition, which is hosted in annually in [[San Mateo, California]]. Robogames is the world's largest adult robotics competition and is often called the "Olympics of robots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RoboGames|url=http://robogames.net/index.php |title='&amp;#39;RoboGames'&amp;#39;. Retrieved 1 July 2015, from RoboGames |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; RobART painted several pieces live for audiences at the competition. All of the robot's paintings were abstract takes on a polluted [[cityscape]], the most well-known titled ''City No. 3''.

==Theory==
The theory of robotic expressionism involves concepts of [[Computer programming|programming]], [[Machine|mechanical devices]], and [[Theory of art|art theory]]. A primary concern in programming physical machines is keeping movement error within a certain [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]]; much research has gone into controlling physical devices to be precise when following directions. Robotic expressionists abandon this notion of robotic precision and embrace the intrinsic unpredictability in the movement on machines. By allowing for physical variability, robotic expressionists are able to explore the robot's "mood". Some of the largest contributors to a robot's mood are its battery power, the strength of its motors, the temperature of its environment, its internal structure, and the material of the surface on which it moves.

The interaction between human ideas and robot mood are central to the theory of robotic expressionism. The human gives the robot a program, which for the purpose of robotic expressionism can be considered an idea or a suggestion. The robot then reads the program and follows it based on its mood; a robot's mood is different each time it paints, so it will create a different work of art even when following the same program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21020">{{Close Relationships|types}}
A '''romantic friendship''',  '''passionate friendship''', or '''affectionate friendship''' is a very close but typically non-[[Human sexuality|sexual]] [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] between [[friend]]s, often involving a degree of physical closeness beyond that which is common in the contemporary [[Western world|Western]] [[Society|societies]]. It may include for example [[holding hands]], [[cuddling]], [[hug]]ging, [[kiss]]ing, giving [[massages]], and sharing a bed, or [[co-sleeping]], without [[sexual intercourse]] or other physical sexual expression.

In historical scholarship, the term may be used to describe a very close relationship between people of the same sex during a period of history when [[homosexuality]] did not exist as a social category. In this regard, the term was coined in the later 20th century in order to retrospectively describe a type of relationship which until the mid 19th century had been considered unremarkable but since the second half of the 19th century had become more rare as [[physical intimacy]] between non-sexual partners came to be regarded with anxiety.{{sfn|Faderman|1998|pp=231-313}} Romantic friendship between women in Europe and North America became especially prevalent in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, with the simultaneous emergence of [[female education]] and a new rhetoric of [[sexual difference]].{{sfn|Rupp|2009|p=127}}
[[File:Frances Shimer Cindarella Gregory 1869.jpg|thumb|[[Shimer College]] founders Cindarella Gregory and [[Frances Shimer]] in 1869; their extremely close relationship has been characterized as a "passionate friendship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Malkmus | first = Doris | title = Frances Wood Shimer, Cindarella Gregory, and the 1853 founding of Shimer College | journal = Journal of Illinois History | volume = 6 | pages = 200 | year = 2003| publisher = Illinois Historic Preservation Agency | issn = 1522-0532 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Historical examples==
The study of historical romantic friendship is difficult because the primary source material consists of writing about love relationships, which typically took the form of love letters, poems, or philosophical essays rather than objective studies.{{sfn|Faderman|1998|ps=&amp;nbsp;''passim.''}} Most of these do not explicitly state the sexual or nonsexual nature of relationships; the fact that homosexuality was taboo in Western European cultures at the time means that some sexual relationships may be hidden, but at the same time the rareness of romantic friendship in modern times means that references to nonsexual relationships may be misinterpreted, as alleged by [[Lillian Faderman|Faderman]], [[Stephanie Coontz|Coontz]], [[E. Anthony Rotundo|Anthony Rotundo]], [[Douglas Bush]], and others.

===Shakespeare and Fair Youth===
{{Main|Sexuality of William Shakespeare}}

The content of Shakespeare's works has raised the question of whether he may have been bisexual.
Although twenty-six of [[Shakespeare's sonnets]] are love poems addressed to a married woman (the "[[Shakespeare's sonnets#The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]]"), one hundred and twenty-six are addressed to an adolescent boy (known as the "[[Shakespeare's sonnets#Fair Youth|Fair Youth]]"). The amorous tone of the latter group, which focus on the boy's beauty, has been interpreted as evidence for Shakespeare's bisexuality, although others interpret them as referring to intense friendship or fatherly affection, not sexual love.

Among those of the latter interpretation, in the preface to his 1961 Pelican edition, Douglas Bush writes:
{{quotation|Since modern readers are unused to such ardor in masculine friendship and are likely to leap at the notion of homosexuality… we may remember that such an ideal, often exalted above the love of women, could exist in real life, from Montaigne to Sir Thomas Browne, and was conspicuous in Renaissance literature.{{sfn|Crompton|2003|p=379}}{{verify source|date=May 2016}}}}

Bush cites [[Montaigne]], who distinguished male friendships from "that other, licentious [[Greek love]]",&lt;ref&gt;Rollins 1:55; Bush cited Montaigne's 1580 work "On Friendship," in which the exact quote was: "And this other Greeke licence is justly abhorred by our customes." {{harvnb|Montaigne|1580|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as evidence of a platonic interpretation.

===Montaigne and Etienne de La Boétie===
The French philosopher [[Montaigne]] described the concept of romantic friendship (without using this English term) in his essay "On Friendship." In addition to distinguishing this type of love from homosexuality ("this other Greek licence"), another way in which Montaigne differed from the modern view&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ruskin]]'s 1865 essay "On Queen's Gardens" is a good example of the later view that emotionality was a female province; Kate Millet analyzes this essay in ''Sexual Politics'' (1969, 1970, 1990, 2000), University of Illinois Press, {{ISBN|0-252-06889-0}}. Many modern books such as Carmen Renee Berry's ''Girlfriends: Invisible Ties'' (1998), Wildcat Canyon Press, {{ISBN|1-885171-20-X}}, argue that intensity in friendship is a female capacity.&lt;/ref&gt; was that he felt that friendship and platonic emotion were a primarily masculine capacity (apparently unaware of the custom of female romantic friendship which also existed):

{{quotation|Seeing (to speake truly) that the ordinary sufficiency of women cannot answer this conference and communication, the nurse of this sacred bond: nor seem their minds strong enough to endure the pulling of a knot so hard, so fast, and durable.{{sfn|Montaigne|1580|p=4}}}}

Lesbian-feminist historian [[Lillian Faderman]] cites Montaigne, using "On Friendship" as evidence that romantic friendship was distinct from homosexuality, since the former could be extolled by famous and respected writers, who simultaneously disparaged homosexuality. (The quotation also furthers Faderman's beliefs that gender and sexuality are [[Social construction|socially constructed]], since they indicate that each sex has been thought of as "better" at intense friendship in one or another period of history.)

===Abraham Lincoln and Joshua Speed===
{{Main|Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln}}

Some historians have used the relationship between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Joshua Speed]] as another example of a relationship that modern people see as ambiguous or possibly gay, but which was most likely{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} to have been a romantic friendship. Lincoln and Speed lived together, shared a bed in their youth{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} and maintained a lifelong friendship. [[David Herbert Donald]] pointed out that men at that time often shared beds for financial reasons; men were accustomed to same-sex nonsexual intimacy, since most parents could not afford separate beds or rooms for male siblings. Anthony Rotundo notes that the custom of romantic friendship for men in America in the early 19th century was different from that of Renaissance France, and it was expected that men would distance themselves emotionally and physically somewhat after marriage; he claims that letters between Lincoln and Speed show this distancing after Lincoln married Mary Todd.{{r|Rotundo (1985)}} Such distancing is still practiced today.{{sfn|Geller|2001|pp=320–23}}

==Biblical and religious evidence==
Proponents of the romantic friendship hypothesis also make reference to the [[Bible]]. Historians like Faderman and Robert Brain{{sfn|Brain|1976}} believe that the descriptions of relationships such as [[David and Jonathan]] or Ruth and Naomi in this religious text establish that the customs of romantic friendship existed and were thought of as virtuous in the ancient [[Near East]], despite the simultaneous taboo on homosexuality.

The relationship between [[King David]] and [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]], son of [[King Saul]], is often cited as an example of male romantic friendship; for example, Faderman uses 2 Samuel 1:26 on the title page of her book: "Your love was wonderful to me, passing the love of women."&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 1:26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] and her [[mother-in-law]] [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]] are the female Biblical pair most often cited as a possible romantic friendship, as in the following verse commonly used in same-sex [[wedding]] ceremonies:
{{quotation|Entreat me not to leave you or to return from following you; for where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God; where you die I will die, and there will I be buried.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth to Naomi, Ruth 1:15-17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Faderman writes that women in Renaissance and Victorian times made reference to both Ruth and Naomi and "Davidean" friendship as the basis for their romantic friendships.{{sfn|Faderman|1981|pp=67, 121}}

While some authors, notably [[John Boswell]], have claimed that ecclesiastical practice in earlier ages blessed "same sex unions", the accurate interpretation of these relationships rests on a proper understanding of the mores and values of the participants, including both the parties receiving the rite in question and the clergy officiating at it. Boswell himself concedes that past relationships are ambiguous; when describing Greek and Roman attitudes, Boswell states that "[A] consensual physical aspect would have been utterly irrelevant to placing the relationship in a meaningful taxonomy."{{sfn|Boswell|1995|p=76}} Boswell's own interpretation has been thoroughly critiqued, notably by Brent D. Shaw, himself a homosexual, in a review written for the New Republic:

{{quotation|Given the centrality of Boswell's "new" evidence, therefore, it is best to begin by describing his documents and their import. These documents are liturgies for an ecclesiastical ritual called [[adelphopoiesis]] or, in simple English, the "creation of a brother." Whatever these texts are, they are not texts for marriage ceremonies. Boswell's translation of their titles (akolouthia eis adelphopoiesin and parallels) as "The Order of Celebrating the Union of Two Men" or "Office for Same-Sex Union" is inaccurate. In the original, the titles say no such thing. And this sort of tendentious translation of the documents is found, alas, throughout the book. Thus the Greek words that Boswell translates as "be united together" in the third section of the document quoted above are, in fact, rather ordinary words that mean "become brothers" (adelphoi genesthai); and when they are translated in this more straightforward manner, they impart a quite different sense to the reader.

Such agreements and rituals are "same-sex" in the sense that it is two men who are involved; and they are "unions" in the sense that the two men involved are co-joined as "brothers." But that is it. There is no indication in the texts themselves that these are marriages in any sense that the word would mean to readers now, nor in any sense that the word would have meant to persons then: the formation of a common household, the sharing of everything in a permanent co-residential unit, the formation of a family unit wherein the two partners were committed, ideally, to each other, with the intent to raise children, and so on.

Although it is difficult to state precisely what these ritualised relationships were, most historians who have studied them are fairly certain that they deal with a species of "ritualised kinship" that is covered by the term "brotherhood." (This type of "brotherhood" is similar to the ritualised agreements struck between members of the Mafia or other "men of honour" in our own society.) That explains why the texts on adelphopoiesis in the prayerbooks are embedded within sections dealing with other kinship-forming rituals, such as marriage and adoption. Giovanni Tomassia in the 1880s and Paul Koschaker in the 1930s, whose works Boswell knows and cites, had already reached this conclusion.{{r|Shaw (1994)}}}}

Historian Robert Brain has also traced these ceremonies from Pagan "blood brotherhood" ceremonies through medieval Catholic ceremonies called "gossipry" or "siblings before God," on to modern ceremonies in some Latin American countries referred to as "[[compadre|compadrazgo]]"; Brain considers the ceremonies to refer to romantic friendship.{{sfn|Brain|1976|p=75–107}}

== Romantic friendships in women's colleges ==
As the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|American suffrage movement]] succeeded in gaining rights for white middle- and upper-class women, heterosexual marriage became less of a necessity, and many more women went to college and continued to live in female-centric communities after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22906565|title=Odd girls and twilight lovers : a history of lesbian life in twentieth-century America|last=Lillian,|first=Faderman,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0231074883|location=New York|pages=12|oclc=22906565}}&lt;/ref&gt; The all-women peer culture formed at [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's colleges]] allowed students to create their own social rules and hierarchies, to become each other's leaders and heroes, and to idolize each other. These idolizations often took the forms of romantic friendships, which contemporaries called "smashes", "crushes" and "spoons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22906565|title=Odd girls and twilight lovers : a history of lesbian life in twentieth-century America|last=Lillian,|first=Faderman,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0231074883|location=New York|pages=19|oclc=22906565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of "smashing" involved one student showering another with gifts: notes, chocolates, sometimes even locks of hair. When the object of the student's affections was wooed and the two of them began spending all their time together, the "aggressor" was perceived by her friends as "smashed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sahli|first=Nancy Ann|date=1979|title=Smashing: Women's Relationships before the Fall|url=|journal=Chrysalis|volume=8|pages=21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century, "crush" gradually replaced the term "smash", and generally signified a younger girl's infatuation with an older peer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43475535|title=Alma mater : design and experience in the women's colleges from their nineteenth-century beginnings to the 1930s|last=Lefkowitz.|first=Horowitz, Helen|date=1993|publisher=University of Massachuchusetts Press|year=|isbn=0870238698|edition= 2nd|location=Amherst|pages=166|oclc=43475535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Susan Van Dyne has documented an "intimate friendship" between Mary Mathers and Frona Brooks, two members of the [[Smith College]] class of 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dyne|first=Susan Van|date=2016|title="Abracadabra": Intimate Inventions by Early College Women in the United States|jstor=10.15767/feministstudies.42.2.0280|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=42|issue=2|pages=280–310|doi=10.15767/feministstudies.42.2.0280}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathers and Brooks exchanged tokens of affection, relished time spent alone together, and celebrated an anniversary.

Romantic friendships kindled in women's colleges sometimes continued after graduation, with women living together in "[[Boston marriages]]" or cooperative houses. Women who openly committed themselves to other women often found acceptance of their commitment and lifestyle in academic fields, and felt comfortable expressing their feelings for their same-sex companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43475535|title=Alma mater : design and experience in the women's colleges from their nineteenth-century beginnings to the 1930s|last=Lefkowitz.|first=Horowitz, Helen|date=1993|publisher=University of Massachuchusetts Press|year=|isbn=0870238698|edition= 2nd|location=Amherst|pages=190|oclc=43475535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the century, smashes and crushes were considered an essential part of the women's college experience, and students who wrote home spoke openly about their involvement in romantic friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43475535|title=Alma mater : design and experience in the women's colleges from their nineteenth-century beginnings to the 1930s|last=Lefkowitz.|first=Horowitz, Helen|date=1993|publisher=University of Massachuchusetts Press|year=|isbn=0870238698|edition= 2nd|location=Amherst|pages=66|oclc=43475535}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, however, public opinion had turned against crushes as the American public began to realize that [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]] might not be dependent on men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22906565|title=Odd girls and twilight lovers : a history of lesbian life in twentieth-century America|last=Lillian,|first=Faderman,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0231074883|location=New York|pages=35|oclc=22906565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception in 1990s American gay and lesbian subculture==
Several small groups of advocates and researchers have advocated for the renewed use of the term, or the related term [[Boston marriage]], today. Several [[lesbian]], [[gay]], and [[feminist]] authors (such as [[Lillian Faderman]], [[Stephanie Coontz]], Jaclyn Geller and Esther Rothblum) have done academic research on the topic;{{sfn|Rothblum|1993}} these authors typically favor the [[social constructionist]] view that [[sexual orientation]] is a modern, culturally constructed concept.&lt;ref&gt;See Faderman's introduction in the 1998 edition of ''Surpassing the Love of Men''; Coontz's ''The Way We Never Were'' has as its thesis the social construction of a variety of family and relationship traditions, whereas Geller advocates for the abolition of marriage and a renewed focus on friendship for feminist reasons ({{harvnb|Geller|2001}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shout gnangarra.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A round or Shout of drinks arriving at the table]]

A '''round of drinks''' is a set of [[alcoholic beverage]]s purchased by one person in a group for that complete group. The purchaser buys the round of drinks as a single order at the bar. In many places it is customary for people to take turns buying rounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirc.org/publik/pub.html  SIRC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roundrules.com  Round Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a nearly [[wiktionary:ubiquitous|ubiquitous]] custom in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]].  In Australia and New Zealand it is referred to as '''shouting'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianbeers.com/culture/shouting.htm|title=Shouting|work=australianbeers.com|accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice is also customary in many parts of [[North America]], especially in areas where people with cultural roots in Ireland and the UK predominate.
A notable exception was the UK [[State Management Scheme]] in which treating (i.e. buying a round) was forbidden, from July 1916 until June 1919.

==Australia==
In [[John O'Grady (writer)|John O'Grady]]'s ''[[They're a Weird Mob]]'', Nino learns some customs related to shouting.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Your turn.''
:''What is my turn?''
Your turn to shout''
:''Why should I shout?''
Because I shouted you.''
:''I did not hear you shout at me.''
He thought for a while and said, I get it. When you buy a bloke a beer, it's called a shout, see?''
:''Why is that?''
I haven't a clue, but that's what it's called. I shouted for you, now it's your turn to shout for me.''
:''I was only a little thirsty. I do not think I wish another drink.''
He looked quite stern, In this country, if you want to keep out of trouble, you always return a shout, see?''
:''Is this the custom?''
Bloody oath, it's the custom. Your turn.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==United States==
In the culture of the [[United States Military]], possession of a [[challenge coin]] can be used to determine who buys a round of drinks.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} One individual of a group lays down their coin, and all else present must lay down their coins as well. Anyone who does not have a coin with them must buy a round. If everyone can produce a coin, the challenger must buy a round.

In [[set theory]], a '''semiset''' is a [[class (set theory)|proper class]] that is contained in a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].
The theory of semisets was proposed and developed by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[mathematician]]s [[Petr Vopěnka]] and [[Petr Hájek]] (1972). It is based on a modification of the [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]]; in standard NBG, the existence of semisets is precluded by the [[axiom of separation]].

The concept of semisets opens the way for a formulation of an [[alternative set theory]].
In particular, Vopěnka's [[Alternative Set Theory]] (1979) axiomatizes the concept of semiset, supplemented with several additional principles.

Semisets can be used to represent sets with imprecise boundaries. Novák (1984) studied approximation of semisets by [[fuzzy set]]s, which are often more suitable for practical applications of the modeling of imprecision.

[[File:1549 siftwinnow.jpg|thumb|"Sifting and winnowing" commemorative plaque]]

'''Sifting and winnowing''' is a [[metaphor]] for the academic pursuit of truth affiliated with the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. It was coined by [[List of Presidents and Chancellors of the University of Wisconsin–Madison|UW President]] [[Charles Kendall Adams]] in an 1894 final report from a committee exonerating economics professor [[Richard T. Ely]] of censurable charges from state education superintendent [[Oliver Elwin Wells]]. The phrase became a local byword for the tenet of [[academic freedom]].

== History ==

[[File:Ely-Richard-T.jpg|thumb|Professor Richard T. Ely, whose work sparked a state challenge to academic freedom]]
In the 1890s, [[University of Wisconsin]] economics professor [[Richard T. Ely]]'s philosophy and radical practice came under fire from state education superintendent [[Oliver Elwin Wells]].{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}} Ely was known to be liberal and pro-union, having published a book on socialism.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}} Wells protested Ely's socialist beliefs, teaching, and public speaking to UW president [[Charles Kendall Adams]] and the Board of Regents, who did not censure Ely.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}} A committee appointed to address the charges produced a report that exonerated Ely upon acceptance by the regents.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}} The report introduced the idea of "sifting and winnowing":{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}}

{{centered pull quote|As Regents of a university with over a hundred instructors supported by nearly two millions of people who hold a vast diversity of views regarding the great questions which at present agitate the human mind, we could not for a moment think of recommending the dismissal or even the criticism of a teacher even if some of his opinions should, in some quarters, be regarded as visionary. Such a course would be equivalent to saying that no professor should teach anything which is not accepted by everybody as true. This would cut our curriculum down to very small proportions. We cannot for a moment believe that knowledge has reached its final goal, or that the present condition of society is perfect. We must therefore welcome from our teachers such discussions as shall suggest the means and prepare the way by which knowledge may be extended, present evils be removed and others prevented. We feel that we would be unworthy of the position we hold if we did not believe in progress in all departments of knowledge. In all lines of academic investigation it is of the utmost importance that the investigator should be absolutely free to follow the indications of truth wherever they may lead. Whatever may be the limitations which trammel inquiry elsewhere we believe the great state University of Wisconsin should ever encourage that continual and fearless [[sifting]] and [[winnowing]] by which alone the truth can be found. |author=1894 Ely trial committee final report|source=via Herfurth's ''Sifting and Winnowing''{{sfn|Herfurth|1949|ps=, ch. 1.}} }}

[[File:Charles Kendall Adams.jpg|thumb|UW–Madison President Adams, who coined the phrase]]

Ely later referred to the report as the "Wisconsin [[Magna Charta]]" for its guarantees of academic freedom in pursuit of truth.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=46}} In ''Decades of Chaos and Revolution'', Stephen J. Nelson contends that UW's sentiment on academic freedom had been set "well before" the 1890s.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}} He added that the 1894 statement "sounds the trumpet of the fundamental principles of the academy: an unending, unlimited belief in the creed of academic freedom and inquiry."{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}}

The "sifting and winnowing" construction was coined by Adams, the UW president, who had defended Ely publicly and read his book.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=46}} It was later invoked by UW–Madison Chancellor [[Robben Wright Fleming]] when responding to protestors during his tenure.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=44}}

In a later incident, sociology professor [[Edward Alsworth Ross]] was censured upon inviting anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] to address his class.&lt;ref name="UW kb"/&gt; He did not share her beliefs, but supported her free speech.&lt;ref name="UW kb"/&gt; In memorial of the incident, the Class of 1910 created a commemorative "sifting and winnowing" plaque of the phrase in its context, which the regents rejected.&lt;ref name="UW kb"/&gt; After the Class appealed to area newspapers, the regents relented.&lt;ref name="UW kb"/&gt; The plaque was installed on [[Bascom Hall]] in 1915, where it remains.&lt;ref name="UW kb"/&gt; It was rededicated in 1957.&lt;ref name="UW kb"/&gt;

The '''''Social Progress Index''''' ('''''SPI''''') measures the extent to which countries provide for the social and environmental needs of their citizens. Fifty-four indicators in the areas of basic human needs, foundations of well-being, and opportunity to progress show the relative performance of nations. The index is published by the nonprofit [[Social Progress Imperative]], and is based on the writings of [[Amartya Sen]], [[Douglass North]], and [[Joseph Stiglitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond GDP|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2013/04/social-progress|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=2 August 2013|date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPI measures the well-being of a society by observing social and environmental outcomes directly rather than the economic factors. The social and environmental factors include wellness (including health, shelter and sanitation), equality, inclusion, sustainability and personal freedom and safety.&lt;ref name="own-website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Progress Imperitive Website|url=https://www.socialprogressimperative.org/|publisher=Social Progress Imperitive|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction and methodology ==
The index combines three dimensions
# [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Basic human needs]]
# Foundations of [[well-being]]
#[[Business opportunity|Opportunity]]

Each dimension includes four components, which are each composed of between three and five specific outcome indicators. The included indicators are selected because they are measured appropriately, with a consistent methodology, by the same organization across all (or essentially all) of the countries in the sample. Together, this framework aims to capture a broad range of interrelated factors revealed by the scholarly literature and practitioner experience as underpinning social progress. 

Two key features of the ''Social Progress Index'' are:&lt;ref name="own-website"/&gt;
# the exclusion of economic variables
# the use of outcome measures rather than inputs

Social Progress Imperative evaluated hundreds of possible indicators while developing the ''Social Progress Index'', including engaging researchers at MIT to determine what indicators best differentiated the performance of nations. The index uses outcome measures when there are sufficient data available or the closest possible proxies.&lt;ref name="own-website"/&gt;

==History==
In 2010, a group of global leaders from the social sector sought to develop a better measure of a country's level of development and, by extension, better understand its development priorities. Funded by private foundations and under the technical guidance of Professors [[Michael Porter]] from [[Harvard Business School]] and Scott Stern from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the group formed Social Progress Imperative and launched a beta version of the ''Social Progress Index'' for 50 countries in 2013 to measure a comprehensive array of components of social and environmental performance and aggregate them into an overall framework.

This work was influenced by the contributions of [[Amartya Sen]] on social development, as well as by the recent call for action in the report ''Mismeasuring Our Lives'' by the [[Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond GDP|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2013/04/social-progress|work=The Economist|accessdate=2 August 2013|date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Social Progress Index'' was released in 2014 for 133 countries with a second version in 2015.&lt;ref name="own-website"/&gt;

On 11 July 2013, Social Progress Imperative's chairman and professor at [[Harvard Business School]], [[Michael Porter]], addressed the [[United Nations]] 6th Ministerial Forum for Development and discussed the Social Progress Index.&lt;ref name="own-website"/&gt;

In addition to the global ''Social Progress Index'', the methodology used to create it has been adapted to measure social and environmental performance in smaller areas, such as the Amazon region of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/thomson-reuters/140823/conservation-amazon-threatened-poor-social-conditions-its-peopl|title=Conservation of Amazon threatened by poor social conditions of its people: study|work=Global Post|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other projects include a ''Social Progress Index'' for the Municipality of Guatemala City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progresosocial.org/news/indice-de-progreso-social-de-la-ciudad-de-guatemala/|title=ÍNDICE DE PROGRESO SOCIAL DE LA CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA - Progreso Social|work=progresosocial.org|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundacion Paraguaya has integrated elements of the ''Social Progress Index'' into its [[Poverty Stoplight]] tool. The national government of Paraguay is setting a target for ''Social Progress Index'' performance alongside GDP targets.

''The Guardian'' reported that the European Commission had agreed to partner with Social Progress Imperative to create a [[EU Social Progress Index|social progress index for the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/09/social-progress-gdp-economic-growth-european-commission|title=European Commission agrees to investigate using social progress tool alongside GDP|author=Jo Confino|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;The EU Social Progress Index was published in October, 2016.

A similar index, although with some differences compared to the nation list (and therefore not directly comparable), has been published for the individual [[U.S. state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Social Progress Index: US States – Methodology Summary | year=2018 | publisher=Social Progress Imperative | url=http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Methodology-brief-Final.pdf | accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=State Progress Reports | year=2018 | publisher=Social Progress Imperative | url=http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/state-progress-reports/ | accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
From an econometric stand point, the Index appears to be similar to other efforts aimed at overcoming the limitation of traditional economic measure such as the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). One major criticism is that although the Social Progress Index can be seen as a superset of indicators used by earlier econometric models such as [[Gross National Well-being]] Index 2005, Bhutan [[Gross National Happiness]] Index of 2012, and [[World Happiness Report]] of 2012, Yet, unlike them, it ignores measures of subjective life satisfaction and psychological well-being. Other critics point out that "there remain certain dimensions that are currently not included in the SPI. These are the concentration of wealth in the top 1 percent of the population, efficiency of the judicial system, and quality of the transportation infrastructure."&lt;ref&gt; http://opinion.inquirer.net/80526/social-progress-index&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics argue that "we must be wary. Though words such as “inclusive capitalism” are bandied around increasingly these days to signal a new age, free from ideological battlegrounds between public and private, much of what the organization’s founders say about it confirms that the index is more about being “business inclusive” than “inclusive capitalism.”&lt;ref&gt; http://www.humanosphere.org/social-business/2016/05/a-new-index-to-measure-social-progress-but-what-is-it-really-telling-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2487">The '''Society for the Quantitative Analyses of Behavior''' was founded in 1978 by [[Michael Commons|Michael Lamport Commons]] and [[John Anthony Nevin]].  The first president was [[Richard Herrnstein|Richard J. Herrnstein]]. In the beginning it was called the '''Harvard Symposium on Quantitative Analysis of Behavior''' ('''HSQAB'''). This society meets once a year to discuss various topic in [[quantitative analysis of behavior]] including: [[behavioral economics]], [[behavioral momentum]], [[Connectionist]] systems or [[neural networks]], [[hyperbolic discounting]], [[foraging]], [[errorless learning]], [[learning]] and the [[Rescorla-Wagner model]], [[matching law]], [[Melioration theory|Melioration]], [[scalar expectancy]], [[Detection theory|signal detection]] and [[stimulus control]], [[connectionism]] or [[Artificial neural network|Neural Network]]s.  Mathematical models and data are presented and discussed. The field is a branch of [[mathematical psychology]]. Some papers resulting from the symposium are published as a special issue of the journal ''[[Behavioural Processes]]''.

The term '''suspension of disbelief''' or '''willing suspension of disbelief''' has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe something surreal; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite dictionary|author=&lt;!--None listed.--&gt;|date=2018|dictionary=[[Oxford Dictionaries]]|title=suspend disbelief (phrase)|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/suspend_disbelief|access-date=29 July 2018|edition=Online|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=|oclc=656668849|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729045913/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/suspend_disbelief|archive-date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who suggested that if a writer could infuse a "human interest and a semblance of truth" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. '''Cognitive estrangement''' in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Critical Theory|last=Buchanan|first=Ian|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199532919|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "suspension of disbelief" came to be used more loosely in the later 20th century, often used to imply that the burden was on the reader, rather than the writer, to achieve it. This might be used to refer to the willingness of the audience to overlook the limitations of a medium, so that these do not interfere with the acceptance of those premises. These premises may also lend to the engagement of the mind and perhaps proposition of thoughts, ideas, art and theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= From 'King Kong' to 'Indecent Proposal,' audiences have been asked to buy a premise that can make – or break – a film|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=15 April 1993|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-15/entertainment/ca-23034_1_indecent-proposal|accessdate=2010-10-24|first=Robert W.|last=Welkos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspension of disbelief is often an essential element for a magic act or a circus sideshow act. For example, an audience is not expected to actually believe that a woman is [[Sawing a woman in half|cut in half]] or transforms into a gorilla&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Botos|first=Tim|title=‘Gorilla Girl' sideshow act hangs on despite changing times|url=http://www.patriotledger.com/archive/x144223716/-Gorilla-Girl-sideshow-act-hangs-on-despite-changing-times|accessdate=15 October 2012|newspaper=GateHouse News Service; Patriot Ledger|date=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to enjoy the performance.

According to the theory, suspension of disbelief is an essential ingredient for any kind of storytelling. With any film, the viewer has to ignore the reality that they are viewing a staged performance and temporarily accept it as their reality in order to be entertained. [[Black-and-white]] films provide an obvious early example that audiences are willing to suspend disbelief, no matter how implausible the images appear, for the sake of entertainment. With the exception of totally color blind people ([[Achromatopsia|achromats]]), no person viewing these films sees the real world without color, but some are still willing to suspend disbelief and accept the images in order to be entertained. Suspension of disbelief is also supposed to be essential for the enjoyment of many films and television shows involving complex stunts, special effects, and seemingly unrealistic plots and characterizations.

== Coleridge's original formulation ==
Coleridge coined the phrase in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'', published in 1817, in the context of the creation and reading of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Safire, William.  ''On Language; Suspension of Disbelief''. New York Times. 7 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter XIV describes the preparations with [[Wordsworth]] for their revolutionary collaboration ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (first edition 1798), for which Coleridge had contributed the more romantic, gothic pieces including ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. Poetry and fiction involving the supernatural had gone out of fashion to a large extent in the 18th century, in part due to the declining belief in witches and other supernatural agents among the educated classes, who embraced the rational approach to the world offered by the new science. [[Alexander Pope]], notably, felt the need to explain and justify his use of elemental spirits in ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', one of the few English poems of the century that invoked the supernatural. Coleridge wished to revive the use of fantastic elements in poetry. The concept of "willing suspension of disbelief" explained how a modern, enlightened audience might continue to enjoy such types of story.

Coleridge recalled:

{{quote|... It was agreed, that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural, or at least romantic, yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith. Mr. Wordsworth on the other hand was to propose to himself as his object, to give the charm of novelty to things of every day, and to excite a feeling analogous to the supernatural, by awakening the mind's attention from the lethargy of custom, and directing it to the loveliness and the wonders of the world before us ...&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Biographia Literaria, 1817, Chapter XIV&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The notion of such an action by an audience was however recognized in antiquity, as seen particularly in the Roman theoretical concerns of Horace, who also lived in an age of increasing skepticism about the supernatural, in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (with the quotation ''[[Ut pictura poesis]]'').

== Examples in literature ==
{{See also|Dramatic convention}}
Suspension of disbelief is sometimes said to be an essential component of live theater, where it was recognized by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], who refers to it in the Prologue to ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'':

{{quote|[…] make imaginary puissance […] 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings […] turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass.}}

== Psychology ==
Psychological critic Norman Holland points to a neuroscientific explanation.  When we hear or watch any narrative, our brains go wholly into perceiving mode, turning off the systems for acting or planning to act, and with them go our systems for assessing reality. We have, in Coleridge's second, more accurate phrase, "poetic faith". That's why humans have such trouble recognizing lies: they first believe, then have to make a conscious effort to disbelieve.

Only when we stop perceiving to think about what we have seen or heard, only then do we assess its truth-value. If we are really "into" the fiction – "transported", in the psychologists' term – we are, as Immanuel Kant pointed out long ago, "disinterested". We respond aesthetically, without purpose.  We don't judge the truth of what we're perceiving, even though if we stop being transported and think about it, we know quite well it's a fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holland|first1=Norman|title=Spiderman? Sure! The Neuroscience of Disbelief|journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews|date=2008|volume=33|issue=4|pages=312–320|url=https://www.researchgate.net/researcher/2003369909_Norman_Holland|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holland|first1=Norman|title=Literature and the Brain|url=http://www.literatureandthebrain.com|website=Literatureandthebrain.com|publisher=PsyArt|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspension of disbelief has also been used within a mental health context by Frank DeFulgentis in his book ''Flux''. It is an attempt to describe the phenomenon of forgetting irrational thoughts associated with cases of [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]]. In the book, the author suggests 'suspending disbelief' as opposed to forcing ourselves to forget; similar to how one would put a virus in quarantine. We can thereby allow ourselves to be absorbed in the activities around us until these irrationalities vanish on their own accord.

== Criticisms ==

[[Aesthetics|Aesthetic philosophers]] generally reject claims that suspension of disbelief accurately characterizes the relationship between people and "fictions." [[Kendall Walton]] notes that, if viewers were to truly suspend disbelief at a horror movie and accept its images as absolute fact, they would have a true-to-life set of reactions. For instance, audience members would cry out, "Look behind you!" to an endangered on-screen character or call the police when they witnessed an on-screen murder.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2025831 Fearing Fictions]", Kendall L. Walton, [[JSTOR]] (''[[Journal of Philosophy|The Journal of Philosophy]]'', Vol. 75, No. 1 (01-1978), pp. 5–27). Retrieved 3 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many of these criticisms simply fail to notice that Coleridge's original statement came in a restrictive clause. The formulation "...that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith," of necessity implies that there are different sorts of suspension of disbelief and specifies that poetic faith is one instance of a larger class. One need not choose to believe that a character in a horror film is a real person in order, for example, to choose to believe that the character is looking at the building seen in the following reverse-shot.{{or|date=August 2018}}

Not all authors believe that suspension of the disbelief adequately characterizes the audience's relationship to imaginative works of art. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] challenges this concept in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", choosing instead the paradigm of secondary belief based on inner [[consistency]] of reality. Tolkien says that, in order for the narrative to work, the reader must believe that what he reads is true within the secondary reality of the fictional world. By focusing on creating an [[Fictional universe#Definition|internally consistent fictional world]], the author makes secondary belief possible. Tolkien argues that suspension of disbelief is only necessary when the work has failed to create secondary belief. From that point the spell is broken, and the reader ceases to be immersed in the story and must make a conscious effort to suspend disbelief or else give up on it entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J. R. R. “On Fairy-Stories.” The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1983, pp. 109–61.

The '''Swiss cheese model''' of accident causation is a model used in [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] and [[risk management]], including [[aviation safety]], [[engineering]], [[healthcare]], emergency service organizations, and as the principle behind [[layered security]], as used in [[computer security]] and [[Defense in depth (computing)|defense in depth]]. It likens human systems to multiple slices of [[swiss cheese]], stacked side by side, in which the risk of a threat becoming a reality is mitigated by the differing layers and types of defenses which are "layered" behind each other.  Therefore, in theory, lapses and weaknesses in one defense do not allow a risk to materialize, since other defenses also exist, to prevent a [[single point of failure]]. The model was originally formally propounded by Dante Orlandella and James T. Reason of the [[University of Manchester]],{{sfn|Reason|1990}} and has since gained widespread acceptance.  It is sometimes called the '''cumulative act effect'''.

Although the Swiss cheese model is respected and considered to be a useful method of relating concepts, it has been subject to criticism that it is used too broadly, and without enough other models or support.&lt;ref name="eurocontrol"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Eurocontrol| title=Revisiting the Swiss cheese model of accidents| date= October 2006| url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/eec/gallery/content/public/document/eec/report/2006/017_Swiss_Cheese_Model.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure domains==
Reason hypothesized that most accidents can be traced to one or more of four failure domains: organizational influences, supervision, preconditions, and specific acts.&lt;ref&gt;1. J.A. Doran (Shell International Exploration and Production B.V.)  |G.C. van der Graaf (Shell International Exploration and Production B.V.)

A.D. Gower-Jones (Shell International Exploration and Production)  |  G.C. van der Graf (Shell International Exploration and Production) Experience with Tripod BETA Incident Analysis Proceedings of the SPE International Conference on Health, Safety, and Environment in Oil and Gas Exploration and Production, 7-10 June, Caracas, Venezuela Publication Date1998&lt;/ref&gt;For example, in aviation, preconditions for unsafe acts include fatigued air crew or improper communications practices.  Unsafe supervision encompasses for example, pairing inexperienced pilots on a night flight into known adverse weather. Organizational influences encompass such things as reduction in expenditure on pilot training in times of financial austerity.&lt;ref name=Wieg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stranks /&gt;

==Holes and slices==
In the Swiss cheese model, an organisation's defenses against failure are modeled as a series of barriers, represented as slices of cheese. The holes in the slices represent weaknesses in individual parts of the system and are continually varying in size and position across the slices. The system produces failures when a hole in each slice momentarily aligns, permitting (in Reason's words) "a trajectory of accident opportunity", so that a hazard passes through holes in all of the slices, leading to a failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Controlling Pilot Error|author1=Daryl Raymond Smith |author2=David Frazier |author3=L W Reithmaier |author4=James C Miller  |last-author-amp=yes |pages=10|year=2001|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=0071373187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=4&amp;ndash;6|title=Clinical Risk Management in Midwifery: the right to a perfect baby?|author1=Jo.

==Active and latent failures==
The model includes both active and latent failures.  Active failures encompass the unsafe acts that can be directly linked to an accident, such as (in the case of aircraft accidents) a [[navigation]] error. Latent failures include contributory factors that may lie dormant for days, weeks, or months until they contribute to the accident. Latent failures span the first three domains of failure in Reason's model.&lt;ref name=Wieg&gt;{{cite book|title=A human error approach to aviation accident analysis: the human factors analysis and classification system|author1=Douglas A. Wiegmann |author2=Scott A. Shappell |lastauthoramp=yes |pages=48&amp;ndash;49|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=0754618730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the Swiss Cheese model, late 1980 to about 1992, attempts were made to combine two theories: James Reason multi-layer defence model and Willem Albert Wagenaar’s [[Tripod Beta|Tripod theory of accident causation]]. This resulted in a period where the Swiss Cheese diagram was represented with the slices of cheese labels as Active Failures, Preconditions and latent failures. 

These attempts to combine both theories still causes confusion today. A more correct version of the combined theories is shown with the Active Failures (now called immediate causes) Precondition and Latent Failure (now called underlying causes) shown as the reason each barrier (slice of cheese) has a hole in it and the slices of cheese as the barriers.

==Applications==
The same framework can be applicable in some areas of healthcare. For example, a latent failure could be the similar packaging of two drugs that are then stored close to each other in a pharmacy. Such a failure would be a contributory factor in the administration of the wrong drug to a patient. Such research led to the realization that [[medical error]] can be the result of "system flaws, not character flaws", and that greed, ignorance, malice or laziness are not the only causes of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Review of Nursing Research Volume 24: Focus on Patient Safety|editor1=Joyce J.

Westrum models latent failures as voids within this envelope, and active failures as factors external to the envelope that are acting to breach it.

'''Takako Saito''' (born 1929) is a Japanese artist. Closely associated with [[Fluxus]], the international collective of avant-garde artists that was active primarily in the 1960s and 1970s,  Saito contributed a number of performances and artworks to the movement, which continue to be exhibited in Fluxus exhibitions to the present day. She currently lives in [[Düsseldorf]] in Germany. She is most famous for  pieces like ''Silent Music'' or for her [[Spice Chess|special Chess]] sets.

==Early life==
[[Image:LiquorChess1975.jpg|thumb|left|270px|''Liquor Chess'', 1975. As the game progresses, players have to keep sampling the phials to ascertain the pieces' status.]]
Saito was born in Sabae-Shi, [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]] Province in Japan. Five Years after studying [[psychology]] at the [[Japan Women's University]], she became involved with ''Sōzō Biiku undŏ'', the 'Creative Art Education' movement. Founded 1952 by Sadajirŏ Kubo, the movement focussed on encouraging creativity through free will.&lt;ref name="Perform"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hVzPI1mvf1cC&amp;pg=RA1-PA117&amp;lpg=RA1-PA117&amp;dq=Takako+SAITO&amp;source=web&amp;ots=KudXkbExvb&amp;sig=8wpOfAOs6mJi_2-UO5gNZ8G5DYg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result#PRA1-PA118,M1 Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst attending a summer camp organized by the movement, Saito met a [[Tokyo]] member [[Ay-O]], an artist actively engaged in encouraging [[avant-garde]] groups in Japan. Ay-O became an important source of information for Saito about the avant-garde, first in Tokyo, and then, later, in [[New York City]], where he moved in 1958.&lt;ref name="Perform"/&gt; Intrigued by the reports being sent back by Ay-O, Saito also travelled to New York in 1963 ostensibly to work as a designer for a textile wholesaler and later studying at NY university, Brooklyn Museum Art School and Art Student League. It was through Ay-O that she was introduced to [[George Maciunas]], founder and organiser of Fluxus, and one of the central members of the New York avant-garde.

==Fluxus==
George Maciunas was fascinated by Japanese craftsmanship and owned some Japanese boxes. He was so impressed with Saito's craftmanship that he asked her to contribute a series of disrupted chess sets to sell in his new Flux shop on Canal Street, SoHo, New York. Maciunas was so delighted by ''Spice Chess'' in particular that he 'even took credit for it on occasion.'.&lt;ref name="Codex"&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams, 1989 p461&lt;/ref&gt; Even after developing some distance to Fluxus Saito maintained contact with him until Maciunas' death.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"After a while, Maciunas proposed having dinner together every evening. In his opinion, buying food for many was more economical than buying for one... He called it Flux Dinner Commune. So George, [[Nam June Paik|Paik]], Takako, Shigeko and I started this part-time collective life. For the first few days, the men went shopping and the girls cooked. However we found it inconvenient, because George came back rather late from his office and then often didn't buy what we wanted to cook.... It didn't last long, because we got jobs at night. George was discouraged, but bravely said, "Well, work comes first, dinner second." Mieko Shiomi &lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p129&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Saito remained part of the Fluxus movement throughout the 1960s and 70s,&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T028714?q=takako+saito&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit Oxford Art Online (subscription only)/ Fluxus]&lt;/ref&gt; producing multi-media, installation and sculptural work in collaboration with other artists such as [[Robert Filliou]], [[George Brecht]], [[Dorothy Iannone]], [[Gerhard Rühm]], [[Ben Vautier]], [[Dick Higgins]] and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Bob Watts]]. Saito has contributed pieces to many Fluxus collaborations, including ''[[Fluxus 1]]'' (1964) and the ''Flux Cabinet'' (1975–77).&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; She is perhaps most well known for her "Silent Music" piece. Her output was diverse and she is also remembered for the various special [[chess]] sets including ''Smell Chess'' and ''[[Spice Chess]]'', and that were often included in the ''Flux Boxes'' from 1964 onwards, which was part of a Fluxus series of game variations of [[Chess]].

Saito left New York in 1968, leading a peripatetic lifestyle until 1978. Saito lived in France, Germany, England and Italy, working with [[George Brecht]], [[Robert Filliou]], and with the Beau Geste Press, publishing artist's books.&lt;ref name="NRW"&gt;[http://www.nrw-museum.de/output/controller.aspx?cid=121&amp;detail=6&amp;detail2=76 Virtual Museum of Modernism]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1979 to 1983, she taught at the [[University of Essen]]. Later pieces have maintained the fluxus ideal of eroding the boundaries between performer and viewer;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Saito's ''You and Me Shop'' again includes the idea of exchange with the viewer and of collaborative artistic work. In a small shop resembling a market stall, the artist as sales woman offered an arranged selection of those small things or materials which she also used in her objects: dried onion skins, chestnuts, pieces of wood. Here, the interaction with the viewer started with the joint selection, placement and fixation of the offered items on paper plates. It ended with the handing over of the object to the respective participant.' Virtual Museum of Modernism &lt;ref name="NRW"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aside from solo exhibitions in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Cologne]], [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]], New York, [[Kansas]], [[Bremen]], [[Kaunas]] and [[Schwerin]], she has featured in recent exhibitions including Fluxus retrospectives at the Chapel Studio in [[Balatonboglár]] in 2002 and at [[Tate Modern]] London in 2008 and the ''Re-Imagining Asia'' at the [[House of World Cultures]] in [[Berlin]].

===Düsseldorf===
Since 1978, Saito has been living and working in Düsseldorf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1428">"'''The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories'''" is a 1976 paper in [[ethics]] by Michael Stocker. Published in ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'', the central claim of the paper is that some modern ethical theories fail to account for [[motivation|motive]] in their theories, producing a sort of [[schizophrenia]] because the agent is unable to use his reasons or motives as a basis for his actions. According to Stocker, motive is important to ethics and should be considered as well, rather than only "duty, rightness and obligation" which he believes are the main focuses of current theories. Stocker believes that this focus is not compatible with the motives required for goods such as [[love]] and [[friendship]].

Stocker uses the example of a friend visiting you in the hospital. It is nice at first, however he reveals that he chose to spend time with you not out of concern for you in particular, but because he felt it was his moral [[duty]]. In this case, we feel that there is something missing in this action—we would much prefer to be visited by someone who cares about us directly, not just his duty.

'''The Spoils of War (symposium)'''
[[File:Looted_Art_-_German_loot_stored_at_Schlosskirche_Ellingen_-_Ellingen_(Bavaria_-_Germany).jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|German repository of looted possessions in a church at Ellingen, Bavaria, May 1945.]]
"The Spoils of War—World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property" was a ground-breaking international [[symposium]] held in New York City in 1995 to discuss the artworks, cultural property, and historic sites damaged, lost, and [[Nazi plunder|plundered as a result of World War II]]. The three-day event was sponsored by the [[Bard Graduate Center]] for Studies in the Decorative Arts to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;January 19–21, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was organized by [[Elizabeth Simpson (archaeologist)|Elizabeth Simpson]], an archaeologist and professor at the Bard Graduate Center.

Worldwide interest in the subject was generated by announcements in 1991 of the location of objects confiscated by Soviet Trophy Brigades from German territory at the end of the war. The unification of Germany in 1990 and dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 were followed by a number of goodwill agreements between Germany and the countries of the former USSR, as well as the opening of official negotiations on repatriation. It was this spirit of openness and cooperation that made the New York symposium possible. This initial gathering of concerned parties would be followed by a series of conferences, initiatives, agreements, and repatriations that continue into the present.

==New York conference and proceedings==
[[File:Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton inspect looted art HD-SN-99-02758.JPEG|thumb|Generals Bradley, Patton, and Eisenhower examining works of art stored by the Nazis in the Merkers mine, Germany, April 1945.]]The program featured 48 notable speakers—government officials, diplomats, journalists, art historians, archaeologists, lawyers, and independent researchers—from Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Australia, England, and the United States. The combined testimony laid bare another horrifying dimension to the anguish of human suffering wrought by the [[World War II|Second World War]].

The symposium was the first to address the issue in a public forum, and led to numerous initiatives on provenance research by the governments involved as well as museums, libraries, and art dealers internationally. As a result, the art world was changed irrevocably. Acquisitions policies were revised and organizations restructured to facilitate the identification of artistic and cultural objects that had been stolen or transferred illegally during and after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aamd.org/standards-and-practices |title=Standards &amp; Practices &amp;#124; Association of Art Museum Directors |website=Aamd.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processes were established to allow families to claim their missing property; such claims have resulted in many works being restored to the heirs and descendants of the rightful owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lootedart.com/home |title=Welcome to |publisher=Lootedart.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Spoils of War cover.jpg|thumb|left|''The Spoils of War'' (1997), showing paintings stolen from the Russian palaces at Petrodvorets and Pushkin, abandoned in March 1945 in East Prussia by German soldiers fleeing the Red Army.]]

The conference proceedings were published in an award-winning volume edited by Elizabeth Simpson (Harry N. Abrams, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Elizabeth. ''The Spoils of War--World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property''. New York: [[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]] in association with the Bard Graduate Center, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes 17 treaties, conventions, and other official documents relating to the protection and return of cultural property. These begin with the "[[Lieber Code]]" of 1863 and the "[[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]]," and continue with the treaties following World War I, the "[[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention and Protocol of 1954]]" for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|1970 UNESCO Convention]]" on the prevention of illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects]] of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/instruments/cultural-property/1995-convention |title=Cultural Property - 1995 Convention - Unidroit - International Institute for the Unification of Private Law - Institut International pour l'Unification du droit privè |publisher=Unidroit |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Losses resulting from World War II==
Elizabeth Simpson and lawyer Jeanette Greenfield, author of ''The Return of Cultural Treasures'',&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Jeanette. ''The Return of Cultural Treasures.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; provided introductory comments on the subject, along with [[Lynn H. Nicholas|Lynn Nicholas]], author of ''The Rape of Europa'',&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Lynn. ''The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War''. New York: Vintage Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; who discussed the massive displacement of art and cultural property that occurred during World War II. Individual countries detailed the damage to their national patrimony, as well as losses suffered by individuals. A talk on Jewish ceremonial art and private property was given by Vivian Mann, then Chair of Judaica at [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|The Jewish Museum]], New York. These reports were followed by a series of contributions on laws, directives, and conventions in place at the beginning of World War II, directives in force in Germany during the war, and laws enacted by the Allies to counter German appropriations. These and all the conference presentations are published in the proceedings (see list of contributors below).

==The "Monuments Men"==
[[File:Capt Edith Standen at Central Collecting Point Wiesbaden 1946.jpg|thumb|Captain Edith Standen at the Wiesbaden Collecting Point, 1946.]]A group of the so-called [[Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art|"Monuments Men"]] (which in fact included several women) detailed their firsthand accounts of the work of the art-specialist officers of the Western Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monumentsmen.com |title=Official Site |publisher=The Monuments Men |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section]] of the [[Office of Military Government, United States]], recounted the discovery of [[looted art]] and stashed bullion in German mines, bunkers, castles, and churches, along with the redistribution and repatriation of these finds through the Munich and Wiesbaden Collecting Points. Of the veteran officers speaking the New York conference—James S. Plaut (d. 1996), [[Walter Farmer|Walter I. Farmer]] (d. 1997), [[Edith Standen|Edith A. Standen]] (d. 1998), [[Craig Hugh Smyth]] (d. 2006), [[S. Lane Faison]] (d. 2006), and Bernard Taper (d. 2016)—none survives today.

==Reappearance and recovery==
Other repatriations occurred at the end of the war, effected by the US State Department, the USSR, and other countries. Case studies include fascinating discussions of the [[Theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg|Quedlinburg Church Treasures]], the Soviet Secret Repositories,&lt;ref&gt;Akinsha, Konstantin, Grigorii Kozlov, and Sylvia Hochfield. ''Beautiful Loot: The Soviet Plunder of Europe's Art Treasures'', New York: Random House, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Treasure of Priam," which was excavated by Heinrich Schliemann at Troy in 1873, shipped out of Turkey illegally by Schliemann, ended up in Berlin, transferred to Moscow by the Soviet Trophy Brigades after the fall of Berlin, held in secret in the Pushkin Museum, and finally brought out of the secret repository and exhibited in the museum in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstikov, Vladimir, and Mikhail Treister. ''The Gold of Troy: Searching for Homer’s Fabled City''. Moscow and New York: Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, in association with Harry N. Abrams, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claims to ownership of the Trojan treasures by Turkey, Germany, and Greece, the objects remain in Moscow with the issue unresolved.[[File:Sophia Schliemann wearing Treasure A, Troy.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|left|Heinrich Schliemann's wife, Sophia, wearing gold jewelry from Treasure A, Troy, ca. 1873.]]

==Current issues and cooperative efforts==
The conference concluded with a series of presentations on current and proposed efforts to mitigate the losses suffered. Lyndel Prott, then Chief of the International Standards Section of the Cultural Heritage Division of [[UNESCO]], offered a list of "Principles for the Resolution of Disputes Concerning Cultural Heritage Displaced during the Second World War":

# Cultural objects that have been taken from territory occupied during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War by any belligerent will be returned to the country from which they have been taken.
#Where there have been successive displacements, the objects will be returned to the territory where they were located at the outbreak of hostilities in 1939.
#Principle 1 will apply whether  transfers of the cultural objects concerned have taken the form of open looting or plunder, or of transactions apparently legal in form, even when they purport to have been voluntarily effected.
#Cultural property taken from an occupied territory shall never be detained as war reparations.
#Where cultural objects displaced during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War have passed into the hands of third parties, the state that is responsible for their removal from the country where they were located in 1939 shall reacquire them for return to the state from which they were taken, by repurchase, indemnity or other appropriate means.
#No time limits can be set.
#Cultural objects being repatriated are to be accompanied by the relevant scientific documentation where available.
#Restitution by replacement is an available remedy where unique cultural objects have been destroyed.

==Press coverage and controversy==
The "Spoils of War" symposium was covered extensively in the international press, including articles carried by the [[Associated Press]] and in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''New York [[Newsday]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Die Zeit]]'', and ''[[Pravda]]''. The [[The Forward|''Jewish Forward'']] published a critique that appeared on the first day of the conference; at issue was whether or not the conference gave sufficient weight to Jewish wartime losses, since these losses were detailed within the greater context of the Second World War and the damages experienced by the peoples of the many nations involved.

[[File:Amber Room Catherine Palace Tsarskoye Selo pre-war photo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The original [[Amber Room]] in the [[Catherine Palace]], Pushkin (Tsarskoye Selo), Russia, in an early 20th century photograph before it was lost as a result of the Second World War.]]This issue sparked a second conference in Washington, DC, in 1998. Sponsored by the [[United States Department of State]] and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], the "Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/index.HTM |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; assembled participants from the New York symposium along with others to discuss Jewish losses in particular, including artworks, books, and archives, as well as insurance claims and other types of assets. This resulted in a further set of "[[Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art|Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rt/hlcst/122038.htm |title=Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art |publisher=State.gov |date=1998-12-03 |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined by organizer [[Stuart E. Eizenstat]], as well as "Declarations of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/decl.htm |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York conference has remained influential, however, due to its broader scope—dealing as it did with losses that occurred throughout Europe, inflicted not only by the Germans but also by the Soviets and western Allies, and affecting all those peoples who suffered as a result of the Second World War. The volume of conference proceedings was reviewed widely by publications in the United States and Europe, as well as ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', ''[[Yeni Yüzyıl]]'', [[Russian News Agency TASS|''ITAR-TASS'']], and others. As the only comprehensive treatment of the subject, it is cited frequently, considered one of the most important books on World War II and its aftermath—and the loss, reappearance, and recovery of cultural property relating to the war.

It aims "to call attention to the continued violence, discrimination and institutionalization of our people [Trans and Gender Non-Conforming people], while simultaneously lifting up and celebrating our legacy of resilience, organizing, and community building."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alp.org/decade-resistance-ten-year-anniversary-statement|title=A Decade of Resistance; Ten Year Anniversary Statement  {{!}} Audre Lorde Project|website=alp.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While addressing issues that disproportionately impact trans and gender non-conforming people, TDOA is also meant to honor and contribute to the broader "struggle for justice, liberation, and recognition for all oppressed people worldwide."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In its first year, TDOA drew over 1,000 participants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The 2016 event gathered 2,000 attendees in Washington Square, and included speakers such as Olympia Perez of the Audre Lorde Project, Jennifer Louise Lopez of Everything Transgender in NYC, and [[Jennicet Gutiérrez]] of Familia Trans Queer Liberation Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gaycitynews.nyc/trans-day-action-old-time-radical-feel/|title=Trans Day of Action With Old-Time Radical Feel|last=Humm|first=Andy|date=July 7, 2016|work=Gay City News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TDOA is supported by a range of organizations, including SALGA (South Asian Lesbian and Gay Association) and GLAAD (formerly the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=South Asian-Americans Join Gay Pride Parade In Great Numbers|last=Dutt|first=Ela|date=July 10, 2015|work=News India Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.glaad.org/blog/nyc-join-audre-lorde-project-11th-annual-trans-day-action-friday|title=NYC: Join the Audre Lorde Project at the 11th annual Trans Day of Action this Friday|last=|first=|date=2015-06-24|work=GLAAD|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The event is highly intersectional, as "TGNC communities include communities of color, immigrants, youth, elders, rural communities, and differently abled communities... as TGNC communities of color, we view our struggles as one and the same as broader struggles for social justice domestically and directly connected—if not the same as—struggles for social justice globally."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayashi|first=Kris|year=2008|title=Stepping Back, Looking Outward: Situating Transgender Activism and Transgender Studies|url=http://nsrc.sfsu.edu|journal=Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy|volume=5|pages=97|via=ProQuest|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205191708/http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/|archivedate=2012-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households because it seems to them to be a normal part of relationships.&lt;ref name="A&amp;R" /&gt;

Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, developing it into an intensity perhaps not matched in other relationships of the victim. It is claimed the longer a relationship continues, the more difficult it is for people to leave the abusers with whom they have bonded.&lt;ref name="A&amp;R" /&gt;

'''''Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don't Matter''''' is a 2017 nonfiction book by [[Scott Adams]], creator of [[Dilbert]], and bestselling author of ''[[How To Fail At Everything and Still Win Big]]''. The book presents Adams's theory that [[Donald Trump]]'s victory in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]] was due to Trump being a "master persuader" with a deep understanding of persuasion and the human mind.&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Scott|title=Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don't Matter|date=2018|publisher=Portfolio|isbn=9780735219717|language=en|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Adams publically predicted Trump's victory. Adams later cited his research into the field of [[Modes of persuasion|persuasion]] as the basis for his claim. He wrote ''Win Bigly'' to analyze Trump's tactics and offer guidance to improve readers' communication skills.&lt;ref name="Reason"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://reason.com/reasontv/2018/02/07/dilberts-scott-adams-explains-prediction |title=Dilbert's Scott Adams Explains How He Knew Trump Would 'Win Bigly' |last1=Gillespie |first1=Nick |last2=Keyser |first2=Ian |date=February 7, 2018 |website=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |publisher= |access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes people who, like Trump, are skilled at convincing listeners as "master persuaders".&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.floridatoday.com/story/money/business/2018/06/21/watson-wins-bigly-machines-learn-art-persuasion/36240703/ |title=Watson Wins Bigly: Machines learn the art of persuasion |last=Tilley |first=Scott |date=June 21, 2018 |website=[[Florida Today]] |access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posits that when debating an issue, facts are only important when they can impact at an emotional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.libertynation.com/jobs-not-mobs-more-than-just-a-slogan/ |title=Jobs Not Mobs – More than Just a Slogan |last=Charles |first=Jeff |date=October 28, 2018 |website=Liberty Nation |access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Florida Today]]'' described the subject matter as "something of great value in today’s media-saturated environment",&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt; and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' thought ''Win Bigly'' was "highly readable" and handled in a skillful and humorous manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7352-1971-7 |title=Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don’t Matter  |last= |first= |date= |website=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Politico]], however, found the book to be "an oxygen-free cubicle into which is piped a barking infomercial for the president".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is This the Worst Explanation for Why Trump Won?|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/31/donald-trump-election-dilbert-facts-persuasion-215766|website=POLITICO Magazine|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Win Bigly'' was a best-seller and brought increased attention to Adams' blog, which led ''[[Forbes]]'' to speculate that Adams was using the opportunity presented by Trump to protect his own career as the newspaper industry declines.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelschein/2018/06/20/dilbert-creator-scott-adams-is-evil-and-why-you-should-follow-his-lead/#447768fd30a7 |title=Dilbert Creator Scott Adams Is Evil (And Why You Should Follow His Lead) |last=Schein |first=Michael |date=June 20, 2018 |website=[[Forbes]] |access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
