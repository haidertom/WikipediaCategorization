&lt;/ref&gt; on affective haptics and real-time communication system with rich emotional and haptic channels. Driven by the motivation to enhance social interactivity and emotionally immersive experience of users of real-time messaging, virtual, augmented realities, the idea of reinforcing (intensifying) own feelings and reproducing (simulating) the emotions felt by the partner was proposed.
Four basic haptic (tactile) channels governing our emotions can be distinguished: (1) physiological changes (e.g., heart beat rate, body temperature, etc.), (2) physical stimulation (e.g., tickling), (3) social touch (e.g., hug, handshake), (4) emotional haptic design (e.g., shape of device, material, texture).

&lt;/ref&gt; the conscious experience of emotion occurs after the cortex receives signals about changes in physiological state. Researchers argued that feelings are preceded by certain physiological changes. Thus, when we see a venomous snake, we feel fear, because our cortex has received signals about our racing heart, knocking knees, etc. Damasio&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes primary and secondary emotions. Both involve changes in bodily states, but the secondary emotions are evoked by thoughts. Recent empirical studies support non-cognitive theories of nature of emotions. It was proven that we can easily evoke our emotions by something as simple as changing facial expression (e.g., smile brings on a feeling of happiness).&lt;ref&gt;

== Sense of touch in affective haptics ==

Human emotions can be easily evoked by different cues, and the sense of touch is one of the most emotionally charged channels. Affective haptic devices produce different senses of touch including kinesthetic and coetaneous channels. Kinesthetic stimulations, which are produced by forces exerted on the body, are sensed by mechanoreceptors in the tendons and muscles. On the other hand, mechanoreceptors in the skin layers are responsible for the perception of cutaneous stimulation. Different types of tactile corpuscles allow us sensing thermal property of the object, pressure, vibration frequency, and stimuli location.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; key feature is that it physically reproduces the human-hug pattern, generating pressure simultaneously on each user’s chest and back. The idea to realistically reproduce hugging is in integration of active-haptic device HaptiHug and pseudo-haptic touch simulated by hugging animation. Thus, high immersion into the physical contact of partners while hugging is achieved.

=== Intimate touch ===
Affection goes further than hugging alone. People in long distance relationships are faced with a lack of physical intimacy on a day-to-day basis. Haptic technology allows for kinesthetic and tactile interface design. The field of digital co-presence envelops Teledildonics as well. The Kiiroo SVir is a good example of an Adult CyberToy that incorporates tactile input, by means of a surface that is touch capacitive, and an inside that is kinesthetic in nature. 12 rings contract, pulse and vibrate according to the movements one's partner makes in real time. The SVir mimics the actual motion of its OPue counterpart and is also compatible with other SVir models.
The SVir enables women to have intercourse with their partner through use of the OPue interactive vibrator no matter how great the distance that separates the couple.

=== Implicit emotion elicitation ===
Different types of devices can be used to produce the physiological changes. Of the bodily organs, the heart plays a particularly important role in our emotional experience. The heart imitator HaptiHeart&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; produces special heartbeat patterns according to emotion to be conveyed or elicited (sadness is associated with slightly intense heartbeat, anger with quick and violent heartbeat, fear with intense heart rate). False heart beat feedback can be directly interpreted as a real heart beat, so it can change the emotional perception. HaptiButterfly&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; reproduces “butterflies in your stomach” (the fluttery or tickling feeling felt by people experiencing love) through arrays of vibration motors attached to the user’s abdomen. HaptiShiver&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; sends “shivers up and down your spine” through a row of vibration motors. HaptiTemper&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; sends “chills up and down your spine” through both cold airflow from a fan and the cold side of a Peltier element. HaptiTemper is also intended for simulation of warmth on the human skin to evoke either pleasant feeling or aggression

=== Explicit emotion elicitation ===
HaptiTickler&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; directly evokes joy by tickling the user’s ribs. It includes four vibration motors reproducing stimuli similar to human finger movements

=== Affective (emotional) haptic design. ===
Recent findings show that attractive things make people feel good, which in turn makes them think more creatively.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of emotional haptic design was proposed.&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; The core idea is to make user to feel an affinity for the device through:
* appealing shapes evoking the desire to touch and haptically explore them,
* material pleasurable to touch, and
* the anticipation of the pleasure of wearing the device.

=== Affective computing ===
[[Affective computing]] can be used to measure and to recognize emotional information in systems and devises employing affective haptics. Emotional information is extracted by using such techniques as speech recognition, natural language processing, facial expression detection, and measurement of physiological data.

== Potential applications ==
[[Image:iFeelIM.png|thumb|400px | The iFeel_IM! architecture]]
Possible applications are as follows:
* treating depression and anxiety (problematic emotional states),
* controlling and modulating moods on the basis of physiological signals,
* affective and collaborative games,
* psychological testing,
* assistive technology and augmentative communication systems for children with autism.
Affective Haptics is in the vanguard of emotional telepresence,&lt;ref&gt;

The philosophy behind the iFeel_IM! (intelligent system for Feeling enhancement powered by affect sensitive Instant Messenger) is “I feel [therefore] I am!”. In the iFeel_IM! system, great importance is placed on the automatic sensing of emotions conveyed through textual messages in 3D virtual world Second Life (artificial intelligence), the visualization of the detected emotions by avatars in virtual environment, enhancement of user’s affective state, and reproduction of feeling of social touch (e.g., hug) by means of haptic stimulation in a real world. The control of the conversation is implemented through the Second Life object called EmoHeart&lt;ref&gt;

'''Agni''' in [[Samskrita]] means "fire", and according to [[Ayurveda]] Agni happens to be the entity that is responsible for all digestive and metabolic processes in the human beings.

== Classification of Agni based on its location ==

Depending upon the stage of metabolism where a specific Agni is functionally active, Agni has been classified into three sub-classes: 'Jaṭharāgni', 'Bhūtāgni' and 'Dhātvagni'.

== Jaṭharāgni ==
While Jaṭharāgni acts on the food in the digestive tract and converts it into absorbable form, the Bhūtāgni acts after the digested material has been absorbed.

== Bhūtāgni ==
Bhūtāgni is of 5 types. Each of these 5 acts on the 5 primordial constituents of the absorbed food: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Space. These 5 Bhutagnis transform the substrates into such form that can be assimilated at tissue level.

== Dhātvagni ==
The third class of Agni, the Dhātvagni, acts at the level of tissue metabolism and is helpful in the tissue nourishment tissue metabolism. This is of 7 types based on the kind of tissue that it helps nourishing.

== Classification of Agni based on its strength ==

Further, Ayurveda recognizes four functional states of Agni: regular, irregular, intense, and weak.

== Samāgni == 
Samāgni ensures complete digestion of the food ingested at the proper time without any irregularity. Its activity is neither too intense nor too weak. It is just appropriate and therefore, is ideal too. This results when all Doshas, Vata-Pitta-Kapha are in a state of equilibrium.

== Vişamāgni ==
Vişamāgni represents an unpredictable state of Agni, which is due to the dominance of Vayu. It sometimes quickly digests the food and at other times it does so very slowly, representing unpredictability.

== Tīkşņāgni ==
Tīkşņāgni results because of the dominance of Pitta which is intense, and hence, it easily digests even a very heavy meal, in a very short span of time.

== Mandāgni ==
Mandāgni is opposite to the Tīkşņāgni: it is subdued in its activity. This Agni is unable to digest and metabolize even a small quantity of food. This state of Agni is a result of the dominance of Kapha.

'''Apophatic theology''', also known as '''negative theology''',{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} is a form of [[theology|theological]] thinking and religious practice which attempts to [[Problem of religious language|approach God]], the Divine, by [[negation]], to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is [[God]].{{r|Bunnin_Yu|group=web}} It forms a pair together with [[cataphatic theology]], which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations or positive statements about what God ''is''.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}

The apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of [[mysticism]], which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of [[Perception|ordinary perception]].{{sfn|Belzen|Geels|2003|p=84–87}}

==Etymology and definition==
"Apophatic", {{lang-grc|ἀπόφασις}} ([[adjective]]); from ἀπόφημι ''apophēmi'', meaning "to deny". From ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'': 
{{quote|apophatic (adj.) "involving a mention of something one feigns to deny; involving knowledge obtained by negation", 1850, from Latinized form of Greek ''apophatikos'', from apophasis "denial, negation", from apophanai "to speak off," from apo "off, away from" (see apo-) + phanai "to speak," related to pheme "voice," from PIE root *bha- (2) "to speak, tell, say."{{r|OED|group=web}}}}

''Via negativa'' or ''via negationis'' ([[Latin]]), "negative way" or "by way of denial".{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} The negative way forms a pair together with the ''[[kataphatic]]'' or positive way. According to Deirdre Carabine,
{{quote|Dionysius describes the kataphatic or affirmative way to the divine as the "way of speech": that we can come to some understanding of the Transcendent by attributing all the perfections of the created order to God as its source. In this sense, we can say "God is Love", "God is Beauty", "God is Good". The apophatic or negative way stresses God's absolute transcendence and unknowability in such a way that we cannot say anything about the divine essence because God is so totally beyond being. The dual concept of the immanence and transcendence of God can help us to understand the simultaneous truth of both "ways" to God: at the same time as God is immanent, God is also transcendent. At the same time as God is knowable, God is also unknowable. God cannot be thought of as one or the other only.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}}}

==Origins and development==
According to Fagenblat, "negative theology is as old as philosophy itself;" elements of it can be found in Plato's "unwritten doctrines," while it is also present in Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and early Christian writers. A tendency to apophatic thought can also be found in [[Philo of Alexandria]].{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}}

According to Carabine, "apophasis proper" in Greek thought starts with Neo-Platonism, with its speculations about the nature of the One, culminating in the works of Proclus.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} According to Carabine, there are two major points in the development of apophatic theology, namely the fusion of the Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy in the writings of Philo, and the works of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

The Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} and Meredith even states that Philo "is the real founder of the apophatic tradition."{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} Yet, it was with [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Maximus the Confessor]],{{sfn|Berthold|1985|p=9}} whose writings shaped both [[Hesychasm]], the contemplative tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the mystical traditions of western Europe, that apophatic theology became a central element of Christian theology and contemplative practice.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

==Greek philosophy==
{{See also|Epoché|Pyrrhonism|Skepticism}}

===Pre-Socratic===
For the ancient Greeks, knowledge of the gods was essential for proper worship.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} Poets had an important responsibility in this regard, and a central question was how knowledge of the Divine forms can be attained.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Epiphany (feeling)|Epiphany]] played an essential role in attaining this knowledge.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Xenophanes]] (c. 570 – c. 475 BC) noted that the knowledge of the Divine forms is restrained by the human imagination, and Greek philosophers realized that this knowledge can only be mediated through myth and visual representations, which are culture-dependent.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}

According to [[Herodotus]] (484–425 BCE), [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] (between 750 and 650 BC) taught the Greek the knowledge of the Divine bodies of the Gods.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=51}} The ancient Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) describes in his ''[[Theogony]]'' the birth of the gods and creation of the world,{{r|ellopsos|group=web}} which became an "ur-text for programmatic, first-person [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanic]] narratives in Greek literature,"{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}{{refn|group=note|Hesiod's ''Theogony'' was highly referred in the time of [[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), and Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' shows a profound familiarity with Hesiod's ''Theogony''.{{sfn|Boys-Stones|Haubold|2009|p=xiviii}} See also Timaeus e39-e41.{{r|ellopsos|group=web}}}} but also "explores the necessary limitations placed on human access to the divine."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} According to Platt, the statement of the Muses who grant Hesiod knowledge of the Gods "actually accords better with the logic of apophatic religious thought."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Richard G. Geldard: "[M]ore than any other pre-Socratic thinker, Heraclitus embodies the apophatic method. He "unsaid" the myths of the Archaic tradition on his way to transforming the ideas of divinity through the divine Logos. It was a transformation affirmed by Plotinus 800 years later."{{sfn|Geldard|2000|p=23}}}}

[[Parmenides]] (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem ''On Nature'', gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. "The way of conviction" explores Being, true reality ("what-is"), which is "What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109-111}} "The way of opinion" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. His distinction between unchanging Truth and shifting opinion is reflected in Plato's [[allegory of the Cave]]. Together with the Biblical story of Moses's ascent of Mount Sinai, it is used by Gregory of Nyssa and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to give a Christian account of the ascent of the soul toward God.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=111-112}} Cook notes that Parmenides poem is a religious account of a mystical journey, akin to the [[mystery cults]],{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109}} giving a philosophical form to a religious outlook.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}} Cook further notes that the philosopher's task is to "attempt through 'negative' thinking to tear themselves loose from all that frustrates their pursuit of wisdom."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}}

===Plato===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377]]
[[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), "deciding for Parmenides against [[Heraclitus]]" and his theory of eternal change,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} had a strong influence on the development of apophatic thought.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

Plato further explored Parmenides's idea of timeless truth in his dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', which is a treatment of the [[Theory of Forms|eternal forms]], ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'', which are the real aims for knowledge.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The Theory of Forms is Plato's answer to the problem "how one unchanging reality or essential{{clarify|date=July 2017}} being can admit of many changing phenomena (and not just by dismissing them as being mere illusion)."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

In ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato argues that the "real objects of knowledge are not the changing objects of the senses, but the immutable Forms,"{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} stating that the ''[[Form of the Good]]''{{refn|group=note|Identified by various commentators with the Form of Unity.{{explain|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}}} is the highest object of knowledge.{{sfn|Kahn|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|See ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' 508d–e, 511b, 516b)}} His argument culminates in the [[Allegory of the Cave]], in which he argues that humans are like prisoners in a cave, who can only see shadows of the Real, the ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} Humans are to be educated to search for knowledge, by turning away from their bodily desires toward higher contemplation, culminating in an intellectual{{refn|group=note|As opposed to mere rationality.}} understanding or apprehension of the Forms, c.q. the "first principles of all knowledge."{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}

According to Cook, the ''Theory of Forms'' has a theological flavour, and had a strong influence on the ideas of his Neo-Platonist interpreters Proclus and Plotinus.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The pursuit of ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'' became a central element in the apophatic tradition,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} but nevertheless, according to Carabine "Plato himself cannot be regarded as the founder of the negative way."{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21}} Carabine warns not to read later Neo-Platonic and Christian understandings into Plato, and notes that Plato did not identify his Forms with "one transcendent source," an identification which his later interpreters made.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21-22}}

===Middle Platonism===
{{Main|Middle Platonism}}

[[Middle Platonism]] (1st century BCE - 3rd century CE){{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} further investigated Plato's "Unwritten Doctrines," which drew on [[Pythagoras]]' first principles of the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] and the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|Dyad]] (matter).{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} Middle Platonism proposed a [[hierarchy of being]], with God as its first principle at its top, identifying it with Plato's ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} An influential proponent of Middle Platonism was [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]] (c.25 BCE–c. 50 CE), who employed Middle Platonic philosophy in his interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures, and asserted a strong influence on early Christianity.{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} According to Craig D. Allert, "Philo made a monumental contribution to the creation of a vocabulary for use in negative statements about God."{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}} For Philo, God is undescribable, and he uses terms which emphasize God's transcendence.{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}}

===Neo-Platonism===
{{Main|Neo-Platonism}}

Neo-Platonism was a mystical or contemplative form of Platonism, which "developed outside the mainstream of Academic Platonism."{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} It started with the writings of Plotinus (204/5–270), and ended with the closing of the Platonic Academy by Emperor Justinian in 529 CE, when the pagan traditions were ousted.{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} It is a product of Hellenistic syncretism, which developed due to the crossover between Greek thought and the Jewish scriptures, and also gave birth to [[Gnosticism]].{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} Proclus was the last head of the Platonic Academy; his student Pseudo-Dinosysius had a far-stretching Neo-Platonic influence on Christianity and Christian mysticism.{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}}

====Plotinus====
[[File:Plotinus.jpg|thumb|left|Plotinus]]
[[Plotinus]] (204/5–270) was the founder of Neo-Platonism.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} In the [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonic philosophy]] of Plotinus and Proclus, the first principle became even more elevated as a radical unity, which was presented as an unknowable Absolute.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' is the first principle, from which everything else emanates.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} He took it from Plato's writings, identifying the Good of the ''Republic'', as the cause of the other Forms, with ''the One'' of the first hypothesis of the second part of the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]''.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' precedes the [[Theory of Forms|Forms]],{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} and "is beyond Mind and indeed beyond Being."{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} From ''the One'' comes the [[Nous|Intellect]], which contains all the Forms.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} ''The One'' is the principle of Being, while the Forms are the principle of the essence of beings, and the intelligibility which can recognize them as such.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} Plotinus's third principle is Soul, the desire for objects external to the person. The highest satisfaction of desire is the contemplation of ''the One'',{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} which unites all existents "as a single, all-pervasive reality."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}}

''The One'' is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the "presence of the intellect in the human soul,"{{refn|group=note|Compare Korean Chon (Zen) master [[Jinul]]s "tracing back the radiance":&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''"Question: What is the mind of void and calm, numinous awareness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chinul: What has just asked me this question is precisely your mind of void and calm, numinous awareness. Why not trace back its radiance rather than search for it outside? For your benefit I will now point straight to your original mind so that you can awaken to it. Clear your minds and listen to my words."''{{r|Chinul|group=web}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also {{Citation | last =Buswell | first =Robert E. | year =1991 | title =Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen | publisher =University of Hawaii Press}}}} initiating an ascent of the soul by [[Abstraction#In philosophy|abstraction]] or "taking away," culminating in a [[Subitism|sudden appearance]] of ''the One''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=8}} In the ''[[Enneads]]'' Plotinus writes: 
{{quote|Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul [...] To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One.}}

Carabine notes that Plotinus' apophasis is not just a mental exercise, an acknowledgement of the unknowability of ''the One'', but a means to ''[[Ecstasy (philosophy)|extasis]]'' and an ascent to "the unapproachable light that is God."{{r|Carabine_interview|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho, investigating what are Plotinus' methods for reaching ''[[henosis]]'',{{refn|group=note|The Neoplatonic concept of ''henosis'' has precedents in the Greek [[mystery religions]]{{sfn|Angus|1975|p=52}} as well as parallels in [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Gregorios|2002}}}} concludes that "Plotinus' mystical teaching is made up of two practices only, namely philosophy and negative theology."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} According to Moore, Plotinus appeals to the "non-discursive, intuitive faculty of the soul," by "calling for a sort of prayer, an invocation of the deity, that will permit the soul to lift itself up to the unmediated, direct, and intimate contemplation of that which exceeds it (V.1.6)."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho further notes that "for Plotinus, mystical experience is irreducible to philosophical arguments."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} The argumentation about ''henosis'' is preceded by the actual experience of it, and can only be understood when ''henosis'' has been attained.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} Ho further notes that Plotinus's writings have a didactic flavour, aiming to "bring his own soul and ''the souls of others'' by way of [[Nous|Intellect]] to union with the One."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} As such, the ''Enneads'' as a spiritual or ascetic teaching device, akin to ''The Cloud of Unknowing'',{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20-21}} demonstrating the methods of philosophical and apophatic inquiry.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=26}} Ultimately, this leads to silence and the abandonment of all intellectual inquiry, leaving contemplation and unity.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=25-27}}

====Proclus====
[[Proclus]] (412-485) introduced the terminology which is being used in apophatic and cataphatic theology.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} He did this in the second book of his ''Platonic Theology'', arguing that Plato states that ''the One'' can be revealed "through analogy," and that "through negations [''dia ton apophaseon''] its transcendence over everything can be shown."{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} For Proclus, apophatic and cataphonic theology form a contemplatory pair, with the apophatic approach corresponding to the manifestation of the world from ''the One'', and cataphonic theology corresponding to the return to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} The analogies are affirmations which direct us toward ''the One'', while the negations underlie the confirmations, being closer to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} According to Luz, Proclus also attracted students from other faiths, including the Samaritan Marinus. Luz notes that "Marinus' Samaritan origins with its Abrahamic notion of a single [[Ineffability|ineffable]] [[Tetragrammaton|Name of God]] ({{Hebrew|יהוה}}) should also have been in many ways compatible with the school's ineffable and apophatic divine principle."{{sfn|Luz|2017|p=149}}
{{Christian mysticism}}

==Christianity==
===Apostolic Age===
The [[Book of Revelation]] 8:1 mentions "the silence of the perpetual choir in heaven." According to Dan Merkur,
{{quote|The silence of the perpetual choir in heaven had mystical connotations, because silence attends the disappearance of plurality during experiences of mystical oneness. The term "silence" also alludes to the "still small voice" ([[1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Kings|19:12|HE|}}) whose [[theophany|revelation]] to [[Elijah]] on [[Mount Horeb]] rejected visionary imagery by affirming a negative theology.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=331}}{{refn|group=note|According to Michel Masson, Elijah's theophany is an "apophatic revelation," a mystical experience which is akin to ''nirvana'' and Böhme's ''Ungrund''."

===Early Church Fathers===
The [[Early Church Fathers]] were influenced by [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]]{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} (c. 25 BCE – c. 50 CE), who saw [[Moses]] as "the model of human virtue and Sinai as the archetype of man's ascent into the "luminous darkness" of God."{{sfn|Woloschak|2016}} His interpretation of Moses was followed by Clement of Alexandria, [[Origen]], the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor.{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}}

God's appearance to Moses in the [[burning bush]] was often elaborated on by the Early Church Fathers,{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}} especially [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c. 335 – c. 395),{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}} realizing the fundamental unknowability of God;{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Mayes|2016|p=117]}} an exegesis which continued in the medieval mystical tradition.{{sfn|Glasscoe|1992|p=57]}} Their response is that, although God is unknowable, Jesus as person can be followed, since "following Christ is the human way of seeing God."{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=221}}

[[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150 – c. 215) was an early proponent of apophatic theology.{{sfn|Hägg|2006}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} According to R.A. Baker, in Clement's writings the term ''theoria'' develops further from a mere intellectual "seeing" toward a spirutal form of contemplation.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} Clement's apophatic theology or philosophy is closely related to this kind of ''theoria'' and the "mystic vision of the soul."{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} For Clement, God is transcendent and immanent.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=89}} According to Baker, Clement's apophaticism is mainly driven by Biblical texts, but by the Platonic tradition.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-92}} His conception of an ineffable God is a synthesis of Plato and Philo, as seen from a Biblical perspective.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92}} According to Osborne, it is a synthesis in a Biblical framework; according to Baker, while the Platonic tradition accounts for the negative approach, the Biblical tradition accounts for the positive approach.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-93}} ''Theoria'' and abstraction is the means to conceive of this ineffable God; it is preceded by dispassion.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=98-103}}

According to [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 – c. 240),
{{quote|[t]hat which is infinite is known only to itself.  This it is which gives some notion of God, while yet beyond all our conceptions{{spndash}}our very incapacity of fully grasping Him affords us the idea of what He really is.  He is presented to our minds in His transcendent greatness, as at once known and unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Apologeticus'', § 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saint [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (313-386), in his ''[[Catechesis|Catechetical]] [[Homily|Homilies]]'', states: 
{{quote|For we explain not what God is but candidly confess that we have not exact knowledge concerning Him.

[[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430) defined God ''aliud, aliud valde'', meaning "other, completely other", in ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' 7.10.16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Mark |editor-last=Vessey |title=A Companion to Augustine |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U8JIm4U05I4C |accessdate=3 July 2016 |year=2012 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]] |id={{ISBN|1-405-15946-4}}|isbn=978-1-405-15946-3 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=wkuVBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=%22aliud,+aliud+valde%22%22%287.10.16%29%22+Confessions+%22other,+completely+other%22 107]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite===
Apophatic theology found its most influential expression in the works of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (late 5th to early 6th century), a student of [[Proclus]] (412-485), combining a Christian worldview with Neo-Platonic ideas.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berthold |first1=George C. |title="Introduction" to Maximus the Confessor.

Dionysius the Areopagite was a pseudonym, taken from [[Acts of the Apostles]] chapter 17, in which [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] gives a [[Areopagus sermon|missionary speech to the court of the Areopagus]] in Athens.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} In {{bibleref2|Acts|17:23|KJV|verse 23}} Paul makes a reference to an altar-inscription, dedicated to the [[Unknown God]], "a safety measure honoring foreign gods still unknown to the Hellenistic world."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} For Paul, Jesus Christ is this unknown God, and as a result of Paul's speech Dionysius the Areopagite converts to Christianity.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}} Yet, according to Stang, for Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite Athens is also the place of Neo-Platonic wisdom, and the term "unknown God" is a reversal of Paul's preaching toward an integration of Christianity with Neo-Platonism, and the union with the "unknown God."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}}

According to Corrigan and Harrington, "Dionysius' central concern is how a triune God, ... who is utterly unknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond even goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of creation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of their source."{{sfn|Corrigan|Harrington|2014}} Drawing on Neo-Platonism, Pseudo-Dionysius described humans [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|ascend to divinity]] as a process of purgation, illumination and union.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}} Another Neo-Platonic influence was his description of the cosmos as a series of hierarchies, which overcome the distance between God and humans.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}}

===Eastern Orthodox Christianity===
{{Main|Eastern Orthodox Church}}

In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] apophatic theology is taught as superior to cataphatic theology. The fourth-century [[Cappadocian Fathers]]{{refn|group=note|[[Basil the Great]] (330–379), who was bishop of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]]; Basil's younger brother [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c.332–395), who was bishop of [[Nyssa (Cappadocia)|Nyssa]]; and a close friend, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (329–389), who became [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Commentary on Song of Songs; Letter on the Soul; Letter on Ascesis and the Monastic Life|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4168|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} stated a belief in the existence of God, but an existence unlike that of everything else: everything else that exists was created, but the Creator [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] this existence, is uncreated. The [[essence]] of God is completely unknowable; mankind can know God only through His [[Energies of God|energies]].&lt;ref name="McGinn"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGinn |first=Bernard |chapter=4.

[[John of Damascus]] (c.675/676–749) employed negative theology when he wrote that positive statements about God reveal "not the nature, but the things around the nature."

[[Maximus the Confessor]] (580-622) took over Pseudo-Dionysius' ideas, and had a strong influence on the theology and contemplative practices of the Eastern Orthodox Churches.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"/&gt; [[Gregory Palamas]] (1296–1359) formulated the definite theology of [[Hesychasm]], the Orthodox practices of [[contemplative prayer]] and [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], "deification."

Influential modern Eastern Orthodox theologians are [[Vladimir Lossky]], [[John Meyendorff]], [[John S. Romanides]] and [[Georges Florovsky]]. Lossky argues, based on his reading of Dionysius and Maximus Confessor, that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology which is a step along the way to the superior knowledge attained by negation.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressed in the idea that [[mysticism]] is the expression of dogmatic theology ''par excellence''.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lossky, outside of directly revealed knowledge through [[Scripture]] and [[Sacred Tradition]], such as the Trinitarian nature of God, God in His essence is beyond the limits of what human beings (or even [[angel]]s) can understand. He is [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] in essence (''[[ousia]]''). Further knowledge must be sought in a direct experience of God or His [[Energies of God|indestructible energies]] through ''[[Christian contemplation|theoria]]'' (vision of God).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Lossky|Lossky, Vladimir]] (1997), ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'', Crestwood, N.Y.: [[SVS Press]], p. 81, {{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lossky (1997), ''The Vision of God'', Crestwood, N.Y.: SVS Press, pp. 36–40, {{ISBN|0-913836-19-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle Papanikolaou, in Eastern Christianity, God is [[Immanence|immanent]] in his [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] or existences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle Papanikolaou|Papanikolaou, Aristotle]] (2006), ''Being With God: Trinity, Apophaticism, and Divine–Human Communion'' (1st Edition), Notre Dame, Indiana:[[University of Notre Dame Press]], p. 2, {{ISBN|978-0-268-03830-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Christianity===
Negative theology has a place in the Western Christian tradition as well. The 9th-century theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus Erigena]] wrote: 
{{quote|We do not know what God is. God Himself does not know what He is because He is not anything [i.e., "not any created thing"]. Literally God ''is not'', because He [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] [[being]].''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=Eriugena+%22We+do+not+know+what+God+is.+God+Himself+does+not+know+what+He+is+because+He+is+not+anything.+Literally+God+is+not%2C+because+He+transcends+being%22 Quote] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When he says "''He is not anything''" and "''God is not''", Scotus does not mean that there is no God, but that God cannot be said to exist in the way that creation exists, i.e. that God is uncreated. He is using apophatic language to emphasise that God is "other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Indick|first1=William|title=The Digital God.

Theologians like [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Saint John of the Cross]] (San Juan de la Cruz) exemplify some aspects of or tendencies towards the apophatic tradition in the West. The medieval work, ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' and Saint John's ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]'' are particularly well known. In 1215 apophatism became the official position of the [[Catholic Church]], which, on the basis of [[Religious text#Christianity|Scripture]] and [[Sacred tradition|church tradition]], during the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]] formulated the following [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]]:

According to Adrian Langdon,
{{quote|The distinction between univocal, equivocal, and analogous language and relations corresponds to the distinction between the ''via positiva'', via ''negativa'', and ''via eminentiae''.

According to ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', the ''Doctor Angelicus'' and the [[Scholasticism|scholastici]] declare [that] 
{{quote|God is not absolutely unknowable, and yet it is true that we cannot define Him adequately. But we can conceive and name Him in an "analogical way". The perfections manifested by creatures are in God, not merely nominally (''equivoce'') but really and positively, since He is their source. Yet, they are not in Him as they are in the creature, with a mere difference of degree, nor even with a mere specific or generic difference (''univoce''), for there is no common concept including the finite and the Infinite. They are really in Him in a supereminent manner (''eminenter'') which is wholly incommensurable with their mode of being in creatures. We can conceive and express these perfections only by an analogy; not by an analogy of proportion, for this analogy rests on a participation in a common concept, and, as already said, there is no element common to the finite and the Infinite; but by an analogy of proportionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia |last=Sauvage |first=George |year=1907 |inline=1 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01449a.htm|title=Analogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[C. S. Lewis]], in his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' (1947), advocates the use of negative theology when first thinking about God, in order to cleanse our minds of misconceptions. He goes on to say we must then refill our minds with the truth about God, untainted by mythology, bad [[analogies]] or false mind-pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brazier |first=P.

The mid-20th century Dutch philosopher [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], who is often associated with a neo-Calvinistic tradition, provides a philosophical foundation for understanding why we can never absolutely know God, and yet, paradoxically, truly know something of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friesen|first1=J. Glenn|title=The religious dialectic revisited|url=https://jgfriesen.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/revisited.pdf|website=jgfriesen.files|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dooyeweerd made a sharp distinction between theoretical and pre-theoretical attitudes of thought. Most of the discussion of knowledge of God presupposes theoretical knowledge, in which we reflect and try to define and discuss. Theoretical knowing, by its very nature, is never absolute, always depends on religious presuppositions, and cannot grasp either God or the law side. Pre-theoretical knowing, on the other hand, is intimate engagement, and exhibits a diverse range of aspects. Pre-theoretical intuition, on the other hand, can grasp at least the law side. Knowledge of God, as God wishes to reveal it, is pre-theoretical, immediate and intuitive, never theoretical in nature.&lt;ref name="VanDrunen"&gt;{{cite book |last=VanDrunen |first=David |title=Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms.

According to [[Deirdre Carabine]], negative theology has become a hot topic since the 1990s,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i, viii}} resulting from a broad effort in the 19 and 20th century to portray Plato as a mysticist, which revived the interest in Neoplatonism and negative theology.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i-ii}}

[[File:Maimonides-2.jpg|thumb|left|Maimonides]]

[[Maimonides]] (1135/1138-1204) was "the most influential medieval Jewish exponent of the ''via negativa''."{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} Maimonides, but also [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]], draw on [[Bahya ibn Paquda]],{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} who shows that our inability to describe God is related to the fact of His [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|absolute unity]]. God, as the entity which is "truly One" (האחד האמת), must be free of properties and is thus unlike anything else and [[Divine simplicity|indescribable]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} According to Rabbi Yosef Wineberg, Maimonides stated that "[God] is knowledge," and saw His Essence, Being and knowledge as completely one, "a perfect unity and not a composite at all."&lt;ref name="Wineberg"/&gt; Wineberg quotes Maimonides as stating
{{quote|This [form of unity] wherein G‑d’s knowledge and so on is one with G‑d Himself is beyond the capacity of the mouth to express, beyond the capacity of the ear to hear, and beyond the capacity of the heart of man to apprehend clearly.&lt;ref name="Wineberg"&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=7994 ''Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah Ch. 8]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' Maimonides stated:
{{quote|God's existence is absolute and it includes no composition and we comprehend only the fact that He exists, not His essence. Consequently it is a false assumption to hold that He has any positive [[Abstraction|attribute]] [...] still less has He accidents (מקרה), which could be described by an attribute. Hence it is clear that He has no positive attribute however, the negative attributes are necessary to direct the mind to the truths which we must believe [...] When we say of this being, that it exists, we mean that its non-existence is impossible; it is living &amp;mdash; it is not dead; [...] it is the first &amp;mdash; its existence is not due to any cause; it has power, wisdom, and will &amp;mdash; it is not feeble or ignorant; [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|He is One]] &amp;mdash; there are not more Gods than one [...] Every attribute predicated of God denotes either the quality of an action, or, when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself &amp;mdash; and not of His actions &amp;mdash; the [[negation]] of the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp.htm 1:58]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Fagenblat, it is only in the modern period that negative theology really gains importance in Jewish thought.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] (1903-1994) was a prominent modern exponent of Jewish negative theology.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=2}} According to Leibowitz, a person's faith is his commitment to obey God, meaning God's commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person’s image of God. This must be so because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God's understanding is not man's understanding, and thus all the questions asked of God are out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, "God, Man and Nietzsche: A Startling Dialogue between Judaism and Modern Philosophers" (New York: iUniverse, 2008), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian parallels==
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|Shankara]]
There are interesting parallels in Indian thought, which developed largely separate from Western thought. Early [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical]] works which have apophatic themes include the [[Mukhya Upanishads|Principal Upanishads]] (800 BCE to the start of common era) and the [[Brahma Sutras]] (from 450 BCE and 200 CE). An expression of negative theology is found in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], where Brahman is described as "[[neti neti]]" or "neither this, nor that".&lt;ref&gt;Tharaud, Barry. Emerson for the Twenty-First Century: Global Perspectives on an American Icon. Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp, 2010. p. 453. {{ISBN|978-0-87413-091-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further use of apophatic theology is found in the Brahma Sutras, which state:{{Quote|Whenever we deny something unreal, it is in reference to something real.&lt;ref&gt;Verse III.2.22, Brahma-Sutra, Translated by Swami Gambhirananda.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Buddhist philosophy]] has also strongly advocated the way of negation, beginning with the Buddha's own theory of [[anatta]] (not-[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]], not-self) which denies any truly existent and unchanging essence of a person. [[Madhyamaka]] is a Buddhist philosophical school founded by [[Nagarjuna]] (2nd-3rd century CE), which is based on a fourfold negation of all assertions and concepts and promotes the theory of emptiness ([[Śūnyatā|shunyata]]). Apophatic assertions are also an important feature of Mahayana sutras, especially the [[Prajnaparamita|prajñaparamita]] genre. These currents of negative theology are visible in all forms of Buddhism.

Apophatic movements in medieval [[Hindu philosophy]] are visible in the works of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] (8th century), a philosopher of [[Advaita Vedanta]] (non-dualism), and [[Bhartṛhari]] (5th century), a grammarian. While Shankara holds that the transcendent noumenon, [[Brahman]], is realized by the means of negation of every phenomenon including language, Bhartṛhari theorizes that language has both phenomenal and noumenal dimensions, the latter of which manifests Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward|Coward, Harold G.]] and Foshay, Toby. Derrida and Negative Theology. State University of New York, 1992. P. 21. {{ISBN|0-7914-0964-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Advaita, Brahman is defined as being [[Nirguna]] or without qualities. Anything imaginable or conceivable is not deemed to be the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;Renard, John.  Responses to One Hundred One Questions on Hinduism. Paulist Press, 1999. P. 75. {{ISBN|0-8091-3845-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taittiriya]] hymn speaks of Brahman as "one where the mind does not reach". Yet the Hindu scriptures often speak of Brahman's positive aspect. For instance, Brahman is often equated with bliss. These contradictory descriptions of Brahman are used to show that the attributes of Brahman are similar to ones experienced by mortals, but not the same. 

Negative theology also figures in the [[Buddhist]] and Hindu [[polemics]]. The arguments go something like this – Is Brahman an object of experience? If so, how do you convey this experience to others who have not had a similar experience? The only way possible is to relate this unique experience to common experiences while explicitly negating their sameness.

==Apophatic theology and atheism==
Even though the ''via negativa'' essentially rejects theological understanding in and of itself as a path to God, some have sought to make it into an intellectual exercise, by describing God only in terms of what God is not. One problem noted with this approach is that there seems to be no fixed basis on deciding what God is not, unless the Divine is understood as an abstract experience of full aliveness unique to each individual consciousness, and universally, the perfect goodness applicable to the whole field of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pondé|first1=Luiz Felipe|title=Crítica e profecia: a filosofia da religião em Dostoiévski |date=2003 |publisher=Editora 34 |location=São Paulo|pages=74–92|isbn=8573262842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apophatic theology is often accused of being a version of [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]], since it cannot say truly that God exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Kvanvig |editor-first=Jonathan |editor-link=Jonathan Kvanvig |year=2015 |chapter=7.

"Negative theology is a complement to, not the enemy of, positive theology".{{sfn|Bryson|2016|p=114}} Since religious experience—or consciousness of the holy or sacred, is not reducible to other kinds of human experience, an abstract understanding of religious experience cannot be used as evidence or proof that religious discourse or praxis can have no meaning or value.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lonergan|Lonergan, Bernard]] (1972), "Method in Theology", New York, N.Y.: Seabury Press, {{ISBN|0-8164-2204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In apophatic theology, the negation of theisms in the ''via negativa'' also requires the negation of their correlative atheisms if the dialectical method it employs is to maintain integrity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Buckley|Buckley, Michael J.]] (2004), "Denying and Disclosing God: The Ambiguous Progress of Modern Atheism", New Haven, C.T.: [[Yale University Press]], pp. 120ff, {{ISBN|0-30009384-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Ernest Drummond''' (born 29 April 1953) is a Scottish artist, musician, writer, and record producer. He was the co-founder of late 1980s avant-garde pop group [[The KLF]] and its 1990s media-manipulating successor, the [[K Foundation]], with which he [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid|famously burned £1 million]] in 1994. More recent art activities, carried out under Drummond's chosen banner of the Penkiln Burn, include making and distributing cakes, soup, flowers, beds and shoe-shines. More recent music projects include [[No Music Day]], and the international tour of a choir called The17. Drummond is the author of several books about art and music.

==Background==
William Ernest Drummond&lt;ref&gt;Drummond's full name is given in "Special K" by William Shaw, ''[[GQ]]'' magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Butterworth, South Africa|Butterworth]], South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed by Drummond's official website ([http://www.penkiln-burn.com/jobs/job44.html link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A music encyclopaedia once mistakenly printed that Drummond was born ''William Butterworth'' not ''in Butterworth''. This error has been reported, and Drummond's real name confirmed, by, for example, ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' (Edinburgh), 27 February 2000, p 22.&lt;/ref&gt; where his father was a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] for the [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Andrew Harrison |title=Bill Drummond: The Man Who Wants To End Recorded Music |url=http://www.wordmagazine.co.uk/content/bill-drummond-man-who-wants-end-recorded-music |work=[[The Word (magazine)|The Word]] |publisher=Development Hell Limited |date=13 June 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912154836/http://www.wordmagazine.co.uk/content/bill-drummond-man-who-wants-end-recorded-music |archivedate=12 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved back to Scotland when he was 18 months old, and his early years were spent in the town of [[Newton Stewart]]. He moved to [[Corby]], Northamptonshire at the age of 11. It was here that he first became involved in performing as a musician, initially working with school friends such as Gary Carson and Chris Ward.&lt;ref&gt;McKerron, I., "Duo Burn £1M In Midnight Madness", ''Daily Express'', 1 October 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=388 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[University of Northampton]] and the [[Art and Design Academy]] from 1970 to 1973. He later decided that "art should use everything, be everywhere" and that, as an artist, he would "use whatever medium is to hand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penkilnburn.com/about/biography_very_long.php |title=About |publisher=Penkiln Burn |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent two years working as a milkman, gardener, steel worker, nursing assistant, theatre carpenter, and scene painter.

==Career==

===1970s: ''Illuminatus'', Big in Japan, and Zoo===
In 1975 Drummond began working at the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool as a carpenter and scene painter. In 1976 he was the set designer for the first stage production of ''[[The Illuminatus Trilogy]]'', a 12-hour performance which opened on 23 November 1976, and which was staged by [[Ken Campbell (actor)|Ken Campbell]]'s "Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool".&lt;ref&gt;Drummond mentioned Campbell and the play in an interview by Ben Watkins, published by ''The Wire'' Magazine in March 1997 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=435]). Campbell spoke about his production in an interview given to James Nye, first published in ''Gneurosis'' 1991, available at [http://www.frogboy.freeuk.com/ken.html Frogweb: Ken Campbell] (URL accessed 2 March 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Logan, B., "Arts: Gastromancy and other animals: Ken Campbell has a new show at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] – but he'd rather tell Brian Logan about dogs that talk and sucking spirits up your bottom", ''The Guardian'' ([[Manchester]]), 29 August 2000, "Guardian Features Pages" section, p14.&lt;/ref&gt; This production then transferred to the National Theatre in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/7081/history-of-the-nt/denys-lasduns-national-theatre.html |title=Denys Lasdun's National Theatre|work= |publisher=National Theatre |quote=The National opened theatre-by-theatre, as the building became available. The Lyttelton opened first in March 1976, with a season of plays transferred from the Company's first home, the Old Vic. It was followed by the Olivier in October of that year with Tamburlaine The Great; the Cottesloe opened on 4 March 1977 with Illuminatus!, an eight-hour play by Ken Campbell. The Queen officially opened the National Theatre on 26 October 1976. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119061721/http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/7081/history-of-the-nt/denys-lasduns-national-theatre.html |archivedate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Campbell, Drummond became known as "the man who went for [[Araldite]]": "In the middle of a tour, Drummond announced he was popping out to get some glue – and never returned."&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Neil, "Yes, this is the cutting edge of rave music Forty striking dockers, one brass band, two former pop stars in wheelchairs and one baffled reporter. What's going on?", ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), The Arts p26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond's musical career began in 1977 with [[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]], a band whose membership also included future luminaries [[Holly Johnson]] ([[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]]), [[Budgie (drummer)|Budgie]] ([[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]), [[Jayne Casey]] ([[Pink Military]]/[[Pink Industry]]) and [[Ian Broudie]] ([[The Lightning Seeds]]).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Pattenden, M., "A Broudie guy", ''The Times'' (1FA Edition, London), 30 October 1999, p8.&lt;/ref&gt; After the band's demise, Drummond and another member [[David Balfe]] started [[Zoo Records]], their first release being Big in Japan's posthumous EP, ''[[From Y To Z and Never Again (Album)|From Y To Z and Never Again]]''. They went on to act as producers of the debut albums by [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen]] and [[The Teardrop Explodes]], both of which Drummond would later manage somewhat idiosyncratically. With Zoo Music Ltd, Drummond and Balfe were also music publishers for Zodiac Mindwarp &amp; The Love Reaction and The Proclaimers. The production team of Drummond and Balfe was christened The Chameleons, who recorded the single "Touch" together with singer Lori Lartey as [[Lori and the Chameleons]].&lt;ref name="tatetat"&gt;"Tate tat and arty", ''New Musical Express'', 20 November 1993, ''passim'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=359 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s: A&amp;R man &amp; solo recording artist===
Drummond later took a job in the mainstream music business as an [[A&amp;R]] consultant for the label [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] working with [[Strawberry Switchblade]] and [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]]. In July 1986, on his 33 and a third birthday, Drummond repented his corporate involvement and resigned his job by way of a "ringingly quixotic press release": "I will be 33.5 (sic) years old in September, a time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, and I want to see the world from the top..."&lt;ref&gt;Drummond's 1986 press release, quoted by Shaw in ''[[GQ]]'' magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; (In an interview in December 1990, Drummond recalled spending half a million pounds at WEA on the band [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]]&amp;nbsp;– for whom he envisioned massive worldwide success&amp;nbsp;– only for them to completely flop. "At that point I thought 'What am I doing this for?' and I got out.")&lt;ref name="skinner"&gt;Bill Drummond interviewed by [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] on ''Saturday Sequence'', [[BBC Radio 1]], December 1990 ([http://www.brandnew.co.uk/klf/billdrummond/Bill%20Drummond%20Interview_Radio1%20Dec90.mp3 MP3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524180959/http://www.brandnew.co.uk/klf/billdrummond/Bill%20Drummond%20Interview_Radio1%20Dec90.mp3 |date=24 May 2006 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond was "obviously very sharp," said WEA chairman [[Rob Dickens]], "and he knew the business. But he was too radical to be happy inside a corporate structure. He was better off working as an outsider."&lt;ref name="trash"&gt;Sharkey, A., "Trash Art &amp; Kreation", ''The Guardian'', 21 May 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=384 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the year, Drummond issued a solo album, ''[[The Man (Bill Drummond album)|The Man]]'', a country/folk music recording, backed by Australian rock group [[The Triffids]]. The album was released on Creation Records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Bill-Drummond-The-Man/release/2329417 |title=Bill Drummond – The Man (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included the sardonic "[[Julian Cope]] Is Dead", where he outlined his fantasy of shooting the Teardrop Explodes frontman in the head to ensure the band's early demise and subsequent legendary status. The song has commonly been seen as a reply to the Cope song "Bill Drummond Said".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bar-none.com/bios/drumbio.html |title=Bill Drummond |publisher=Bar-none.com |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206211828/http://www.bar-none.com/bios/drumbio.html |archivedate=6 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Graham Johnston |url=http://www.beefheart.com/zine/001/45rm.htm |title=Clicks and Klangs – Bill Drummond – 45 |publisher=Beefheart.com |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207155057/http://www.beefheart.com/zine/001/45rm.htm |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a B-side, Drummond wrote and recorded "The Manager" in which he lamented the state of the music industry and offered his services to help fix it.

''The Man'' received positive reviews – including 4 stars from ''[[Q Magazine]]'';&lt;ref&gt;du Noyer, P. (1986), "''The Man''" review, ''[[Q Magazine]]'', December (?) 1986 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=483 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; and 5 from ''Sounds'' Magazine who called the album a "touching if idiosyncratic biographical statement".&lt;ref name="sounds-man"&gt;Wilkinson, R., "''The Man'' review", ''Sounds'', 8 November 1986 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=15 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond intended to focus on writing books once ''The Man'' had been issued but, as he recalled in 1990, "That only lasted three months, until I had an[other] idea for a record and got dragged back into it all".&lt;ref name="skinner"/&gt;

===1987–1992: The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, The Timelords and The KLF===
{{Main|The KLF}}
While out walking on [[New Years Day]] 1987, Drummond formulated a plan to make a hip-hop record. However, "I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself", he said. "...although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, I thought, I knew [[Jimmy Cauty|Jimmy [Cauty]]], I knew he was a like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said 'Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu'. And he knew exactly, to coin a phrase, 'where I was coming from'".&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 1]] "Story Of Pop" documentary interview with Bill Drummond. First [[BBC]] broadcast believed to have been in  late 1994, and was transmitted by Australian national broadcaster [[Citadel Media|ABC]] on [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/pop/default.htm 1 January 2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010218093054/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/pop/default.htm |date=18 February 2001 }}. Transcript taken from the [http://www.klf.de/faq/index.php?cate_id=1 KLF FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719201237/http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/STORY%2BOF%2BPOP |date=19 July 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond and Cauty (who Drummond had signed to [[Food Records|Food]]/[[Warner Music Group|WEA]] as a member of Brilliant) released their first single, [[The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]]'s "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]", in March 1987. This was followed by an album – ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)]]'' – in June of the same year, and a high-profile copyright dispute with [[ABBA]] and the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]].&lt;ref name=sweden87&gt;"Thank You For The Music", ''New Musical Express'', 17 October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; A second album  – ''[[Who Killed The JAMs?]]'', also the last album under the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs) name, was released in February 1988.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Later in 1988, Drummond and Cauty released a 'novelty' pop single, "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" as The Timelords. The song reached number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 12 June, and charted highly in Australia and New Zealand. On the back of this success, the duo self-published a book, ''[[The Manual|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]''.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In late 1988, the duo was renamed [[The KLF]] and released their first singles under this moniker, "[[Burn the Bastards]]" and "[[Burn the Beat]]" (both taken from the JAMs' last album). (From late 1987, Drummond and Cauty's independent record label had been named "[[KLF Communications]]".) As The KLF, Drummond and Cauty would amass fame and fortune. "[[What Time Is Love?]]" – a signature song which they would revisit and revitalise several times in the coming years – saw its first release in July 1988, and its success spawned an album, ''[[The "What Time Is Love?" Story]]'', in September 1989.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

''[[Chill Out]]'', an [[ambient house]] album which had its roots in Cauty's chill-out sessions with [[The Orb]]'s [[Alex Paterson]], was released in February 1990. Described by ''[[The Times]]'' as "The KLF's comedown classic",&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Paddy, "And you thought they were dead", ''The Times'' (London) ISSN 0140-0460 , 4 May 2001, Features p2.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chill Out'' was named the fifth best dance album of all time in a 1996 ''[[Mixmag]]'' feature.&lt;ref&gt;Philips, D., "50 Greatest Dance Albums: # 5", ''[[Mixmag]]'', March 1996 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=478 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The KLF's commercial success peaked in 1991, with ''[[The White Room]]'' album and the accompanying "Stadium House" singles, remixes of 1988's "What Time Is Love?", 1989's "[[3&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eternal]]", 1990's "[[Last Train to Trancentral]]"; and "[[Justified and Ancient]]", a new song based on a sample from ''1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)''{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In 1992, The KLF were awarded the "Best British group" [[BRIT Awards|BRIT Award]]. With grindcore group [[Extreme Noise Terror]], The KLF performed a live "violently antagonistic performance" of "[[3&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eternal]]" at the BRIT Awards ceremony in front of "a stunned music-business audience".&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, N., "The Arts: My name is Bill, and I'm a popaholic", ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), 2 March 2000, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later in the evening Drummond and Cauty dumped a dead sheep with the message "I died for you —bon appetit {{sic}}" tied around its waist at the entrance to one of the post-ceremony parties.&lt;ref name="sheep-seats"&gt;Kelly, D. "Welcome To The Sheep Seats", ''New Musical Express'', 29 February 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=297 link])&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[NME]]'' listed this appearance at number 4 in their "top 100 rock moments",&lt;ref&gt;[http://microsites.nme.com/rock100/site/4.html "100 Rock Moments"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060417214917/http://microsites.nme.com/rock100/site/4.html |date=17 April 2006 }}, NME.com. Retrieved 21 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2003, ''The Observer'' named it the fifth greatest "publicity stunt" in the history of popular music.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, B. "The 10 greatest publicity stunts", ''The Observer'', 27 September 2003 ([http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/the10/story/0,11109,1043955,00.html link])&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 1992, The KLF announced their immediate retirement from the music industry and the [[Deletion (music industry)|deletion]] of their ''entire'' back catalogue, an act which associate [[Scott Piering]] described as "[throwing] away a fortune".&lt;ref name="select92"&gt;"Who Killed The KLF?", ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', July 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=315 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; 

As when he left WEA, Drummond issued an enigmatic press release, this time talking of a "wild and wounded, glum and glorious, shit but shining path" he and Cauty had been following "...these past five years. The last two of which has {{sic}} led us up onto the commercial high ground—we are at a point where the path is about to take a sharp turn from these sunny uplands down into a netherworld of we know not what."&lt;ref&gt;KLF Communications advertisement in ''New Musical Express'', 16 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Timelords gentlemen, please!", ''New Musical Express'', 16 May 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=309 link])&lt;/ref&gt; There have been numerous suggestions that in 1992 Drummond was at the edge of a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name="select92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, W., "Special K", ''[[GQ]]'' Magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vox (magazine)|''Vox'' Magazine]] wrote, for example, that 1992 was "the year of Bill's 'breakdown', when The KLF, perched on the peak of greater-than-ever success, quit the music business, ... [and] machine gunned the tuxedo'd twats in the front row of that year's BRIT Awards ceremony."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, G., "The Chronicled Mutineers", ''Vox'', December 1996 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=430 link])&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond himself said that he was on the edge of the "abyss".&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, Bill and Mark Manning, ''Bad Wisdom'' ({{ISBN|0-14-026118-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===1993–1997: K Foundation, burning one million pounds, and other activities with Jimmy Cauty===

Despite The KLF's retirement from the music business, Drummond's involvement with Jimmy Cauty was far from over. In 1993, the pair regrouped as the [[K Foundation]], ostensibly a foundation for the arts. They established the [[K Foundation art award]] for the "''worst'' artist of the year". The award, worth £40,000, was presented to [[Rachel Whiteread]] on 23 November 1993 outside London's [[Tate Gallery]]. Ms Whiteread had just accepted the £20,000 1993 [[Turner Prize]] award for best British [[Contemporary art]]ist inside the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Ellison, M.

Infamy followed when, on 23 August 1994, the K Foundation burnt what remained of The KLF's earnings – one million [[pounds sterling]] – at a [[boathouse]] on the [[Scottish island]] of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]].&lt;ref name="burning"&gt;"Burning Question", ''The Observer'', 13 February 2000 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=486 link])&lt;/ref&gt; A film of the event – ''[[Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid]]'' – was taken on tour, with Drummond and Cauty discussing the incineration with members of the public after each screening. In 2004 Drummond admitted to the BBC that he now regretted burning the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McKevitt |first=Greg |title=What Drummond did next |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=30 April 2004 |accessdate=18 August 2013 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/3667901.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; "It's a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier.

On 4 September 1995 the duo recorded "[[The Magnificent (song)|The Magnificent]]" for ''[[The Help Album]]''. In 1997, Drummond and Cauty briefly re-emerged as 2K and K2 Plant Hire Ltd. with various plans to "[[Fuck the Millennium]]". K2 Plant Hire's published aim was to "build a massive pyramid containing one brick for every person born in the UK during the 20th century"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fortean Times]]'', referencing ''[[The Big Issue]]'', 15–21 Sept and ''The Guardian'', 5 Nov 1997.

=== Art activities and the Penkiln Burn ===
Drummond studied painting at Liverpool School of Art from 1972 to 1973. Following that, he decided that instead of limiting his practice to paint and canvas, as an artist he would use any medium that came to hand. He has said that much of his work since  – including the pop-music, book-writing, and The17 choir – has been done as art.&lt;ref&gt;See interview [[Apollo Magazine]], Belgium March 2010. Or questions 77 to 80, Q&amp;A [http://www.penkilnburn.com penkilnburn.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998, Drummond's art activities have been carried out using the brand-name of the Penkiln Burn. This is the name of the river in Scotland upon the banks of which he played and fished as a boy.

In 1995, Drummond bought ''A Smell of Sulphur in the Wind'' by [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], for $20,000. In Drummond’s own words, he ‘fell in love with Richard Long’s work because’ "it was art by walking and doing things on his walks."&lt;ref&gt;page ii How To Be An Artist 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, Drummond felt that he was no longer "getting his money's worth" from the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;see page 27 $20,000 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  He decided to try to sell it by placing a series of placards around the country. When this failed to result in its sale, in 2001 he cut the photograph and mounting card into 20,000 pieces to sell for $1 each. His plan, upon retrieving the $20,000 in cash, is to walk with it to the remote place in Iceland where Richard Long had made the photograph and bury it in a box beneath the stone circle. He will then take his own photograph of the site, bring it home, frame it, hang it in the same place in his bedroom where the Richard Long hung, and call the new work ''The Smell of Money Underground''. Drummond's books ''How to be an Artist'' and a later soft-bound edition titled ''$20,000'' recounts this story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.q-arts.co.uk/parsetemplate.asp?id=109 Q ARTS | How to be an Artist] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050511125444/http://www.q-arts.co.uk/parsetemplate.asp?id=109 |date=11 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, Bill, ''Job 5'', [http://www.penkiln-burn.com/jobs/job5elements.html Penkiln Burn]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Drummond was involved in a controversial exhibition at the deconsecrated [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Liverpool]]. Drummond contributed a guestbook which asked visitors "Is God a Cunt?".&lt;ref&gt;"Artistic or offensive?", ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'', 20 September 2002, p1.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reported that the artwork had been stolen and a £1000 reward offered for its return.&lt;ref&gt;"Art stolen from church", ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'', 1 October 2002, 1st edition p9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Self|Self, W.]], "God is in the details", ''[[The Independent]]'' (London) ISSN 0951-9467 , 14 October 2002, Features p14.&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond himself said that he would answer "no" to his own question: "God is responsible for all the things I love, the speckles on a [[brown trout]]; the sound of [[Angus Young]]'s guitar, the nape of my girlfriend's neck, the song of the [[blackcap]] when he returns in Spring. I never blame God for all the shit, for the baby [[Rwanda]]n slaughtered in a casual [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]], the ever-present wars, drudgery and misery that fills most of our lives."&lt;ref&gt;"Artwork that uses [[obscene language]] is stolen from Merseyside church", ''[[The Independent]]'' (London) ISSN 0951-9467 , 1 October 2002, News p5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Penkiln Burn projects involve making things and then distributing them. Drummond has created a Soup Line drawn across a map going through Belfast and Nottingham to the edges of the British Isles. Anyone living on the Soup Line may contact Drummond to come to their house and make soup for them, their family and friends. Drummond has also constructed – and encourages others to construct – Cake Circles drawn on maps. Cakes are then made and delivered to people who live within the circle with the words "I have baked you a cake, here it is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penkilnburn.com/poster.php?poster=73.jpg&amp;painting=09 |title=Penkiln Burn |publisher=Penkiln Burn |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other projects involve Drummond building beds from timber in public places which are then raffled off. In 2011, for the Venice Biennale, Drummond took up shoe-shining on the streets of Venice. Each spring, Drummond gives away 40 bunches of daffodils to strangers on the street in different cities.&lt;ref&gt;Penkiln Burn jobs are detailed at www.penkilnburn.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond's web-based projects include MyDeath.net, where people can plan their own funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Heaney, Mick, "Bill Drummond once burnt Pounds 1m for art's sake. Now he is taking a soupopera to Belfast", ''[[Sunday Times]]'' (London), 18 April 2004, p18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--, and...--&gt;  Another site, youwhores.com, was meant for anyone to advertise any kind of service at their own set price. Due to misuse though, youwhores.com has become archival only. Still open for contributions is Drummond's website www.openmanifesto.com which "exists to define what art is and art is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openmanifesto.com/notice.php?lang=english |title=The Open Manifesto |publisher=The Open Manifesto |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Open Manifesto site invites definitions of art in 100 words or less.

Drummond was a Director of The Foundry, an arts centre in [[Shoreditch]], London which closed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundry.tv/ |title=The Foundry |publisher=Foundry.tv |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also owner of The Curfew Tower in [[Cushendall]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="BelfastNews"&gt;"Perfect tower for artistic retreat", Arts Diary, ''[[The Belfast News Letter]]'', 26 April 1999, p27&lt;/ref&gt; Via an arts trust called In You We Trust, the Curfew Tower acts as an artists' residency.&lt;ref name="BelfastNews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, Bill, ''Welcome To The Turnly Prize'', [http://www.penkiln-burn.com/jobs/job43_elements/30.html Penkiln Burn], June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992 onwards: Music===
&lt;!--Kalevala needs a mention.--&gt;

With Jimmy Cauty, Bill Drummond announced his retirement from pop-music with a dramatic performance involving deactivated machine guns, a dead sheep and a grindcore version of the KLF hit 3am Eternal at the [[Brit Awards#The KLF (1992)|1992 BRIT Awards]]. His involvement in the music industry more widely has been minimal since his final collaboration with Jimmy Cauty as 2K in 1997.

In 1998, the Scottish Football Association invited Drummond to write and record a theme song for the Scotland national football team's 1998 FIFA World Cup campaign.&lt;ref&gt;"KLF kick off their bid for France 98", ''The Sun'' (London), 30 January 1998, p29.&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond decided against doing it (Del Amitri got the job) but he wondered if he had twisted fate by declining, because the other major football songs of that year were made by associates of his: Keith Allen ("Vindaloo") and Ian Broudie ("Three Lions"), two men he had met on the same day when working on ''Illuminatus!'' in 1976, and former protege Ian McCulloch.

In 2000, Drummond released ''[[45 (book)|45]]'', a book consisting of a "series of loosely related [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] forming the rambling diary of one year."&lt;ref&gt;Maunsell, J.B., ''The Times'' (London), 26 February 2000, p22.&lt;/ref&gt; ''45'' also explored Drummond's KLF legacy, and was well received by the press.&lt;ref&gt;For reviews see [[45 (book)#Reviews]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====No Music Day====
{{Main|No Music Day}}
In 2005, Drummond announced an annual No Music Day on 21 November. The 22 November is Saint Cecilia day – the Patron Saint of Music – so No Music Day represents a fast before the feast.&lt;ref&gt;16 November 2009, Financial Times, A Day for Savouring the Sound of Silence&lt;/ref&gt;  No Music Day was held between 2005 and 2010. In this time, [[BBC Radio Scotland]] observed it by broadcasting no music, including jingles, for 24 hours. Radio Resonance FM also acknowledged it. In 2009 the entire city of Linz, Austria observed No Music Day with the backing of the city mayor; music was not played on local radio stations or in shops, and the cinemas only showed films without music soundtracks. No Music Day is documented at www.nomusicday.com

==== The17 ====
Drummond's most recent music project is a [[choir]] called [[The17]]. His first formal performance of The17 was staged with 16 other men in a studio in Leicester in 2004. It followed thoughts about music that Drummond had been having for many years. With the advent of recorded music via the internet, iPods and MP3 players etc. Drummond proclaims that "all recorded music has run its course."&lt;ref&gt;Penkiln Burn Poster 59&lt;/ref&gt;  The17 creates music that follows no musical history, or necessarily has words, melodies or rhythms. It may be made up of many human voices or none. Performances may only be recorded and played back once and then deleted. The17 can be made up of as many people who want to be a part of it at the time of a performance; they are all then lifetime members.

The17 now has several thousand members who have carried out performances on Drummond's Coast-to-Coast tour across the UK, and a World Tour which has included Jerusalem, Beijing, Port-au-Prince and Gothenburg. The17 is the subject of the 2008 book ''17'' published by Beautiful Books.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3558135/Review-17-by-Bill-Drummond.html |title=Review: 17 by Bill Drummond – Telegraph |publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Performances, scores, tours and Drummond's related graffiti are documented on a website: the17.org.

A performance of The17's SURROUND, originally planned to take place in Damascus, Syria, will take place in London on 18 March 2012. Drummond explains in his essay for Treuchet Magazine: 'it would best for all concerned if the Syrian leg of the tri-nation festival was postponed for a few weeks or maybe months, when things would have undoubtedly settled down'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/index.php/site/article/bill_drummond_presents_surround_damascus_in_london/ Bill Drummond Presents: SURROUND: Damascus in London, Trebuchet-Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317081231/http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/index.php/site/article/bill_drummond_presents_surround_damascus_in_london/ |date=17 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 2013, the day before his 60th birthday, Drummond took part in what has been billed as the last performance of The17. A seventeen-hour version of Score 1: IMAGINE was performed while standing on a manhole cover at the bottom of Mathew Street in Liverpool.

=== The 25 Paintings World Tour: 2014–2025 ===
In February 2014, Drummond announced plans for a world tour, beginning under Spaghetti Junction in Birmingham on 13 March 2014 and ending at the same place on the 28 April 2025. Taking in twelve cities in twelve different countries, each leg of the tour will last three months, during which he will produce 25 Paintings whilst working on other art projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Beaumont-Thomas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/feb/14/bill-drummond-world-tour-2025 |title=Bill Drummond announces world tour that will last until 2025 &amp;#124; Culture |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews, accolades and criticism==
In 1993, ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' magazine published a list of the 100 Coolest People in Pop. Drummond was number one on the list. "What has this giant of coolness not achieved?", they asked: "Like the Monolith in [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]], Drummond has always been a step ahead of human evolution, guiding us on. Manager of The Teardrop Explodes, co-inventor of ambient and trance house, number one pop star, situationist pagan, folk troubadour, pan-dimensional zenarchist gentleman of leisure...and then, ladies and gentlemen, he THROWS IT ALL AWAY, machine-guns the audience and dumps a dead sheep on the doorstep of the Brit Awards and vanishes to build dry-stone walls. His new 'band' The K Foundation make records but say they won't release them at all until world peace is established. Deranged, inspired, intensely cool."&lt;ref&gt;"Cool like what?", ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', September 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=343 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1993, an ''NME'' piece about the [[K Foundation]] found much to praise in Drummond's career, from [[Zoo Records]] through to the [[K Foundation art award]]: "Bill Drummond's career is like no other... there's been cynicism... and there's been care (no one who didn't love pop music could have made a record so commercial and so [[Pet Shop Boys]]-lovely as '[[Kylie Said to Jason]]', or the madly wonderful '[[Last Train to Trancentral]]', or the [[Tammy Wynette]] version of '[[Justified and Ancient]]'). There's been mysticism... But most of all there's been a belief that, both in music and life, there's something more."&lt;ref name="tatetat"/&gt;

[[Charles Shaar Murray]] wrote in ''[[The Independent]]'' that "[Bill] Drummond is many things, and one of those things is a magician. Many of his schemes... involve symbolically-weighted acts conducted away from the public gaze and documented only by Drummond himself and his participating comrades. Nevertheless, they are intended to have an effect on a worldful of people unaware that the act in question has taken place. That is magical thinking. Art is magic, and so is pop. Bill Drummond is a cultural magician..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Shaar Murray|Murray, C.S.]], ''The Independent'' (London), 26 February 2000, p10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, NME readers voted "the KLF's Art Terrorism" at the Brit Awards in 1992 at number 4 in the "top 100 Rock moments of all time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/kurt-cobain/6010 |title=NME.COM'S TOP 100 ROCK MOMENTS OF ALL TIME &amp;#124; News |publisher=Nme.

''[[Trouser Press]]'' has referred to Drummond as a "high-concept joker";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=klf |title=The KLF |publisher=Trouserpress.com |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s ''The Sun'' has called him a "madcap Scots genius".&lt;ref&gt;Blackstock, R., "Are you top of the pop class on no1s?", ''The Sun'' (London), 13 January 2005, Features section p50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julian Cope]] said in 2000, "I have no relationship with this guy. He burned a million pounds which was not all his, and some of it was mine.

==Football==
Bill Drummond is a fan of Scottish football club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] which he says is due to their proximity to his home town of Newton Stewart. "[[Queen of the South (song)|Queen of the South]]" is also the title of the 6th track on his 1986 album ''[[The Man (Bill Drummond album)|The Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=632 |title=Bill Drummond interview for the official Queen of the South website |publisher=Qosfc.com |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6390">A '''Braitenberg vehicle''' is a concept conceived in a [[thought experiment]] by the [[Italy|Italian]]-[[Austria]]n [[cybernetics|cyberneticist]] [[Valentino Braitenberg]]. The book models the animal world in a minimalistic and constructive way, from simple reactive behaviours (like [[phototaxis]]) through the simplest vehicles, to the formation of concepts, spatial behaviour, and generation of ideas.

For the simplest vehicles, the motion of the vehicle is directly controlled by some sensors (for example photo cells). Yet the resulting behaviour may appear complex or even intelligent.

== Mechanism ==
[[Image:Braitenberg Vehicle 2ab.png|thumbnail|Vehicles 2a, 2b]]

A Braitenberg vehicle is an agent that can autonomously move around based on its sensor inputs. It has primitive [[sensors]] that measure some stimulus at a point, and wheels (each driven by its own motor) that function as [[actuators]] or effectors. In the simplest configuration, a sensor is directly connected to an effector, so that a sensed signal immediately produces a movement of the wheel.

Depending on how sensors and wheels are connected, the vehicle exhibits different behaviors (which can be goal-oriented). This means that, depending on the sensor-motor wiring, it appears to strive to achieve certain situations and to avoid others, changing course when the situation changes.&lt;ref name="braitenberg84vehicles"&gt;Braitenberg, V. (1984). Vehicles: Experiments in synthetic psychology. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. {{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype%3D2%26tid%3D3323 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129022037/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=3323 |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connections between sensors and actuators for the simplest vehicles (2 and 3) can be [[ipsilateral]] or [[contralateral]], and excitatory or inhibitory, producing four combinations with different behaviours named fear, aggression, liking, and love. These correspond to biological positive and negative taxes&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, G. S., and Gunn,D.L. (1961). "The orientation of animals. Kineses, taxes and compass reactions". Dover Publications&lt;/ref&gt; present in many animals species.

== Examples ==

The following examples are some of Braitenberg's simplest vehicles.

===Vehicle 1 - Getting Around===
The first vehicle has one sensor (e.g. a temperature detector) that directly stimulates its single wheel in a directly proportional way. The vehicle moves ideally in one dimension only and can stand still or move forward at varying speed depending on the sensed temperature. When forces like asymmetric friction come into play, the vehicle could deviate from its straight line motion in unpredictable ways akin to Brownian motion.

This behavior might be understood by a human observer as a creature that is 'alive' like an insect and 'restless', never stopping in its movement. The low velocity in regions of low temperature might be interpreted as a preference for cold areas.&lt;ref name="braitenberg84vehicles"/&gt;

===Vehicle 2a=== 
A slightly more complex agent has two (left and right) symmetric sensors (e.g. light detectors) each stimulating a wheel on the same side of the body. This vehicle represents a model of negative animal [[Taxis|tropotaxis]]. It obeys the following rule:
* More light right → right wheel turns faster → turns towards the left, away from the light.
This is more efficient as a behavior to escape from the light source, since the creature can move in different directions, and tends to orient towards the direction from which least light comes.

In another variation, the connections are negative or inhibitory: more light → slower movement. In this case, the agents move away from the dark and towards the light.

===Vehicle 2b=== 
The agent has the same two (left and right) symmetric sensors (e.g. light detectors), but each one stimulating a wheel on the other side of the body. It obeys the following rule:
* More light left → right wheel turns faster → turns towards the left, closer to the light.
As a result, the robot follows the light; it moves to be closer to the light.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Braitenberg Vehicle 4a.png|thumbnail|Complex behavior]]
In a complex environment with several sources of stimulus, Braitenberg vehicles will exhibit complex and dynamic behavior.

Depending on the connections between sensors and actuators, a Braitenberg vehicle might move close to a source, but not touch it, run away very fast, or describe circles or figures-of-eight around a point.

This behavior is undoubtedly goal-directed, flexible and adaptive, and might even appear to be intelligent, the way some minimal intelligence is attributed to a cockroach. Yet, the functioning of the agent is purely mechanical, without any [[information processing]] or other apparently [[cognition|cognitive]] processes.

Often, [[BEAM robotics]] implements these sorts of behaviors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9071">The '''camel's nose''' is a [[metaphor]] for a situation where the permitting of a small, seemingly innocuous act will open the door for larger, clearly undesirable actions.

== History ==
According to [[Geoffrey Nunberg]], the image entered the English language in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Nunberg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nunberg|first1=Geoffrey|title=Going Nucular: Language, Politics, and Culture in Confrontational Times|date=2009|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9780786738649|page=118|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Doxh1e87V-UC|accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early example is a [[fable]] printed in 1858 in which an [[Arab]] [[miller]] allows a camel to stick its nose into his bedroom, then other parts of its body, until the camel is entirely inside and refuses to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Anonymous | title = The Child's Companion and Juvenile Instructor | year = 1858 | chapter = Sin is a Bad Master | publisher = The Religious Tract Society | page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lydia Sigourney]] wrote another version, a widely reprinted poem for children, in which the camel enters a shop because the workman does not forbid it at any stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sigourney|first1=Lydia Howard|title=Gleanings|date=1860|publisher=Brown &amp; Gross|location=Hartford|isbn=9781425523282|pages=58–59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nlQxe8xckw0C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1858 example above says, "The Arabs repeat a fable", and Sigourney says in a footnote, "To illustrate the danger of the first approach of evil habit, the Arabs have a proverb, 'Beware of the camel's nose.'" However, Nunberg could not find an Arab source for the saying and suspected it was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] invention.&lt;ref name=Nunberg/&gt;

An early citation with a tent is "The camel in the Arabian tale begged and received permission to insert his nose into the desert tent."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', April 21, 1875&lt;/ref&gt; By 1878, the expression was familiar enough that part of the story could be left unstated. "It is the humble petition of the camel, who only asks that he may put his nose into the traveler's tent. It is so pitiful, so modest, that we must needs relent and grant it."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', March 14, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1909 essay by John B. West, founder of the West legal classification system, used the metaphor to describe the difficulty of trying to insert an otherwise innocuous set of facts into a rigid legal system:
&lt;blockquote&gt;three excellent digesters [] spent an entire day in disagreeing as to whether seal fishery cases should be classified under the topic 'Fish' or that of 'Game' .... It is the old story of the camel's head in the tent. What seems at first a plausible pretext for forcing some novel case or new principle into a topic or subdivision to which it does not naturally belong, leads to hopeless confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=West|first1=John|title=Multiplicity of Reports|url=http://www.hyperlaw.com//90-99-docs/1909-multiplicity_of_reports_jbwest.html|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1915 book of fables by [[Horace Scudder]], the story titled ''The Arab and His Camel'' ends with the [[moral]]: "It is a wise rule to resist ''the beginnings of evil''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=scudder&amp;book=fables&amp;story=arab |title=The Baldwin Project: The Book of Fables and Folk Stories by Horace E. Scudder |publisher=Mainlesson.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]] used the metaphor in expressing his opposition to the [[National Defense Education Act]] in 1958:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=John T.|title=Academic Science, Higher Education, and the Federal Government, 1950-1983|date=1983|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226900520|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oti9Yo4AVUAC&amp;ots=tq55qGY97c&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This bill and the foregoing remarks of the majority remind me of an old Arabian proverb: "If the camel once gets his nose in the tent, his body will soon follow." If adopted, the legislation will mark the inception of aid, supervision, and ultimately control of education in this country by the federal authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pierce|first1=Patrick A.|last2=Miller|first2=Donald E.|title=Gambling Politics: State Gambling Politics: State Government and the Business of Betting|date=2004|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=Boulder, CO|isbn=9781588262684|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcaTLPJ05X0C|accessdate=15 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase was used in ''Reed v. King'' (193 CA Rptr. 130 - 1983):{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} "The paramount argument against an affirmative conclusion is it permits the camel's nose of unrestrained irrationality admission to the tent. If such an 'irrational' consideration is permitted as a basis of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] the stability of all conveyances will be seriously undermined." The case in question involved a plaintiff suing because the defendant sold a house without telling them that the house's previous inhabitants had been brutally murdered 10 years earlier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4420">'''Covert conditioning''' is an approach to mental health treatment that uses the principles of [[applied behavior analysis]], or [[cognitive-behavior therapy|cognitive-behavior therapies]] (CBTs) to assist people in making improvements in their behavior or inner experience. The method relies on the person's capacity to use [[image]]ry for purposes such as mental rehearsal. In some populations, it has been found that an imaginary reward can be as effective as a real one.&lt;ref name="Cautela, 1986"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cautela |first=Joseph R. |last2=Kearney |first2=Albert J. |year=1986 |title=The Covert Conditioning Handbook |location=New York |publisher=Springer |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective covert conditioning is said to rely upon careful application of behavioral treatment principles such as a thorough behavioral analysis.

Some clinicians include the mind's ability to spontaneously generate imagery that can provide intuitive solutions or even reprocessing that improves people's typical reactions to situations or inner material. However, this goes beyond the behavioristic principles on which covert conditioning is based.&lt;ref name="Cautela, 1986" /&gt;

Therapies and self-help methods have aspects of covert conditioning. This can be seen in focusing, some [[neuro-linguistic programming]] methods such as future pacing, and various visualization or imaginal processes used in [[behavior therapy|behavior therapies]], such as CBTs or [[clinical behavior analysis]].

Covert conditioning does not have a solid base of research.&lt;ref name="Cautela, 1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cautela |first=Joseph R. |last2=Kearney |first2=Albert J. |year=1993 |title=Covert Conditioning Casebook |location=Pacific Grove, Calif. |publisher=Brooks/Cole |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapeutic interventions==
"[[Systematic desensitization]]" associates an aversive [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] with a behavior the client wishes to reduce or eliminate. This is done by imagining the target behavior followed by imagining an aversive consequence. "Covert extinction" attempts to reduce a behavior by imagining the target behavior while imagining that the reinforcer does not occur. "Covert response cost" attempts to reduce a behavior by associating the loss of a reinforcer with the target behavior that is to be decreased.

"Contact desensitization" is intended to increase a behavior by imagining a reinforcing experience in connection with [[mental model|modeling]] the correct behavior. "Covert [[negative reinforcement]]" attempts to increase a behavior by connecting the termination of an aversive stimulus with increased production of a target behavior.

"[[Dialectical behavior therapy]]" (DBT) and "[[Acceptance and commitment therapy]]" (ACT) uses positive reinforcement and covert conditioning through [[mindfulness]]. Although the therapies are quite similar in theory and practice, DBT is based on the cognitive psychology philosophy that thoughts and feelings are explanations of motor behavior, whereas ACT&amp;mdash;rooted in behavior analysis&amp;mdash;views thinking and feelings as more behavior to be explained.

==Effectiveness==
Previous research in the early 1990s has shown covert conditioning to be effective with sex offenders as part of a [[behavior modification]] treatment package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marshall |first=W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15053">'''Design for the Environment''' (DfE) is a design approach to reduce the overall human health and environmental impact of a product, process or service, where impacts are considered across its life cycle. Different software tools have been developed to assist designers in finding optimized products or processes/services. DfE is also the original name of a [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) program, created in 1992, that works to prevent pollution, and the risk pollution presents to humans and the environment. The program provides information regarding safer [[Chemical substance|chemical formulations]] for cleaning and other products.&lt;ref name=DfE&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice |title=Safer Choice |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC |date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA renamed its program [[EPA Safer Choice|"Safer Choice"]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="EPA-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/history-safer-choice-and-design-environment |title=History of Safer Choice and Design for the Environment |date=2017-04-19 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Updated Fig.1 Pie.png|thumb|Each piece of the pie chart depicts the role that the individual processes play in the overall design and production of a product.  In recent years the environment has begun to play an important role in this diagram. If any piece is missing, production may not be able to occur. This figure was adopted from Conrad Luttropp and Jessica Lagerstedt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luttropp|first=Conrad|author2=Jessica Lagerstedt|title=EcoDesign and The Ten Golden Rules: generic advice for merging environmental aspects into product development|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Initial guidelines for a DfE approach were written in 1990 by [[East Meets West (non-governmental organization)|East Meets West]], a New York-based non-governmental organization. It became a global movement targeting design initiatives and incorporating environmental motives to improve product design in order to minimize health and environmental impacts by incorporating it from design stage all the way to the manufacturing process. The DfE strategy aims to improve technology and design tactics to expand the scope of products. By incorporating [[eco-efficiency]] into design tactics, DfE takes into consideration the entire life-cycle of the product, while still making products usable but minimizing resource use. The key focus of DfE is to minimize the [[Environmental economics|environmental-economic]] cost to consumers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luttropp|first=Conrad|author2=Jessica Lagerstedt|title=Design and The Ten Golden Rules: generic advice for merging environmental aspects into product development|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=11 November 2011|volume=14|pages=1396–1408|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2005.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; while still focusing on the life-cycle framework of the product. By balancing both customer needs as well as environmental and social impacts DfE aims to "improve the product use experience both for consumers and producers, while minimally impacting the environment".

==Design for Environment practices==
[[File:Designforenvironment fig1.png|thumb|Resource consumption and mitigation strategies for product production which minimizes environmental and health impacts.This figure has been adapted from Spangenberg et al.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spangenberg|first=Joachim H. |author2=Alastair Fuad- Luke |author3=Karen Blincoe|title=Design for Sustainability (DfS): the interface of sustainable production and consumption|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=16 June 2010|volume=18|pages=1485–1493|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.06.002}}&lt;!--|accessdate=April 10, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Four main concepts that fall under the DfE umbrella.&lt;ref name="DfE"/&gt;

* '''Design for environmental processing and manufacturing''': This ensures that raw material [[Resource extraction|extraction]] (mining, drilling, etc.), processing (processing reusable materials, metal melting, etc.) and [[manufacturing]] are done using materials and processes which are not dangerous to the environment or the employees working on said processes. This includes the minimization of waste and hazardous by-products, air pollution, energy expenditure and other factors.
* '''Design for environmental packaging''': This ensures that the materials used in [[packaging]] are environmentally friendly, which can be achieved through the reuse of shipping products, elimination of unnecessary paper and packaging products, efficient use of materials and space, use of [[Recycling|recycled]] and/or recyclable materials.
* '''Design for disposal or reuse''': The [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] of a product is very important, because some products emit dangerous chemicals into the air, ground and water after they are disposed of in a landfill. Planning for the [[reuse]] or [[Remanufacturing|refurbishing]] of a product will change the types of materials that would be used, how they could later be disassembled and reused, and the environmental impacts such materials have.
* '''Design for energy efficiency''': The design of products to reduce overall energy consumption throughout the product's life.

[[Life cycle assessment]] (LCA) is employed to forecast the impacts of different (production) alternatives of the product in question, thus being able to choose the most [[environmentally friendly]]. A life cycle analysis can serve as a tool when determining the environmental impact of a product or process. Proper LCAs can help a designer compare several different products according to several categories, such as [[energy]] use, [[toxicity]], acidification, [[Carbon dioxide|CO2 emissions]], [[ozone depletion]], [[resource depletion]] and many others. By comparing different products, designers can make decisions about which environmental hazard to focus on in order to make the product more environmentally friendly.

==Why do firms want to design for the environment?==
Modern day businesses all aim to produce goods at a low cost while maintaining quality, staying competitive in the global marketplace, and meeting consumer preferences for more environment friendly products. To help businesses meet these challenges, EPA encourages businesses to incorporate environmental considerations into the design process. The benefits of incorporating DfE include: cost savings, reduced business and environmental risks, expanded business and market opportunities, and to meet environmental regulations.&lt;ref name="EPA brochure 2001"&gt;{{cite report |date=March 2001 |title=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Design for the Environment Program |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000132E.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 744-F-00-020.

==How does a business design for the environment?==
A business can design for the environment by:
* Evaluating the human health and environmental impacts of its processes and products. 
* Identifying what information is needed to make human health and environment decisions
* Conducting an assessment of alternatives
* Considering cross-media impacts and the benefits of substituting chemicals
* Reducing the use and release of toxic chemicals through the innovation of cleaner technologies that use safer chemicals.
* Implementing pollution prevention, energy efficiency, and other resource conservation measures. 
* Making products that can be reused and recycled
* Monitoring the environmental impacts and costs associated with each product or process
* Recognizing that although change can be rapid, in many cases a cycle of evaluation and continuous improvement is needed.&lt;ref name=DfE /&gt;

==Safer Choice labeling program==
EPA's DfE labeling program was renamed [[EPA Safer Choice|"Safer Choice"]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="EPA-history"/&gt;

==Current U.S. laws and regulations encouraging DfE in the electronics industry==
===National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)===
EPA promulgated the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) to establish basic air pollution control requirements across the U.S. The NAAQS sets standards on six main sources of pollutants, which include emissions of: [[ozone]] (0.12 ppm per 1 hour), [[carbon monoxide]] (35 ppm per 1 hour; primary standard), [[particulate matter]] (50g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), [[sulfur dioxide]] (80g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), [[nitrogen dioxide]] (100g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), and [[lead]] emissions (1.5g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NAAQS Table |url=https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table |website=Criteria Air Pollutants |publisher=EPA |date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stratospheric ozone protection===
[[Stratospheric ozone]] protection is required by section 602 of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1990. This regulation aims to decrease emission of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) and other chemicals that are destroying the stratospheric ozone layer. The protection initiative categorizes ozone-depleting substances into two classes: Class I, and Class II.&lt;ref name="Clean Air Act Requirements"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ozone Protection under Title VI of the Clean Air Act |url=https://www.epa.gov/ozone-layer-protection/ozone-protection-under-title-vi-clean-air-act |publisher=EPA |date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Class I substances include 20 different kinds of chemicals and have all been phased-out of production processes since 2000. Class II substances consist of 33 different hydro-chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). The EPA has already begun plans to decrease emissions in HCFCs and plan to completely phase out the class II substances by 2030.&lt;ref name="Clean Air Act Requirements"/&gt;

===Reporting requirements for releases of toxic substances===
A firm operating in the electronics industry in [[Standard Industrial Classification]] (SIC) Codes 20-39 that has more than 10 full-time employees and consumes more than 10,000&amp;nbsp;lbs per year of any toxic chemical lists in 40 CFR 372.65 must file a toxic release inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superfund and Community Right-to-Know Requirements|url=http://www.epa.gov/dfe/pubs/pwb/tech_rep/fedregs/regsectd.htm#D4|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{buddhism}}
The '''''dharmakāya''''' ([[Sanskrit]], "truth body" or "reality body", {{bo|w=chos sku, rdzogs sku}}) is one of the three bodies (''[[trikaya]]'') of a [[buddhahood|buddha]] in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism. The ''dharmakāya'' constitutes the unmanifested, "inconceivable" (''acintya'') aspect of a buddha out of which buddhas arise and to which they return after their dissolution. Buddhas are manifestations of the ''dharmakāya'' called the ''[[nirmāṇakāya]]'', "transformation body". Reginald Ray writes of it as "the body of reality itself, without specific, delimited form, wherein the Buddha is identified with the spiritually charged nature of everything that is."&lt;ref name="Reginald Ray 2001, p. 13"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ray|first=Reginald|authorlink=Reginald Ray|title=Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQMLAAAAYAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-57062-772-9|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dhammakaya Movement|Dhammakaya tradition]] of Thailand and the ''[[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]'' of the ancient Indian tradition view the ''dharmakāya'' as the ''[[ātman (Buddhism)|ātman]]'' (true self) of the Buddha present within all beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thrangu Rinpoche|authorlink=Thrangu Rinpoche|title=Pointing Out the Dharmakaya: Teachings on the Ninth Karmapa's Text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fi5w-wNj0D8C|year=2003|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-55939-857-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tibetan etymology ==
In Tibetan, the term ''chos sku''&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/chos_sku] (accessed: January 15, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; glosses ''dharmakāya''; it is composed of ''chos'' "religion, [[dharma]]" and ''sku'' "body, form, image, bodily form, figure".&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/sku] (accessed: January 15, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Thondup &amp; Talbott render it as the "ultimate body".&lt;ref name="Thondup, Tulku 1996, p.48"&gt;Thondup, Tulku &amp; Harold Talbott (Editor)(1996, 2002).

Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Shambhala, South Asia Editions. {{ISBN|1-57062-113-6}} (alk. paper); {{ISBN|1-56957-134-1}}. p.48&lt;/ref&gt; In a key scholarly collaborative, [[Nyingma]] translation work published in 2005, furthermore notable as the first complete rendering of the ''[[Bardo Thodol]]'' into the English language from the Tibetan, this technical term was configured into English as "Buddha-body of Reality".&lt;ref name="Padmasambhava 2006 p.452"&gt;Padmasambhava (composed), Karma Linga (revealed), Gyurme Dorje (translated), Graham Coleman (Editor) and Thupten Jinpa (Associate) (2006).

The Yungdrung [[Bon]] term for ''dharmakāya'' is ''rdzogs sku'', where ''rdzogs'' means "perfection".

== Origins and development ==

=== Pali Canon ===
{{religious text primary|section|date=November 2017}}
In the [[Pāli Canon]], [[Gautama Buddha]] tells Vasettha that the [[Tathāgata]] (the Buddha) is ''Dhammakaya'', the "Truth-body" or the "Embodiment of Truth", as well as ''Dharmabhuta'', "Truth-become", that is, "One who has become Truth."
{{quote|He whose faith in the Tathagata is settled, rooted, established, solid, unshakeable by any ascetic or Brahmin, any deva or mara or Brahma or anyone in the world, can truly say: 'I am a true son of Blessed Lord (Bhagavan), born of his mouth, born of Dhamma, created by Dhamma, an heir of Dhamma.' Why is that? Because, Vasettha, this designates the Tathagata: 'The Body of Dhamma,' that is, 'The Body of Brahma,' or 'Become Dhamma,' that is, 'Become Brahma.'" &lt;ref name="Maurce Walshe 1995 p.409"&gt;Digha Nikaya III.84, Maurice Walshe, The Long Discourses of the Buddha, (Boston, MA: Wisdom Publications, 1995) 409&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the Buddha's life great veneration was shown to him. A mythology developed concerning the physical characteristics of Universal Buddhas.

After the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana]]'' a distinction was made between the Buddha’s physical body or ''rūpakaya'' and his ''dharmakaya'' aspect. As the Buddha told Vakkali, he was a living example of the "Truth" of the ''Dharma''. Without that form to relate to, the Buddha's followers could only relate to the ''dharmakaya'' aspect of him.

In SN 6.2 – Garava sutta. Buddha paid homage to the ''Dhamma'' and tell, that he will respect it.

=== Trikaya doctrine ===
{{Main|Trikaya}}
The ''Trikaya doctrine'' (Sanskrit, literally "three bodies" or "three personalities") is a Buddhist teaching both on the nature of reality, and the appearances of a Buddha.

The ''dharmakaya''-doctrine was possibly first expounded in the ''[[Prajnaparamita#Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā]]'', composed in the 1st century BCE.

Around 300 CE, the [[Yogacara]] school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the ''Trikaya'' "three-body" doctrine. According to this doctrine, [[Buddhahood]] has three aspects:{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=126}}
# The ''Nirmāṇakāya'', "Transformation body"
# The ''[[Sambhogakāya]]'', "Enjoyment-body"
# The ''Dharmakāya'', "Dharma-body"

=== Qualities ===
Tulku Thondup states that ''dharmakaya'' must possess three great qualities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thondup|first1=Tulku|title=Masters of meditation and miracles : the Longchen Nyingthig lineage of Tibetan Buddhism|date=1996|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=978-1-57062-113-0|page=50|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Great purity'' ({{bo|w=spang pa chen po}}, "the great abandonment"&lt;ref name=nitartha&gt;{{cite web|title=dictionary|url=http://www.nitartha.org/dictionary_search04.html|publisher=Nitartha|accessdate=25 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224040319/http://www.nitartha.org/dictionary_search04.html|archivedate=24 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;),
# ''Great realization'' ({{bo|w=rtogs pa chen po}}),
# ''Great mind'' ({{bo|w=sems pa chen po}}).

== Interpretation in Buddhist traditions ==
{{See also|Anatta}}

=== Mahāsāṃghika ===
According to Guang Xing, two main aspects of the Buddha can be seen in [[Mahāsāṃghika]] teachings: the true Buddha who is omniscient and omnipotent, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through skillful means.&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; For the Mahāsaṃghikas, the historical Gautama Buddha was one of these transformation bodies (Skt. ''nirmāṇakāya''), while the essential real Buddha is equated with the ''dharmakāya''.&lt;ref&gt;Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sarvāstivāda ===
[[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādins]] viewed the Buddha's physical body (Skt. ''rūpakāya'') as being impure and improper for taking refuge in, and they instead regarded taking refuge in the Buddha as taking refuge in the dharmakāya of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 49"&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in the ''[[Mahavibhasa|Mahāvibhāṣā]]'':&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 49" /&gt;
{{quote|Some people say that to take refuge in the Buddha is to take refuge in the body of the Tathāgata, which comprises head, neck, stomach, back, hands and feet. It is explained that the body, born of father and mother, is composed of defiled ''dharmas'', and therefore is not a source of refuge. The refuge is the Buddha's fully accomplished qualities (''aśaikṣadharmāḥ'') which comprise ''bodhi'' and the ''dharmakāya.''}}

=== Theravada ===
In the [[Pali Canon]] of [[Theravada]] Buddhism, the ''Dhammakāya'' (''dharmakāya'') is explained as a figurative term, meaning the "body" or the sum of the Buddha's teachings.&lt;ref name="Endo1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Buddha in Theravada Buddhism: A Study of the Concept of Buddha In the Pali Commentaries | url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/toshiichi_endo_buddha_in_theravada_buddhism_a_study_of_the_concept_of_buddha_in_the_pali_commentaries__2002.pdf|publisher=[[Buddhist Cultural Centre]] | author=Toschiichi, Endo | year=2002 | location=Nedimala | pages=108–10 | isbn=978-955-96292-0-7 | edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=376–7}}{{sfn|Dutt|1929|p=523}} The Canon does not invest the term ''dhammakāya'' with a metaphysical or unrealistic connotation.&lt;ref name="Endo1" /&gt;{{sfn|Dutt|1929|p=521-523}} Jantrasrisalai disagrees though, arguing that the term originally was more connected with the process of enlightenment than the way it later came to be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/4130/1/01ch-jantrasrisalai-2008-thesis.pdf|title=Early Buddhist Dhammakaya: Its Philosophical and Soteriological Significance| type=PhD thesis|last=Jantrasrisalai|first=Chanida|publisher=Department of Studies in Religion, [[University of Sydney]]|year=2008|isbn=|location=Sydney|pages=288|quote=In all references to dhammakāya in early Buddhist usage, it is apparent that dhammakāya is linked always with the process of enlightenment in one way or another. Its relation with the Buddhist noble ones of all types is evident in the early Buddhist texts. That is to say, dhammakāya is not exclusive to the Buddha. It appears also that the term’s usage in the sense of teaching is a later schema rather than being the early Buddhist common notions as generally understood.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[atthakatha|atthakathā]]''s (commentaries on the [[Buddhist texts]]), the interpretation of the word depends on the author. Though both [[Buddhaghoṣa]] and [[Dhammapala|Dhammapāla]] describe ''dhammakāya'' as the nine supramundane states (''navalokuttaradhamma''), their interpretations differ in other aspects. Buddhaghoṣa always follows the canonical interpretation, referring to the ''teaching'' of the ''lokuttaradhamma''s, but Dhammapāla interprets ''dhammakāya'' as the ''spiritual attainments'' of the Buddha.{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=376–80}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Steven|title=Reflections on the Dichotomy Rūpakāya/Dhammakāya|journal=Contemporary Buddhism|date=15 July 2014|volume=15|issue=2|pages=261–2|doi=10.1080/14639947.2014.932481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhammapāla's interpretation is still essentially Theravāda though, since the Buddha is still considered a human being, albeit an enlightened one.&lt;ref name="Endo1" /&gt; The Buddha's body is still subject to ''[[Karma in Buddhism|kamma]]'' and limited in the same way as other people's bodies are.{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=376–80}}

In a post-canonical text Sri Lankan text called Saddharmaratnākaraya, a distinction is drawn between four different ''kāya''s: the ''rūpakāya'', ''dharmakāya'', ''nimittakāya'' and ''suñyakāya''. The ''rūpakāya'' refers to the four ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhāna]]''s here; the ''dharmakāya'' refers to the attainment of the first eight of the nine ''lokuttaradhamma''s; the ''nimittakāya'' refers to the final ''lokuttaradhamma'': ''Nibbāna'' with a physical remainder (''sopadisesanibbāna''); and the ''suñyakāya'' refers to ''Nibbāna'' without physical remainder (''anupādisesanibbāna''). However, even this teaching of four ''kāya''s does not really stray outside of orthodox Theravāda tradition.&lt;ref name="Endo1" /&gt;{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=380–2}}

In a more unorthodox approach, Maryla Falk has made the argument that in the earliest form of Buddhism, a [[yogic]] path existed which involved the acquisition of a ''manomayakāya'' or ''dhammakāya'' and an ''amatakāya'', in which the ''manomayakāya'' or ''dhammakāya'' refers to the attainment of the ''jhānas'', and the ''amatakāya'' to the attainment of insight and the culmination of the path. In this case, the ''kāyas'' refer to a general path and fruit, not only to the person of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falk|first1=Maryla|title=Nāma-rūpa and dharma-rūpa : origin and aspects of an ancient Indian conception|date=2006|publisher=Jain Publishing|location=Fremont, California|isbn=978-0-89581-978-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9M-z-JVSa0C|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strong|first=J.|author-link=John S.

Furthermore, he points out that there are remarkable resemblances with interpretations that can be found in ''Yogāvacara'' texts, often called [[Tantric Theravada]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=380–4}}

The usage of the word ''dhammakāya'' is common in Tantric Theravāda texts. It is also a common term in later texts concerning the consecration of Buddha images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1062942 | title=Hypostasizing the Buddha: Buddha Image Consecration in Northern Thailand | author=Swearer, Donald K. | journal=History of Religions | year=1995 | volume=34 | issue=3 (Image and Ritual in Buddhism) | page=270 |url=http://works.swarthmore.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1116&amp;context=fac-religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Kinnard|first1=Jacob N.|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of religion|title=Iconography: Buddhist iconography|date=2005|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-02-865740-0|page=4331|edition=2nd|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302020621/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%207.pdf|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these later texts, which are often descriptions of ''[[kammaṭṭhāna]]'' (meditation methods), different parts of the body of the Buddha are associated with certain spiritual attainments, and the practitioner determines to pursue these attainments himself. The idea that certain characteristics or attainments of the Buddha can be pursued is usually considered a Mahāyāna idea, but unlike Mahāyāna, Yogāvacara texts do not describe the Buddha in [[ontological]] terms, and commonly use only Theravāda terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crosby|first=Kate|year=2000|title=Tantric Theravada: A Bibliographic Essay on the Writings of Francois Bizot and others on the Yogavacara-Tradition|journal=Contemporary Buddhism|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://abhidharma.ru/A/Vedalla/Content/0003.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226044721/http://abhidharma.ru/A/Vedalla/Content/0003.pdf|archivedate=2011-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=384–7}}

The [[Dhammakaya Movement]] of Thai Theravada Buddhism has doctrinal elements which distinguish it from conventional Theravāda Buddhism. Basing itself on the Pali suttas and meditative experience, the movement teaches that the ''Dhammakaya'' is the eternal Buddha within all beings. The ''dhammakaya'' is ''Nibbāna'', and ''Nibbāna'' is equated with the true Self (as opposed to the non-self).{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=126}} In some respects its teachings resemble the [[Buddha-nature]] doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism. Paul Williams has commented that this view of Buddhism is similar to ideas found in the [[Rangtong-Shentong|shentong]] teachings of the [[Jonang]] school of Tibet made famous by [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]].{{sfn|Williams 2009|p=237}}

The Thai meditation masters who teach of a true self of which they claim to have gained meditative experience are not rejected by [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhists]] in general, but tend, on the contrary, to be particularly revered and worshipped in Thailand as arahats or even ''[[bodhisattva]]s'', far more so than more orthodox Theravada monks and scholars.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=329}}

=== Mahāyāna ===

==== Prajnaparamita ====
According to Paul Williams, there are three ways of seeing the concept of the ''dharmakaya'' in the ''[[prajnaparamita]] '' sutras:
{{quote|First, the dharmakaya is the collection of teachings, particularly the Prajñaparamita itself. Second, it is the collection of pure [[Dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dharmas]] possessed by the Buddha, specifically pure mental dharmas cognizing emptiness. And third, it comes to refer to [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] itself, the true nature of things. The dharmakaya in all these senses is contrasted with the Buddha’s physical body, that which lived and died and is preserved in [[stupa]]s.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=177}}}}

==== Tathāgatagarbha ====
In the tathagatagarbha sutric tradition, the ''dharmakaya'' is taught by the Buddha to constitute the transcendental, blissful, eternal, and pure Self of the Buddha. "These terms are found in sutras such as the ''Lankavatara'', ''Gandavyuha'', ''Angulimaliya'', ''Srimala'', and the ''Mahaparinirvana'', where they are used to describe the Buddha, the Truth Body (''dharmakaya'') and the Buddha-nature."&lt;ref name=Duckworthxiv&gt;''Mipam on Buddha-Nature: The Ground of the Nyingma Tradition'' by Douglas S. Duckworth, State University of New York Press, Albany, 2008, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; They are the "transcendent results [of spiritual attainment]".&lt;ref name=Duckworthxiv /&gt;

==== ''Lotus Sutra'' ====
In the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' (sixth fascicle) the Buddha explains that he has always and will always exist to lead beings to their salvation.

==== Tibetan Buddhism ====
[[Padmasambhava]], [[Karma Lingpa]], [[Gyurme Dorje]], [[Graham Coleman]] and [[Thupten Jinpa]] define "Buddha-body of Reality", which is a rendering of the Tibetan ''chos-sku'' and the Sanskrit ''dharmakāya'', as:
{{quote|[T]he ultimate nature or essence of the enlightened mind [''byang-chub sems''], which is uncreated (''skye-med''), free from the limits of conceptual elaboration (''spros-pa'i mtha'-bral''), empty of inherent existence (''rang-bzhin-gyis stong-pa''), naturally radiant, beyond duality and spacious like the sky. The intermediate state of the time of death (''chi-kha'i bar-do'') is considered to be an optimum time for the realisation of the Buddha-body of Reality.&lt;ref name="Padmasambhava 2006 p.452" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more discussion on this particular 'intermediate state of the time of death' refer "Chikkhai bardo" (Tibetan) in the [[Bardo]] article.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Reginald Ray]], writing of the Vajrayana view of the ''dharmakaya'', defines it as:
{{quote|The body of reality itself, without specific, delimited form, wherein the Buddha is identified with the spiritually charged nature of everything that is.'&lt;ref name="Reginald Ray 2001, p. 13" /&gt;}}

The Dalai Lama defines the dharmakaya as "the realm of the Dharmakaya-- the space of emptiness--where all phenomena, pure and impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation taught by the Sutras and Tantras.". However he also states that its distinct from the Hindu concept of [[Brahman]] because buddhism adheres to the doctrine of emptyness (sunyata).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html | title=Dalai Lama Answers Questions on Various Topics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Rime movement =====
According to [[Jamgon Kongtrul]], the founder of the [[Rimé movement]], in his 19th century commentary to the [[Lojong]] slogan, "To see confusion as the four kayas, the [[Śūnyatā|sunyata]] protection is unsurpassable",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kongtrul|first1=Jamgon|title=The great path of awakening : the classic guide to lojong, a Tibetan Buddhist practice for cultivating the heart of compassion|date=2005|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-1-59030-214-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; when one meditates on ultimate ''[[bodhicitta]]'' and rests in a state where appearances simply appear but there is no clinging to them, the ''dharmakaya'' aspect is that all appearances are empty in nature, the ''[[sambhogakāya]]'' is that they appear with clarity, the ''nirmanakaya'' is that this emptiness and clarity occur together, and the natural ''kāya'' aspect is that these are inseparable.

===== Gyaltrul Rinpoche's Dharmakaya Organization =====
Recently, ''Dharmakaya'' has also become the name for an organization founded by H. E. the 4th [[Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche]], and is affiliated with his global organization the United Trungram Buddhist Fellowship (UTBF).  {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Gyaltrul Rinpoche's Dharmakaya organization was founded for the specific purpose of bringing the teachings and meditation practices from the Trungram Tradition of the [[Karma Kagyu]] lineage to North America. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

== Iconography ==

=== Emptiness ===
In the early traditions of Buddhism, depictions of Gautama Buddha were neither iconic nor aniconic but depictions of empty space and absence: [[petrosomatoglyph]]s (Images of a part of the body carved in rock), for example.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Susan (1990). "Early Buddhist art and the theory of aniconism" in ''Art Journal'', Winter 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sky-blue ===
Thondup and Talbott identify dharmakaya with the naked ("sky-clad"; Sanskrit: ''Digāmbara''), unornamented, sky-blue [[Samantabhadra]]:
{{quote|In Nyingma icons, dharmakāya is symbolized by a naked, sky-coloured (light blue) male and female Buddha in union [Kāmamudrā], called Samantabhadra [and [[Samantabhadrī (tutelary)|Samantabhadrī]]].&lt;ref name="Thondup, Tulku 1996, p.48" /&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For further discussion of 'Kāmamudrā' (English: "love-seal") refer: [[mudra]], [[mahamudra]] and [[Yab-Yum]].}}}}

Fremantle states:
{{quote|Space is simultaneously the first and the last of the great elements. It is the origin and precondition of the other four, and it is also their culmination... The Sanskrit word for space is the same as for the sky: ''[[akasha]]'', which means "shining and clear." What is it that we call the sky? It marks the boundary of our vision, the limit our sight can reach. If we could see more clearly, the sky would extend infinitely into outer space. The sky is an imaginary boundary set by the limitations of our senses, and also by the limitations of our mind, since we find it almost impossible to imagine a totally limitless [U]niverse. Space is the dimension in which everything exists. It is all-encompassing, all-pervading, and boundless. It is synonymous with emptiness: that emptiness which is simultaneously fullness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francesca Fremantle|Fremantle, Francesca]] (2001). ''Luminous Emptiness: Understanding the Tibetan Book of the Dead''. Boston: Shambala Publications. {{ISBN|1-57062-450-X}}. p.85&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The colour blue is an iconographic polysemic rendering of the ''[[mahābhūta]]'' element of the "pure light" of space (Sanskrit: ''ākāśa'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Francesca Fremantle|Fremantle, Francesca]] (2001). ''Luminous Emptiness: Understanding the Tibetan Book of the Dead''. Boston: Shambala Publications. {{ISBN|1-57062-450-X}}. p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

The conceptually bridging and building poetic device of analogy, as an exemplar where ''dharmakaya'' is evocatively likened to sky and space, is a persistent and pervasive visual metaphor throughout the early [[Dzogchen]] and Nyingma literature and functions as a linkage and conduit between the 'conceptual' and 'conceivable' and the 'ineffable' and 'inconceivable' (Sanskrit: ''acintya''). It is particularly referred to by the ''[[terma (religion)|terma]]'' ''Gongpa Zangtel'' {{refn|group=lower-alpha|Wylie: ''kun tu bzang po'i dgongs pa zang thal du bstan pa''; English: ''Direct Revelation of Samantabhadra's Mind''}}, a terma cycle revealed by [[Rigdzin Gödem]] (1337–1408) and part of the Nyingma "Northern Treasures" ({{bo|w=byang gter}}).&lt;ref&gt;Kunsang, Eric Pema  (compiler, translator); Tweed, Michael (editor); Schmidt, Marcia Binder (editor); Zanpo, Ngawang (artwork) (2006).

Hong Kong: Rangjung Yeshe Publications. {{ISBN|962-7341-57-6}}; {{ISBN|978-962-7341-57-4}}. p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mirror ===
Sawyer conveys the importance of [[melong|mirror]] iconography to ''dharmakaya'':
{{quote|The looking glass/mirror (T. me-long, Skt. adarsa), which represents the dharmakaya or Truth Body, having the aspects of purity (a mirror is clear of pollution) and wisdom (a mirror reflects all phenomena without distinction).&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaladarshan.arts.ohio-state.edu/exhib/sama/Essays/CS92.061MahaOfr.html Sawyer, Chad (1998, 2004), ''Offerings to Mahakala''] (accessed: Saturday March 14, 2009) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125213943/http://kaladarshan.arts.ohio-state.edu/exhib/sama/Essays/CS92.061MahaOfr.html |date=January 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In India, there are designated places for conducting Dharna, and a permission is required for it. Often, those practicing dharna break the permission leading to clashes with law enforcement.

Dharna generally refers to fixing one's mind on an object.  It refers to whole-heartedly pledging toward an outcome or to inculcating a directed attitude. Dharna is consciously and diligently holding a point of view with the intent of achieving a goal.

The word originates from the Sanskrit word ''dharnam''.

In Pakistan, the term was first used in 1958 by [[Abdul Qayyum Khan]] against the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Firoz Khan Noon|Feroze Khan]]'s [[Feroze Khan administration|administration]] to remove his [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Iskander Mirza]] but its effective usage was made by [[Naeem Siddiqui]] proposed the to use dharna politics for obtaining objectives and latter on Qazi Hussain Ahmed and Jammat e Islami organised dharna in Pakistan in 1993, Imran Khan, Dr.Tahir ul Qadri and other political and religious leaders are now attempting to use this strategy for their purposes.

{{More footnotes|date=August 2009}} 
The '''essential facilities doctrine''' (sometimes also referred to as the '''essential facility doctrine''') is a [[legal doctrine]] which describes a particular type of claim of [[monopolization]] made under [[competition law]]s.  In general, it refers to a type of [[anti-competitive behavior]] in which a firm with [[market power]] uses a "[[Bottleneck (logistics)|bottleneck]]" in a market to deny competitors entry into the market.  It is closely related to a claim for [[refusal to deal]].

The doctrine has its origins in [[United States law]], but it has been adopted (often with some modification) into the legal systems of [[Law of the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], [[Law of Australia|Australia]], [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], and the [[Law of the European Union|European Union]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Overview==
Under the essential facilities doctrine, a [[monopoly|monopolist]] found to own "a facility essential to other competitors" is required to provide reasonable use of that facility, unless some aspect of it precludes shared access.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott B. Lipsky, Jr. &amp; J. Gregory Sidak, [https://www.criterioneconomics.com/docs/essential_facilities1.pdf ''Essential Facilities''], 51 {{smallcaps|Stan. L. Rev.}} 1187, 1190–91 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The basic elements of a [[Claim (legal)|legal claim]] under this doctrine under [[United States antitrust law]], which a [[plaintiff]] is required to show to establish liability, are:

#control of the essential facility by a monopolist
#a competitor’s inability to practically or reasonably duplicate the essential facility
#the denial of the use of the facility to a competitor; and
#the feasibility of providing the facility to competitors

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Verizon Communications v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP|Verizon v. Trinko]]'', 540 U.S. 398 (2004), in effect added a fifth element:  absence of regulatory oversight from an agency (the [[Federal Communications Commission]], in that case) with power to compel access.

These elements are difficult for potential plaintiffs to establish for several reasons.  It is quite difficult for a plaintiff to demonstrate that a particular facility is "essential" to entry into and/or competition within the [[relevant market]].  The plaintiff must demonstrate that the "facility" must be something so indispensable to entry or competition that it would be impossible for smaller firms to compete with the market leader.  Likewise, the plaintiff must show that compelling the [[Dominance (economics)|dominant firm]] to permit others to use the facility would not interfere with the ability of the dominant firm to serve its own customers.

==Development==
The first notable case to address the anti-competitive implications of an essential facility was the Supreme Court's judgment in ''[[United States v. Terminal Railroad Association]]'', 224 U.S. 383 (1912).&lt;ref&gt;Abbott B. Lipsky, Jr. &amp; J. Gregory Sidak, [https://www.criterioneconomics.com/docs/essential_facilities1.pdf ''Essential Facilities''], 51 Stan. L. Rev.]] 1187, 1189–91 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  A group of railroads controlling all railway bridges and switching yards into and out of [[St. Louis]] prevented competing railway companies from offering transportation to and through that destination. The court held it to be an illegal restraint of trade.&lt;ref&gt;224 U.S. 383 (1912), at 409-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar decisions include,
* ''[[Associated Press v. United States]]'', 326 U.S. 1 (1945), in which the Supreme Court found that the [[Associated Press]] bylaws which limited membership and therefore access to copyrighted news services violated the Sherman Act.
* In ''[[Lorain Journal Co. v. United States]]'', 342 U.S. 143, 146-49 (1951), ''[[The Lorain Journal]]'' was the only local business doing news and advertisements in town. The case was that refusing to place an ad for the customers of a small radio station was a Sherman Act violation. In the end, the court accepted an offer to simply accept the advertisements.
* ''[[Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States]]'', 410 U.S. 366, 377-79 (1973), in which the Supreme Court found that [[Otter Tail Corporation|Otter Tail]], an electrical utility which sold electricity at both directly to consumers and to municipalities who resold to consumers, violated the Sherman Act by refusing to supply electricity at wholesale, instead serving customers directly itself.
* ''[[Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp.]]'', 427 U.S. 585 (1985), upholding the  ''Lorain Journal'' decision in holding that Aspen Skiing violated § 2 of the [[Sherman Act]] by refusing to honor vouchers and [[ski lift]] tickets after it had previously done so.
* ''[[Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States#Hecht case|Hecht v. Pro Football]]'' where potential American Football League franchise did not show they needed Washington's [[RFK Stadium]], the essential facilities doctrine was not met.

==Application of the doctrine==
There is controversy about what exactly constitutes an "essential facility".  While the doctrine has most frequently been applied to [[Natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] such as [[Public utility|utilities]] and owners of transportation facilities, it has also been applied{{Specify|date=May 2012}} in situations involving [[intellectual property]].  For example, it is possible for a court to apply the doctrine in a case where one competitor refuses to sell materials protected by [[copyright]] or [[patent]] to potential competitors.

== Historical development of concept ==
In 1990s the concept of [[value chain]] gained its credit among economists and business scholars. (Its prominent developer [[Michael Porter]]). The concept combined sequenced and interconnected activities in the process of value creation. Value chain concept focused on business activities, but not on the corporate power and institutional context. In 1994 Garry Gereffi, together with Miguel Korzeniewicz introduced the concept of Global Commodity Chains (GCC):

{{quote|sets of interorganizational networks clustered around one commodity or product, linking households, enterprises, and states to one another within the world-economy. These networks are situationally specific, socially constructed, and locally integrated, underscoring the social embeddedness of economic organization|Gereffi&lt;ref&gt;Gereffi, G. (1994) ‘The organisation of buyer-driven global commodity chains: how US retailers shape overseas production networks’, in G. Gereffi and M. Korzeniewicz (eds), Commodity Chains and Global Development. Westport: Praeger, pp. 95–122: 2&lt;/ref&gt;}} The concept was developed further by a number of authors that emphasized importance of chain governance in different commodities (e.g. automobiles, textile, electronics etc.)

At the beginning of 2000s a group of authors Jeffrey Henderson, Peter Dicken, Martin Hess, Neil Coe and Henry Wai-Chung Yeung, introduced GPN framework, that builds on the development of previous approaches to international production processes. At the same time it expands beyond the linearity of GCC approach to incorporate all kinds of network configuration. Adopting clear network perspective allows to embrace the complexity of multidimensional layers of production moving beyond the "linear progression of the product or service"&lt;ref&gt;Neil M. Coe, Peter Dicken, and Martin Hess, “Global Production Networks: Realizing the Potential,” Journal of Economic Geography 8, no. 3 (May 1, 2008): 271–95, doi:10.1093/jeg/lbn002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insights from the analysis of production networks ==
Analysis of the global production networks relies on the use of the input-output tables that links firms through the transactions involved in the product creation. Commodity chain literature considers firms as the nodes in a number of chains that transform inputs into outputs through a series of interconnected stages of production, later linked to distribution and consumption activities. Andersen and Christensen define five major types of connective nodes in supply networks: Local integrator, Export base, Import base, International spanner and Global integrator &lt;ref&gt;Poul Houman Andersen and Poul Rind Christensen, “Bridges over Troubled Water: Suppliers as Connective Nodes in Global Supply Networks,” Journal of Business Research 58, no. 9 (September 2005): 1261–73, doi:10.1016/j.jbusres.2003.04.002.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobday et al. argue that the core capability of the firms stem from their ability to manage network of components and subsystem suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;Hobday, M., Davies, A., Prencipe, A. (2005) Systems integration: a core capability of the modern corporation. Industrial and Corporate Change, 14: 1109–1143.&lt;/ref&gt;

To capture both vertical and horizontal links across the sequence of production process, Lazzarini introduced the concept of Netchain: "a set of networks {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} horizontal ties between firms within a particular industry or group, which are sequentially arranged based on vertical ties between firms in different layers ... Netchain analysis explicitly differentiates between horizontal (transactions in the same layer) and vertical ties (transactions between layers), mapping how agents in each layer are related to each other and to agents in other layers".&lt;ref&gt;Lazzarini, S., Chaddad, F. R., Cook, M. L. (2000) Integrating supply chain and network analysis: the study of netchains. Journal on Chain and Network Science, 1: 7–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical studies have explored production networks in the domain of ethics of production, for instance focusing on local effects or labor relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miszczynski|first=M.|date=2016-02-18|title=Global Production in a Romanian Village: Middle-Income Economy, Industrial Dislocation and the Reserve Army of Labor|journal=Critical Sociology|volume=43|issue=7–8|pages=1079–1092|language=en|doi=10.1177/0896920515623076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:First members of harmonic sequence.svg|thumb|The first ten members of the harmonic sequence &lt;math&gt;a_n=\tfrac 1n&lt;/math&gt;.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''harmonic progression''' (or '''harmonic sequence''') is a progression formed by taking the reciprocals of an [[arithmetic progression]]. It is a [[sequence]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{a} ,\ \frac{1}{a+d}\ , \frac{1}{a+2d}\ , \frac{1}{a+3d}\ , \cdots, \frac{1}{a+kd},&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;minus;a/''d'' is not a [[natural number]] and ''k'' '''is''' a natural number.

Equivalently, a sequence is a harmonic progression when each term is the [[harmonic mean]] of the neighboring terms.

It is not possible for a harmonic progression (other than the trivial case where ''a'' = 1 and ''k'' = 0)  to sum to an [[integer]]. The reason is that, necessarily, at least one denominator of the progression will be divisible by a [[prime number]] that does not divide any other denominator.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=P.|last= Erdős |authorlink=Paul Erdős |title=Egy Kürschák-féle elemi számelméleti tétel általánosítása|trans-title=Generalization of an elementary number-theoretic theorem of Kürschák|language=Hungarian|journal=Mat.

'''Human ecosystems''' are [[complex system|complex cybernetic systems]] that are increasingly being used by [[ecological]] [[anthropologists]] and other scholars to examine the ecological aspects of human communities in a way that integrates multiple factors as economics, socio-political organization, psychological factors, and physical factors related to the environment.

A human ecosystem has three central organizing concepts: human environed unit (an individual or group of individuals), environment, interactions and transactions between and within the components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sprout, H.H. and Sprout, M.: Ecological Perspective on Human Affairs (eBook and Paperback).|url = http://press.princeton.edu/titles/2999.html|website = press.princeton.edu|access-date = 2016-01-28|date = 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Total human ecosystem|total environment]] includes three conceptually distinct, but interrelated environments: the natural, human constructed, and human behavioral.

'''James Francis Cauty''' (born 19 December 1956), also known as '''Rockman Rock''', is an English artist and musician, best known as one half of the duo [[The KLF]], co-founder of [[The Orb]] and as the man who [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid|burnt one million pounds]].

Cauty was married to Cressida (née Bowyer), with whom he has twins, Daisy and Harry, and a younger son, Alfie.&lt;ref name="trash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=384|title=Library of Mu - Trash Art &amp; Kreation|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later married artist and musician [[Alannah Currie]] (formerly of [[Thompson Twins]]) in 2011.

==Early career==
Cauty was born on the [[Wirral Peninsula]] in [[Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=james+f&amp;lastname=cauty+&amp;eventyear=1956&amp;eventyear_offset=1|title=findmypast.co.uk|website=Search.findmypast.co.uk|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a 17-year-old artist, he drew a popular ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' poster (and later, a counterpart based on ''[[The Hobbit]]'') for British retailer [[Athena (retailer)|Athena]],&lt;ref&gt;"The KLF", ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' ([[Cardiff]]), 4 March 2005, p29.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the cover for the [[concept album]] ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter (album)|The King of Elfland's Daughter]]''.

In 1981-2 Cauty was guitarist in a band called Angels 1–5, who recorded a [[Peel session]] on 1 July 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1980s/1981/Jul01angels15/|title=BBC - Radio 1 - Keeping It Peel - 01/07/1981 Angels 1 - 5|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead vocalist was [[Cressida Cauty|Cressida Bowyer]], whom Cauty later married. He then joined the band [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]] with which he remained until its break-up in 1986. Cauty was also an original member of [[Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction]], in 1985.

==Artistic partnership with Bill Drummond, 1987–1995, 1997==
Cauty joined with [[Bill Drummond]] to form [[The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]] (The JAMs), a collaboration that played out in various guises and media over much of the next decade.

As an [[A&amp;R]] man, Drummond had signed Brilliant to [[Warner Music Group|WEA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brilliant-mn0000627485/biography|title=Brilliant - Biography &amp; History|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concocting a scheme for a hip-hop record on New Year's Day 1987, Drummond needed a like-minded collaborator with expertise in current music technology, and so contacted Cauty. Drummond later commented that Cauty "knew exactly, to coin a phrase, 'where I was coming from'", said Drummond. A week later, The JAMs had recorded their debut single, "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 1]] "Story of Pop" documentary interview with Bill Drummond. First BBC broadcast believed to have been in [http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/STORY+OF+POP late 1994], and was transmitted by Australian national broadcaster [[Citadel Media|ABC]] on [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/pop/default.htm 1 January 2005]. Transcript taken from the [http://www.klf.de/faq/index.php?cate_id=1 KLF FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427020752/http://www.klf.de/faq/index.php?cate_id=1 |date=27 April 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several singles and three albums as The JAMs followed (their debut, ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)|1987]]''; the follow-up, ''[[Who Killed The JAMs?]]''; and compilation ''[[Shag Times]]'') before a change of direction saw the duo mutate into dance and ambient music pioneers, [[The KLF]]. Along the way, the duo scored their first British number one hit single as [[The Timelords]] with the [[Gary Glitter]]/[[Doctor Who|Dr. Who]] novelty-pop [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]", claimed to be sung by Cauty's 1968 [[Ford Galaxie]] American [[police car]].

The KLF released two albums, ''[[Chill Out]]'' and ''[[The White Room]]'', and a string of top 5 singles, becoming the biggest selling singles act in the world in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-klf-mn0000074853/biography|title=The KLF - Biography &amp; History|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, suddenly and very publicly, The KLF retired from the music industry and deleted their entire back catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;KLF Communications advertisement in ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 16 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="select92"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=315|title=Library of Mu - Who Killed The KLF?|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=309|title=Library of Mu - Timelords gentlemen, please!|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond and Cauty re-emerged in 1993 as the [[K Foundation]], releasing one limited edition single ("[[K Cera Cera]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=356|title=Library of Mu - Yasser, they can boogie!|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and awarding the £40,000 [[K Foundation art award]] for the "worst artist of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=364|title=Library of Mu - K Foundation tries to turn the art world on its head|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the duo courted infamy by [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid|setting fire to one million pounds in cash]] on the Scottish island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]].&lt;ref name="Reid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=387|title=Library of Mu - Money To Burn|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, they undertook a screening tour of a film of the burning,&lt;ref&gt;Banks-Smith, Nancy, "From cash to ash", ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([[Manchester]]), 30 August 1995, page T.009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=400|title=Library of Mu - WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; before signing a moratorium on K Foundation activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=519|title=Library of Mu - Cape Wrath|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cauty worked with Drummond again in 1997 with a campaign to "[[Fuck the Millennium]]", the highlight of which was a 23-minute live performance satirising the "pop comeback", in which Cauty and Drummond appeared as grey-haired pensioners and wheeled around the stage in electric wheelchairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=439|title=Library of Mu - JUSTIFIED AND (VERY) ANCIENT?|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout The KLF's career, Drummond was most often the mouthpiece of the group and is regularly mistakenly viewed as their chief protagonist but in fact Cauty was just as instrumental in developing ideas and actions in the duo as is evident in his practice as an individual artist. As described by the ''[[NME]]'' their joint and individual work displays "honesty mixed with deranged publicity-seeking, pop terrorism ideas mixed with utter strangeness and mysticism..., and a sense that the things pop groups do should be visionary and above all should not be mundane."&lt;ref name="TateTat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=359|title=Library of Mu - TATE TAT AND ARTY|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cauty's wife at the time, Cressida, also helped out, taking on an organisational role for KLF Communications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=506|title=Library of Mu - K.L.F. INFO SHEET 6. (AUG/SEPT. 89.)|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to design and choreography work for The KLF, and her own work as an artist.&lt;ref name="trash" /&gt;

==Ambient house, 1988–1992==
In the late 1980s, Cauty met [[Alex Paterson]] and the duo began DJ-ing and producing together as [[The Orb]]. Paterson and Cauty's first release was a 1988 [[acid house]] anthem track, "Tripping on Sunshine" released on the German record compilation ''[[Eternity Project One]]''.&lt;ref name="rough"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Peter|title=The Rough Guide to Drum 'n' Bass|authorlink=Peter Shapiro (journalist)|year=1999|isbn=1-85828-433-3|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|pages=327–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, The Orb released the ''[[Kiss (The Orb EP)|Kiss EP]]'', a four-track [[Extended play|EP]] based on samples from New York City's [[WEPN-FM|Kiss FM]].&lt;ref name="rough"/&gt; It was released on Paterson and Glover's new record label [[WAU/Mr. Modo Records]], which Paterson and Glover created out of a desire to maintain financial independence from larger record labels.&lt;ref name="century"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prendergast|first=Mark |title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Moby-The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing PLC]]|year=2003|isbn=1-58234-323-3|pages=407–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as "really shit drum sounds", the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by "taking the bloody drums away".&lt;ref name="keyboard"&gt;{{cite news|last=Doerschuck|first=Robert|work=[[Keyboard Magazine]]|date=June 1995|title=Inside the Ambient Techno Ultraworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterson and Cauty began DJ-ing in London and landed a deal for The Orb to play the [[Chill-out music|chill-out]] room at London nightclub [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]]. Resident DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]] brought in the duo specifically as ambient DJs for his "The Land of Oz" event at Heaven.&lt;ref name="irish-boyd"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Irish Times]]|last=Boyd|first=Brian|date=23 October 1998|page=12|title=Unidentified Flying Orb}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though initially The Orb's Monday night performances had only several "hard-core" followers, their "Chill Out Room" act grew popular over the course of their six-month stay at Heaven to the point that the small room was often packed with around 100&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name="ocean"&gt;{{cite book|last = Toop|first = David|authorlink = David Toop|title=Ocean of Sound|publisher=Serpent's Tail|pages=59–62|year=2001|isbn = 1-85242-743-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orb's performances became especially popular among weary DJs and clubbers who sought solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor.&lt;ref name="amg-orb"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5071/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Orb Biography |accessdate=2006-10-09 |last = Bush |first = John |website=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orb would build up melodies using [[multitrack recording]]s linked to multiple [[record deck]]s and a [[mixing console|mixer]]. They incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop|BBC sound effects]] into their act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as "[[Sueño Latino]]".&lt;ref name="ocean"/&gt; Most often, they played [[Dub music|dub]] and other [[chill out music]] which Bill Drummond described as "Ambient house for the E generation."&lt;ref name="rough"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metropolis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Crispy|first=Don|url=http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/590/clubs.asp|title=Alex Paterson|publisher=''[[Metropolis (Japanese magazine)|Metropolis]]''|accessdate=20 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704194423/http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/590/clubs.asp|archivedate=4 July 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1989, Paterson, Cauty, [[Bill Drummond|Drummond]] and [[Martin Glover]] developed the musical genre of [[ambient house]] through the use of a diverse array of [[sampling (music)|samples]] and recordings. The culmination of Cauty and Paterson's musical work came towards the end of the year when The Orb recorded a session for [[John Peel]] on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The track, then known as "Loving You", was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from science fiction radio plays, nature sounds, and [[Minnie Riperton]]'s "Lovin' You".&lt;ref name="amg-peel"&gt;{{cite web|website=[[AllMusic]]|last=Thompson|first=Dave|accessdate=20 January 2018|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r14521|pure_url=yes}}|title=Peel Sessions Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orb changed the title to "[[A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld]]". In 1990, Cauty and Drummond held a [[Chill-out music|chillout]] party at [[Trancentral]], a recording of Patersons DJing was made with a view to releasing it as an LP but the mix contained many uncleared samples and other records and was unusable. Later that year Cauty and Drummond went to the isle of [[Jura, Scotland]] to record a techno record called Gate. Instead they created a long form ambient film called [[The KLF films|Waiting (1990)]]. During the same year Cauty and Drummond went into the studio and made the ambient LP ''[[Chill Out]]''.&lt;ref name="generation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|year=1999|isbn=0-415-92373-5|publisher=Routledge|title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Dictionary]]'' suggests ''Chill Out'' to be the first ambient house album.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Ambient house|author=Fulford-Jones, Will|access-date=4 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When offered an album deal by Big Life, The Orb found themselves at a crossroads. Cauty preferred that albums by The Orb were released on his [[KLF Communications]] label, whereas Paterson wanted to ensure The Orb did not become an offshoot of The KLF.&lt;ref name="times-waves"&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't make negative waves|last=Toop|first=David|authorlink=David Toop |date=3 June 1994|work=[[The Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name ''The Orb''.&lt;ref name="amg-orb"/&gt; Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the recordings in progress and released the album as ''[[Space (Jimmy Cauty album)|Space]]'' on [[KLF Communications]].&lt;ref name="klfcomm"&gt;{{cite press release|title=KLF Communications Info Sheet Nine|publisher=[[KLF Communications]]|year=1990|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=509|accessdate=9 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-KLF==
In 1999 Cauty produced several remixes under the alias The Scourge of the Earth for artists such as [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Hawkwind]], [[Ian Brown]], [[The Orb]] etc. In December 1999 he joined with [[Guy Pratt]] to record and release a mobile telephone-themed novelty-pop record "[[I Wanna 1-2-1 With You]]" under the name Solid Gold Chartbusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Solid+Gold+Chartbusters|title=Solid Gold Chartbusters|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released as competition for the Christmas Number One but only got to 62. In 2001, Cauty joined with former collaborators Alex Paterson and Guy Pratt in a London recording studio, together with Dom Beken, an associate of Pratt.&lt;ref name="Official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transitkings.com/TransitKings/WaitingRoom.html|title=HugeDomains.com - TransitKings.com is for sale (Transit Kings)|website=Transitkings.com|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recording later continued in Cauty's [[Brighton]] studio. In 2003, the group released their first single, "Boom Bang Bombay", under the name Custerd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Custerd|title=Custerd|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, they settled on the name "[[Transit Kings]]". Cauty left the band in 2004 to work on other projects. In 2006, the Transit Kings released their debut album, ''[[Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God]]''; Cauty is listed as a composer on 7 of the album's 12 tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/763820|title=Transit Kings - Living In A Giant Candle Winking At God|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Cauty's two remixes of U2's "New York" were featured as B-sides on the band's [[Electrical Storm (song)|Electrical Storm]] single. Until mid-2005, together with [[James Fogarty]] and Keir Jens-Smith, he was part of art/music collective [[Blacksmoke]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Cauty works with the [[L-13 Light Industrial Workshop]], London which he explains "is not a gallery, it’s a support system, spiritual home and technical epicentre for a small group of artists"&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Marco. [http://www.proceso.com.mx/457586/la-pequena-insurreccion-cauty "La pequeña insurrección de Cauty."], ''[[Proceso (magazine)]]'', 5 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes ''[[Billy Childish]]'', ''[[Jamie Reid]]'' and Harry Adams. Cauty first worked in conjunction with L-13 on the Cautese Nationál Postal Disservice. Subsequent collaborations included the Riot In A Jam Jar exhibitions and the ADP Riot Tour - is a vast 1:87 scale model in a 40-foot shipping container which tours historic riot sites around the world. L-13 continue to collaborate with Cauty and Drummond, running "dead perch merch", official merchandise operatives to The JAMs.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Following 2003 media speculation that Saddam Hussein could launch a poison chemical attack on London, Cauty designed the Stamps of Mass Destruction for [[Blacksmoke]] Art Collective. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd class stamps featuring the Queen's head wearing a gas mask were released as limited edition prints and exhibited at Artrepublic Gallery, Brighton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artrepublic.com/biographies/35-james-cauty.html|title=James Cauty|work=artrepublic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a legal battle over alleged copyright infringement, the stamps were sent to [[Royal Mail]] for destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/2963414.stm Row Over Gas Masked Queen], [[BBC News]], 4 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Left, Sarah. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/04/post.artsfeatures Royal Mail Stamps Down on Postage Art], [[The Guardian]], 4 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Cauty installed a gift shop, ''Blackoff'', at the Aquarium Gallery, based on the government's ''Preparing for Emergencies'' leaflet.  The installation included "terror aware" items, such as "terror tea towels", "attack hankies" and "bunker-buster jigsaw puzzles" (missing one piece). He commented, "The gift shop becomes the place we can explore our branding ideas, Cash for trash – it represents the futility and the glory of it all."&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Paul.[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1353862,00.html "The art that stole Christmas"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 November 2004; retrieved 1 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Cauty Operation Magic Kingdom billboard, Old Street, 2007.jpg|thumb|James Cauty artwork Operation Magic Kingdom bombed onto billboard in Old Street, 2007]]In response to the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]], Cauty developed Operation Magic Kingdom, a series of images showing US forces in Iraq wearing masks of lovable and friendly Disney characters, adopting the UK’s "winning hearts and minds" tactics in a bid to gain the confidence of the Iraqi people. In Operation Magic Kingdom "the rules of engagement have been changed to include "try and be more fun" before firing." &lt;ref&gt;Cauty, James. [http://jamescauty.com/work/operation-magic-kingdom/ "Operation Magic Kingdom press release"], [[The Aquarium L-13|The Aquarium]], April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The images were launched at the Bayswater Road Sunday Art Exhibition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayswater-road-artists.co.uk|title=bayswater road artists|work=bayswater road artists}}&lt;/ref&gt; bombed onto billboards and flyposted across London, as well as being released by [[The Aquarium L-13|The Aquarium]] as limited edition prints and stamps.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In June 2011 he held a public exhibition at L-13 entitled ''A Riot in a Jam Jar'' consisting primarily of a series of [[Scale model|scale]] [[diorama]]s depicting violent confrontations between British rioters and police, each contained within an inverted glass jar.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In 2012,  Cauty premiered his short film, Believe the Magic, starring [[Debbie Harry]], Nick Lehan and [[Branko Tomović]], at [[Tate Modern]] as part of the annual Merge festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mergefestival.co.uk/artists/believe-the-magic-by-jimmy-cauty.html Believe The Magic], Merge Festival Programme, 30 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.film-news.co.uk/show-news.asp?nItemID=18426 Jimmy Cauty's 'Believe the Magic' trailer starring Debbie Harry], film-news.co.uk, 6 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of A Riot in a Jam Jar evolved into the Aftermath Dislocation Principle, shown at the Hoxton Arches in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Pilger, Zoe.[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/art-review-james-cauty-the-aftermath-dislocation-principle-parts-i-and-ii-8874179.html "Art review: James Cauty, The Aftermath Dislocation Principle Parts I and II"], [[The Independent]], 11 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 448 square foot installation at 1:87 scale (representing approximately one square mile) details the desolate and charred aftermath of what appears to have been a devastating riot. The sculpture, constructed by modifying components of traditional model railway kits, took approximately 8 months to complete includes nearly 3,000 police figures and a soundtrack pitched to match the 1:87 scale. The piece "makes a political statement about societal freedom and state control".&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Johnny.[http://www.designcurial.com/news/devil-in-the-detail-4157979/ "Devil in the Detail: James Cauty's Dystopia in Miniature"], [[Blueprint (architecture magazine)]], 10 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aftermath Dislocation principle then toured the Netherlands, being shown at Piet Hein Eek Gallery, Eindhoven (November 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pietheineek.nl/nl/kunstgalerie/james-cauty|title=Piet Hein Eek|work=pietheineek.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultuurwerf, Vlissingen (April 2014),&lt;ref&gt;[http://cultuurwerf.nl/expos/james-cauty-the-aftermath-dislocation-principle/ "James Cauty the Aftermath Dislocation Principle"], cultuurwerf.nl; accessed 20 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mediamatic, Amsterdam (July–August 2014).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamatic.net/370219/en/opening-the-aftermath-dislocation-principle "Opening: The Aftermath Dislocation Principle – A Disaster Tour with Jimmy Cauty"], Mediamatic, 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Cauty released a series of limited edition Smiley Riot Shields. The shields are all ex-police riot gear which have been painted over with a yellow smiley face.

'''''Jus soli''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|dʒ|ʌ|s|_|ˈ|s|oʊ|l|aɪ}}; {{IPA-la|juːs ˈsɔ.liː}}), meaning "right of the soil",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jus%20soli jus soli], definition from [http://www.merriam-webster.com/ merriam-webster.com].&lt;/ref&gt; commonly referred to as '''birthright citizenship''' in the [[United States]], is the [[right]] of anyone born in the territory of a state to [[nationality]] or [[citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vincent|first=Andrew |title=Nationalism and Particularity |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |location=Cambridge; New York |pages=|url=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jus soli'' was part of the [[English common law|English]] [[common law]], in contrast to ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', which derives from the [[Roman law]] that influenced the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] systems of [[continental Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayelet Shachar, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xXt5SoXtqEsC&amp;pg=PA120 The Birthright Lottery: Citizenship and Global Inequality]'' (Harvard University Press, 2009), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rey Koslowski, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0lZxEfg-tQMC&amp;pg=PA77 Migrants and Citizens: Demographic Change in the European State System]'' (Cornell University Press, 2000), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Where it exists universally, it is often not quite unconditional. For instance, some countries deny citizenship to children of foreign diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/policies-politiques/births-naissances.aspx?lang=eng|publisher=Global Affairs Canada|title=Birth in Canada of children of foreign representatives|date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an unconditional (or near-unconditional) basis for citizenship, ''jus soli'' is the predominant rule in the Americas, but it is rare elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-09-16/news/ct-oped-0916-birthright-20100916_1_birthright-citizenship-illegal-aliens-alien-parents |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Birthright citizenship benefits the country|first=Ronald D.|last=Rotunda|date=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.texastribune.org/immigration-in-texas/immigration/repeal-birthright-citizenship--and-then-what/ |work=Texas Tribune|title=Repeal Birthright Citizenship – and Then What?|first=Morgan|last=Smith|date=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] was enacted in 2004, no European country grants citizenship based on unconditional or near-unconditional ''jus soli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?ID=369 |publisher=Migration Policy Institute|title=Citizenship in a Globalized World |first=Greta |last=Gilbertson|date=1 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/birthright_comparativepaper.pdf |last1=Vink|first1=M. |first2=G.

Comparative Report RSCAS/EUDO-CIT-Comp. 2010/8 |location=Florence |publisher=EUDO Citizenship Observatory|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all states in Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania grant citizenship at birth based upon the principle of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (right of blood), in which citizenship is inherited through parents not by birthplace, or a restricted version of ''jus soli'' in which citizenship by birthplace is automatic only for the children of certain immigrants. Countries that have acceded to the [[1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness]] will grant nationality to otherwise [[stateless person]]s who were born on their territory, or on a ship or aircraft flagged by that country.

''Jus soli'' is associated with permissive citizenship rights. Most countries with unconditional or near-unconditional ''jus soli'' laws tend to give birthright citizenship (and nationality) based on ''jus sanguinis'' rules as well, although these stipulations tend to be more restrictive than in countries that use ''jus sanguinis'' as the primary basis for nationality.

== History ==
An early form of ''jus soli'' dates from [[Cleisthenes]]' reforms of ancient [[Athenian]] law in the 6th century BC. It developed further in the Roman world, where citizenship was extended to all free inhabitants of the [[Roman Empire]] by the [[Constitutio Antoniniana|Edict of Caracalla]] in AD 212.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

Much later, the independence of the English colonies in America and the French Revolution in the late 18th century laid the foundations for ''jus soli''. With the social and economic development of the 19th and 20th centuries and the massive migrations to the Americas and Western Europe, ''jus soli'' was established in a greater and greater number of countries.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

At the turn of the 19th century, [[nation-states]] commonly divided themselves between those granting nationality on the grounds of ''jus soli'' ([[France]], for example) and those granting it on the grounds of ''jus sanguinis'' (for example, [[Germany]] before 1990). However, since 2007 the [[European migrant crisis]] has focused attention on these two conflicting sources of nationality rights.

== {{anchor|Lex soli}}National laws ==
''Lex soli'' is a law used in practice to regulate who and under what circumstances an individual can assert the right of ''jus soli''. Most states provide a specific ''lex soli—''in application of the respective ''jus soli—''and it is the most common means of acquiring nationality. However, a frequent exception to ''lex soli'' is imposed when a child is born to a parent in the diplomatic or consular service of another state on a mission to the state in question.&lt;ref&gt;Guimezanes, Nicole.

'''Kleshas''' ({{lang-sa|क्लेश|kleśa}}; {{lang-pi|किलेस}} ''kilesa''; {{lang-bo|ཉོན་མོངས།}} ''nyon mongs''), in [[Buddhism]], are mental states that cloud the mind and manifest in unwholesome actions. ''Kleshas'' include states of mind such as anxiety, fear, anger, jealousy, desire, depression, etc. Contemporary translators use a variety of English words to translate the term ''kleshas'', such as: afflictions, defilements, destructive emotions, disturbing emotions, negative emotions, mind poisons, etc.

In the contemporary Mahayana and Theravada Buddhist traditions, the three kleshas of ignorance, attachment, and aversion are identified as the root or source of all other kleshas. These are referred to as the ''[[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three poisons]]'' in the Mahayana tradition, or as the three ''unwholesome roots'' in the Theravada tradition.

While the early Buddhist texts of the Pali canon do not specifically enumerate the three root kleshas, over time the ''three poisons'' (and the kleshas generally) came to be seen as the very roots of [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsaric existence]].

== Pali literature ==
{{PaliCanon}}
In the [[Pali Canon]]'s discourses (''[[Sūtra|sutta]]''), ''kilesa'' is often associated with the various passions that defile bodily and mental states.  In the Pali Canon's [[Abhidhamma Pitaka|Abhidhamma]] and post-canonical [[Pali literature]], ten defilements are identified, the first three of which – greed, hate, delusion – are considered to be the "roots" of suffering.

=== Sutta Pitaka: Mental hindrances ===
In the Pali Canon's [[Sutta Pitaka]], ''kilesa'' and its correlate ''upakkilesa''&lt;ref&gt;Beyond the etymological relationship between and semantic closeness of ''kilesa'' and ''upakkilesa'' (e.g., see Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, 1921–25, p. 139, entry for ''upakkilesa'' at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:3657.pali), the below-referenced [[Samyutta Nikaya]] collection entitled "''&lt;u&gt;Kilesa&lt;/u&gt;-sa{{IAST|ṃ}}yutta''" (SN 27) does not use ''kilesa'' in its actual suttas but, in fact, ''&lt;u&gt;upakkilesa&lt;/u&gt;''.  Bodhi (2000), pp. 1012–14, 1100 ''n''. 273, specifically makes note of the lexical differences between these two Pali words and chooses to translate ''kilesa'' as "defilement" and ''upakkilesa'' as "corruption."  Similar, in Bodhi (2000), p. 1642, SN 47.12, ''upakkilesa'' is translated as "corruption" whereas, as indicated below, in Bodhi (2005), p. 416, this same Pali word in the same sutta is translated as "defilement."  Consistent with Bodhi (2005), as seen below, Thanissaro (1994) also translates ''upakkilesa'' as "defilement."&lt;p&gt;The related correlate ''sankilesa'' (or ''sa{{IAST|ṅ}}kilesa'') is also translated as "defilement" by Bodhi (e.g., 2000, pp. 903-4; 2005, pp. 55-6), [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.026.than.html Thanissaro (2004)] and Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-5, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2756.pali entry for "Sankilesa"]).  In [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 22.60 (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 903-4), ''sankilesa'' is contextualized by: "By being enamoured with [form], [beings] are captivated by it, and by being captivated by it they are defiled."  In this sutta, ''sankilesa'' is juxtaposed with purification (''visuddhi'') which is contextualized by:  "Experiencing revulsion [in the impermanence of form's pleasure], [beings] become dispassionate, and through dispassion they are purified."&lt;/ref&gt; are affective obstacles to the pursuit of direct knowledge (''[[abhijñā]]'') and wisdom (''[[pañña]]'').

For instance, the [[Samyutta Nikaya]] includes a collection of ten discourses ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 27, ''Kilesa-sa{{IAST|ṃ}}yutta'') that state that any association of "desire-passion" (''chanda-rāgo'') with the body or mind&lt;ref&gt;In particular, this ''sa{{IAST|ṃ}}yutta'' contextualizes ''kilesa'' vis-à-vis the six internal and external "sense bases" (''[[ayatana]]'') and their mental concomitants (the six classes of [[vijnana|consciousness]], [[phassa|contact]], [[vedana|feeling]] and [[tanha|craving]], see the section on the [[Ayatana#Sense-base contexts|"six sextets"]]), the six primary "elements" (''dhātu'', cf. ''[[mahābhūta]]''), and the five "aggregates" (''[[khandha]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; is a "defilement of mind" (''cittasse'so upakkileso''):
:"Monks, any desire-passion with regard to the eye is a defilement of the mind. Any desire-passion with regard to the ear... the nose... the tongue... the body... the intellect is a defilement of the mind. When, with regard to [[ayatana|these six bases]], the defilements of awareness are abandoned, then the mind is inclined to [[nekkhamma|renunciation]]. The mind fostered by renunciation feels malleable for the [[abhijna|direct knowing]] of those [[dhamma|qualities]] worth realizing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 27.1 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn27/sn27.001-010.than.html (trans. Thanissaro, 1994).]  Note that the phrase that Thanissaro translates as "defilement of &lt;u&gt;awareness&lt;/u&gt;" here is ''&lt;u&gt;ceta&lt;/u&gt;so upakkileso''; Bodhi (2000), p. 1012, simply translates this as "&lt;u&gt;mental&lt;/u&gt; corruption" (underlining added for clarity).&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, the [[five hindrances]] – sensual desire (''kāmacchanda''), anger (''byāpāda''), sloth-torpor (''thīna-middha''), restlessness-worry (''uddhacca-kukkucca''), and doubt (''vicikicchā'') – are frequently associated with ''kilesa'' in the following (or a similar) manner:

|}

Additionally, in the [[Khuddaka Nikaya]]'s [[Niddesa]], ''kilesa'' is identified as a component of or synonymous with craving (''[[taṇhā|{{IAST|taṇhā}}]]'') and lust (''rāga'').&lt;ref&gt;See Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-5), pp. 216-7, entry for "Kilesa," retrieved 2008-02-09 from "University of Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:579.pali.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abhidhamma: Ten defilements and unwholesome roots ===
While the Sutta Pitaka does not offer a list of ''kilesa'', the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]]'s [[Dhammasangani]] (Dhs. 1229''ff''.) and [[Vibhanga]] (Vbh. XII) as well as in the post-canonical [[Visuddhimagga]] (Vsm. XXII 49, 65) enumerate ten defilements (''dasa kilesa-vatthūni'') as follows:
# greed (''[[Raga (Buddhism)|lobha]]'')
# hate (''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|dosa]]'')
# delusion (''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'')
# conceit (''[[māna]]'')
# wrong views (''[[View (Buddhism)|micchāditthi]]'')
# doubt (''[[vicikicchā]]'')
# torpor (''[[thīna|thīna{{IAST|ṃ}}]]'')
# restlessness (''[[uddhacca|uddhacca{{IAST|ṃ}}]]'')
# shamelessness (''[[ahirika|ahirika{{IAST|ṃ}}]]'')
# recklessness (''[[anottappa|anottappa{{IAST|ṃ}}]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-5), p. 217; and, Nyanatiloka (1988), entry for "kilesa," retrieved 2008-02-09 from "BuddhaSasana" at http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/bud-dict/dic3_k.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vibhanga also includes an eightfold list (''a{{IAST|ṭṭ}}ha kilesa-vatthūni'') composed of the first eight of the above ten.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Pali literature, the first three ''kilesa'' in the above tenfold Abhidhamma list (''lobha dosa moha'') are known as the "unwholesome roots" (''akusala-mūla'' or the root of [[Buddhist views on sin|akusala]]); and, their opposites (''alobha adosa amoha'') are the three "wholesome roots" (''kusala-mūla'' or the root of [[Merit (Buddhism)#Puñña, kusala and Nirvana|kusala]]).&lt;ref&gt;In addition to frequent reference in the Abhidhamma and post-canonical Pali literature, references to the unwholesome roots (''akusala-mūla'') are sprinkled throughout the [[Sutta Pitaka]].  For instance, in the [[Digha Nikaya]], it can be found in DN 33 (D iii.215) and DN 34 (D iii.275); in the [[Majjhima Nikaya]], it is the first of several topics discussed by Ven. [[Sariputta]] in the well-known ''[[Sammaditthi Sutta|Sammādi{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hi Sutta]]'' ("Right View Discourse," MN 9); and, in the [[Itivuttaka]], a brief discourse on three unwholesome roots starts off the "Section of the Threes" (Iti. 50).  However, in ''none'' of these Sutta Pitaka texts are the three unwholesome roots referred to as ''kilesa''.  Such an association appears to begin in the Abhidhamma texts.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of such a wholesome or unwholesome root during a mental, verbal or bodily action conditions future states of consciousness and associated mental factors (see [[Karma (Buddhism)|Karma]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nyanatiloka (1988), entry for "mūla," retrieved 2008-02-09 from "BuddhaSasana" at http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/bud-dict/dic3_m.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

In the 5th-century CE [[atthakatha|commentarial]] [[Visuddhimagga]], in its discussion of "Dependent Origination" (Pali: ''[[paticca-samuppada]]'') ([[Visuddhimagga|Vsm]]. XVII), it presents different expository methods for understanding this teaching's twelve factors (''[[Twelve Nidanas|nidana]]'').  One method (Vsm. XVII, 298) divides the twelve factors into three "rounds" (''va{{IAST|ṭṭ}}a''):
* the "round of defilements" (''kilesa-va{{IAST|ṭṭ}}a'')
* the "round of [[Karma in Buddhism|kamma]]" (''kamma-va{{IAST|ṭṭ}}a'')
* the "round of results" (''[[vipaka|vipāka]]-va{{IAST|ṭṭ}}a'').&lt;ref name="Vsm_xvii_298" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the [[Paracanonical texts (Theravada Buddhism)|paracanonical]] [[Nettipakarana|Nettipakara{{IAST|ṇ}}a]]'s "round of suffering, round of action, round of defilements" (''dukkhava{{IAST|ṭṭ}}o kammava{{IAST|ṭṭ}}o kilesava{{IAST|ṭṭ}}o'') (Nett. i.95).{{cite web |url=http://www.bodhgayanews.net/tipitaka.php?title=&amp;record=15231 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719223228/http://www.bodhgayanews.net/tipitaka.php?title=&amp;record=15231 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this framework (see Figure to the right, starting from the bottom of the Figure), ''kilesa'' ([[Avidya (Buddhism)|"ignorance"]]) conditions ''kamma'' ([[sankhara|"formations"]]) which conditions [[vipaka|results]] ([[vinnana|"consciousness"]] through [[vedana|"feelings"]]) which in turn condition ''kilesa'' ([[tanha|"craving"]] and [[upadana|"clinging"]]) which condition ''kamma'' ([[bhava|"becoming"]]) and so on.&lt;ref name="Vsm_xvii_297"&gt;Strictly speaking, in this framework the [[Visuddhimagga]] (Vsm. XVII, 298) does not ''explicitly'' identify "birth" (''[[Jāti (Buddhism)|jāti]]'') and "aging-death" (''[[Jarāmaraṇa|jarāmara{{IAST|ṇ}}a]]'') with results (''[[vipāka]]'').  Nonetheless, in the preceding paragraph (Vsm. XVII, 297), [[Buddhaghosa]] writes: "''And in the future fivefold fruit'': the five beginning with consciousness.  These are expressed by the term 'birth'.  But 'ageing-and-death' is the ageing and the death of these [five] themselves" (Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli, 1991, p. 599, v. 297; square-brackets in original).  Thus, "birth" and "ageing and death" become correlates or expressions of the five-fold "results" sequence.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhaghosa]] (Vsm. XVII, 298) concludes:
:So this [[Wheel of Becoming]], having a triple round with these three rounds, should be understood to spin, revolving again and again, forever; for the conditions are not cut off as long as the round of defilements is not cut off.&lt;ref name="Vsm_xvii_298"&gt;Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli (1991), p. 599, v. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;
As can be seen, in this framework, the round of defilements consists of:
* ignorance (''[[avijjā]]'')
* craving (''[[taṇhā|{{IAST|taṇhā}}]]'')
* clinging (''[[upadana|ūpādānā]]'').&lt;ref name="Vsm_xvii_298" /&gt;

Elsewhere in the Visuddhimagga (Vsm. XXII, 88), in the context of the four noble persons (''ariya-puggala'', see [[Four stages of enlightenment]]), the text refers to a precursor to the attainment of [[nibbana]] as being the complete eradication of "the defilements that are the root of the round" (''va{{IAST|ṭṭ}}a-mūla-kilesā'').&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} (1991), p. 715.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sanskrit Sravaka &amp; Mahayana literature ==

=== Three poisons ===
{{Main|Three poisons (Buddhism)}}

The three kleshas of ignorance, attachment and aversion are referred to as the '''''three poisons''''' (Skt. ''triviṣa'')  in the Mahayana tradition and as the '''''three unwholesome roots''''' (Pāli, ''akusala-mūla''; Skt. ''akuśala-mūla'' )  in the Therevada tradition. These three poisons (or unwholesome roots) are considered to be the root of all the other kleshas.

=== Five poisons ===
In the Mahayana tradition, the five main kleshas are referred to as the '''''five poisons''''' (Sanskrit: ''pañca kleśaviṣa''; Tibetan-Wylie: ''dug lnga'').

The five poisons consist of the ''three poisons'' with two additional poisons: pride and jealousy. The five poisons are:&lt;ref name="pr1"&gt;Padmakara (1998), p. 336, 414. (from the glossary)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Longchen Yeshe Dorje (Kangyur Rinpoche) (2010). p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Six root kleshas of the Abhidharma ===
The ''[[Abhidharma-kośa]]'' identifies six root kleshas (''mūlakleśa''):
* Attachment ([[Raga (Buddhism)|''raga'']])
* Anger (''[[pratigha]]'')
* Ignorance (''[[Avidya (Buddhism)|avidya]]'')
* Pride/Conceit (''[[māna]]'')
* Doubt (''[[vicikitsa]]'')
* Wrong view/False view/Opinionatedness ([[View (Buddhism)|''dṛiṣṭi'']])&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Location 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] school of Buddhism, Muller (2004: p.&amp;nbsp;207) states that the Six Klesha arise due to the "...reification of an 'imagined self' (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|satkāya-dṛṣṭi}}'')".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acmuller.net/articles/reinterpretations_of_the_hindrances.html Muller (2004).]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mahaparinirvana Sutra ===
The [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]] lists approximately 50 kleshas, including those of attachment, aversion, stupidity, jealousy, pride, heedlessness, haughtiness, ill-will, quarrelsomeness, wrong livelihood, deceit, consorting with immoral friends, attachment to pleasure, to sleep, to eating, and to yawning; delighting in excessive talking and uttering lies, as well as thoughts of harm.

=== Two obscurations ===
Mahayana literature often features an enumeration of "two obscurations" (Wylie: ''sgrib gnyis''), the "obscuration of conflicting emotions" (Sanskrit: ''kleśa-avaraṇa'', Wylie: ''nyon-mongs-pa'i sgrib-ma'') and the "obscuration concerning the knowable" (Sanskrit: ''jñeya-avaraṇa'', Wylie: ''shes-bya'i sgrib-ma'').&lt;ref&gt;Dorje, Jikdrel Yeshe ([[Dudjom Rinpoche]], author), translated and edited: [[Gyurme Dorje]] and [[Matthew Kapstein]] (1991).

== Contemporary glosses ==
Contemporary translators have used many different English words to translate the term ''kleshas'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Epstein|Epstein, Mark]] (2009) http://www.quietspaces.com/kleshas.html&lt;/ref&gt; such as: afflictions, passions, destructive emotions, disturbing emotions, etc.

The following table provides brief descriptions of the term kleshas given by various contemporary Buddhist teachers and scholars:

|-
| Afflictive emotions
| ... those mind states that cause suffering, such as depression, fear, hatred, anger, jealousy and so on – it's a long list!
| [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]]. ''[http://www.dharma.org/ims/ai_news_jg_interview.html The Emerging Western Buddhism: An Interview with Joseph Goldstein]''.

|-
| Afflictive emotions
| In general, any defilement or emotion which obscures the mind. They are often summarized as three: ignorance, attachment and aversion. All other negative predispositions are produced on the basis of these three.
| Khenchen Konchog Gyaltshen (2009). ''A Complete Guide to the Buddhist Path''. p.&amp;nbsp;451 (from the glossary)

|-
| Afflictions
| Mental factors that produce states of mental torment both immediately and in the long term. The five principal kleshas, which are sometimes called poisons, are attachment, aversion, ignorance, pride, and jealousy.
| Longchen Yeshe Dorje (Kangyur Rinpoche) (2010). ''Treasury of Precious Qualities''. p.&amp;nbsp;492 (from the glossary)

|-
| Conditioning Factors or Mental Afflictions
| The processes that not only describe what we perceive, but also determine our responses.
| [[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche]] (2008). ''The Joy of Living''. p.&amp;nbsp;115

|-
| Mental afflictions
| In Tibetan a mental affliction is defined as a mental process that has the function of disrupting the equilibrium of the mind. They all have that in common, whether or not there is a strong emotional component to it.
| [[Daniel Goleman|Goleman, Daniel]] (2008). ''Destructive Emotions: A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama''. Kindle Locations 2553–2555.

|-
| Destructive emotions
| Fundamentally, a destructive emotion—which is also referred to as an ‘obscuring’ or ‘afflictive’ mental factor—is something that prevents the mind from ascertaining reality as it is. With a destructive emotion, there will always be a gap between the way things appear and the ways things are.
| [[Daniel Goleman|Goleman, Daniel]] (2008). ''Destructive Emotions: A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama''. Kindle Locations 1779–1781.

|-
| Defilements
| These are unskilful factors such as greed, hate, delusion, opinionatedness and lack of moral concern. Whereas the term ‘[[Five hindrances|hindrance]]’ refers to five sticking points, ‘defilement’ is often used without any definite list, but to refer to any function of the mind which is led by unskilful factors.
| [[Ajahn Sucitto]] (2011). ''Meditation, A Way of Awakening''. Amaravati Publications. p.&amp;nbsp;263. (from the glossary)

| Kleshas
| Kleshas are the strong conflicting emotions that spin off and heighten when we get caught by aversion and attraction.

|-
| Kleshas
| Kleshas are properties that dull the mind and are the basis for all unwholesome actions. The three main kleshas are passion, aggression, and ignorance.
| [[Chögyam Trungpa]]. ''The Truth of Suffering and the Path of Liberation''. Edited by Judy L. Lief. Shambhala. p.&amp;nbsp;134 (from the glossary)

|-
| Kleshas
| The basic idea is that certain powerful reactions have the capacity to take hold of us and drive our behavior. We believe in these reactions more than we believe in anything else, and they become the means by which we both hide from ourselves and attempt to cope with a world of ceaseless change and unpredictability. The three poisons of greed, hatred, and ignorance are the classic Buddhist examples, but others include conceit, skeptical doubt, and so-called "speculative" views ... 
| [[Mark Epstein]]. ''Going on Being: Buddhism and the Way of Change, a Positive Psychology for the West''. http://www.quietspaces.com/kleshas.html

|-
| Kleshas
| The emotional obscurations (in contrast to intellectual obscurations), usually translated as "poisons" or "defilements." The three main klesas are ignorance, hatred, and desire. The five klesas include these three along with pride and envy.
|
[[Thrangu Rinpoche]] (1993). ''The Practice of Tranquility &amp; Insight: A Guide to Tibetan Buddhist Mediation'' (p.&amp;nbsp;152). Snow Lion. Kindle Edition. p.&amp;nbsp;152 (from the glossary)
|}

== Overcoming the kleshas ==
All Buddhist schools teach that through Tranquility ([[Samatha]]) meditation the kilesas are pacified, though not eradicated, and through Insight ([[Vipassana]]) the true nature of the kilesas and the mind itself is understood.  When the empty nature of the Self and the Mind is fully understood, there is no longer a root for the disturbing emotions to be attached to, and the disturbing emotions lose their power to distract the mind.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12974">'''Lubachevsky-Stillinger (compression) algorithm''' (LS algorithm, LSA, or LS protocol) is a numerical procedure suggested by [[F. H. Stillinger]] and B.D. Lubachevsky that simulates or imitates a physical process of compressing an assembly of hard particles&lt;ref name="StillingerLubachevskyJStat"&gt;B. D. Lubachevsky and F. H. Stillinger, Geometric properties of random disk packings, J. Statistical Physics 60 (1990), 561-583 http://www.princeton.edu/~fhs/geodisk/geodisk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. As the LSA may need thousands of arithmetic operations even for a few particles, it is usually carried out on a [[digital computer]].[[File:1000 triangles packed in rectangle.png|thumb|Using a variant of Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm, 1000 congruent isosceles triangles are randomly packed by compression in a rectangle with periodic (wrap-around) boundary. The rectangle which is the period of pattern repetition in both directions is shown. Packing density is 0.8776]]

==Phenomenology==
A physical process of compression often involves a contracting hard boundary of the container, such as a piston pressing against the particles. The LSA is able to simulate such a scenario.&lt;ref&gt;F. H. Stillinger and B. D. Lubachevsky,  Crystalline-Amorphous Interface Packings for Disks and Spheres, J. Stat. Phys. 73, 497-514 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the LSA was originally introduced in the setting without a hard boundary&lt;ref name="StillingerLubachevskyJStat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.D. Lubachevsky, How to Simulate Billiards and Similar Systems, Journal of Computational Physics Volume 94 Issue 2, May 1991 https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/cond-mat/pdf/0503/0503627v2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; where the virtual particles were "swelling" or expanding in a fixed, finite virtual volume with [[periodic boundary conditions]]. The absolute sizes of the particles were increasing but particle-to-particle relative sizes remained constant. In general, the LSA can handle an external compression and an internal particle expansion, both occurring simultaneously and possibly, but not necessarily, combined with a hard boundary. In addition, the boundary can be mobile.

In a final, compressed, or "jammed" state, some particles are not  jammed, they are able to move within "cages" formed by their immobile, jammed neighbors and the hard boundary, if any. These free-to-move particles are not an artifact, or pre-designed, or target feature of the LSA, but rather a real phenomenon. The simulation revealed this phenomenon, somewhat unexpectedly for the authors of the LSA. Frank H. Stillinger coined the term "rattlers" for the free-to-move particles, because if one physically shakes a compressed bunch of hard particles, the rattlers will be rattling.

In the "pre-jammed" mode when the density of the configuration is low and when the particles are mobile, the compression and  expansion can be stopped, if so desired. Then the LSA, in effect, would be simulating a [[granular flow]]. Various dynamics of the instantaneous collisions can be simulated such as: with or without a full restitution, with or without tangential friction.
Differences in masses of the particles can be taken into account. It is also easy and sometimes proves useful to "fluidize" a jammed configuration, by decreasing the sizes of all or some of the particles. Another possible extension of the LSA is replacing the hard collision [[force]] [[potential]] (zero outside the particle, infinity at or inside) with a piece-wise constant [[force]] [[potential]]. The LSA thus modified would approximately simulate [[molecular dynamics]] with continuous
short range particle-particle force interaction. External [[force fields]], such as [[gravitation]], can be also introduced, as long as the inter-collision motion of each particle can be represented by a simple one-step calculation.

Using LSA for spherical particles of different sizes and/or for jamming in a non-commeasureable size container proved to be a useful technique for generating and studying micro-structures formed under conditions of a [[crystallographic defect]]&lt;ref&gt;F. H. Stillinger and B. D. Lubachevsky. Patterns of Broken Symmetry in the Impurity-Perturbed Rigid Disk Crystal, J. Stat. Phys. 78, 1011-1026 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[geometrical frustration]]&lt;ref&gt;Boris D. Lubachevsky and Frank H. Stillinger, Epitaxial frustration in deposited packings of rigid disks and spheres. Physical Review E 70:44, 41604 (2004) https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/cond-mat/pdf/0405/0405650v5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boris D. Lubachevsky, Ron L. Graham, and Frank H. Stillinger, Spontaneous Patterns in Disk Packings. Visual Mathematics, 1995. http://vismath5.tripod.com/lub/&lt;/ref&gt; It should be added  that the original LS protocol was designed primarily for spheres of same or different sizes.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Kansal, S. Torquato, and F.H. Stillinger, Computer Generation of Dense Polydisperse Sphere Packings, J. Chem. Phys. 117, 8212-8218 (2002) http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=13990882&lt;/ref&gt;

Any deviation from the spherical (or circular in two dimensions) shape, even a simplest one, when spheres are replaced with ellipsoids (or ellipses in two dimensions),&lt;ref&gt;A. Donev, F.H. Stillinger, P.M. Chaikin, and S. Torquato, Unusually Dense Crystal Packings of Ellipsoids, Physical Review Letters 92, 255506 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; causes thus modified LSA to slow down substantially.
But as long as the shape is spherical, the LSA is able to handle particle assemblies in tens to hundreds of thousands
on today's (2011) standard [[personal computers]]. Only a very limited experience was reported&lt;ref&gt;M. Skoge, A. Donev, F.H. Stillinger, and S. Torquato, Packing Hyperspheres in High-Dimensional Euclidean Spaces, Phys. Rev. E 74, 041127 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
in using the LSA in dimensions higher than 3.

==Implementation==
The state of particle jamming is achieved via simulating a [[granular flow]]. The flow is rendered as a [[discrete event simulation]], the events being particle-particle or particle-boundary collisions. Ideally, the calculations should have been
performed with the infinite precision. Then the jamming would have occurred [[ad infinitum]]. In practice, the precision is finite as is the available resolution of representing the real numbers in the [[computer memory]], for example, a [[double-precision]] resolution. The real calculations are stopped when inter-collision runs of the non-rattler particles become
smaller than an explicitly or implicitly specified small threshold. For example, it is useless to continue the calculations when inter-collision runs are smaller than the roundoff error.

The LSA is efficient in the sense that the events are processed essentially in an [[Event-driven programming|event-driven]] fashion, rather than in a 
time-driven fashion. This means almost no calculation is wasted on computing or maintaining the positions and velocities
of the particles between the collisions. Among the [[Event-driven programming|event-driven]] algorithms intended for the same task of simulating [[granular flow]], like, for example, the algorithm of D.C. Rapaport,&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Rapaport, The Event Scheduling Problem in Molecular Dynamic Simulation, Journal of Computational Physics Volume 34 Issue 2, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; the LSA is distinguished by a simpler [[data structure]] and data handling.

For any particle at any stage of calculations the LSA keeps record of only two events: an old, already processed committed event, which comprises the committed event [[time stamp]], the particle state (including position and velocity), and, perhaps, the "partner" which could be another particle or boundary identification, the one with which the particle collided in the past,
and a new event proposed for a future processing with a similar set of parameters. The new event is not committed. The maximum of the committed old event times must never exceed the minimum of the non-committed new event times.

Next particle to be examined by the algorithm has the current minimum of new event times. At examining the chosen particle,
what was previously the new event, is declared to be the old one and to be committed, whereas the next new event is being scheduled, with its new time stamp, new state, and new partner, if any. As the next new event for a particle is being set,
some of the neighboring particles may update their non-committed new events to better account for the new information.

As the calculations of the LSA progress, the collision rates of particles may and usually do increase. Still the LSA successfully approaches the jamming state as long as those rates remain comparable among all the particles, except for the rattlers. (Rattlers experience consistently low collision rates. This property allows one to detect rattlers.) However, 
it is possible for a few particles, even just for a single particle, to experience a very high collision rate along the approach to a certain simulated time. The rate will be increasing without a bound in proportion to the rates of collisions in the rest of the particle ensemble. If this happens, then the simulation will be stuck in time, it won't be able to progress toward the state of jamming.

The stuck-in-time failure can also occur when simulating a granular flow without particle compression or expansion. This failure mode was recognized by the practitioners of granular flow simulations as an "inelastic collapse" &lt;ref&gt;S. McNamara, and W.R. Young, Inelastic collapse in two dimensions, Physical Review E 50: pp. R28-R31, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; because it often occurs in such simulations when the [[restitution coefficient]] in collisions is low (i.e. inelastic). The failure is not specific to only the LSA algorithm. Techniques to avoid the failure have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Drozd, Computer Simulation of Granular Matter: A Study of An Industrial Grinding Mill, Thesis, Univ. Western Ontario, Canada, 2004. {{cite web |url=http://imaging.robarts.ca/~jdrozd/thesisjd.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818102135/http://imaging.robarts.ca/~jdrozd/thesisjd.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The LSA was a by-product of an attempt to find a fair measure of [[speedup]] in [[Parallel algorithm|parallel]] [[simulations]]. The [[Time Warp (algorithm)|Time Warp]] parallel simulation algorithm by David Jefferson was advanced as a method to simulate asynchronous spatial interactions of fighting units in combat models on a [[parallel computer]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Wieland, and D. Jefferson, Case studies in serial and parallel simulations, Proc. 1989 Int'l Conf. Parallel Processing, Vol.III, F. Ris, and M. Kogge, Eds., pp. 255-258.&lt;/ref&gt; Colliding particles models&lt;ref&gt;P. Hontales, B. Beckman, et al., Performance of the colliding pucks simulation of the Time Warp operating systems, Proc. 1989 SCS Multiconference, Simulation Series, SCS, Vol. 21, No. 2, pp. 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt; offered similar simulation tasks with spatial interactions of particles but clear of the details that are non-essential for exposing the simulation techniques. The [[speedup]] was presented as the ratio of the execution time on a [[uniprocessor]] over that on a [[multiprocessor]], when executing the same parallel Time Warp algorithm. Boris D. Lubachevsky noticed that such a speedup assessment might be faulty because executing a [[parallel algorithm]] for a task on a uniprocessor is not necessarily the fastest way to perform the task on such a machine. The LSA was created in an attempt to produce a faster uniprocessor simulation and hence to have a more fair assessment of the [[parallel speedup]]. Later on, a parallel simulation algorithm,
different from the Time Warp, was also proposed, that, when run on a uniprocessor, reduces to the LSA.&lt;ref&gt;B.D. Lubachevsky, Simulating Billiards: Serially and in Parallel, Int.J. in Computer Simulation, Vol. 2 (1992), pp. 373-411.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7546">In [[economics]], the '''lump of labour fallacy''' is the idea that there is a fixed amount of work—a lump of labour—to be done within an economy which can be distributed to create more or fewer jobs. It was considered a [[fallacy]] in 1891 by economist [[David Frederick Schloss]], who held that the amount of work is not fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/l|title=Economics A-Z terms beginning with L|website=The Economist|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originated to rebut the idea that reducing the number of hours employees are allowed to labour during the working day would lead to a reduction in unemployment. The term is also commonly used to describe the belief that increasing labour productivity, immigration, or automation causes an increase in [[unemployment]]. Whereas some argue immigrants displace a country's workers, others believe this to be a fallacy by arguing that the number of jobs in the economy is not fixed and that immigration increases the size of the economy, thus creating more jobs.&lt;ref&gt;John Bercow [http://www.smf.co.uk/index.php?name=UpDownload&amp;req=getit&amp;lid=136 Incoming assets: Why Tories should change policy on immigration and asylum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105552/http://www.smf.co.uk/index.php?name=UpDownload&amp;req=getit&amp;lid=136 |date=28 September 2007 }}, [[Social Market Foundation]], October 2005, accessed 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Cooley, Macha Farrant and Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah [http://www.ippr.org.uk/members/download.asp?f=/ecomm/files/selecting_wisely.pdf&amp;a=skip Selecting wisely: Making managed migration work for Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311022019/http://www.ippr.org.uk/members/download.asp?f=%2Fecomm%2Ffiles%2Fselecting_wisely.pdf&amp;a=skip |date=11 March 2007 }}, [[Institute for Public Policy Research]], November 2005, accessed 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The lump of labor fallacy is also known as the '''lump of jobs fallacy''', '''fallacy of labour scarcity''', '''fixed pie fallacy''' or the '''zero-sum fallacy''' – due to its ties to [[zero-sum game]]s. Some economics studies have noted criticism and complexities with the fallacy claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Tom|year=2007|title=Why economists dislike a lump of labor|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/tafrsocec/v_3a65_3ay_3a2007_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a279-291.htm|journal=Review of Social Economy|volume=65|issue=3|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immigration ==
The lump of labour fallacy has been applied to concerns around immigration and labour. Given a fixed availability of employment, the lump of labour position argues that allowing immigration of working-age people reduces the availability of work for native-born workers ("they are taking our jobs").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2017/08/24/do-immigrants-steal-jobs-from-american-workers/|title=Do immigrants “steal” jobs from American workers?|last=Hoban|first=Brennan|date=2017-08-24|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, skilled immigrating workers can bring capabilities that are not available in the native workforce, for example in academic research or [[information technology]]. Additionally, immigrating workforces also create new jobs by expanding demand, thus creating more jobs, either directly by setting up businesses (therefore requiring local services or workers), or indirectly by raising consumption. As an example, a greater population that eats more groceries will increase demand from shops, which will therefore require additional shop staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Simply the best? Highly-skilled migrants and the UK's knowledge economy|date=28 June 2012|url=http://www.theworkfoundation.com/Reports/315/Simply-the-best-Highlyskilled-migrants-and-the-UKs-knowledge-economy|author1=Laurence Hopkins|author2=Charles Levy|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment regulations ==
Advocates of restricting working hours regulation may assume that there is a fixed amount of work to be done within the economy. By reducing the amount that those who are already employed are allowed to work, the remaining amount will then accrue to the unemployed. This policy was adopted by the governments of [[Herbert Hoover]] in the [[United States]] and [[Lionel Jospin]] in [[France]], in the [[35-hour workweek|35-hour working week]] (though in France various exemptions to the law were granted by later centre-right governments).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-08-12/france-s-35-hour-week-has-done-its-job|title=France's 35-Hour Week Has Done Its Job|last=Bershidsky|first=Leonid|date=2015-08-12|newspaper=Bloomberg View|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many economists contend that such proposals are likely to be ineffective, alleging that there are usually substantial administrative costs associated with employing more workers. These can include additional costs in recruitment, training, and management that would increase average cost per unit of output. This overall would lead to a reduced production per worker, and may even result in higher unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/3230|title=The 35-hour workweek in France: Straightjacket or welfare improvement?|last=Estevão, Sá|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Economic Policy July 2008 pp. 417–463 Printed in Great Britain © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2008.|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early retirement ==
[[Early retirement]] has been used to induce workers to accept termination of employment before retirement age following the employer's diminished labour needs. Government support for the practice has come from the belief that this should lead to a reduction in unemployment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The unsustainability of this practice has now been recognised, and the trend in Europe is now towards postponement of the retirement age.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In an editorial in ''[[The Economist]]'' a thought experiment is proposed in which old people leave the workforce in favour of young people, on whom they become dependent for their living through state benefits. It is then argued that since growth depends on having either more workers or greater productivity, the society cannot really become more prosperous by paying an increasing number of its citizens unproductively. The article also points out that even early retirees with private pension funds become a burden on society as they also depend on equity and bond income generated by workers.&lt;ref name="KeepOT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21547263|title=Keep on trucking: Why the old should not make way for the young|date=11 February 2012|author=Buttonwood|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], '''marginal revenue''' (R') is the additional revenue that will be generated by increasing product sales by one unit.&lt;ref name="Essentials"&gt;Bradley R. chiller, "Essentials of Economics", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory"&gt;Edwin Mansfield, "Micro-Economics Theory and Applications, 3rd Edition", New York and London:W.W. Norton and Company, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro"&gt;Roger LeRoy Miller, "Intermediate Microeconomics  Theory Issues Applications, Third Edition", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg"&gt;Tirole, Jean,  "The Theory of Industrial Organization", Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary"&gt;John Black, "Oxford Dictionary of Economics", New York: Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also be described as the [[total revenue|unit revenue]] the last item sold has generated for the firm.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary" /&gt;  In a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] market, the additional revenue generated by selling an additional unit of a good is equal to the price the firm is able to charge the buyer of the good.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan &amp; Sheffrin (2003), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because a firm in a [[perfect competition|competitive market]] will always get the same price for every unit it sells regardless of the number of units the firm sells since the firm's sales can never impact the industry's price.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt; However, a [[monopoly]] determines the entire [[industry]]'s sales.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;  As a result, it will have to lower the price of all units sold to increase sales by 1 unit.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;  Therefore, the marginal revenue generated is always lower than the price the firm is able to charge for the unit sold, since each reduction in price causes unit revenue to decline on every good the firm sells.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;  The marginal revenue (the increase in [[total revenue]]) is the price the firm gets on the additional unit sold, less the revenue lost by reducing the price on all other units that were sold prior to the decrease in price. 

A firms profits will be maximized when marginal revenue (MR) equals [[Marginal cost|marginal cost (MC)]]. If &lt;math&gt;MR &gt; MC&lt;/math&gt; then a firm should increase output for more profits, if &lt;math&gt;MR &lt; MC&lt;/math&gt; then a firm should decrease output for additional profits. A firm should choose the output level which is profit maximizing under perfect competition theory &lt;math&gt;MR = MC&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/432989728|title=Managerial economics : a strategic approach|last=David.|first=Prentice,|last2=1962-|first2=Waschik, Robert G.,|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9780415495172|location=|pages=33|oclc=432989728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Marginal revenue is equal to the ratio of the change in revenue for some change in quantity sold to that change in quantity sold. This can also be represented as a derivative when the change in quantity sold becomes arbitrarily small.  More formally, define the revenue function to be the following
:&lt;math&gt;R(q)=P(q)\cdot q &lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[product rule]], marginal revenue is then given by
:&lt;math&gt;R'(q)=P(q) + P'(q)\cdot q&lt;/math&gt;.

For a firm facing perfect competition, price does not change with quantity sold (&lt;math&gt;P'(q)=0&lt;/math&gt;), so marginal revenue is equal to price. For a [[monopoly]], the price decreases with quantity sold (&lt;math&gt;P'(q)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;), so marginal revenue is less than price (for positive &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;).

==Marginal revenue curve==

The marginal revenue curve is affected by the same factors as the demand curve - changes in income, change in the prices of complements and substitutes, change in populations. These factors can cause the R curve to shift and rotate.&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S Price 2002. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship between marginal revenue and elasticity==
The relationship between marginal revenue and the [[price elasticity of demand|elasticity of demand]] by the firm's customers can be derived as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Perloff (2008) p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R' = \frac{dR}{dQ} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle + \left( \frac{d \langle R \rangle}{dQ} \right) Q &lt;/math&gt;
:as &lt;math&gt; \langle R \rangle = P &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle \left[ 1 + \frac{d \langle R \rangle}{dQ} \frac{Q}{\langle R \rangle} \right] &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle (1 + 1 / e_{\langle R \rangle})&lt;/math&gt;

where e is the [[price elasticity of demand]]. If demand is inelastic (e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1) then R' will be negative, because to sell a marginal (infinitesimal) unit the firm would have to lower the selling price so much that it would lose more revenue on the pre-existing units than it would gain on the incremental unit. If demand is elastic (e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1) R' will be positive, because the additional unit would not drive down the price by so much. If the firm is a perfect competitor, so that it is so small in the market that its quantity produced and sold has no effect on the price, then the price elasticity of demand is negative infinity, and marginal revenue simply equals the (market-determined) price.

==Marginal revenue and rule-of-thumb pricing==
Profit maximization requires that a firm produces where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. Firm managers are unlikely to have complete information concerning their marginal revenue function or their marginal costs. Fortunately, the profit maximization conditions can be expressed in a “more easily applicable form” or rule of thumb.

:R' = C' 
:R' = &lt;R&gt;(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
:MC = &lt;R&gt;(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
:MC = &lt;R&gt; + &lt;R&gt;/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
:(&lt;R&gt; - C')/ &lt;R&gt; = - 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="Pindyck, R 2001 p. 334"&gt;Pindyck, R &amp; Rubinfeld, D (2001) p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Markup is the difference between price and marginal cost. The formula states that markup as a percentage of price equals the negative of the inverse of elasticity of demand.&lt;ref name="Pindyck, R 2001 p. 334"/&gt; Alternatively, the relationship can be expressed as:
:&lt;R&gt; = C'/(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)

Thus if e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is - 2 and mc is $5.00 then price is $10.00.

(&lt;R&gt; - C')/ &lt;R&gt; = - 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is called the Lerner index after economist Abba Lerner.&lt;ref name="Perloff"&gt;Perloff (2008) p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lerner index is a measure of market power - the ability of a firm to charge a price that exceeds marginal cost.  The index varies from zero to 1. The greater the difference between price and marginal cost the closer the index value is to 1. The Lerner index increases as demand becomes less elastic.&lt;ref name="Perloff"/&gt;

'''Example'''
If a company can sell 10 units at $20 each or 11 units at $19 each, then the marginal revenue from the eleventh unit is (11 × 19) - (10 × 20) = $9.

The '''microscopic scale''' (from {{Lang-el|μικρός}}, ''mikrós'', "small" and σκοπέω, ''skopéō'' "look") is the scale of objects and events smaller than those that can easily be seen by the [[naked eye]], requiring a [[lens (optics)|lens]] or [[microscope]] to see them clearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The microscopic scale|url=http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Exploring-with-Microscopes/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/The-microscopic-scale|website=Science Learning Hub|publisher=The University of Waikato|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physics]], the microscopic scale is sometimes regarded as the scale between the [[macroscopic scale]] and the [[quantum realm|quantum scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=What in the (quantum) world is macroscopic?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=September 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=896–905|doi=10.1119/1.4878358|bibcode = 2014AmJPh..82..896J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reif|first=F.|title=Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics|year=1965|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=007-051800-9|edition=International student edition.|page=2|quote=We shall call a system {{'}}''micro''scopic' (i.e., {{'}}''small'' scale') if it is roughly of atomic dimensions or smaller (say of the order of 10 [[Angstrom|Å]] or less).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microscopic units and measurements are used to classify and describe very small objects.  One common microscopic [[length scale]] unit is the [[micrometre]] (also called a ''micron'') (symbol: μm), which is one millionth of a [[metre]].

==Biology==
By convention, the microscopic scale also includes classes of objects that are most commonly too small to see but of which some members are large enough to be observed with the eye. Such groups include the ''[[Cladocera]]'', planktonic green [[algae]] of which ''[[Volvox]]'' is readily observable, and the protozoa of which ''[[Stentor (protozoa)|stentor]]'' can be easily seen without aid.
The submicroscopic scale similarly includes objects that are too small to see with an [[optical microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=What in the (quantum) world is macroscopic?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=September 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=896–905|doi=10.1119/1.4878358|bibcode = 2014AmJPh..82..896J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3412">'''Mind at Large''' is a [[concept]] from ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]]. This philosophy was influenced by the ideas of [[C. D. Broad]]. [[Psychedelic drug]]s are thought to disable filters which inhibit or quell signals related to mundane functions from reaching the conscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Psychedelic Experience FAQ|url=https://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_experience_faq.shtml#4f|website=Erowid|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aforementioned books, Huxley explores the idea that the human mind filters reality, partly because handling the details of all of the impressions and images coming in would be unbearable, partly because it has been taught to do so. He believes that [[psychoactive drug]]s can partly remove this filter, which leaves the drug user exposed to Mind at Large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|title=The Doors of Perception|date=1954|publisher=Perennial Classics|isbn=0-06-059518-3|page=6|url=https://www.maps.org/images/pdf/books/HuxleyA1954TheDoorsOfPerception.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an experiment with British psychiatrist, [[Humphrey Osmond]], Huxley was administered [[mescaline]], and was prompted by Osmond to comment on the various stimuli around him, such as books and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|title=The Doors of Perception|date=1954|publisher=Perennial Classics|isbn=0-06-059518-3|page=5|url=https://www.maps.org/images/pdf/books/HuxleyA1954TheDoorsOfPerception.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversation that was recorded in Huxley's book mainly concerned his thoughts on what he said in the recordings. He observed that everyday objects lose their functionality, and suddenly exist "as such"; space and dimension become irrelevant, with perceptions seemingly being enlarged, and at times even overwhelming.

According to ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]],

{{quote|Each person is at each moment capable of remembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe. The function of the brain and nervous system is to protect us from being overwhelmed and confused by this mass of largely useless and irrelevant knowledge, by shutting out most of what we should otherwise perceive or remember at any moment, and leaving only that very small and special selection which is likely to be practically useful. According to such a theory, each one of us is potentially Mind at Large.}}
 
In ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Huxley also stated: "In the final stage of [[ego death|egolessness]] there is an 'obscure knowledge' that All is in all—that All is actually each. This is as near, I take it, as a finite mind can ever come to 'perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe.'"

The Mind at Large is also the name of a psychedelic blues band, from Greater Manchester, who have gained an audience due to their underground free acid parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://themindatlarge.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6112">'''Minimum distance estimation (MDE)''' is a statistical method for fitting a mathematical model to data, usually the [[Empirical distribution function|empirical distribution]].

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle X_1,\ldots,X_n&lt;/math&gt; be an [[Independent and identically-distributed random variables|independent and identically distributed]] (iid) [[Random variable|random]] [[Random sample|sample]] from a [[Statistical population|population]] with [[Cumulative distribution function|distribution]] &lt;math&gt;F(x;\theta)\colon \theta\in\Theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Theta\subseteq\mathbb{R}^k (k\geq 1)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle F_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[empirical distribution function]] based on the sample.

Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[estimator]] for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \theta&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;F(x;\hat{\theta})&lt;/math&gt; is an estimator for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle F(x;\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;d[\cdot,\cdot]&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] returning some measure of [[Distance#General_case|"distance"]] between the two [[Dependent and independent variables#Mathematics|arguments]]. The functional &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle d&lt;/math&gt; is also called the criterion function.

If there exists a &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}\in\Theta&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d[F(x;\hat{\theta}),F_n(x)]=\inf\{d[F(x;\theta),F_n(x)]; \theta\in\Theta\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''minimum distance estimate''' of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statistics used in estimation==

Most theoretical studies of minimum distance estimation, and most applications, make use of "distance" measures which underlie already-established [[goodness of fit]] tests: the test statistic used in one of these tests is used as the distance measure to be minimised. Below are some examples of statistical tests that have been used for minimum distance estimation.

===Chi-square criterion===

The [[Pearson's chi-square test|chi-square test]] uses as its criterion the sum, over predefined groups, of the squared difference between the increases of the empirical distribution and the estimated distribution, weighted by the increase in the estimate for that group.

===Cramér–von Mises criterion===

The [[Cramér–von Mises criterion]] uses the integral of the squared difference between the empirical and the estimated distribution functions {{harv|Parr|Schucany|1980|p=616}}.

===Kolmogorov–Smirnov criterion===

The [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]] uses the [[supremum]] of the [[absolute difference]] between the empirical and the estimated distribution functions {{harv|Parr|Schucany|1980|p=616}}.

===Anderson–Darling criterion===

The [[Anderson–Darling test]] is similar to the Cramér–von Mises criterion except that the integral is of a weighted version of the squared difference, where the weighting relates the variance of the empirical distribution function {{harv|Parr|Schucany|1980|p=616}}.

==Theoretical results==

The theory of minimum distance estimation is related to that for the asymptotic distribution of the corresponding statistical [[goodness of fit]] tests. Often the cases of the [[Cramér–von Mises criterion]], the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]] and the [[Anderson–Darling test]] are treated simultaneously by treating them as special cases of a more general formulation of a distance measure. Examples of the theoretical results that are available are: [[Consistency (statistics)|consistency]] of the parameter estimates; the asymptotic covariance matrices of the parameter estimates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7413">'''Models of consciousness''' are used to illustrate and aid in understanding and explaining distinctive aspects [[consciousness]]. Sometimes the models are labeled '''theories of consciousness'''. [[Anil Seth]] defines such models as those that relate brain phenomena such as fast irregular electrical activity and widespread brain activation to properties of consciousness such as qualia. Seth allows for different types of models including mathematical, logical, verbal and conceptual models.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarpedia.org/article/Models_of_consciousness&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Seth, A. K. &amp; Baars, B. J. 2005 Neural Darwinism and consciousness. ''Consciousness and Cognition'' 14, 140-168&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neural correlates of consciousness ==
{{Main|Neural correlates of consciousness}}

The [[Neural correlates of consciousness]] (NCC) formalism is used as a major step towards explaining consciousness. The NCC are defined to constitute the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious percept, and consequently sufficient for consciousness. In this formalism, consciousness is viewed as a state-dependent property of some undefined complex, adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system. &lt;ref&gt; Crick F. and Koch C. (1990) Towards a neurobiological theory of consciousness. ''Seminars in Neuroscience'' Vol2, 263–275.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Koch, Christof (2004). The quest for consciousness: a neurobiological approach. Englewood, US-CO: Roberts &amp; Company Publishers. {{ISBN|0-9747077-0-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Squire, Larry R. (2008). ''Fundamental neuroscience'' (3rd ed.). Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-374019-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness ==
{{Main|Eight-circuit model of consciousness}}

[[Timothy Leary]] introduced&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). ''Info-Psychology''. New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Page xii&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and [[Antero Alli]] elaborated  the [[Eight-circuit model of consciousness]] as hypothesis that "suggested eight periods [circuits] and twenty-four stages of neurological evolution".

== Multiple drafts model ==
{{Main|Multiple drafts model}}
[[Daniel Dennett]] proposed a physicalist, information processing based [[multiple drafts model]] of consciousness described more fully in his 1991 book, [[Consciousness Explained]].

== Dehaene–Changeux model ==
{{Main|Dehaene–Changeux model}}

The [[Dehaene–Changeux model]] (DCM), also known as the global neuronal workspace or the global cognitive workspace model is a computer model of the [[Neural correlates of consciousness|neural correlates of consciousness]]  programmed as a neural network.  [[Stanislas Dehaene]] and [[Jean-Pierre Changeux]] introduced this model in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP. ''Experimental and theoretical approaches to conscious processing''. Neuron. 2011 Apr 28;70(2):200-27.&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with [[Bernard Baars]]'s [[Global workspace theory]] for consciousness. 

== Clouding of consciousness ==
{{Main|Clouding of consciousness}}
[[Clouding of consciousness]], also known as brain fog or mental fog, is a term used in medicine denoting an abnormality in the regulation of the overall level of consciousness that is mild and less severe than a delirium&lt;ref&gt;Plum and Posner's diagnosis of stupor and coma. Oxford University Press. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. It is part of an overall model where there's regulation of the "overall level" of the consciousness of the brain and aspects responsible for "arousal" or "wakefulness" and awareness of oneself and of the environment&lt;ref&gt;Augusto Caraceni; Luigi Grassi (2011). ''Delirium: Acute Confusional States in Palliative Medicine''. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Electromagnetic theories of consciousness ==
{{Main|Electromagnetic theories of consciousness}}
 
[[Electromagnetic theories of consciousness]] propose that consciousness can be understood as an electromagnetic phenomenon that occurs when a brain produces an electromagnetic field with specific characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Pockett, Susan. ''The Nature of Consciousness''. {{ISBN|0-595-12215-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pockett, Susan (2012). "The electromagnetic field theory of consciousness: a testable hypothesis about the characteristics of conscious as opposed to non-conscious fields". ''Journal of Consciousness Studies''. 19 (11-12): 191–223.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some electromagnetic theories are also quantum mind theories of consciousness; examples include [[quantum brain dynamics]] (QBD).&lt;ref&gt;Mari Jibu; Kunio Yasue. ''Quantum brain dynamics and consciousness''. {{ISBN|1-55619-183-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orchestrated objective reduction ==
{{Main|Orchestrated objective reduction}}
 
Orchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR) model is based on the hypothesis that consciousness in the brain originates from quantum processes inside neurons, rather than from connections between neurons (the conventional view). The mechanism is held to be associated with molecular structures called [[microtubules]]. The hypothesis was advanced by [[Roger Penrose]] and [[Stuart Hameroff]] and has been the subject of extensive debate&lt;ref&gt;Hameroff, Stuart; Penrose, Roger (March 2014). "Consciousness in the universe: A review of the 'Orch OR' theory". Physics of Life Reviews. Elsevier. 11 (1): 39–78. doi:10.1016/j.plrev.2013.08.002. {{PMID|24070914}}. &lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Hameroff, Stuart; Penrose, Roger (March 2014). "Reply to seven commentaries on "Consciousness in the universe: Review of the 'Orch OR' theory"". ''Physics of Life Reviews''. Elsevier. 11 (1): 104–112. doi:10.1016/j.plrev.2013.11.014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thalamic reticular networking model of consciousness ==

Min proposed in a 2010 paper a Thalamic reticular networking model of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Min, B. K. (2010). A thalamic reticular networking model of consciousness. ''Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling'', 7(1), 10. https://tbiomed.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1742-4682-7-10&lt;/ref&gt; The model suggests consciousness as a "mental state embodied through TRN-modulated synchronization of thalamocortical networks". In this model the [[thalamic reticular nucleus]] (TRN) is suggested as ideally suited for controlling the entire cerebral network, and responsible (via [[GABAergic]] networking) for synchronization of neural activity.

== Functionalism (philosophy of mind) ==
{{Main|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}

Functionalism is a view in the theory of the mind. It states that mental states (beliefs, desires, being in pain, etc.) are constituted solely by their functional role – that is, they have causal relations to other mental states, numerous sensory inputs, and behavioral outputs.

== Sociology of human consciousness ==
{{Main|Sociology of human consciousness}} 

[[Sociology of human consciousness]] uses the theories and methodology of sociology to explain human consciousness. The theory and its models emphasize the importance of language, collective representations, self-conceptions, and self-reflectivity. It argues that the shape and feel of human consciousness is heavily social.

'''Natural language training''' is a set of procedures used by behavior analysts. These procedures are used to mirror the natural areas of language use for children.&lt;ref name="Hart80"&gt;Hart, B. &amp; Risely, T.R. (1980). "''In vivo'' language intervention: Unanticipated general effects." ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', 13, 407–432.&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysts language training procedures run along a continuum from highly restrictive such as discrete trial training to very nonrestrictive conversationally-based strategies. Natural language falls in the middle of these procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, P. (2004): "Naturalistic Language Teaching Procedures for Children at Risk for Language Delays." ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 5 (4), 404–420 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Natural language training, sometimes referred to as milieu (person's social environment.) language training&lt;ref&gt;Hart, B. &amp; Warren, S. (1978). A milieu approach to teaching language. In R. Schiefelbusch, (Ed.), ''Language Intervention Strategies''. Baltimore University Park Press.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged from generalization research by [[Donald M. Baer|Donald Baer]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren, S.F., Baxter, D.K., Anderson, S.R., Marshall, A.M., &amp; Baer, D.M. (1981). These procedures use free operant principles as opposed to discrete trials. Generalization and maintenance of question-asking by severely retarded individuals. ''Journal of the Association for the Severely Handicapped'', 6, 15–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Onsnes03"&gt;Osnes, P. &amp; Lieblein. (2003) "An Explicit Technology of Generalization." ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3 (4),  364–377 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on these procedures was to use concepts closer to the natural environment to reduce prompt dependency and promote generalization.&lt;ref name="Onsnes03"/&gt; The initial procedure was the incidental teaching procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, B. &amp; Risely, T.R. (1975) "Incidental teaching of language in preschool." ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', 8, 411–420.&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural language training approach is often contrasted with discrete trial approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Kates-McElrath, K. &amp; Axelrod, S. (2006). "Behavioral Intervention for Autism: A Distinction Between Two Behavior Analytic Approaches." ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 7 (2), Page 242–254. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; In discrete trial program there is a clear trial window and only the first response is scored. If incorrect no reward is delivered and the trainer moves to the next trial. In the milieu language training program (natural language program), the trainer uses a least-to-most response strategy and waits for the correct response to be produced. Research exists showing that over 90% of the studies report good generalization for natural language training procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, P. (2009). "Promoting Generalization and Maintenance of Skills Learned via Natural Language Teaching." ''J-SPL-ABA'', 4, 90–131. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Currently, these procedures are used to teach children with [[autism]], [[language delay]]s, and [[developmental disabilities]]. Drawing on a behavior analytic model of child development (see [[Behavior analysis of child development]]) the goal of these procedures is to remediate developmental deficits. Because of their focus on generalization, natural language programs are often recommended when discrete trial programs run into problems.&lt;ref&gt;Lillian V. Pelios &amp; Amy Sucharzewski (2003): "Teaching Receptive Language To Children with Autism: A Selective Overview." ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 4 (4), Pg. 378–385 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferraioli, S., Hughes, C. and Smith, T. (2005). "A Model for Problem Solving in Discrete Trial Training for Children With Autism." ''JEIBI'',  2 (4), 224–235. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; These procedures are also recommended as part of building comprehensive programs for children with autism.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, M.J. (2005): "Comprehensive ABA Programs: Integrating And Evaluating The Implementation Of Varied Instructional Approaches." ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 6 (4), 249–265. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Natural language training procedures use a least to most prompt strategy.&lt;ref name="Hart80"/&gt; This strategy starts with designing/engineering the environment to increase the chances for language to occur, followed by incidental teaching, time delay, [[mand (psychology)|mand]] modeling, and modeling the response. Each intervention is used in a successive fashion if the previous intervention does not produce results.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, P. (2004). "Naturalistic Language Teaching Procedures for Children at Risk for Language Delays." ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 5 (4), 404–445. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pain''' is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. The [[International Association for the Study of Pain]]'s widely used definition defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage";&lt;ref name="IASPdef"&gt;{{cite web |quote=Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage |url=http://www.iasp-pain.org/Taxonomy |title=International Association for the Study of Pain: Pain Definitions |accessdate=12 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113000208/http://www.iasp-pain.org/Taxonomy |archivedate=13 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }} Derived from {{vcite journal |first=JJ |last=Bonica |title=The need of a taxonomy |journal=Pain |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=247–8 |year=1979 |month=June |pmid=460931 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(79)90046-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, due to it being a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a [[symptom]] of an underlying condition.

Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future.&lt;ref name= Lynn1984&gt;{{vcite book |last=Lynn |first=B |editor-last=Winlow |editor-first=W |editor2-last= Holden |editor2-first=AV |title=The neurobiology of pain: Symposium of the Northern Neurobiology Group, held at Leeds on 18 April 1983 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |year=1984 |isbn=9780719009969 |page=106 |chapter=Cutaneous nociceptors |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7rnAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;=true#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pain resolves once the [[noxious stimulus]] is removed and the body has healed, but it may persist despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body.

==Classification==
===Duration===
{{main|Chronic pain}}
Pain is usually transitory, lasting only until the noxious stimulus is removed or the underlying damage or pathology has healed, but some painful conditions, such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[Cancer pain|cancer]] and [[idiopathic]] pain, may persist for years. Pain that lasts a long time is called ''[[Chronic pain|chronic]]'' or persistent, and pain that resolves quickly is called ''[[Acute (medicine)|acute]]''. Traditionally, the distinction between ''acute'' and ''chronic'' pain has relied upon an arbitrary interval of time from onset; the two most commonly used markers being 3 months and 6 months since the onset of pain,&lt;ref name = Turk&amp;Okifuji2001&gt;{{vcite book |last=Turk |first=DC |last2=Okifuji |first2=A |editor-last=Bonica |editor-first=JJ |editor2-last=Loeser |editor2-first=JD |editor3-last=Chapman |editor3-first=CR |editor4-last=Turk |editor4-first=DC |editor5-last=Butler |editor5-first=SH  |title=Bonica's management of pain |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2001 |isbn=9780781768276 |chapter=Pain terms and taxonomies of pain}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at 12 months.&lt;ref name="isbn0-443-05683-8"/&gt;{{rp|93}} Others apply ''acute'' to pain that lasts less than 30 days, ''chronic'' to pain of more than six months' duration, and ''subacute'' to pain that lasts from one to six months.&lt;ref name=Thienhaus1&gt;{{vcite book |last=Thienhaus |first=O |last2=Cole |first2=BE |editor-last=Weiner |editor-first=R |title=Pain management: a practical guide for clinicians |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=2002 |pages=28 |isbn=9780849322624 |chapter=Classification of pain}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A popular alternative definition of ''chronic pain'', involving no arbitrarily fixed durations, is "pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing".&lt;ref name = Turk&amp;Okifuji2001/&gt; Chronic pain may be classified as [[cancer pain]] or else as benign.&lt;ref name=Thienhaus1/&gt;

===Nociceptive===
{{Main|Nociception}}
[[File:Nociceptive pain.jpg|thumb|288x288px|Mechanism of nociceptive pain.]]
Nociceptive pain is caused by stimulation of [[Sensory nervous system|sensory nerve fibers]] that respond to stimuli approaching or exceeding harmful intensity ([[nociceptor]]s), and may be classified according to the mode of noxious stimulation. The most common categories are "thermal" (e.g. heat or cold), "mechanical" (e.g. crushing, tearing, shearing, etc.) and "chemical" (e.g. [[iodine]] in a cut or chemicals released during [[inflammation]]). Some nociceptors respond to more than one of these modalities and are consequently designated polymodal.

Nociceptive pain may also be divided into "visceral", "deep somatic" and "superficial somatic" pain. [[Viscus|Visceral structures]] are highly sensitive to stretch, [[ischemia]] and [[inflammation]], but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain in other structures, such as burning and cutting. ''[[Visceral pain]]'' is diffuse, difficult to locate and often [[referred pain|referred]] to as distant, usually superficial, structure. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting and may be described as sickening, deep, squeezing, and dull.&lt;ref name = Urch&gt;{{vcite book |last=Urch |first=CE |last2=Suzuki |first2=R  |chapter=Pathophysiology of somatic, visceral, and neuropathic cancer pain |editor=Sykes N, Bennett MI &amp; Yuan C-S |title=Clinical pain management: Cancer pain |edition=2 |isbn=978-0-340-94007-5 |publisher=Hodder Arnold |location=London |pages=3–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Deep somatic'' pain is initiated by stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments, tendons, bones, blood vessels, [[fascia]]e and muscles, and is dull, aching, poorly-localized pain. Examples include [[sprain]]s and broken bones. ''Superficial'' pain is initiated by activation of nociceptors in the skin or other superficial tissue, and is sharp, well-defined and clearly located. Examples of injuries that produce superficial somatic pain include minor wounds and minor (first degree) [[burn]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-443-05683-8"&gt;{{vcite book |last=Coda |first=BA |last2=Bonica |first2=JJ |editor-last=Spanswick |editor-first=CC |editor2-last=Main |editor2-first=CJ |title=Pain management: an interdisciplinary approach |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2000 |isbn=9780443056833|chapter=General considerations of acute pain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropathic===

====Phantom====
{{Main|Phantom pain}}
[[Phantom pain]] is pain felt in a part of the body that has been [[amputated]], or from which the brain no longer receives signals. It is a type of neuropathic pain.&lt;ref name="pmid10863043"&gt;{{vcite journal |last=Kooijman |first=CM |last2=Dijkstra |first2=PU |last3=Geertzen |first3=JH |last4=Elzinga |first4=A |last5=van der Schans |first5=CP |title=Phantom pain and phantom sensations in upper limb amputees: an epidemiological study |journal=Pain |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=33–41 |year=2000 |month=July |pmid=10863043 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3959(00)00264-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[prevalence]] of phantom pain in upper limb amputees is nearly 82%, and in lower limb amputees is 54%.&lt;ref name="pmid10863043"/&gt; One study found that eight days after amputation, 72% of patients had phantom limb pain, and six months later, 67% reported it.&lt;ref name="pmid6657285"&gt;{{vcite journal |last=Jensen |first=TS |last2=Krebs |first2=B |last3=Nielsen |first3=J |last4=Rasmussen |first4=P |title=Phantom limb, phantom pain and stump pain in amputees during the first 6 months following limb amputation |journal=Pain |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=243–56 |year=1983 |month=November |pmid=6657285 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(83)90097-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3991231"&gt;{{vcite journal |last=Jensen |first=TS |last2=Krebs |first2=B |last3=Nielsen |first3=J |last4=Rasmussen |first4=P |title=Immediate and long-term phantom limb pain in amputees: incidence, clinical characteristics and relationship to pre-amputation limb pain |journal=Pain |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=267–78 |year=1985 |month=March |pmid=3991231 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(85)90090-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some amputees experience continuous pain that varies in intensity or quality; others experience several bouts of pain per day, or it may reoccur less often. It is often described as shooting, crushing, burning or cramping. If the pain is continuous for a long period, parts of the intact body may become sensitized, so that touching them evokes pain in the phantom limb. Phantom limb pain may accompany [[urination]] or [[defecation]].&lt;ref name = "The challenge of pain"&gt;{{vcite book |last=Wall |first=PD |last2=Melzack |first2=R |title=The challenge of pain |edition=2nd |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=9780140256703}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61–9}}

[[Local anesthetic]] injections into the nerves or sensitive areas of the stump may relieve pain for days, weeks, or sometimes permanently, despite the drug wearing off in a matter of hours; and small injections of [[:wikt:hypertonic|hypertonic]] saline into the soft tissue between vertebrae produces local pain that radiates into the phantom limb for ten minutes or so and may be followed by hours, weeks or even longer of partial or total relief from phantom pain. Vigorous vibration or electrical stimulation of the stump, or current from electrodes surgically implanted onto the spinal cord, all produce relief in some patients.&lt;ref name = "The challenge of pain"/&gt;{{rp|61–9}}

[[Mirror box|Mirror box therapy]] produces the illusion of movement and touch in a phantom limb which in turn may cause a reduction in pain.&lt;ref name="pmid8637922"&gt;{{vcite journal |last=Ramachandran |first=VS |last2=Rogers-Ramachandran |first2=D |title=Synaesthesia in phantom limbs induced with mirrors |journal=Proc.

[[Paraplegia]], the loss of sensation and voluntary motor control after serious spinal cord damage, may be accompanied by [[girdle pain]] at the level of the spinal cord damage, [[visceral pain]] evoked by a filling bladder or bowel, or, in five to ten per cent of paraplegics, phantom body pain in areas of complete sensory loss. This phantom body pain is initially described as burning or tingling, but may evolve into severe crushing or pinching pain, or the sensation of fire running down the legs or of a knife twisting in the flesh. Onset may be immediate or may not occur until years after the disabling injury. Surgical treatment rarely provides lasting relief.&lt;ref name = "The challenge of pain"/&gt;{{rp|61–9}}

===Psychogenic===
{{Main|Psychogenic pain}}
Psychogenic pain, also called ''psychalgia'' or ''somatoform pain'', is pain caused, increased, or prolonged by mental, emotional, or behavioral factors.&lt;ref name="Cleveland Clinic"/&gt; Headache, back pain, and stomach pain are sometimes diagnosed as psychogenic.&lt;ref name="Cleveland Clinic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/Pain_Management/hic_Psychogenic_Pain.aspx |title=Psychogenic Pain |publisher=[[Cleveland Clinic]] |accessdate=September 25, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110714011822/http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/Pain_Management/hic_Psychogenic_Pain.aspx |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufferers are often stigmatized, because both medical professionals and the general public tend to think that pain from a psychological source is not "real". However, specialists consider that it is no less actual or hurtful than pain from any other source.&lt;ref name=IASP_definitions&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512061229/http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=General_Resource_Links&amp;Template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=3058#Pain "International Association for the Study of Pain | Pain Definitions".]. Retrieved 12 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

People with [[chronic pain|long-term pain]] frequently display psychological disturbance, with elevated scores on the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] scales of [[hysteria]], depression and [[hypochondriasis]] (the "[[neurotic triad]]"). Some investigators have argued that it is this neuroticism that causes acute pain to turn chronic, but clinical evidence points the other direction, to chronic pain causing [[neuroticism]]. When long-term pain is relieved by therapeutic intervention, scores on the neurotic triad and [[anxiety]] fall, often to normal levels. [[Self-esteem]], often low in chronic pain patients, also shows improvement once pain has resolved.&lt;ref name = "The challenge of pain"/&gt;{{rp|31–2}}

===Breakthrough pain===
Breakthrough pain is transitory pain that comes on suddenly and is not alleviated by the patient's regular pain management. It is common in cancer patients who often have background pain that is generally well-controlled by medications, but who also sometimes experience bouts of severe pain that from time to time "breaks through" the medication. The characteristics of breakthrough [[cancer pain]] vary from person to person and according to the cause. Management of breakthrough pain can entail intensive use of [[opioid]]s, including [[fentanyl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mishra |first=S |last2=Bhatnagar |first2=S |last3=Chaudhary |first3=P |last4=Rana |first4=SP |title=Breakthrough cancer pain: review of prevalence, characteristics and management |journal=Indian Journal of Palliative Care |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=14–8 |date=January 2009 |pmid=20606850 |pmc=2886208 |doi=10.4103/0973-1075.53506 |url=http://www.jpalliativecare.com/article.asp?issn=0973-1075;year=2009;volume=15;issue=1;spage=14;epage=18;aulast=Mishra |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018161010/http://www.jpalliativecare.com/article.asp?issn=0973-1075;year=2009;volume=15;issue=1;spage=14;epage=18;aulast=Mishra |archivedate=18 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caraceni |first=A |last2=Hanks |first2=G |last3=Kaasa |first3=S |last4=Bennett |first4=MI |last5=Brunelli |first5=C |last6=Cherny |first6=N |last7=Dale |first7=O |last8=De Conno |first8=F |last9=Fallon |first9=M |last10=Hanna |first10=M |last11=Haugen |first11=DF |last12=Juhl |first12=G |last13=King |first13=S |last14=Klepstad |first14=P |last15=Laugsand |first15=EA |last16=Maltonib |first16=M |last17=Mercadante |first17=S |last18=Nabal |first18=M |last19=Pigni |first19=A |last20=Radbruch |first20=L |last21=Reid |first21=C |last22=Sjogren |first22=P |last23=Stone |first23=PC |last24=Tassinari |first24=D |last25=Zeppetella |first25=G |title=Use of opioid analgesics in the treatment of cancer pain: evidence-based recommendations from the EAPC |journal=The Lancet Oncology |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=e58–68 |date=February 2012 |pmid=22300860 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(12)70040-2 |url=http://www.fadin.org/Documenti/164/Recommendations_EAPC_2012.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019205001/http://www.fadin.org/Documenti/164/Recommendations_EAPC_2012.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zeppetella |first=G |last2=Davies |first2=AN |title=Opioids for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=10 |pages=CD004311 |year=2013 |pmid=24142465 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004311.pub3 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:No pain. Science Museum Painless Exhibition Series.webm|thumb|A patient and doctor discuss congenital insensitivity to pain]]
The ability to experience pain is essential for protection from injury, and recognition of the presence of injury. Episodic [[analgesia]] may occur under special circumstances, such as in the excitement of sport or war: a soldier on the battlefield may feel no pain for many hours from a traumatic amputation or other severe injury.&lt;ref&gt;Beecher, HK (1959).

Although unpleasantness is an essential part of the [[International Association for the Study of Pain|IASP]] definition of pain,&lt;ref name = IASPdef /&gt; it is possible to induce a state described as intense pain devoid of [[unpleasantness]] in some patients, with [[morphine]] injection or [[psychosurgery]].&lt;ref name=IASP_definitions/&gt; Such patients report that they have pain but are not bothered by it; they recognize the sensation of pain but suffer little, or not at all.&lt;ref name="asymbolia"&gt;Nikola Grahek, [http://docserver.bis.uni-oldenburg.de/publikationen/bisverlag/2001/grafee01/grafee01.html Feeling pain and being in pain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927042509/http://docserver.bis.uni-oldenburg.de/publikationen/bisverlag/2001/grafee01/grafee01.html |date=27 September 2008 }}, Oldenburg, 2001. {{ISBN|9780262517324}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indifference to pain can also rarely be present from birth; these people have normal nerves on medical investigations, and find pain unpleasant, but do not avoid repetition of the pain stimulus.&lt;ref name="pmid12583863"&gt;{{vcite journal |last=Nagasako |first=EM |last2=Oaklander |first2=AL |last3=Dworkin |first3=RH |title=Congenital insensitivity to pain: an update |journal=Pain |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=213–9 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12583863 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3959(02)00482-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insensitivity to pain may also result from abnormalities in the [[nervous system]]. This is usually the result of [[acquired disorder|acquired]] damage to the nerves, such as [[spinal cord injury]], [[diabetes mellitus]] ([[diabetic neuropathy]]), or [[leprosy]] in countries where that disease is prevalent.&lt;ref name=Brand_1997&gt;{{vcite book |last=Brand |first=PW |last2=Yancey |first2=P |title=The gift of pain: why we hurt &amp; what we can do about it |publisher=Zondervan Publ |location=Grand Rapids, Mich |year=1997 |isbn=9780310221449}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals are at risk of tissue damage and infection due to undiscovered injuries.

A much smaller number of people are insensitive to pain due to an inborn abnormality of the nervous system, known as "[[congenital insensitivity to pain]]".&lt;ref name="pmid12583863"/&gt; Children with this condition incur carelessly-repeated damage to their tongues, eyes, joints, skin, and muscles.

==Theory==

=== Historical theories&lt;!--linked from 'Patrick David Wall'--&gt; ===
{{see also|History of pain theory}}
Before the relatively recent discovery of [[neuron]]s and their role in pain, various different body functions were proposed to account for pain. There were several competing early theories of pain among the ancient Greeks: [[Hippocrates]] believed that it was due to an imbalance in vital fluids.&lt;ref name=Linton&gt;Linton. Models of Pain Perception. Elsevier Health, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century, [[Avicenna]] theorized that there were a number of feeling senses including touch, pain and titillation.&lt;ref name = Dallenbach&gt;{{vcite journal |first=KM |last=Dallenbach |title=Pain: History and present status |journal=American Journal of Psychology |date=July 1939 |volume=52 |pages=331–347 |doi=10.2307/1416740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan Baptist Weenix - Portrait of René Descartes.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[René Descartes]] by [[Jan Baptist Weenix]], 1647-1649]]
In 1644, [[René Descartes]] theorized that pain was a disturbance that passed down along nerve fibers until the disturbance reached the brain.&lt;ref name=Linton /&gt;&lt;ref name=MelzackKatz&gt;{{vcite book |last=Melzack |first=R |last2=Katz |first2=J |editor-last=Craig |editor-first=KD |editor2-last=Hadjistavropoulos |editor2-first=T |title=Pain: psychological perspectives |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers |location=Mahwah, N.J |year=2004 |chapter=The Gate Control Theory: Reaching for the Brain |isbn=9780415650618}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes's work, along with Avicenna's, prefigured the 19th-century development of specificity theory. Specificity theory saw pain as "a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses".&lt;ref name = Bonica1&gt;{{vcite book |first=JJ |last=Bonica |chapter=History of pain concepts and therapies |title=The management of pain |volume=1 |edition=2 |year=1990 |publisher=Lea &amp; Febiger |location=London |page=7 |isbn=9780812111224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature.&lt;ref name = Finger&gt;{{vcite book |first=S |last=Finger |title=Origins of neuroscience: a history of explorations into brain function |page 149 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195146943|year=2001 |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1890s, specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists. However, after a series of clinical observations by [[Henry Head]] and experiments by [[Max von Frey]], the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse, and by century's end, most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact.&lt;ref name = Dallenbach/&gt;&lt;ref name = Bonica1/&gt;

{{Anchor|Gate control}}
In 1955, DC Sinclair and [[G Weddell]] developed peripheral pattern theory, based on a 1934 suggestion by [[John Paul Nafe]]. They proposed that all skin fiber endings (with the exception of those innervating hair cells) are identical, and that pain is produced by intense stimulation of these fibers.&lt;ref name = Bonica1/&gt; Another 20th-century theory was [[gate control theory]], introduced by [[Ronald Melzack]] and [[Patrick David Wall|Patrick Wall]] in the 1965 [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] article "Pain Mechanisms: A New Theory".&lt;ref name="pmid5320816"&gt;{{vcite journal |last=Melzack |first=R |authorlink=Ronald Melzack |last2=Wall |first2=PD |authorlink2=Patrick David Wall |title=Pain mechanisms: a new theory |journal=Science |volume=150 |issue=3699 |pages=971–9 |year=1965 |month=November |pmid=5320816 |doi=10.1126/science.150.3699.971 |url=http://www.hnehealth.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/70122/pain_mechanisms_20100315013844.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114141747/http://www.hnehealth.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/70122/pain_mechanisms_20100315013844.pdf |archivedate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors proposed that both thin (pain) and large diameter (touch, pressure, vibration) nerve fibers carry information from the site of injury to two destinations in the [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]] of the spinal cord, and that the more large fiber activity relative to thin fiber activity at the inhibitory cell, the less pain is felt.&lt;ref name="MelzackKatz"/&gt;

===Three dimensions of pain===
In 1968 Ronald Melzack and [[Kenneth L. Casey|Kenneth Casey]] described chronic pain in terms of its three dimensions:

* "sensory-discriminative" (sense of the intensity, location, quality and duration of the pain), 
* "affective-motivational" (unpleasantness and urge to escape the unpleasantness), and 
* "cognitive-evaluative" (cognitions such as appraisal, cultural values, distraction and hypnotic suggestion).&lt;ref name="Melzack_1968"/&gt;

They theorized that pain intensity (the sensory discriminative dimension) and unpleasantness (the affective-motivational dimension) are not simply determined by the magnitude of the painful stimulus, but "higher" cognitive activities can influence perceived intensity and unpleasantness. Cognitive activities "may affect both sensory and affective experience or they may modify primarily the affective-motivational dimension. Thus, excitement in games or war appears to block both dimensions of pain, while suggestion and placebos may modulate the affective-motivational dimension and leave the sensory-discriminative dimension relatively undisturbed." (p.&amp;nbsp;432) The paper ends with a call to action: "Pain can be treated not only by trying to cut down the sensory input by anesthetic block, surgical intervention and the like, but also by influencing the motivational-affective and cognitive factors as well." (p.&amp;nbsp;435)

===Theory today===
[[File:Schematic of cortical areas involved with pain processing and fMRI.jpg|thumb|right|Regions of the cerebral cortex associated with pain.]]
[[Wilhelm Erb|Wilhelm Erb's]] (1874) "intensive" theory, that a pain signal can be generated by intense enough stimulation of ''any'' sensory receptor, has been soundly disproved. Some sensory fibers do not differentiate between noxious and non-noxious stimuli, while others, [[nociceptor]]s, respond only to noxious, high intensity stimuli. At the peripheral end of the nociceptor, noxious stimuli generate currents that, above a given threshold, send [[action potential|signals]] along the nerve fiber to the spinal cord. The "specificity" (whether it responds to thermal, chemical or mechanical features of its environment) of a nociceptor is determined by which [[ion channel]]s it expresses at its peripheral end. Dozens of different types of nociceptor ion channels have so far been identified, and their exact functions are still being determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Woolf |first=CJ |last2=Ma |first2=Q |title=Nociceptors--noxious stimulus detectors |journal=Neuron |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=353–64 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17678850 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.07.016 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pain signal travels from the periphery to the spinal cord along an [[A delta fiber|A-delta]] or [[C fiber|C]] fiber. Because the A-delta fiber is thicker than the C fiber, and is thinly sheathed in an electrically insulating material ([[myelin]]), it carries its signal faster (5–30&amp;nbsp;[[Metre per second|m/s]]) than the unmyelinated C fiber (0.5–2&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref name=Marchand&gt;{{vcite book |first=S |last=Marchand |editor-last=Beaulieu |editor-first=P|editor2-last=Lussier |editor2-first=D|editor3-last=Porreca |editor3-first=F |editor4-last=Dickenson |editor4-first=A |title=Pharmacology of pain |chapter=Applied pain neurophysiology |publisher=International Association for the Study of Pain Press |location=Seattle |year=2010 |pages=3–26 |isbn=978-0-931092-78-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain evoked by the A-delta fibers is described as sharp and is felt first. This is followed by a duller pain, often described as burning, carried by the C fibers.&lt;ref name=Skevington9&gt;{{vcite book |first=S |last=Skevington |title=Psychology of pain |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1995 |page=9 |isbn=9780471957737}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "first order" neurons enter the spinal cord via [[Lissauer's tract]].

These A-delta and C fibers [[synapse|connect with]] "second order" nerve fibers in the [[central gelatinous substance of the spinal cord]] (laminae II and III of the [[Posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horns]]). The second order fibers then cross the cord via the [[anterior white commissure]] and ascend in the [[spinothalamic tract]]. Before reaching the brain, the spinothalamic tract splits into the [[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]], [[neospinothalamic tract]] and the [[medial (anatomy)|medial]], [[paleospinothalamic tract]].&lt;ref name=Skevington1995&gt;{{cite book |last=Skevington |first=S. M. |year=1995 |title=Psychology of pain |location=Chichester, UK |publisher=Wiley |page=18 |isbn=9780471957737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second order, spinal cord fibers dedicated to carrying A-delta fiber pain signals, and others that carry both A-delta and C fiber pain signals to the [[thalamus]] have been identified. Other spinal cord fibers, known as [[wide dynamic range neuron]]s, respond to A-delta and C fibers, but also to the large A-beta fibers that carry touch, pressure and vibration signals.&lt;ref name=Marchand/&gt; Pain-related activity in the thalamus spreads to the [[insular cortex]] (thought to embody, among other things, the feeling that distinguishes pain from other [[homeostatic emotion]]s such as itch and nausea) and [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (thought to embody, among other things, the affective/motivational element, the unpleasantness of pain).&lt;ref name= Craig2003a&gt;{{vcite journal |first=AD |last=Craig |title=Pain mechanisms: labeled lines versus convergence in central processing |journal=Annu.

===Evolutionary and behavioral role===
Pain is part of the body's defense system, producing a [[Nervous system#Reflexes and other stimulus-response circuits|reflexive]] retraction from the painful stimulus, and tendencies to protect the affected body part while it heals, and avoid that harmful situation in the future.&lt;ref name= Lynn1984/&gt;&lt;ref name= Bernston2008&gt;{{vcite book |last=Bernston |first=GG |last2=Cacioppo |first2=JT |editor-last=Gardner |editor-first=WL |editor2-last=Shah |editor2-first=JY |title=Handbook of Motivation Science |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2007 |page=191 |isbn=9781593855680 |chapter=The neuroevolution of motivation |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCxpZkZtDG8C&amp;pg=PT209&amp;dq=%22One+general+class+of+spinal+reflexes+consists+of+the+flexor+(pain)+withdrawal%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22One%20general%20class%20of%20spinal%20reflexes%20consists%20of%20the%20flexor%20(pain)%20withdrawal%22&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; It&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;an important part of animal life, vital to healthy survival. People with [[congenital insensitivity to pain]] have reduced [[life expectancy]].&lt;ref name="pmid12583863"/&gt;

In ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution]]'', biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] addresses the question of why pain should have the quality of being painful. He describes the alternative as a mental raising of a "red flag". To argue why that red flag might be insufficient, Dawkins argues that drives must compete with one other within living beings. The most "fit" creature would be the one whose pains are well balanced. Those pains which mean certain death when ignored will become the most powerfully felt. The relative intensities of pain, then, may resemble the relative importance of that risk to our ancestors.{{efn|For example, lack of food, extreme cold, or serious injuries are felt as exceptionally painful, whereas minor damage is felt as mere discomfort}} This resemblance will not be perfect, however, because natural selection can be a [[Argument from poor design|poor designer]]. This may have maladaptive results such as [[Supernormal stimulus|supernormal stimuli]].&lt;ref name=Dawkins2009&gt;{{vcite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2009 |title=The Greatest Show on Earth |publisher=Free Press |Pages=392-395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Idiopathic pain (pain that persists after the trauma or pathology has healed, or that arises without any apparent cause) may be an exception to the idea that pain is helpful to survival, although some [[psychodynamic]] psychologists argue that such pain is psychogenic, enlisted as a protective distraction to keep dangerous emotions unconscious.&lt;ref name="Sarno-DividedMind"&gt;{{vcite book |first=JE |last=Sarno |title=The divided mind: the epidemic of mindbody disorders |publisher=ReganBooks |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=9780061174308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thresholds===
In pain science, thresholds are measured by gradually increasing the intensity of a stimulus such as electric current or heat applied to the body. The [[Threshold of pain|pain perception threshold]] is the point at which the stimulus begins to hurt, and the [[pain tolerance|pain tolerance threshold]] is reached when the subject acts to stop the pain.

Differences in pain perception and tolerance thresholds are associated with, among other factors, ethnicity, genetics, and gender. People of Mediterranean origin report as painful some radiant heat intensities that northern Europeans describe as nonpainful. And Italian women tolerate a lesser level of intense electric shock than Jewish or Native American women. Some individuals in all cultures have significantly higher than normal pain perception and tolerance thresholds. For instance, patients who experience painless heart attacks have higher pain thresholds for electric shock, muscle cramp and heat.&lt;ref name = "The challenge of pain"/&gt;{{rp|17–9}}

(1968). ''Nursing practice theories related to cognition, bodily pain, and man-environment interactions''. Los Angeles: UCLA Students Store.&lt;br /&gt;More recently, McCaffery defined pain as "whatever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever the experiencing person says it does." {{vcite book |last=Pasero |first=C |last2=McCaffery |first2=M |title=Pain: clinical manual |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=1999 |isbn=9780815156093}}&lt;/ref&gt; To assess intensity, the patient may be asked to locate their pain on a scale of 0&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;10, with 0 being no pain at all, and 10 the worst pain they have ever felt. Quality can be established by having the patient complete the [[McGill Pain Questionnaire]] indicating which words best describe their pain.&lt;ref name= Breivik2008/&gt;

===Visual analogue scale===
{{Main|Visual analogue scale}}
The visual analogue scale is a common, reproducible tool in the assessment of pain and pain relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=A.-M.|date=2001-05-01|title=The minimum clinically significant difference in visual analogue scale pain score does not differ with severity of pain|url=http://emj.bmj.com/content/18/3/205|journal=Emergency Medicine Journal|language=en|volume=18|issue=3|pages=205–207|doi=10.1136/emj.18.3.205|issn=1472-0205|pmid=11354213|pmc=1725574|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125015423/http://emj.bmj.com/content/18/3/205|archivedate=25 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale is a continuous line anchored by verbal descriptors, one for each extreme of pain where a higher score indicates greater pain intensity. It is usually 10&amp;nbsp;cm in length with no intermediate descriptors as to avoid marking of scores around a preferred numeric value. When applied as a pain descriptor, these anchors are often 'no pain' and 'worst imaginable pain". Cut-offs for pain classification have been recommended as no pain (0-4mm), mild pain (5-44mm), moderate pain (45-74mm) and severe pain (75-100mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawker|first=Gillian A.|last2=Mian|first2=Samra|last3=Kendzerska|first3=Tetyana|last4=French|first4=Melissa|date=2011-11-01|title=Measures of adult pain: Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS Pain), Numeric Rating Scale for Pain (NRS Pain), McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), Chronic Pain Grade Scale (CPGS), Short Form-36 Bodily Pain Scale (SF-36 BPS), and Measure of Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP)|journal=Arthritis Care &amp; Research|language=en|volume=63|issue=S11|pages=S240–S252|doi=10.1002/acr.20543|pmid=22588748|issn=2151-4658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multidimensional pain inventory===
The Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) is a questionnaire designed to assess the [[psychosocial]] state of a person with chronic pain. Analysis of MPI results by Turk and Rudy (1988) found three classes of chronic pain patient: "(a) dysfunctional, people who perceived the severity of their pain to be high, reported that pain interfered with much of their lives, reported a higher degree of psychological distress caused by pain, and reported low levels of activity; (b) interpersonally distressed, people with a common perception that significant others were not very supportive of their pain problems; and (c) adaptive copers, patients who reported high levels of social support, relatively low levels of pain and perceived interference, and relatively high levels of activity."&lt;ref name= Turk&amp;Rudy1988&gt;{{vcite journal |last=Turk |first=DC |last2=Rudy |first2=TE |title=Toward an empirically derived taxonomy of chronic pain patients: integration of psychological assessment data |journal=J.

===Assessment in people who are non-verbal===
{{See also|Pain and dementia|Pain in babies}}
When a person is [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] and cannot self-report pain, observation becomes critical, and specific behaviors can be monitored as pain indicators. Behaviors such as facial grimacing and guarding indicate pain, as well as an increase or decrease in vocalizations, changes in routine behavior patterns and mental status changes. Patients experiencing pain may exhibit withdrawn [[social behavior]] and possibly experience a [[Anorexia (symptom)|decreased appetite]] and decreased nutritional intake. A change in condition that deviates from baseline such as moaning with movement or when manipulating a body part, and limited [[range of motion]] are also potential pain indicators. In patients who possess language but are incapable of expressing themselves effectively, such as those with dementia, an increase in confusion or display of aggressive behaviors or agitation may signal that discomfort exists, and further assessment is necessary.

[[Pain in babies|Infants do feel pain]], but lack the language needed to report it, and so communicate distress by crying. A non-verbal pain assessment should be conducted involving the parents, who will notice changes in the infant which may not be obvious to the health care provider. [[Preterm birth|Pre-term babies]] are more sensitive to painful stimuli than those carried to full term.&lt;ref name= Jarvis2004&gt;{{vcite book |first=C |last=Jarvis |title=Physical examination &amp; health assessment |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2007 |pages=180–192 |isbn=9781455728107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other barriers to reporting===
The way in which one experiences and responds to pain is related to sociocultural characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |first=JA |last=Encandela |year=1993 |title=Social science and the study of pain since Zborowski: A need for a new agenda |journal=Soc Sci Med |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=783–91 |doi=10.1016/0277-9536(93)90039-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zborowski M. People in Pain. 1969, San Francisco, CA:Josey-Bass&lt;/ref&gt; An aging adult may not respond to pain in the same way that a younger person might. Their ability to recognize pain may be blunted by illness or the use of [[prescription drug|medication]]. Depression may also keep older adult from reporting they are in pain. Decline in [[self-care]] may also indicate the older adult is experiencing pain. They may be reluctant to report pain because they do not want to be perceived as weak, or may feel it is impolite or shameful to complain, or they may feel the pain is a form of deserved punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |first=JA |last=Encandela |year=1997 |title=Social Construction of pain and aging: Individual artfulness within interpretive structures |journal=Symb Interaction |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=251–273 |doi=10.1525/si.1997.20.3.251}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;lawhorne, L; Passerini, J (1999). ''Chronic Pain Management in the Long Term Care Setting: Clinical Practice Guidelines.'' Baltimore, Maryland: American Medical Directors Association. pp. 1–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural barriers may also affect the likelihood of reporting pain. Sufferers may feel that certain treatments go against their religious beliefs. They may not report pain because they feel it is a sign that death is near. Many people fear the stigma of addiction, and avoid pain treatment so as not to be prescribed potentially addicting drugs. Many Asians do not want to lose respect in society by admitting they are in pain and need help, believing the pain should be borne in silence, while other cultures feel they should report pain immediately to receive immediate relief.&lt;ref name= Jarvis2004/&gt; Gender can also be a factor in reporting pain. Gender [[Gender differences|differences]] can be the result of social and cultural expectations, with women expected to be more emotional and show pain, and men more stoic.&lt;ref name= Jarvis2004/&gt;

===As an aid to diagnosis===
Pain is a symptom of many medical conditions. Knowing the time of onset, location, intensity, pattern of occurrence (continuous, intermittent, etc.), exacerbating and relieving factors, and quality (burning, sharp, etc.) of the pain will help the examining physician to accurately diagnose the problem. For example, chest pain described as extreme heaviness may indicate [[myocardial infarction]], while chest pain described as tearing may indicate [[aortic dissection]].&lt;ref name="pmid9786377"&gt;{{vcite journal |last=Panju |first=AA |last2=Hemmelgarn |first2=BR |last3=Guyatt |first3=GH |last4=Simel |first4=DL |title=The rational clinical examination.

{{anchor|Oral sugar}}

Sugar ([[sucrose]]) when taken by mouth reduces [[Pain in babies|pain in newborn babies]] undergoing some medical procedures (a [[Incision and drainage|lancing]] of the heel, [[venipuncture]], and [[intramuscular injections]]).

===Psychological===
Individuals with more [[social support]] experience less cancer pain, take less pain medication, report less labor pain and are less likely to use [[Epidural administration|epidural anesthesia]] during childbirth, or suffer from chest pain after [[coronary artery bypass surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberger, NI; Lieberman (2005).

[[Suggestion]] can significantly affect pain intensity. About 35% of people report marked relief after receiving a [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] injection they believed to be [[morphine]]. This [[placebo]] effect is more pronounced in people who are prone to anxiety, and so anxiety reduction may account for some of the effect, but it does not account for all of it. Placebos are more effective for intense pain than mild pain; and they produce progressively weaker effects with repeated administration.&lt;ref name = "The challenge of pain"/&gt;{{rp|26–8}} It is possible for many with chronic pain to become so absorbed in an activity or entertainment that the pain is no longer felt, or is greatly diminished.&lt;ref name = "The challenge of pain"/&gt;{{rp|22–3}}

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) has been shown effective for improving quality of life in those with chronic pain but the reduction in suffering is modest, and the CBT method was not shown to have any effect on outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=15599126 |volume=21 |issue=1 |title=Cognitive-behavioral treatments for chronic pain: what works for whom? |year=2005 |last=Vlaeyen |first=JW |last2=Morley |first2=S |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1097/00002508-200501000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]] (ACT) may also effective in the treatment of chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ost |first1=LG |title=The efficacy of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |date=October 2014 |volume=61 |pages=105–21 |pmid=25193001 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2014.07.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors concluded that "although the findings provide support for the general applicability of hypnosis in the treatment of chronic pain, considerably more research will be needed to fully determine the effects of hypnosis for different chronic-pain conditions."&lt;ref name= Elkins2007&gt;{{vcite journal |last=Elkins |first=G |last2=Jensen |first2=MP |last3=Jensen |first3=DR |last4=Patterson |year=2007 |title=Hypnotherapy for the management of chronic pain |journal=International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis |volume=55 |issue=3 |page=283 |doi=10.1080/00207140701338621 |pmid=17558718 |pmc=2752362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1994, responding to the need for a more useful system for describing [[chronic pain]], the [[International Association for the Study of Pain]] (IASP) classified pain according to specific characteristics:
# region of the body involved (e.g. abdomen, lower limbs), 
# system whose dysfunction may be causing the pain (e.g., nervous, gastrointestinal), 
# duration and pattern of occurrence, 
# intensity and time since onset, and

Woolf suggests three classes of pain:

The nature or meaning of physical pain has been diversely understood by religious or secular traditions from antiquity to modern times.&lt;ref name="isbn0-674-39968-4"&gt;{{vcite book |first=R |last=Rey |title=The history of pain |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1995 |isbn=9780674399686}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-520-08276-1"&gt;{{vcite book |first=DR |last=Morris |title=The culture of pain |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1991 |isbn=9780520082762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical pain is an important political topic in relation to various issues, including [[pain management]] policy, [[drug control]], [[animal rights]] or [[animal welfare]], [[torture]], and [[pain compliance]]. In various contexts, the deliberate infliction of pain in the form of [[corporal punishment]] is used as retribution for an offence, or for the purpose of disciplining or reforming a wrongdoer, or to deter attitudes or behaviour deemed unacceptable. The [[Lingchi|slow slicing]], or death by a thousand cuts, was a form of execution in China reserved for crimes viewed as especially severe, such as high treason or patricide. In some cultures, extreme practices such as [[mortification of the flesh]] or painful [[rites of passage]] are highly regarded. For example, the [[Mawé people|Sateré-Mawé]] people of Brazil use intentional [[Paraponera clavata|bullet ant]] stings as part of their initiation rites to become warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/travel/Holidays/Wildlife/article77936.ece |publisher=The Sunday Times |location=London |title=Bitten by the Amazon |first=Steve |last=Backshall |date=6 January 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222144437/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/travel/Holidays/Wildlife/article77936.ece |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
{{Main|Pain in animals|Pain in invertebrates}}
The most reliable method for assessing pain in most humans is by asking a question: a person may report pain that cannot be detected by any known physiological measure. However, like infants, animals cannot answer questions about whether they feel pain; thus the defining criterion for pain in humans cannot be applied to them. Philosophers and scientists have responded to this difficulty in a variety of ways.  [[René Descartes]] for example argued that animals lack consciousness and therefore do not experience pain and suffering in the way that humans do.&lt;ref name=nuffield45&gt;Working party of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics (2005).

[[Image:Phalanstère.jpg|thumb|alt=|Perspective view of the urban area of Fourier's ''Phalanstère''. Rural area is not shown in the drawing.]]
[[Image:Phalanxary colt nj.jpg|thumb|[[North American Phalanx]] building in [[Monmouth County, New Jersey]], inspired by Fourier's concept]]
[[File:Unite d'Habitation, Marseille.jpg|thumb|right|The Unité d'Habitation in Marseilles, France, designed by Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier.]]
A '''''phalanstère''''' (or '''phalanstery''') was a type of building designed for a self-contained [[Utopia|utopian community]], ideally consisting of 500–2000 people working together for mutual benefit, and developed in the early 19th century by [[Charles Fourier]]. Fourier chose the name by combining the French word ''phalange'' ([[Phalanx formation|phalanx]], the basic military unit in ancient Greece), with the word ''monastère'' ([[monastery]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|phalanstery|accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''phalanstère'' structure==
Fourier conceived the ''phalanstère'' as an organized building designed to integrate urban and rural features.

The structure of the ''phalanstère'' was composed of three parts: a central part and two lateral wings. The central part was designed for quiet activities. It included dining rooms, meeting rooms, libraries and studies. A lateral wing was designed for labour and noisy activities, such as carpentry, hammering and forging. It also hosted children because they were considered noisy while playing. The other wing contained a [[caravansary]], with ballrooms and halls for meetings with outsiders who had to pay a fee in order to visit and meet the people of the Phalanx community. This income was thought to sustain the autonomous economy of the ''phalanstère''. The ''phalanstère'' also included private apartments and many social halls. A social hall was defined by Fourier as a ''seristère''.

==In France and the United States==
Though Fourier published several journals in Paris, among them ''La  Phalanstère'', he created no ''phalanstères'' in [[Europe]] due to a lack of financial support.  Several so-called [[colonies]] were founded in the [[United States of America]] by [[Albert Brisbane]] and [[Horace Greeley]].

==Gender roles==
Fourier believed that the traditional house was a place of exile and oppression of women.  He believed gender roles could progress by shaping them within community, more than by pursuits of sexual freedom or other [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Simonian]] concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.languages.ttu.edu/faculty/snell/HistoryFranceFeminism.htm |title=Feminism |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425123232/http://www.languages.ttu.edu/faculty/snell/HistoryFranceFeminism.htm |archive-date=May 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In the 20th century, the architect [[Le Corbusier]] adapted the concept of the ''phalanstère'' when he designed the ''[[Unité d'Habitation]]'', a self-contained commune, at [[Marseilles]].&lt;ref name="Coleman2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=Nathaniel |last=Coleman|title=Utopias and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HgGTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137 |date= 2007 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-99395-5 |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

In the Hungarian play ''[[The Tragedy of Man]]'' by [[Imre Madách]], one of the later scenes takes place in a phalanstery, in a utopian future, where the entirety of humanity lives in phalansteries, there are no borders, no nations, and civilization is dominated by science.

In the PC game ''Tristania 3D'', the evil ''Courbèe Dominate'' empire lives in a phalanstery (spelled "Falanster" in the game) somewhere near Norway, hidden from the rest of the world. In the game, the  phalanstery is described as a gigantic city-state, consisting 7 major districts. The protagonist of the game must gain entry into the phalanstery, unfortunately it is very well protected. Eventually he does so, and most of the game takes place inside the phalanstery, although explicitly only level 15 bears the name "Falanster".

In the [[Booker prize]]-winning novel ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'' by [[A. S. Byatt]], ancestors of the antagonist Mortimer Cropper are described (p.&amp;nbsp;114) as having attempted to found a phalanstery in New Mexico.

'''Planograms''', also known as '''plano-grams''', '''plan-o-grams''', '''[[schematic]]s''' and '''POGs''', are visual representations of a store's products or services on display. They are considered a tool for [[visual merchandising]]. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', a plangoram "is a diagram or model that indicates the placement of retail products on shelves in order to maximize sales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/planogram?region=us|title=planogram(plan·o·gram)|author= |date= |work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the planogram can be measured by the sales volume generated from the specific area being diagramed.

==Overview==
Planograms are predominantly used in [[retail]] businesses. A planogram defines the location and quantity of products to be placed on display. The rules and theories for creating planograms are set under the terms of [[merchandising]]. For example, given limited shelf space, a vendor may prefer to provide a wide assortment of products, or may limit the assortment but increase the facings of each product to avoid stock-outs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/616081266|title=Supply chain management for retailing|last=Rajesh.|first=Ray,|date=2010|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780070145047|location=New Delhi|oclc=616081266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers often send planograms to stores ahead of new product shipments. This is useful when a vendor wants retail displays in multiple store locations to have the same look and feel. Often, a consumer goods manufacturer releases a planogram with each new product to show how the product can relate to existing products.

[[Fast Moving Consumer Goods|Fast-moving consumer goods]] organizations and [[supermarket]]s mostly use text and box-based planograms to optimize shelf space, [[Inventory turnover|inventory turns]] and [[profit margin]]s. Apparel brands and retailers are more focused on presentation and use pictorial planograms that illustrate the look and brand identity for each product.

==Placement methods==
===Visual===
Visual product placement is supported by different theories including; horizontal, vertical, and block placement. Horizontal product placement increases the concentration of a certain article. Research studies suggest that a product's relation to customer eye levels directly correlates to its sales.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2008/12/18/the-way-the-brain-buys&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; This depends on the customer's distance from the unit. Vertical product placement puts products on more than one shelf level to achieve {{convert|15|cm|in}} – {{convert|30|cm|in}} of placement space. Similar products are placed in blocks.

===Commercial===
Commercial placement is determined by both market share placement and margin placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/i1vihjvnvieo/planogram/|title=PLANOGRAM|website=prezi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Market share research companies like [[ACNielsen]] collect sales data for various products and calculate market share of products in various market segments. Margin placement is determined by the profit margin of a specific item. Higher margin places a product closer to the front of the store, where it is most likely to attract attention.

===Derivative objectives===

* To communicate how to set the merchandise
* To ensure sufficient inventory levels on the shelf or display
* To use space effectively (e.g. floor, page, and screen)
* To facilitate communication of retailer's brand identity
* To assist in the process of mapping a store

==Creation==
The planogram concept originated with [[Kmart|KMart]]. Planograms are created with the help of planogramming software by a Planogram Specialist, Space Planning Specialist or Space Planning Manager. The retail industry utilizes software to ensure proper stocking. Retailers turn to planogram software to reflect each store’s particular customer profile and localized demand, while maintaining centralized control and supply chain efficiency. 

For example, some software packages focused upon [[fast-moving consumer goods]] and [[hard goods]] sectors made enhancements to transfer parts of shelving elements to single store measurements, which, according to the producers, should increase efficiency.

Retailers automate the creation of store-specific planograms through use of corporate-level business rules and constraints describing best practices. Such planogramming solutions allow these companies to respond with location and language-specific messaging, pricing, and product placements based on business rules derived from location, campaign and fixture attributes to create localized assortments.

Recent advances in store virtualization and collaboration allow manufacturers, retailers and category management experts from across the globe to work in the same virtual store in real time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">The '''postcautionary principle''' is a principle of ''de facto'' environmental management formulated by [[John Paull]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John, [http://orgprints.org/11042/  Certified Organic Forests &amp; Timber: the Hippocratic Opportunity], Proceedings ANZSEE Conference 2007, 1-14,  2007&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the postcautionary principle, as the antithesis of the [[precautionary principle]], has guided environmental management, as it is actually practised. 

Taking the Rio 1982 formulation of the '''pre'''cautionary principle as a guide, the '''post'''cautionary principle has been stated as follows: 
''"Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, the lack of full scientific certainty shall be used as a reason for not implementing cost-effective measures until after the environmental degradation has actually occurred"'' [http://orgprints.org/11042]. 

Examples of this principle include: the extinction of the [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger), which was, after decades of government bounty hunting (starting in 1888), declared a protected species on 10 July 1936 by the Fauna Board of [[Tasmania]], only weeks before the last one died in captivity (on 7 September 1936); the 2003 Forestry Tasmania burning of Tasmania's largest tree ''El Grande'',&lt;ref&gt;BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3306655.stm  Forestry officials admit killing biggest tree], BBC News, 10 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt; a tree protected under legislation, and its subsequent demise, after which "new standard operating procedures" were implemented;&lt;ref&gt;FPB, 2004, Derwent 02-03, Forest Practices Board, Hobart, Tasmania, 13  January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and seven months after [[Malaysia Airlines]] flight [[MH370]] disappeared without trace, the airline introduced a monitoring system where the onboard communication system will issue an electronic ping every few minutes&lt;ref&gt;Creedy, Steve, 2014, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/more-pings-to-locate-malaysian-planes/story-e6frg95x-1227107689500  More pings to locate Malaysian planes], The Australian, 31 October.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematical logic]], a '''predicate''' is commonly understood to be a [[Boolean-valued function]] ''P'': ''X''→ {true, false}, called the predicate on ''X''. However, predicates have many different uses and interpretations in mathematics and logic, and their precise definition, meaning and use will vary from theory to theory. So, for example, when a theory defines the concept of a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]], then a predicate is simply the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] (otherwise known as the [[indicator function]]) of a relation.  However, not all theories have relations, or are founded on [[set theory]], and so one must be careful with the proper definition and semantic interpretation of a predicate.

==Simplified overview==
Informally, a predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Daniel W.|title=A Logical Introduction to Proof|year=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781461436317|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIf3CkTPPjMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It can be thought of as an operator or function that returns a value that is either true or false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haas|first=Guy M.|title=What If? (Predicates)|url=http://www.bfoit.org/itp/Predicates.html|work=Introduction to Computer Programming|publisher=Berkeley Foundation for Opportunities in IT (BFOIT)|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, predicates are sometimes used to indicate set membership: when talking about sets, it is sometimes inconvenient or impossible to describe a set by listing all of its elements. Thus, a predicate ''P(x)'' will be true or false, depending on whether ''x'' belongs to a set.

Predicates are also commonly used to talk about the [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of objects, by defining the set of all objects that have some property in common. So, for example, when ''P'' is a predicate on ''X'', one might sometimes say ''P'' is a [[Property (philosophy)|property]] of ''X''.  Similarly, the notation ''P''(''x'') is used to denote a sentence or statement ''P'' concerning the variable object x. The set defined by ''P''(''x'') is written as {''x'' | ''P''(''x'')}, and is the set of objects for which ''P'' is true.

For instance, {''x'' | ''x'' is a natural number less than 4} is the set {1,2,3}.

If ''t'' is an element of the set {''x'' | ''P''(''x'')}, then the statement ''P''(''t'') is ''true''.

Here, ''P''(''x'') is referred to as the ''predicate'', and ''x'' the ''placeholder'' of the ''[[proposition]]''. Sometimes, ''P''(''x'') is also called a ([[Template processor|template]] in the role of)  [[propositional function]], as each choice of the placeholder ''x'' produces a proposition.

A simple form of predicate is a [[Boolean expression]], in which case the inputs to the expression are themselves Boolean values, combined using Boolean operations. Similarly, a Boolean expression with inputs predicates is itself a more complex predicate.

== Formal definition==
The precise semantic interpretation of an [[atomic formula]] and an atomic sentence will vary from theory to theory.

* In [[propositional logic]], atomic formulas are called [[propositional variable]]s.&lt;ref name=lavrov&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavrov|first=Igor Andreevich|first2=Larisa|last2=Maksimova|author2-link= Larisa Maksimova |title=Problems in Set Theory, Mathematical Logic, and the Theory of Algorithms|year=2003|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=0306477122|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPLjjjU1C9AC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a sense, these are nullary (i.e. 0-[[arity]]) predicates. 
* In [[first-order logic]], an atomic formula consists of a predicate symbol applied to an appropriate number of terms. 
* In [[set theory]], predicates are understood to be [[Indicator function|characteristic functions]] or set [[indicator function]]s, ''i.e.'' [[function (mathematics)|functions]] from a set element to a [[truth value]].  [[Set-builder notation]] makes use of predicates to define sets.
* In [[autoepistemic logic]], which rejects the [[law of excluded middle]], predicates may be true, false, or simply ''unknown''; ''i.e.'' a given collection of facts may be insufficient to determine the truth or falsehood of a predicate.
* In [[fuzzy logic]], predicates are the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic functions]] of a [[probability distribution]]. That is, the strict true/false valuation of the predicate is replaced by a quantity interpreted as the degree of truth.

'''Rothschild's giraffe''' (''Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi'') is a subspecies of the [[giraffe]]. It is one of the most endangered distinct populations of [[giraffe]], with 1671 individuals estimated in the wild in 2016.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

== Taxonomy and evolutionary history ==

The IUCN currently recognizes only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; ''Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi'' was named after the [[Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum|Tring Museum]]'s founder, [[Walter Rothschild]],&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,3604,1589085,00.html|title=Obituary - Betty Leslie-Melville|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 October 2005|accessdate=19 April 2007|location=London|first=Christopher|last=Reed}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also known as the '''Baringo giraffe''', after the [[Lake Baringo]] area of Kenya,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilec.or.jp/eg/lbmi/pdf/03_Lake_Baringo_27February2006.pdf |title=Lake Baringo |author=Odada, Eric O. |accessdate=7 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605055411/http://www.ilec.or.jp/eg/lbmi/pdf/03_Lake_Baringo_27February2006.pdf |archivedate= 5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as the '''Ugandan giraffe'''. All of those living in the wild are in protected areas in [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]]. In 2007, Rothschild's giraffe was proposed as a separate species from other giraffe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=David M.|last2=Brenneman|first2=Rick A.|last3=Koepfli|first3=Klaus-Peter|last4=Pollinger|first4=John P.|last5=Milá|first5=Borja|last6=Georgiadis|first6=Nicholas J.|last7=Louis|first7=Edward E.|last8=Grether|first8=Gregory F.|last9=Jacobs|first9=David K.|date=2007-01-01|title=Extensive population genetic structure in the giraffe|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-5-57|journal=BMC Biology|volume=5|pages=57|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-5-57|issn=1741-7007|pmc=2254591|pmid=18154651}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Rothschild's giraffe was proposed to be conspecific with the [[Nubian giraffe]], but that taxonomy has not been widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bercovitch|first=Fred B.|last2=Berry|first2=Philip S.M.|last3=Dagg|first3=Anne|last4=Deacon|first4=Francois|last5=Doherty|first5=John B.|last6=Lee|first6=Derek E.|last7=Mineur|first7=Frédéric|last8=Muller|first8=Zoe|last9=Ogden|first9=Rob|date=2017-02-20|title=How many species of giraffe are there?|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(16)31520-2?_returnURL=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982216315202?showall=true|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=27|issue=4|pages=R136–R137|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2016.12.039|issn=0960-9822|pmid=28222287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
The Rothschild's giraffe is easily distinguishable from other subspecies. The most obvious sign is in the coloring of the coat, or [[Fur|pelt]]. Whereas the [[reticulated giraffe]] has very clearly defined dark patches with bright-whitish channels between them, Rothschild's giraffe more closely resembles the [[Masai giraffe]]. However, when compared to the Masai giraffe, the Rothschild's [[ecotype]] is paler, the orange-brown patches are less jagged and sharp in shape, and the connective channel is of a [[Cream (colour)|creamier hue]] compared to that seen on the reticulated giraffe. In addition, Rothschild's giraffe displays no markings on the lower leg, giving it the impression of wearing white stockings.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Another distinguishing feature of Rothschild's giraffe, although harder to spot, is the number of [[ossicones]] on the head. This is the only ''[[Giraffe|Giraffa]]'' [[phenotype]] to be born with five ossicones. Two of these are the larger and more obvious ones at the top of the head, which are common to all giraffes. The third ossicone can often be seen in the center of the giraffe's forehead, and the other two are behind each ear.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} They are also taller than many other populations, measuring up to {{convert|5.88|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall.&lt;ref name=Dagg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dagg|first1=A.I.|first2=J. B.|last2=Foster|year=1982|title=The Giraffe. Its Biology, Behavior, and Ecology (with updated supplementary material)|publisher=Krieger Publishing Company|location=Malabar, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nowak1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Nowak|first=R. M.|year=1999|pages=1086–1089|title=Walker's Mammals of the World|volume=Volume 1|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, USA and London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are larger than females and their two largest ossicones are usually bald from sparring. They usually tend to be darker in colour than the females, although this is not a guaranteed sexing indicator.

== Habitat and distribution ==
Isolated populations of Rothschild's giraffes live in [[savannah]]s, [[grassland]]s and open [[woodland]]s of Uganda and Kenya. They are possibly regionally extinct from [[South Sudan]] and northeastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

== Ecology and behavior ==
[[File:Rothschilds giraffe at paignton arp.jpg|thumb|left|Rothschild's giraffe at [[Paignton Zoo]], [[England]].]]
Rothschild's giraffes mate at any time of the year and have a [[gestation period]] of 14 to 16 months, typically giving birth to a single calf. They live in small [[herd]]s, with males and females (and their calves) living separately, only mixing for mating.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

== Threats and conservation ==
Giraffes in general are classified as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. Very few locations are left where Rothschild's giraffe can be seen in the wild, with notable spots being [[Lake Nakuru National Park]] in Kenya&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1344/|title=Lake Nakuru National Park|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Murchison Falls National Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visituganda.com/parks.html |title=National Parks &amp; Safaris |publisher=Uganda Tourist Board |accessdate=9 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210172250/http://visituganda.com/parks.html |archivedate=10 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in northern Uganda.

== In captivity ==
Various captive breeding programmes are in place&amp;nbsp;— notably at the [[Giraffe Centre]] in [[Nairobi]], Kenya&amp;nbsp;— which aim to expand the [[gene pool]] in the wild population of Rothschild's giraffe. {{As of|January 2011}}, more than 450 are kept in [[International Species Information System|ISIS]] (international species information system)  registered zoos (which does not include the Nairobi Giraffe Centre), making both it and the [[reticulated giraffe]] the most commonly kept [[phenotype]]s of ''Giraffa''.&lt;ref name=ISIS&gt;International Species Information System (2011).

It is one of the four [[self-evaluation motives]] along with ''[[self-assessment]]'' (the drive for an accurate self-concept), ''[[self-verification]]'' (the drive for a self-concept congruent with one's identity) and ''[[self-improvement]]'' (the act of bettering one's self-concept).
Self-evaluation motives drive the process of self-regulation, that is, how people control and direct their own actions.

There are a variety of strategies that people can use to enhance their sense of personal worth. For example, they can downplay skills that they lack or they can criticise others to seem better by comparison. These strategies are successful, in that people tend to think of themselves as having more positive qualities and fewer negative qualities than others.&lt;ref name=kunda485&gt;{{harvnb |Kunda|1999|pp=485–486}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although self-enhancement is seen in people with low self-esteem as well as with high self-esteem, these two groups tend to use different strategies. People who already have high esteem enhance their self-concept directly, by processing new information in a biased way. People with low self-esteem use more indirect strategies, for example by avoiding situations in which their negative qualities will be noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Kunda|1999|pp=465–466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are controversies over whether or not self-enhancement is beneficial to the individual, and over whether self-enhancement is culturally universal or specific to Western individualism.

==Levels==
Self-enhancement can occur in many different situations and under many different guises. The general motive of self-enhancement can have many differing underlying explanations, each of which becomes more or less dominant depending on the situation.

The explanations of the self-enhancement motive can occur in different combinations. Self-enhancement can occur as an underlying motive or personality trait without occurring as an observed effect.

|header1 =
|label1  =   Observed Effect
|data1   = Self-enhancement at the level of an observed effect describes the product of the motive. For example, self-enhancement can produce inflated self-ratings (positive illusions). Such ratings would be self-enhancement manifested as an observed effect. It is an observable instance of the motive.
|header2 =
|label2  =   Ongoing Process
|data2   = Self-enhancement at the level of an ongoing process describes the actual operation of the motive. For example, self-enhancement can result in attributing favourable outcomes to the self and unfavourable outcomes to others (self-serving attribution bias). The actual act of attributing such ratings would be self-enhancement manifested as an ongoing process. It is the motive in operation.
|header3 =
|label3  =   Personality Trait
|data3   = Self-enhancement at the level of a personality trait describes habitual or inadvertent self-enhancement. For example, self-enhancement can cause situations to be created to ease the pain of failure (self-handicapping). The fabrication of such situations or excuses frequently and without awareness would be self-enhancement manifested as a personality trait. It is the repetitive inclination to demonstrate the motive.
|header4 =
|label4  =   Underlying Motive
|data4   = Self-enhancement at the level of an underlying motive describes the conscious desire to self-enhance. For example, self-enhancement can cause the comparison of the self to a worse other, making the self seem greater in comparison (strategic social comparisons). The act of comparing intentionally to achieve superiority would be self-enhancement manifested as an underlying motive. It is the genuine desire to see the self as superior.

==Dimensions==
Both the extent and the type of self-enhancement vary across a number of dimensions.&lt;ref name=SedikidesGregg2008 /&gt;

===Self-advancement vs. self-protection===
Self-enhancement can occur by either self-advancing or self-protecting, that is either by enhancing the positivity of one's self-concept, or by reducing the negativity of one's self-concept.&lt;ref name=Arkin1981&gt;{{Citation |last=Arkin |first=R. M.  | year = 1981 | title= Self-presentation styles. In J. Tedeschi (Ed.),'' Impression management theory and research'' (pp. 311-333). New York: Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-protection appears to be the stronger of the two motives, given that avoiding negativity is of greater importance than encouraging positivity.&lt;ref name=BaumeisterBratslavskyFinenauerVohs2001&gt;{{Citation |last=Baumeister |first=R.

People high in self-esteem tend to be greater risk takers and therefore opt for the more risky strategy of self-advancement, whereas those low in self-esteem and risk-taking hedge their bets with self-protection.&lt;ref name=JosephsLarrickSteeleNIsbett1992&gt;{{Citation |last=Josephs |first=R.

==Types==
Self-enhancement does not just occur at random. Its incidence is often highly systematic and can occur in any number of ways in order to achieve its goal of inflating perceptions of the self. Importantly, we are typically unaware that we are self-enhancing. Awareness of self-enhancing processes would highlight the facade we are trying to create, revealing that the self we perceive is in fact an enhanced version of our actual self.

===Self-serving attribution bias===
{{Main|Self-serving bias}}
Self-enhancement can also affect the causal explanations people generate for social outcomes. People have a tendency to exhibit a self-serving attribution bias, that is to attribute positive outcomes to one's internal disposition but negative outcomes to factors beyond one's control e.g. others, chance or circumstance.&lt;ref name=MezulisAbramsonHydeHankin2004&gt;{{Citation|last1=Mezulis|first1=Amy H.|last2=Abramson|first2=Lyn Y.|last3=Hyde|first3=Janet S.|last4=Hankin|first4=Benjamin L.|title=Is There a Universal Positivity Bias in Attributions?

People sometimes self-enhance by selectively remembering their strengths rather than weaknesses. This pattern of selective forgetting has been described as [[mnemic neglect]]. Mnemic neglect may reflect biases in the processing of information at either encoding, retrieval or retention.
*Biases at encoding occur via selective attention and selective exposure.
*Biases at retrieval and retention occur via selective recall.
The role of mnemic neglect can be emphasised or reduced by the characteristics of a certain behaviour or trait. For example, after receiving false feedback pertaining to a variety of behaviours, participants recalled more positive behaviours than negative ones, but only when the behaviours exemplified central not peripheral traits and only when feedback pertained to the self and not to others.&lt;ref name=SedikidesGreen2000&gt;{{Citation |last=Sedikides |first=C. |lastauthoramp=y | year = 2000 | title= On the self-protective nature of inconsistency/negativity management: Using the person memory paradigm to examine self-referent memory| journal =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | pages= 906–922 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.906 |pmid=11138760 |last2=Green |first2=JD |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar findings emerge when the to-be-recalled information is personality traits,&lt;ref name=MischelEbbesenZeiss1976&gt;{{Citation |last=Mischel |first=W.|lastauthoramp=y  | year = 1976 | title= Determinants of selective memory about the self| journal =  Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 44 | pages= 92–103 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.44.1.92 |pmid=1245637 |last2=Ebbesen |first2=EB |last3=Zeis |first3=AM |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; relationship promoting or undermining behaviours,&lt;ref name=vanLangeRusbultSemin-GoossensGoertsStalpers1999&gt;{{Citation |last=van Lange |first=P.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1999 | title= Being better than others but otherwise perfectly normal: Perceptions of uniqueness and similarity in close relationships| journal =  Personal Relationships | volume = 6 | pages= 269–289 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1999.tb00192.x |last2=Rusbult |first2=Caryl E. |last3=Semin-Goossens |first3=Astrid |last4=Gorts |first4=Carien A. |last5=Stalpers |first5=Mirjam |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; frequencies of social acts,&lt;ref name=GoslingJohnCraikRobins1998&gt;{{Citation|last1=Gosling|first1=Samuel D.|last2=John|first2=Oliver P.|last3=Craik|first3=Kenneth H.|last4=Robins|first4=Richard W.|title=Do people know how they behave?

====Selective acceptance and refutation====
Selective acceptance involves taking as fact self-flattering or ego-enhancing information with little regard for its validity. Selective refutation involves searching for plausible theories that enable criticism to be discredited. A good example of selective acceptance and refutation in action would be: Selective acceptance is the act of accepting as valid an examination on which one has performed well without consideration of alternatives, whereas selective refutation would be mindfully searching for reasons to reject as invalid an examination on which one has performed poorly.&lt;ref name=ArkinMaruyama1979&gt;{{Citation |last=Arkin |first=R.

===Strategies===

====Strategic social comparisons====
[[File:Social Comparison Diagram.JPG|thumb|200px|The potential directions for strategic social comparisons.]]
The social nature of the world we live in means that self-evaluation cannot take place in an absolute nature – comparison to other social beings is inevitable. Many social comparisons occur automatically as a consequence of circumstance, for example within an exam sitting social comparisons of intellect may occur to those sitting the same exam. However, the strength of the self-enhancement motive can cause the subjective exploitation of scenarios in order to give a more favourable outcome to the self in comparisons between the self and others. Such involuntary social comparisons prompt self-regulatory strategies.

Self-esteem moderates the beneficial, evaluative consequences of comparisons to both inferior and superior others. People with higher self-esteem are more optimistic about both evading the failures and misfortunes of their inferiors and about securing the successes and good fortunes of their superiors.&lt;ref name=BuunkCollinsTaylorVanYperenDakof1990&gt;{{Citation |last=Buunk |first=B. P.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1990 | title= The affective consequences of social comparisons: Either directions has its ups and downs| journal =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | pages= 1238–1249 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.6.1238 |pmid=2283590 |last2=Collins |first2=RL |last3=Taylor |first3=SE |last4=Vanyperen |first4=NW |last5=Dakof |first5=GA |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Upward social comparisons=====
An upwards social comparison involves comparing oneself to an individual perceived to be superior to or better than oneself. Upwards social comparison towards someone felt to be similar to oneself can induce self-enhancement through assimilation of the self and other's characteristics,&lt;ref name=Collins1996&gt;{{Citation |last=Collins |first=R. L.  | year = 1996 | title= For better for worse: The impact of upwards social comparison on self-evaluation| journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 119 | pages=51–69 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.51}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this only occurs when:
*The gap between the self and the comparison target is not too large;&lt;ref name=Wheeler1966&gt;{{Citation |last=Wheeler |first=L.  | year = 1966 | title= Motivation as a determinant of upwards social comparison| journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 2 | pages=27–31 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(66)90062-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The skill or success being compared is attainable;&lt;ref name=LockwoodKunda1997&gt;{{Citation |last=Lockwood |first=P.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1997 | title= Superstars and me: Predicting the impact of role models on self| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 73 | pages=91–103 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.1.91 |last2=Kunda |first2=Ziva}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The comparison target is perceived as a competitor.&lt;ref name=Wood1989&gt;{{Citation |last=Wood |first=J. V.  | year = 1989 | title= Theory and research concerning social comparison of personality attributes| journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 106 | pages=231–248 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.106.2.231 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Where assimilation does not occur as a result of a social comparison, contrast can instead occur which can lead to upwards social comparisons providing inspiration.&lt;ref name=Collins2000&gt;{{Citation |last=Collins |first=R. L. |lastauthoramp=y | year = 2000 | contribution= Among the better ones: Upward assimilation in social comparison|editor1=J. Suls|editor2=L. Wheeler|title=Handbook of social comparison'' |pages=159–172|location=New York|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Downward social comparisons=====
Even though upwards social comparisons are the most common social comparisons,&lt;ref name=Gruder1971&gt;{{Citation |last=Gruder |first=C. L.  | year = 1971 | title= Determinants of social comparison choices| journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 1 | pages=473–489 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(71)90010-2 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MillerTrunbullMcFarland1988&gt;{{Citation |last=Miller |first=D.

Downwards social comparisons involve comparing oneself to an individual perceived to be inferior to or less skilled than the self. Downwards social comparisons serve as a form of ego-defence whereby the ego is inflated due to the sense of superiority gained from such downwards social comparisons.&lt;ref name=BiernatBillings2001&gt;{{Citation |last=Biernat |first=M.|author2=Billings, L.

A.|year=1991|title=Social comparison: Contemporary theory and research|location=Hillsdale, NJ|publisher=Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Lateral social comparisons=====
Lateral social comparisons, comparisons against those perceived as equal to the self, can also be self-enhancing. Comparisons with members of one's in-group can lead be protective against low self-esteem, especially when the in-group are disadvantaged.&lt;ref name=CrockerVoelklTestaMajor1991&gt;{{Citation |last=Crocker |first=J., Voelkl, K.|author2=Testa, M.|author3=Major, B.|lastauthoramp=y   | year = 1991 | title= Social stigma and self-esteem: The self-protective properties of stigma| journal = Psychological Review | volume = 96 | pages=803–808 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.96.4.608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Self-evaluation maintenance theory=====
{{Main|Self-evaluation maintenance theory}}
Self-enhancement waxes and wanes as a function of one's ability level in the context of interpersonal relationships, and this, in turn influences interpersonal attitudes and behaviours. Three factors influence the self-evaluations people make:&lt;ref name=Tesser1988&gt;{{Citation |last=Tesser |first=A.  | year = 1988 | title= Towards a self-evaluation maintenance model of social behaviour. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.),'' Advances in experimental social psychology'' (vol. 21, pp. 181-227). New York: Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Closeness of a relationship:'' comparison of one's own performance with that of another is more likely to occur, and when it does is more consequential when others are close rather than distant.
*''Personal relevance of a particular ability:'' when the domain is not relevant to oneself reflection will occur and when the domain is relevant comparison will occur.
**''Reflection:'' one will undergo self-enhancement (pride) when the other does well, but self-derogation (shame) when the other does poorly.
**''Comparison:'' one will undergo self-derogation (humiliation) if others perform well, but self-enhancement (triumph) if the other performs poorly.
*Level of performance in that ability domain.

People adopt a variety of coping strategies to deal with the pressures of self-evaluation:
*Choose friends and partners who excel, but not in the same domains as they do;&lt;ref name=BeachTesser1993&gt;{{Citation |last=Beach |first=S. R. H.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1993 | title= Decision making power and marital satisfaction: A self-evaluation maintenance perspective| journal =  Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 12 | pages= 471–494 |doi=10.1521/jscp.1993.12.4.471 |last2=Tesser |first2=Abraham |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Withhold information that is likely to improve the performance of others of personally relevant domains;&lt;ref name=PembertonSedikides2001&gt;{{Citation |last=Pemberton |first=M.|lastauthoramp=y| year = 2001 | title= When do individuals help close others improve?

*Alter the relevance of performance domains by changing their self-concept, thus moderating the impact of the reflection and comparison processes;&lt;ref name=TesserPaulhus1983&gt;{{Citation |last=Tesser |first=A.|lastauthoramp=y| year = 1983 | title= The definition of self: Private and public self-evaluation maintenance strategies| journal =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | pages= 672–682 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.4.672 |last2=Paulhus |first2=Del |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Broaden or narrow the gap between the oneself and others, even by deliberately altering the difficulty of domain-relevant tasks.&lt;ref name=TesserSmith1980&gt;{{Citation |last=Tesser |first=A.|lastauthoramp=y  | year = 1980 | title= Some effects of task relevance and friendship on helping: You don't always help the one you like| journal =  Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 16 | pages= 582–590 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(80)90060-8 |last2=Smith |first2=Jonathan |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strategic construal====
The concepts that people use to understand themselves and their social world are relatively vague.&lt;ref name=CantorMischel1979&gt;{{Citation |last=Cantor |first=N.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1979 | title= Prototypicality and personality: Effects on free recall and personality impressions| journal =  Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 13 | pages= 187–205 |doi=10.1016/0092-6566(79)90030-8 |last2=Mischel |first2=Walter |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, when making social comparisons or estimations people can easily and subtly shift their construal of the meaning of those concepts in order to self-enhance. Strategic construals typically increase following negative feedback.&lt;ref name=DunningLeuenbergerSherman1995&gt;{{Citation |last=Dunning |first=D.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1995 | title= A new look at motivated inference: Are self-serving theories of success a product of motivational forces?| journal =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 69 | pages= 58–68 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.1.58 |last2=Leuenberger |first2=Ann |last3=Sherman |first3=David A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous examples of strategic construals exist, a small selection include:
*People's interpretation of what counts as a virtue or talent is biased in favour of the attributes they possess, and of what counts as a vice or deficiency in favour of attributes they lack.&lt;ref name=DunningPerieStory1991&gt;{{Citation |last=Dunning |first=D.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1991 | title= Self-serving prototypes of social categories| journal =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 61 | pages= 957–968 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.6.957 |pmid=1774633 |last2=Perie |first2=M |last3=Story |first3=AL |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*People rate personality feedback and scientific research as less credible if it implies they are susceptible to disease.&lt;ref name=DittoBoardman1995&gt;{{Citation |last=Ditto |first=P.

*Lazy people perceive the rest of the world as reasonably fit and healthy, whereas frequent exercisers see their athleticism as a single, unique attribute.&lt;ref name=DunningCohen1992&gt;{{Citation |last=Dunning |first=D.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1992 | title= Egocentric definitions of traits and abilities in social judgment| journal =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 63 | pages= 341–355 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.3.341 |last2=Cohen |first2=Geoffrey L. |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Low achievers in a particular area are likely to perceive the successes of high achievers as exceptional, thereby lessening the shame of their own inability.&lt;ref name=AlickeLoSchiavoZerbstZhang1997&gt;{{Citation |last=Alicke |first=M.

*People think harder about any discouraging test results they receive, will spend longer thinking about them, are more inclined to have them confirmed and are significantly more skeptical of them.&lt;ref name=DittoLopez1992&gt;{{Citation |last=Ditto |first=P.

*When research tarnishes the reputation of groups with which people identify, they search for a statistical weakness of that research.&lt;ref name=DoosjeSpearsKoomen1995&gt;{{Citation |last=Doosje |first=B.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1995 | title= When bad isn't all bad: The strategic use of sample information in generalization and stereotyping| journal =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 69 | pages= 642–655 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.4.642 |last2=Spears |first2=Russell |last3=Koomen |first3=Willem |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Strategic construals can also be more subtle. People make self-aggrandizing interpretations not only of their own attributes, but also of others in order to appear greater by comparison.

Strategic construals appear to operate around one's [[self-esteem]]. After either positive or negative feedback people with high self-esteem alter their perceptions of others, typically varying their perceptions of others ability and performance in a self-enhancing direction.&lt;ref name=DunningBeauregard2000&gt;{{Citation |last=Dunning |first=D.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 2000 | title= Regulating impressions of others to affirm images of the self| journal =  Social Cognition | volume = 18 | pages= 198–222 |doi=10.1521/soco.2000.18.2.198 |last2=Beauregard |first2=Keith S. |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with low self-esteem however do not. Self-esteem level appears to moderate the use of strategic construals. As well as operating as a function of self-esteem level, strategic construals also appear to protect self-esteem levels. For example, members of minority groups who perform poorly in academic settings due to negative cultural attitudes towards them, subsequently disengage psychologically from, and dissidentify with academic pursuits in general. Whilst buffering their self-esteem level they jeopardise their future socioeconomic prospects.&lt;ref name=CrockerMajorSteele1998&gt;{{Citation |last=Crocker |first=J.|author2=Major, B.|author3=Steele, C. |lastauthoramp=y | year = 1998 | contribution= Social stigma|editor1=D. T. Gilbert|editor2=S. T. Fiske|editor3=G. Lindzey|title=The handbook of social psychology|edition=4th |pages=504–553|location=New York|publisher=McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic construals also influence the degree to which categories are believed to characterise other people. There is a general tendency to assume that others share one's own characteristics.&lt;ref name=RossGreeneHouse1977&gt;{{Citation |last=Ross |first=L.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1977 | title= The false consensus effect: An attributional bias in self-perception and social perception processes| journal =  Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 13 | pages= 279–301 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(77)90049-X |last2=Greene |first2=David |last3=House |first3=Pamela |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, people reliably overestimate the prevalence of their shortcomings e.g. show enhanced false consensus effect, and underestimate the prevalence of their strengths e.g. show a contrary false uniqueness effect.&lt;ref name=MullenGoethals1990&gt;{{Citation |last=Mullen |first=B.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1990 | title= Social projection, actual consensus and valence| journal =  British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 29 | pages= 279–282 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8309.1990.tb00907.x |last2=Goethals |first2=George R. |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; People perceive their flaws as relatively commonplace but their skills as unique.

===Behavioural self-handicapping===
{{Main|Self-handicapping}}
Behavioural self-handicapping is the act of erecting obstacles in the path of task success in order to reduce the evaluative implications that can be drawn from task performance.&lt;ref name=JonesBerglas1978&gt;{{Citation |last=Jones |first=E. E.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1978 | title= Control of attributions about the self through self-handicapping strategies: The appeal of alcohol and underachievement| journal =  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 4 | pages= 200–206 |doi=10.1177/014616727800400205 |last2=Berglas |first2=S. |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This permits self-enhancement to occur in two ways:&lt;ref name=FeickRhodewalt1997&gt;{{Citation |last=Feick |first=D.

*In the case of failure, self-handicapping can protect self-esteem by attributing failure to obstacles that one has erected – ''discounting''.
*In the case of success, self-handicapping can promote self-esteem by attributing success to oneself despite the obstacles one has erected – ''augmenting''.
People low in self-esteem opt for discounting as a self-protective route to avoid being perceived as incompetent, whereas people high in self-esteem preferentially select augmenting as a method of self-promotion to enhance their perceived competence,.&lt;ref name="Tice1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RhodewaltMorfHazlettFairfield1991&gt;{{Citation|authorlink1=Frederick Rhodewalt |last=Rhodewalt |first=F.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1991 | title= Self-handicapping: The role of discounting and augmentation in the preservation of self-esteem| journal =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 61 | pages= 122–131 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.1.122 |last2=Morf |first2=Carolyn |last3=Hazlett |first3=Susan |last4=Fairfield |first4=Marita}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-handicapping, whilst predominantly a behaviour that occurs in private performance&lt;ref name=RhodewaltFairfield1991&gt;{{Citation|authorlink1=Frederick Rhodewalt|last=Rhodewalt |first=F.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1991 | title= Claimed self-handicaps and the self-handicapper: The relation of reduction in intended effort to performance| journal =  Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 25 | pages= 402–417 |doi=10.1016/0092-6566(91)90030-T |last2=Fairfield |first2=Marita |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is magnified in public situations.&lt;ref name=TiceBaumeister1990&gt;{{Citation |last=Tice |first=D.

Regardless of the causes of self-handicapping the self-defeating end result remains the same – the integrity and quality of a task outcome or evaluation is compromised in order that the meaning of that outcome appears more agreeable. Behavioural self-handicapping is a good demonstration of active self-deception.&lt;ref name=Giannetti2001&gt;{{Citation |last=Giannetti |first=E.  | year = 2001 | title='' Lies we live by: The art of self-deception.''

Whilst task performance is important to people, they do sometimes act in ways so as to paradoxically impair task performance,&lt;ref name=JonesBerglas1978 /&gt; either to protect against the shame of performing poorly by creating a convenient excuse (discounting), or to enhance themselves by succeeding despite adversity by creating grounds for conceit (augmenting).&lt;ref name=RhodewaltMorfHazlettFairfield1991 /&gt; Furthermore, self-handicapping can have unintentional adverse consequences.

===Self-enhancing triad===

====Above-average effect====
{{Main|Illusory superiority}}
The [[Illusory superiority|better-than-average-effect]] is the most common demonstration of an above-average effect. It is a highly robust effect, as evidenced by the fact that even when the criteria on which the self and others are judged are identical the self is still perceived more favourably.&lt;ref name=AlickeVredenburgHiattGovorun2001 /&gt; Things close to the self also take on the perceived superiority of the above-average effect. People value both their close relationships&lt;ref name=Murray1999&gt;{{Citation |last=Murray |first=S. L.  | year = 1999 | title= The quest for conviction: Motivated cognition in romantic relationships| journal =  Psychological Inquiry | volume = 10 | pages= 23–34 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1001_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RusbultvanLangeWildschutYovetichVerette2000&gt;{{Citation |last=Rusbult |first=C.

However, where an outcome is perceived as highly skilled, people often err on the side of caution and display a [[worse-than-average effect]]. The majority of people would rate themselves as below average in unicycling ability, for example.
[[File:Self-Enhancing Triad.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The three related divisions of the self-enhancing triad.]]

The illusory nature of the above-average effect comes from the fact that not everyone can be above-average – otherwise the average would not be the average! The majority of people rating themselves as being better than the majority of people does not quite seem plausible, and in some situations is 100% impossible. Where a distribution is symmetrical i.e. mean = median = mode, it is statistically impossible for the majority of people to be above average, as whichever of the three averages is taken, all are equal to the 50th percentile.&lt;ref name=Brown1998&gt;{{Citation |last=Brown |first=J.  | year = 1998 | title='' The self.'' New York: McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a non-symmetrical distribution i.e. mean &lt; median &lt; mode or mode &lt; median &lt; mean, it is statistically impossible for the majority of people to be above average when the average is taken to be the median, as the median represents the 50th percentile, or the midpoint of the data.&lt;ref name=Brown1998 /&gt; However, in a non-symmetrical distribution where the average is taken to be either the mean or the mode, the above-average effect can be statistically plausible. In some situations the majority of people can be above-average!

People show self-enhancement in the form of the above-average effect in many different ways. It is typical for people to profess to be above-average at a task yielding positive or desirable outcomes, and below average at a task yielding negative or undesirable outcomes.

Some of the wide variety of documented examples of the above-average effect include observations that:

*Most university students regard themselves as well above the 50th percentile in exhibiting social grace, athletic prowess and leadership abilities.&lt;ref name=Alicke1985&gt;{{Citation |last=Alicke |first=M.

Self-enhancement thrives upon the vagueness or ambiguity of evidence. Where criteria are rigidly defined, self-enhancement typically reduces. For example, the above-average effect decreases as clarity and definition of the defined trait increases.&lt;ref name=vanLangeSedikides1998&gt;{{Citation |last=van Lange |first=P. A.

The plausibility of a trait or characteristic given real world evidence moderates the degree to which the self-enhancement of that trait occurs.

When plausibility reduces the impact of self-enhancement, undesirable evidence often has to be accepted, albeit reluctantly.

The constraint of plausibility on self enhancement exists because self-enhancing biases cannot be exploited. Self-enhancement works only under the assumption of rationality – to admit to self-enhancing totally undermines any conclusions one can draw and any possibility of believing its facade, since according to legit rational processes it functions as a genuinely verifiable and accredited improvement.&lt;ref name=GilbertPinelWilsonBlumbergWheatley1998&gt;{{Citation |last=Gilbert |first=D.

===Mood===
Both positive and negative moods can reduce the presence of the self-enhancement motive. The effects of mood on self-enhancement can be explained by a negative mood making the use self-enhancing tactics harder, and a positive mood making their use less necessary in the first place.

The onset of a positive mood can make people more receptive to negative diagnostic feedback. Past successes are reviewed with expectation of receiving such positive feedback, presumably to buffer their mood.&lt;ref name=TropeNeter1994&gt;{{Citation |last=Trope |first=Y. |lastauthoramp=y  | year = 1994 | title= Reconciling competing motives in self-evaluation: The role of self-control in feedback seeking| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 66 | pages=646–657 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.4.646 |pmid=8189345 |last2=Neter |first2=E |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social context and relationships===
The presence of the motive to self-enhance is dependent on many social situations, and the relationships shared with the people in them. Many different materialisations of self-enhancement can occur depending on such social contexts:
*The self-enhancement motive is weaker during interactions with close and significant others.
*When friends (or previous strangers whose intimacy levels have been enhanced) cooperate on a task, they do not exhibit a self-serving attribution bias.
**Casual acquaintances and true strangers however do exhibit a self-serving attribution bias.&lt;ref name=SedikidesHerbstHardinDardis2002/&gt;
**Where no self-serving bias is exhibited in a relationship, a betrayal of trust in the relationship will reinstate the self-serving bias. This corresponds to findings that relationship satisfaction is inversely correlated with the betrayal of trust.&lt;ref name=FinchamBradbury1989&gt;{{Citation |last=Fincham |first=F.

Self-enhancement appears to be a phenomenon largely limited to Western cultures, where social ties are looser than in the East. This is concordant with empirical evidence highlighting relationship closeness as a constraint on self-enhancement.&lt;ref name=SedikidesCampbellReederElliot2002&gt;{{Citation |last=Sedikides |first=C.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 2002 | title= The self in relationships: Whether, how and when close others put the self "in its place"|editor1= W.

One possible explanation for the observed differences in self-enhancement between cultures is that they may occur through differences in how candidly of tactically the motive to self-enhance is acted upon, and not due to variations in the strength of motive.&lt;ref name=SedikidesStrube1997/&gt; Alternatively, self-enhancement may be represented only in terms of the characteristics that are deemed important by individuals as they strive to fulfil their culturally prescribed roles.

The issue over whether self-enhancement is universal or specific to Western cultures has been contested within modern literature by two researchers — [[Constantine Sedikides]] and [[Steven Heine (psychologist)|Steven Heine]]. Sedikides argues that self-enhancement is universal, and that different cultures self-enhance in domains important in their culture. Heine on the other hand describes self-enhancement as a predominantly Western motive.&lt;ref name=SedikidesGaertnerToguchi2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GaertnerSedikidesChang2008&gt;{{Citation |last=Gaertner |first=L.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 2008 | title= On pancultural self-enhancement: Well-adjusted Taiwanese self-enhance on personally valued traits| journal =  Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 39 | pages= 463–477 |doi=10.1177/0022022108318431 |last2=Sedikides |first2=C. |last3=Chang |first3=K. |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HeineKitayamaHamamura2007a&gt;{{Citation |last=Heine |first=S.

===Other motives===
It is an exaggeration to say that self-enhancement is the dominant [[self-evaluation motives|self-evaluation motive]]. Many controversies exist regarding the distinction between the self-evaluation motives, and there are situations in which motives asides from self-enhancement assume priority.
#The [[self-assessment]] motive is often contrasted with the self-enhancement motive due to the relative adaptiveness of each approach within social interactions.
#The [[self-verification]] motive is often challenged by supporters of the self-enhancement as being unfeasible as it often appears implausible.
#The [[self-improvement]] motive is often taken to be the physical manifestation of the self-enhancement motive i.e. the act of attaining desired positive self views.
Where the truth about oneself worsens or varies it gradually becomes less feasible to satisfy all motives simultaneously.

In an attempt to compare the self-evaluation motives (excluding self-improvement) a self-reflection task was employed. Participants were asked to choose the question they would most likely ask themselves in order to determine whether they possessed a certain [[Personality type|personality]] trait. On the whole, people self-enhanced more than they self-assessed or self-verified. People chose higher diagnosticity questions concerning central, positive traits than central, negative ones, and answered yes more often to central, positive than negative questions. Also, people self-verified more than the self-assessed, and chose more questions overall concerning relatively certain central traits than relatively uncertain peripheral traits.&lt;ref name=Sedikides1993&gt;{{Citation|last1=Sedikides|first1=Constantine|title=Assessment, enhancement, and verification determinants of the self-evaluation process|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=65|issue=2|year=1993|pages=317–338|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.2.317|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]], a '''set''' is a group of expectations that shape experience by making people especially sensitive to specific kinds of information. A ''perceptual set'', also called ''perceptual expectancy'', is a predisposition to [[perception|perceive]] things in a certain way.&lt;ref name="Weiten2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiten|first=Wayne|title=Psychology: Themes and Variations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&amp;pg=PT193|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=17 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-60197-5|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses.&lt;ref name="Sonderegger1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sonderegger|first=Theo|title=Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUrCHiSb_QsC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=16 October 1998|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-8220-5327-9|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one's own name in a crowded room, or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Malcolm|last2=Heyes|first2=Steve|title=Beginning Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=2 December 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-832821-6|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''mental set'' is a framework for thinking about a problem.&lt;ref name="Galotti2009" /&gt; It can be shaped by habit or by desire.&lt;ref name="SharmaChandra2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Ram Nath|last2=Chandra|first2=S.S.|title=General Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wJ0om-uxWpcC&amp;pg=PA253|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=978-81-269-0303-0|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental sets can make it easy to solve a class of problem, but attachment to the wrong mental set can inhibit problem-solving and creativity.&lt;ref name="Galotti2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Galotti|first=Kathleen M.|title=Cognitive Psychology: In and Out of the Laboratory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezZWTurJuH0C&amp;pg=PA341|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=5 February 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-17-644065-7|pages=341–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruno2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruno|first=Frank Joe|title=Psychology: a self-teaching guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W3NxvYRL-fgC&amp;pg=PA127|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=2 August 2002|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-44395-7|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptual==
Perception can be shaped by "top-down" processes such as drives and expectations. An effect of these factors is that people are particularly sensitive to perceive certain things, detecting them from weaker stimuli than otherwise.&lt;ref name="CoonMitterer2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coon|first1=Dennis|last2=Mitterer|first2=John O.|title=Introduction to Psychology: Gateways to Mind and Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=29 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59911-1|pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non-words such as "sael". Subjects who were told to expect words about animals read it as "seal", but others who were expecting boat-related words read it as "sail".&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999" /&gt;

Sets can be created by [[motivation]] and so can result in people interpreting ambiguous situations so that they see what they want to see.&lt;ref name="CoonMitterer2008"/&gt; For instance, a person's experience of the events in a sports match can be biased if they strongly support one of the teams.&lt;ref name="BlockYuker2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=J. R.|last2=Yuker|first2=Harold E.|title=Can You Believe Your Eyes?: Over 250 Illusions and Other Visual Oddities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNMFiMQu8BMC&amp;pg=PA173|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=1 October 2002|publisher=Robson|isbn=978-1-86105-586-6|pages=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one experiment, students were allocated to pleasant or unpleasant tasks by a computer. They were told that either a number or a letter would flash on the screen to say whether they were going to taste an orange juice drink or an unpleasant-tasting health drink. In fact, an ambiguous figure was flashed on screen, which could either be read as the letter B or the number 13. When the letters were associated with the pleasant task, subjects were more likely to perceive a letter B, and when letters were associated with the unpleasant task they tended to perceive a number 13.&lt;ref name="Weiten2008" /&gt;

Perceptual sets have been demonstrated in many social contexts. People who are [[priming (psychology)|primed]] to think of someone as "warm" are more likely to perceive a variety of positive characteristics in them, than if the word "warm" is replaced by "cold". When someone has a reputation for being funny, an audience are more likely to find them amusing.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999" /&gt; Individual's perceptual sets reflect their own personality traits. For example, people with an aggressive personality are quicker to correctly identify aggressive words or situations.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999" /&gt;

==Mental==
Mental sets are subconscious tendencies to approach a problem in a particular way.&lt;ref name="Bruno2002" /&gt; They are shaped by past experiences and habits.&lt;ref name="Mangal2007" /&gt; An inappropriate mental set can hamper the solution of straightforward problems.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999" /&gt; For example, when people are asked, "When a United States plane carrying Canadian passengers crashes in international waters, where should the survivors be buried?" the phrasing of the question suggests that it is a problem of international law. People who interpret the statement with this mental set will miss the fact that survivors would not need to be buried.&lt;ref name="Bruno2002" /&gt; A specific form of mental set is ''functional fixedness'', in which someone fails to see the variety of uses to which an object can be put.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruno2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mangal2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangal|first=S. K.|title=Essentials of educational psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XyYPIr120ZcC&amp;pg=PA393|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=1 August 2007|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-203-3055-9|pages=393–394}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be someone who needs a weight but fails to use an easily available hammer because their mental set is to think of a hammer as for a specific purpose.&lt;ref name="Bruno2002" /&gt;

'''Soil conservation''' is the preventing of soil loss from [[erosion]] or reduced fertility caused by over usage, acidification, salinization or other chemical [[soil contamination]].

[[Slash-and-burn]] and other unsustainable methods of [[subsistence farming]] are practiced in some lesser developed areas. A sequel to the deforestation is typically large scale [[erosion]], loss of soil nutrients and sometimes total [[desertification]]. Techniques for improved soil conservation include [[crop rotation]], [[cover crop]]s, [[Tillage#Conservation tillage|conservation tillage]] and planted [[windbreak]]s and affect both erosion and fertility. When plants, especially trees, die, they decay and become part of the soil. Code 330 defines standard methods recommended by the U.S. [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]].
Farmers have practiced soil conservation for millennia. In Europe, policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy are targeting the application of best management practices such as reduced tillage, winter cover crops,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panagos|first=Panos|last2=Borrelli|first2=Pasquale|last3=Meusburger|first3=Katrin|last4=Alewell|first4=Christine|last5=Lugato|first5=Emanuele|last6=Montanarella|first6=Luca|title=Estimating the soil erosion cover-management factor at the European scale|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264837715001611|journal=Land Use Policy|volume=48|pages=38–50|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.05.021|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; plant residues and grass margins in order to better address the soil conservation.Political and economic action is further required to solve the erosion problem. A simple governance hurdle concerns how we name and value the land and what we call it and this can be changed by cultural adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panagos|first=Panos|last2=Imeson|first2=Anton|last3=Meusburger|first3=Katrin|last4=Borrelli|first4=Pasquale|last5=Poesen|first5=Jean|last6=Alewell|first6=Christine|date=2016-08-01|title=Soil Conservation in Europe: Wish or Reality?|journal=Land Degradation &amp; Development|language=en|volume=27|issue=6|pages=1547–1551|doi=10.1002/ldr.2538|issn=1099-145X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contour ploughing  ==
[[Contour ploughing]] orients furrows following the [[contour line]]s of the farmed area. Furrows move left and right to maintain a constant altitude, which reduces [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. Contour ploughing was practiced by the ancient [[Phoenicia]]ns, and is effective for slopes between two and ten percent.&lt;ref&gt;''Predicting soil erosion by water, a guide to conservation planning in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation'', [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Agricultural Research Service, Agricultural handbook no. 703 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Contour plowing can increase crop yields from 10 to 50 percent, partially as a result of greater soil retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/contourfarmingbo23unit|title=Contour farming boosts yields: a farmer's guide in laying out key contour lines and establishing grassed waterways|last=United States. Department of Agriculture|first=National Agricultural Library|date=1943-01-01|publisher=[Washington, D.C.] : U.S. Dept. of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Terrace Farming ==
[[terrace (agriculture)|Terracing]] is the practice of creating nearly level areas in a hillside area. The terraces form a series of steps, each at a higher level than the previous. Terraces are protected from erosion by other soil barriers.

Terraced farming is more common on small farms and in underdeveloped countries, since mechanized equipment is difficult to deploy in this setting.
It protects the soil from its erosion. It is one of the way by which soil erosion can be stopped. It is the step can be cut out on the slopes making terraces. It restricts soil erosion. It is practiced in western and central Himalayas

== Keyline design ==

[[Keyline design]] is an enhancement of contour farming, where the total watershed properties are taken into account in forming the [[contour line]]s.

== Perimeter runoff control ==
[[File:Runoff and filtersoxx.ogv|thumb|350px|runoff and filter soxx]]

Tree, [[shrub]]s and [[ground-cover]] are effective perimeter treatment for [[soil erosion]] prevention, by impeding surface flows. A special form of this perimeter or inter-row treatment is the use of a “grass way” that both [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s and dissipates runoff through surface friction, impeding [[surface runoff]] and encouraging infiltration of the slowed surface water.&lt;ref&gt;''Perimeter landscaping of Carneros Business Park'', Lumina Technologies, Santa Rosa, Ca., prepared for Sonoma County, Ca. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Windbreaks==

Windbreaks are sufficiently dense rows of [[tree]]s at the [[Windward and leeward|windward]] exposure of an agricultural field subject to [[wind]] [[erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Summer, ''Modelling Soil Erosion, Sediment Transport and Closely Related Hydrological Processes'' entry by Mingyuan Du, Peiming Du, Taichi Maki and Shigeto Kawashima, “Numerical modeling of air flow over complex terrain concerning wind erosion”, International Association of Hydrological Sciences publication no. 249 (1998)  {{ISBN|1-901502-50-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evergreen]] [[species]] provide year-round protection; however, as long as [[foliage]] is present in the seasons of bare [[soil]] surfaces, the effect of [[deciduous]] trees may be adequate.

== Cover crops/crop rotation ==

Cover crops such as legumes plant, white turnip, radishes and other species are rotated with cash crops to blanket the soil year-round and act as [[green manure]] that replenishes nitrogen and other critical nutrients. Cover crops also help suppress weeds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news

== Soil-conservation farming ==

Soil-conservation farming involves [[no-till farming]], “green manures” and other soil-enhancing practices.  Such farming methods attempt to mimic the biology of [[barren lands]]. They can revive damaged soil, minimize erosion, encourage plant growth, eliminate the use of nitrogen fertilizer or fungicide, produce above-average yields and protect crops during droughts or flooding. The result is less labor and lower costs that increase farmers’ profits. No-till farming and cover crops act as sinks for nitrogen and other nutrients. This increases the amount of [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Repeated plowing/tilling degrades soil, killing its beneficial fungi and earthworms. Once damaged, soil may take multiple seasons to fully recover, even in optimal circumstances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Critics argue that no-till and related methods are impractical and too expensive for many growers, partly because it requires new equipment. They cite advantages for conventional tilling depending on the geography, crops and soil conditions. Some farmers claimed that no-till complicates weed control, delays planting and that post-harvest residues, especially for corn, are hard to manage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Salinity management==
[[File:Aralship2.jpg|thumb|right|Salt deposits on the former bed of the [[Aral Sea]]]]

{{Main article|Soil salinity control}}
[[Salinity]] in soil is caused by irrigating with salty water. Water then evaporates from the soil leaving the salt behind. Salt breaks down the soil structure, causing infertility and reduced growth.
 
The [[ions]] responsible for salination are: [[sodium]] (Na&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[potassium]] (K&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;2+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;2+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and [[chlorine]] (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Salinity is estimated to affect about one third of the earth’s [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Yaron, ''Salinity in Irrigation and Water Resources'', Marcel Dekker, New York (1981)   {{ISBN|0-8247-6741-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil salinity adversely affects crop [[metabolism]] and erosion usually follows.

Salinity occurs on [[drylands]] from [[Irrigation|overirrigation]] and in areas with shallow saline water tables. Over-irrigation deposits salts in upper soil layers as a byproduct of soil [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]; irrigation merely increases the rate of salt deposition. The best-known case of shallow [[saline water]] table [[capillary action]] occurred in [[Egypt]] after the 1970 construction of the [[Aswan Dam]]. The change in the [[groundwater]] level led to high salt concentrations in the water table. The continuous high level of the [[water table]] led to [[soil salination]].

Use of [[humic acid]]s may prevent excess salination, especially given excessive irrigation. Humic acids can fix both [[anion]]s and [[cation]]s and eliminate them from [[root|root zones]]. Planting species that can tolerate saline conditions to produce surface cover can preserve soil salinity can be reduced. Salt-tolerant plants include [[saltbush]], a plant found in much of [[North America]] and in the [[Mediterranean]] regions of [[Europe]].

Pagal Organisms In Soil
[[File:K 1033CR08-9 Yellow fungus on stalk.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Yellow fungus, a [[mushroom]] that assists in organic decay.]]

When worms excrete [[faeces|egesta]] in the form of [[Vermicompost|casts]], a balanced selection of minerals and plant nutrients is made into a form accessible for [[root]] uptake. [[Earthworm]] casts are five times richer in available [[nitrogen]], seven times richer in available [[phosphate]]s and eleven times richer in available [[potash]] than the surrounding upper {{Convert|150|mm}} of soil. The weight of casts produced may be greater than 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg per worm per year. By burrowing, the earthworm improves soil [[poros]]ity, creating channels that enhance the processes of aeration and drainage.&lt;ref&gt;Bill  Mollison, ''Permaculture: A Designer's Manual'', Tagari Press, (December 1, 1988), 576 pages, {{ISBN|0908228015}}. Increases in porosity enhance infiltration and thus reduce adverse effects of [[surface runoff]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important soil organisms include [[nematodes]], [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrizha]] and [[bacteria]].

Degraded soil requires [[synthetic fertilizer]] to produce high yields. Lacking structure increases erosion and carries nitrogen and other pollutants into rivers and streams.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Each one percent increase in soil organic matter helps soil hold '''20,000''' gallons more water per acre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mineralization==
To allow plants full realization of their [[phytonutrient]] potential, active [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of the soil is sometimes undertaken. This can involve adding crushed rock or chemical soil supplements. In either case the purpose is to [[combat]] [[mineral]] depletion. A broad range of minerals can be used, including common substances such  as [[phosphorus]] and more exotic substances such as [[zinc]] and [[selenium]]. Extensive research examines the phase transitions of minerals in soil with aqueous contact.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur T. Hubbard, ''Encyclopedia of Surface and Colloid Science Vol 3'', Santa Barbara, California Science Project, Marcel Dekker, New York (2004) {{ISBN|0-8247-0759-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flooding can bring significant [[sediments]] to an [[alluvial]] plain. While this effect may not be desirable if floods endanger life or if the sediment originates from productive land, this process of addition to a [[floodplain]] is a natural process that can rejuvenate soil chemistry through mineralization.

==Local campaigns==
===Canada===
Stop Murder Music (Canada) is an independent branch of the organization in [[Canada]], founded by Akim Adé Larcher, after learning at a local [[West Indian]] store about a Canadian Tour by Elephant Man.  Larcher, a Canadian/Saint Lucian, brought together over 20 organizations from the African and Caribbean communities in Canada to form the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mygsa.ca/SMMC |title=Stop Murder Music (Canada) (SMMC) &amp;#124; Egale Canada's |publisher=Mygsa.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Despite not causing any artists to be denied entry visas, the campaign was able to get concert venues cancelled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Krishna Rau / Toronto / Thursday, October 11, 2007 |url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?AFF_TYPE=3&amp;STORY_ID=3703&amp;PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=1 |title=Koolhaus cancels concerts amid queer outrage |publisher=Xtra.ca |date=2007-10-11 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also get iTunes to remove some tracks by Buju Banton, Elephant Man and TOK that they deemed contrary to their standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(Jenna Wakani photo) |url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?STORY_ID=4593&amp;PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=2 |title=iTunes Canada pulls anti-gay dancehall songs |publisher=Xtra.ca |date=2008-04-07 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[Green Party of England and Wales]] and [[OutRage!]] campaigned on behalf of the stop murder music campaign, including petitioning the [[United Kingdom]] [[Home Secretary]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Reggae star barred from Britain. |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/pop_music/sizzla.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104071246/http://petertatchell.net/pop_music/sizzla.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-04 |title=Sizzla Denied Visa |publisher=Peter Tatchell |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for and against==
Tatchell has called for laws against homophobic music and the Campaign participated in protests outside concerts. The Campaign has especially objected to lyrics which they allege to support violence, including allegedly murder, towards gay men. Dennis Carney, chair of the Black Gay Men's Advisory Group, argued in 2004 that the [[MOBO Awards]] had a responsibility to exclude anti-gay artists because, "homophobic lyrics in music normalise hatred towards black gay men."&lt;ref&gt;Graver, Mark (2004). [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/13190.php "Why homophobic lyrics in reggae music are a health issue for black gay men"], ''MedicalNewsToday.com''. Article Date: 10 Sep 2004 - 9:00 PDT.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The UK International Development Minister [[Gareth Thomas (English politician)|Gareth Thomas]] argued in a speech that, "A number of artists [such as Sizzla and Buju Banton] are effectively contributing to the spread of HIV by producing reggae and rap songs actually encouraging discrimination against those who have AIDS and encouraging violence against minority groups such as men who have sex with men...Yes, we believe in free speech, but nobody in a democracy should be able to incite violence against minorities."&lt;ref&gt;(22 November 2004).

[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/nov/22/health.aids "Reggae stars 'fuel spread of HIV'"], ''Guardian.co.uk''.&lt;/ref&gt; He cited John King and the [[Mighty Gabby]] as examples of musicians who are positive role models against violence and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Thomas.

=== Criticism ===
Tatchell and the Stop Murder Music campaign have been criticized by The Black Music Council, a British organisation formed in 2004 in response to the campaign by the president of Blacker Dread Records, [[Blacker Dread]], in order, "to protect the rights of the eight artistes placed on the OutRage! hit list".&lt;ref name="Roache"&gt;Alicia Roache, Staff Reporter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1539">The term '''taskscape''' is often credited to [[social anthropology|social anthropologist]] [[Tim Ingold]]. As Ingold has described the term: "just as the [[landscape]] is an array of related features, so – by analogy – the taskscape is an array of related activities." Taskscape, then is a socially constructed space of human activity, understood as having spatial boundaries and delimitations for the purposes of analysis. Of key importance, is that ''taskscape'' as well as ''landscape'', is to be considered as perpetually in process rather than in a static or otherwise immutable state. A taskscape is typically analyzed via five factors: mobility, habitat, economy, nature, and public space.

Tim Ingold coined the term in his 1993 article&lt;ref&gt;Ingold, Tim. (1993) "The Temporality of the Landscape", ''World Archaeology'', 25(2): pp. 152-174&lt;/ref&gt; defining the spatial and temporal dimensions of the landscape in human life. He considers it as a methodological structure and analyses the temporality of the landscape in [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel's]] famous painting, ''[[The Harvesters (painting)|The Harvesters]]''.

'''Theodor Wolff''' (2 August 1868 – 23 September 1943) was a [[Germany|German]] writer who was influential as a journalist, critic and newspaper editor.&lt;ref name=Kühn&gt;{{cite journal|author= Alexander Kühn|title=Mut zur Wahrheit|publisher=''Spiegel Geschichte''|volume=5(2014|pages=108–109|date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born and died in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdw-berlin.de/vertiefung/biografien/personenverzeichnis/biografie/view-bio/theodor-wolff/?no_cache=1|title=Short biography of Theodor Wolff|publisher= [[Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand]]|access-date= 27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1906 and 1933 he was the chief editor of the politically liberal newspaper ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]''.

His talent as a writer won praise from an unlikely quarter: In 1939 [[Joseph Goebbels]] recommended his [[Reichs Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]] staff to study Wolff's contributions in back numbers of the newspaper that he had edited. According to Goebbels, despite his being Jewish, the quality of Wolff's writing was matched by only very few in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Alexander Kühn|title=Mut zur Wahrheit|publisher=''Spiegel Geschichte''|volume=5(2014|pages=108|date=30 September 2014|quote=Das Lob kam von höchster Stelle, doch es war verlogen und zynisch. Sie sollten mal in den alten Bänden des ''Berliner Tageblatts'' nachlesen, empfahl Propagandaminister Joseph Goebbels 1939 seinen Parteischreibern,  bei einem 'gewissen Theodor Wolff', der 'zwar Jude' sei, 'aber schreiben konnte wie nur ganz wenige in Deutschland'.}} What Goebels did not mention was that as a younger man he had himself on at least one occasion applied to work for the newspaper in question.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Early years===
Theodor Wolff was born in [[Berlin]], second of the four recorded children of a fabric wholesaler from [[Silesia]] called Adam Wolff by his marriage to Recha, née Davidsohn. Recha was a doctor's daughter from [[Danzig]]. Wolff grew up in a [[Grand Burgher|prosperous]] Jewish family. He rapidly achieved good results at the prestigious [[:de:Königliches Wilhelms-Gymnasium (Berlin)|King William I Grammar school]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=Goldmann&gt;Christel Goldmann: ''Distanzierte Beobachtung: Theodor Wolff und das Judentum. "…&amp;nbsp;es sind zwar nicht meine Kerzen, aber ihr Licht ist warm"''. Oldenburg 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

He married in 1902, in Paris, the actress Marie Louise Charlotte Anna Hickethier (known as Änne), coming from a Protestant [[Prussia]]n family. The couple had three children: Richard Wolff (born in [[Paris]], 14 June 1906), Rudolf Wolff (born in [[Berlin]], 9 July 1907) and Lilly Wolff (born in [[Berlin]], 7 August 1909). The children were baptised as Protestants.

===Journalism mostly===
In 1887 Wolff's cousin [[Rudolf Mosse]] recruited him to his successful publishing conglomerate. Mosse was 25&amp;nbsp;years older than Wolff, to whom he provided a thorough commercial and journalistic training across all the departments of his publishing business, the "Mosse-Verlag".&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mendelssohn&gt;Peter de Mendelssohn: ''Zeitungsstadt Berlin. Menschen und Mächte in der Geschichte der deutschen Presse''. Frankfurt am Main 1982, page 180 et seq&lt;/ref&gt; During these years Wolff also found time to write some early novels, inspired by [[Theodor Fontane]] whom he greatly admired, and several plays which were staged in Berlin,&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; though in his memoirs he would later describe these as "not particularly distinguished". In 1889 he was one of the ten co-founders of the Berlin theatre company, [[:de:Freie Bühne (Verein)|''Freie Bühne'']] ("Free stage").

Wollf's written contributions to the ''Tageblatt'' focused initially on cultural matters and literature, but he soon switched his focus towards political journalism.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; An early journalistic success at the newspaper was a daily bulletin on the health of [[Frederick III, German Emperor|the emperor]] (who was dying of throat cancer). Emperor Frederick died in June 1888 and Wolff embarked on an itinerant career, writing pieces and sending them in to Berlin by telegraph from, successively, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Italy. In 1894 the paper sent him to Paris, where he would live for the next twelve years.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

As the [[Paris]] correspondent of the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'' Wolff, identified in print only as "our Paris correspondent", produced numerous contributions covering public life in France. During 1896 he became known for his coverage of the [[Dreyfus affair]], one of the most high-profile news stories of the decade in western Europe.&lt;ref name=Goldmann/&gt; His early ambitions to become a novelist were now being overtaken by his success as a journalist.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

===Editor-in-chief to the ''Berliner Tageblatt''===
====1906–1918====
In autumn 1906, Rudolf Mosse offered Theodor Wolff the top job at the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]''. Between 1906 and 1933 Wolff served the ''Tageblatt'' as editor-in-chief, developing it into one of Germany's most influential newspapers. Circulation under his stewardship rose from 100,000 to more than 300,000.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; His powerful prose was notably on display in the Monday editions of the paper for which he wrote the [[Editorial|lead article]], frequently exhorting fellow citizens to political participation. In respect of foreign policy, he quickly positioned the ''Tageblatt'' in opposition to "great power politics", imperial and military assertiveness and the risk of international isolation to which these were leading Germany. On domestic issues the paper's attitude under Wolff favoured [[civil rights]] and a liberal-democratic approach,&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Henning Zabel: "Rudolf Mosse". In: ''Neue Deutsche Biographie''. Vol. 18. Berlin 1997, pp. 213–217.&lt;/ref&gt; advocating a "parliamentarisation" ("Parlamentarisierung") of the [[Constitution of the German Empire|constitution]] and vigorously opposing the [[Prussian three-class franchise|"Dreiklassenwahlrecht"]]&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; which had been introduced in 1849 and which was, by the beginning of the twentieth century, widely perceived as a badly flawed application of the democratic ideal.

At this time Wolff promoted numerous writers including [[Victor Auburtin]] whose individualistic approach he valued and who played an important part in defining the newspaper's liberal profile.&lt;ref&gt;Hilmar Klute: "Der Kulturkonservative. Die deutsch-französische Geschichte des [[Victor Auburtin]]"  (SZ-Serie über große Journalisten, IX). In: ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 3 February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Germany's traditionalist [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]], [[Bernhard von Bülow]], refused any interviews or statements to the ''Tageblatt'' while his successor, [[Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg]], instructed all government departments to steer well clear of the newspaper's reports and opinions.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

In July 1916, the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' was temporarily banned. Wolff reacted by refusing to publish anything for several months, which was picked up and used abroad in the savage [[British propaganda during World War I|propaganda battle]] that was a major element in the increasingly desperate conduct of the [[First World War]]. Wolff refused to compromise his editorial line, and the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' continued to promote the politically toxic view that the only route to a lasting peace was for Germany to come to an understanding with France.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Bernd Sösemann|Bernd Sösemann]] (Ed.): ''Theodor Wolff.

Der Erste Weltkrieg und die Entstehung der Weimarer Republik in Tagebüchern, Leitartikeln und Briefen des Chefredakteurs am "Berliner Tageblatt" und Mitbegründers der "Deutschen Demokratischen Partei"''. München 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1918–1933====
In November 1918 Theodor Wolff was one of the founders of the [[German Democratic Party]] (''Deutsche Demokratische Partei'', DDP),&lt;ref name=HorWagDDP/&gt; committed to individual freedom and social responsibility.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; He had himself played a central role in the party's defining manifesto, but he took no leadership position within the DDP preferring, not for the last time, the role of a powerful newspaper editor. It was in this role that he called on the government to reject the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name="bernd-sösemann"&gt;[[:de:Bernd Sösemann|Bernd Sösemann]]: ''Theodor Wolff. Ein Leben mit der Zeitung''. Econ Verlag, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]], who in the early summer was briefly the German Chancellor, invited Wolff to take on the position of German Ambassador to [[Paris]] but, again, Wolff opted to remain a Berlin-based journalist.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

On 4 December 1926 Wolff resigned his [[German Democratic Party|DDP]] membership. The resignation came in response to the acceptance by a large number of the party's [[:de:Liste der Reichstagsabgeordneten der Weimarer Republik|Reichstag Members]] of tightened censorship laws against so-called dirty and trashy literature.&lt;ref name=HorWagDDP&gt;Horst Wagner: [http://luise-berlin.de/BMS/bmstext/9811gesa.htm „Die Gründung der DDP 1918“.]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} In: ''[[Berlinische Monatsschrift]]'', 11/1998 beim [[:de:Luisenstädtischer Bildungsverein|Luisenstädtischen Bildungsverein]].&lt;/ref&gt;   ([[Kurt Tucholsky]], one of the ''Tageblatt''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s most high-profile contributors, had also, on the world stage, sharply condemned DDP support for these measures.) Wolff nevertheless remained powerfully influential, a leading advocate for democracy and moderation, welcomed as a dinner guest by various government ministers.&lt;ref name="bernd-sösemann"/&gt; Wolff was also continuing to attract important writers as contributors for the ''Tageblatt''. In 1926 he persuaded the pugnaciously liberal journalist-lawyer [[Rudolf Olden]]&lt;ref&gt;"He was a German Liberal of the best sort, rather more pugnacious than the average British Liberal, because he had more to fight against." – [[Gilbert Murray]] on Rudolf Olden: Foreword to ''The History of Liberty in Germany'', 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; to move his base from [[Vienna]] to [[Berlin]].

Germany's military defeat and the catastrophic economic aftermath did much to discredit democratic politics during the 1920s, which saw a corresponding growth in support for right wing politics, which in their turn favoured somewhat 'tribal' definitions of the political sphere. Theodor Wolff and his ''Berliner Tageblatt'' (the "Jewish news-sheet", ''das Judenblatt'') were increasingly targeted by [[:de:Deutschnationale Bewegung|nationalists]] and during the 1920s nationalists were increasingly setting the country's political agenda. His name started to appear on the death lists of various radical-right and populist groups, causing Wolff to become anxious that he might share the fate of [[Walther Rathenau]], the generally popular Jewish [[Foreign Minister]] and fellow [[German Democratic Party|DDP]] member who had been shot dead by a gang of [[Ernst Werner Techow|three extremists]] in June 1922. Anxiety that he might be murdered by racist extremists remained with him for the rest of his life. His counterpart at the right wing [[Alfred Hugenberg|Hugenberg media group]], editor in chief [[:de:Friedrich Hussong|Friedrich Hussong]], stirred up popular hatred of Wolff, whom he identified as a representing the liberal metropolitan press.&lt;ref name=Mendelssohn/&gt;

The [[German federal election, 1930|Reichstag election of September 1930]] transformed the country's political landscape, with the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist party]] increasing its share of the popular vote from 2.6% to 18.3%, which under the country's multi-party system left it as the second largest party in the Reichstag. Right wing extremism was suddenly mainstream and at the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' the publisher's proprietor, [[Hans Lachmann-Mosse]], who had taken over from [[Rudolf Mosse|his father-in-law]], mandated a turn towards the right for the newspaper. The business was also in financial trouble thanks to poorly timed investment decisions and intensified competition from the by now openly anti-Semitic [[Alfred Hugenberg|Hugenberg Group]].&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

===Exile===
The night of 27 to 28 February 1933 was the night of the [[Reichstag fire]]. It was also the night on which Theodor Wolff, whose hostility to a Nazi future was undiminished and who had been warned by colleagues that his name was on the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] death list, fled Berlin.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; His initial destination, traveling via [[Munich]], was the [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]].  From there he moved on to Switzerland. However, the Swiss refused to issue him with a residence permit and by the end of 1933 Theodor Wolff and his wife had ended up in [[Nice]], which since 1860 had been part of France.

Theodor Wolff's last [[Editorial|lead article]] in the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' appeared on 5 March 1933, the day of the last multi-party [[German federal election, March 1933|German election]] until 1949. In March 1933 the ''Tageblatt''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s proprietor (who himself, being Jewish, was effectively deprived of control over his business later in the month), removed Wolff from his editorship responding to political pressure&lt;ref name=Goldmann/&gt; following the flight from Berlin.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; In May 1933 Wolff's books were among those listed by the government for the public [[Nazi book burnings|book burnings]].  Wolff celebrated his 65th&amp;nbsp;birthday in 1933 and played very little part in the political struggles of the many German Jewish exiles who were gravitating to Nice at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff fought vainly against the rise of National Socialism, but as an exile he turned away from political issues: After his former newspaper, the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'', reported on the so-called [[Night of the Long Knives|"Röhm-Putsch"]] of 30&amp;nbsp;June 1934 under the headline "Crackdown!" ("Durchgegriffen!") he cancelled his subscription.&lt;/ref&gt; His opinions nevertheless remained clear enough, and on 26 October 1937 he was deprived of his German citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the legal consequences of this expatriation, cf. the introduction (p. xii-xiii) to Michael Hepp (Ed.): ''Die Ausbürgerung deutscher Staatsangehöriger 1933–45 nach den im Reichsanzeiger veröffentlichten Listen''. Vol. 1. Munich 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In exile Wolff reverted to writing books, while still contributing occasional pieces of journalism to (non-German) newspapers.&lt;ref name=Goldmann/&gt; Two historical-political works met with little success.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; He dedicated his last novel, ''Die Schwimmerin'' ("The [female] Swimmer") to his secretary from the Berlin days, [[Ilse Stöbe]] (1911–1942). His project to have a film produced on the basis of this novel, with [[Greta Garbo]] in the starring role, could not be realised.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Ulrich Sahm (Botschafter)|Ulrich Sahm]]: ''Ilse Stöbe''. In: Hans Coppi, Jürgen Danyel, Johannes Tuchel (Ed.): ''Die Rote Kapelle im Widerstand gegen den Nationalsozialismus.'' Schriften der [[Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand]], Berlin 1994, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolff continued to distance himself from [[Zionism|Zionist separatism]], believing throughout his life in a "German-Jewish symbiosis" ("deutsch-jüdische Symbiose").&lt;ref name="bernd-sösemann"/&gt;

===Arrest and death===
After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] on 22 June 1940 Theodor Wolff applied, unsuccessfully, for permission to emigrate to United States:  he remained in Nice. The coastal strip along the south-eastern part of France including, from late 1942, [[Nice]] was in the process of being [[Italian occupation of France during World War II|annexed by Italy]], and on 23 May 1943 Theodor Wolff was arrested by the Italian civil authorities. He was handed over to the [[Gestapo]] and interned in a [[Marseilles]] jail before being transferred to the [[Drancy internment camp|Drancy detention centre]] near Paris. Drancy was used as a collection point for Jewish internees scheduled for deportation to internment camps and death camps in Germany, and Wolff now found himself transferred to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] to the east of Berlin. Now aged 75, and ill with [[Phlegmon]], his fellow internees pleaded successfully for him to be sent to the [[:de:Jüdisches Krankenhaus Berlin|Jewish Hospital]] in Berlin. Here he was admitted on 20 September 1943: he died three days later.&lt;ref name=Goldmann/&gt;

Theodor Wolff's body is buried in the "row of honour" at Berlin's [[Weißensee Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="bernd-sösemann"/&gt;

==Posthumous honour==
In 1961 the [[Theodor Wolff Prize]] for newspaper journalism was founded, and it has since 1962 been awarded annually. Since 1973 the prize has been awarded by the [[:de:Bundesverband Deutscher Zeitungsverleger|German Newspaper Publishers' Association (BDZV / ''Bundesverband Deutscher Zeitungsverleger'')]].

'''Trabecular cartilages''' ('''trabeculae cranii''', sometimes simply '''trabeculae''', '''prechordal cartilages''') are paired, rod-shaped cartilages, which develop in the [[head]] of the [[vertebrate]] [[embryo]]. They are the primordia of the anterior part of the [[Base of skull|cranial base]], and are derived from the [[cranial neural crest|cranial neural crest cells]].

==Structure==
[[File:Shark Lacerta deBeer1937.jpg|thumb|330px|Morphogenesis of neurocranium (shark and lizard).]]
The trabecular cartilages generally appear as a paired, rod-shaped cartilages at the ventral side of the [[forebrain]] and lateral side of the [[adenohypophysis]] in the vertebrate embryo. During development, their anterior ends fuse and form the ''trabecula communis''. Their posterior ends fuse with the caudal-most [[parachordal cartilages]].

===Development===
Most [[skeletons]] are of [[mesodermal]] origin in vertebrates. Especially axial skeletal elements, such as the vertebrae, are derived from the paraxial mesoderm (e.g., [[somites]]), which is regulated by molecular signals from the [[notochord]]. Trabecular cartilages, however, originate from the neural crest, and since they are located anterior to the rostral tip of the notochord,&lt;ref&gt;their derivatives are called the ''prechordal cranium'' (Couly et al., 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; they cannot receive signals from the notochord. Due to these specialisations, and their essential role in cranial development, many comparative morphologists and embryologists have argued their developmental or evolutionary origins. The general theory is that the trabecular cartilage is derived from the neural crest mesenchyme which fills anterior to the mandibular arch (premandibular domain).

==Other animals==
===Lamprey===
As clearly seen in the [[lamprey]], [[Cyclostome]] also has a pair of cartilaginous rods in the embryonic head which is similar to the trabecular cartilages in jawed vertebrates.
However, in 1916, [[Alexej Nikolajevich Sewertzoff]] pointed out that the cranial base of the lamprey is exclusively originated from the paraxial mesoderm. Then in 1948, [[:de:Alf Johnels|Alf Johnels]] reported the detail of the skeletogenesis of the lamprey, and showed that the “trabecular cartilages” in lamprey appear just beside the notochord, in a similar position to the parachordal cartilages in jawed vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Johnels AG (1948) On the development and morphology of the skeleton of the head of Petromyzon. Acta Zool 29: 139-279&lt;/ref&gt; Recent experimental studies also showed that the cartilages are derived from the head mesoderm.&lt;ref&gt;Kuratani S ''et al''., (2004) Developmental fate of the mandibular mesoderm in the lamprey, Lethenteron japonicum: comparative morphology and development of the gnathostome jaw with special reference to the nature of trabecula cranii. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.). 302B, 458-468&lt;/ref&gt; The “trabecular cartilages” in the Cyclostome is no longer considered to be the homologue of the trabecular in the jawed vertebrates: the (true) trabecular cartilages were firstly acquired in the Gnathostome lineage.

==History==
{{refimprove-section|date=August 2017}}
The trabecular cartilages were first described in the [[grass snake]] by [[:de:Martin Heinrich Rathke|Martin Heinrich Rathke]] at 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Entwicklungsgeschichte der Natter. Konigsberg (1839)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] suggested that the trabecular cartilages are a modified part of the [[splanchnocranium]]: they arose as the serial homologues of the [[pharyngeal arches]].{{fact|date=August 2017}}

The vertebrate [[jaw]] is generally thought to be the modification of the [[mandibular arch]] (1st pharyngeal arch). Since the trabecular cartilages appear anterior to the mandibular arch, if the trabecular cartilages are serial homologues of the pharyngeal arches, ancestral vertebrates should possess more than one pharyngeal arch (so-called "premandibular arches") anterior to the mandibular arch. The existence of premandibular arch(es) has been accepted by many comparative embryologists and morphologists (e.g., [[Edwin Stephen Goodrich]], [[Gavin de Beer]]). Moreover, [[:de: Erik Stensio|Erik Stensio]] reported premandibular arches and the corresponding branchiomeric nerves by the reconstruction of the [[Osteostraci|Osteostracans]] (e.g., ''[[Cephalaspis]]''; recently this arch was reinterpreted as the mandibular arch)

However, the existence of the premandibular arch(es) has been rejected, and the trabecular cartilages are no longer assumed to be one of the pharyngeal arches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12465">'''Transition scenarios''' are descriptions of future states which combine a future image with an account of the changes that would need to occur to reach that future. These two elements are often created in a two-step process where the future image is created first (envisioning) followed by an exploration of the alternative pathways available to reach the future goal ([[backcasting]]). Both these processes can use participatory techniques ([[Paul Raskin|Raskin]] et al., 2002&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, P., T. Banuri, G. Gallopín, P. Gutman, A. Hammond, R. Kates, and R. Swart. (2002). The Great Transition: The Promise and the Lure of the Times Ahead. Boston, MA: [[Tellus Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;) where participants of varying backgrounds and interests are provided with an open and supportive group environment to discuss different contributing elements and actions.

Transition scenarios are unique in type not only in terms of how they are created (process) but also their content. Their requirements are guided by transition management concepts and consider the "fundamental and irreversible change in the culture, structure and practices of a system" (Sondeijker, 2009:52,&lt;ref&gt;Sondeijker, S. (2009), Imagining Sustainability: methodological building blocks for Transition Scenarios, DRIFT, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;). Transition scenarios are emerging as a scenario type which is more applicable to the context of sustainable development based on their abilities to capture the complexities of system structure and innovation (Loorbach, 2007; Rotmans, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Loorbach, D.A. (2007), Transition Management: new mode of governance for sustainable development, DRIFT, Rotterdam&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotmans, J. (2005) Societal Innovation: Between Dream and Reality Lies Complexity, Inaugural Speech, Rotterdam, Erasmus Research Institute of Management&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Scenario types==

There are various types of scenarios that can be used for a range of purposes and are predominantly split between first, second and third generation scenarios.

===First generation===
First generation scenarios are intended to predict the future as accurately as possible, for instance by extrapolating trends. Examples of these scenarios are weather predictions, forecasts for a wide range of topics such as economic growth, population, building volume etc. They are predominantly based on the quantitative / econometric extrapolation of trends. Another part is based on qualitative "trend watching methods" (e.g. fashion).

===Second generation===
Second generation scenarios have a more explorative character. Scenarios can be intended to explore possibilities for the future, without pronouncing upon their probability or desirability. Scenarios can then be defined as "a tool for ordering alternative future environments in which one's decision may be played out" (Peter Schwartz, 1991,&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, P. (1991). The art of the long view. Doubleday. New York, USA&lt;/ref&gt;). These scenarios are based on the presumption that nobody can predict, and therefore should not try to predict the future. "The only relevant discussions about the future are those where we succeed from shifting from the question "whether something will happen" to the question "what will we do IF something happens" (Arie de Geus, 1998,&lt;ref&gt;De Geus, A. (1997). The living company. Longview Publishing Limited, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;). An example of this type of scenario was developed by Shell (The Shell scenario method).

===Third generation===
Third generation scenarios focus on long time spans and preferred societal systems which are normative and explorative in nature and reflective of the structural and societal changes required in pursuing sustainability (Sondeijker, 2009; Edquist 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Sondeijker, S. (2009), Imagining Sustainability: methodological building blocks for Transition Scenarios, DRIFT, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edquist, C. (2005). Systems of innovation: Perspectives and challenges. In J. Fagerberg, D. C. Mowery &amp; R. R. Nelson (Eds.), The Oxford handbook of innovation (pp. 181-208). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;). These scenarios are intended to produce a picture of the future we want. The question then is: "what do we actually want the future to look like?", examples of these scenarios are based, amongst others, on the European Awareness method and include the use of energy in urban environments, sustainable production and consumption, and normative "factor 4" studies. These scenarios were devised based on the claim that scenarios active in first and second generation scenario methods cannot live up to the challenge of imagining, contributing and preparing for the dynamic processes of transformative change. Transitions are complex interactions which need system approaches to define paths towards a sustainable future and transition scenarios are set to address these concerns by providing a method to handle these issues.

==Content and process==

The creation of transition scenarios has two basic objectives. To ensure that the scenario created is relevant to the concepts of transition management to allow the system to be systematically analysed and to contribute to social learning. These objectives are encapsulated in the content and process, respectively, of transition scenario creation.

==Content==
Transition scenarios are informed by transition management concepts and theories which it uses as a basis for its contents. In particular, transition scenarios consider long time frames and are both normative and explorative in nature. Their contents are predominantly centred on the following elements (Sondeijker 2009; Geels, F. W, 2002, Kemp et al. 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Sondeijker, S. (2009), Imagining Sustainability: methodological building blocks for Transition Scenarios, DRIFT, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F. W. (2002), Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: A multi-level perspective and a case-study, Research Policy 31(8/9), 1257-1274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, R., Schot, J., Hoogma, R. (1998), Regime shifts to sustainability through processes of niche formation: the approach of strategic niche management, In: Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 10(2): 175-195.&lt;/ref&gt;):

===Multi-level criteria===
Multi-level criteria relate to elements of change (weak signals) that can be identified in present structures occurring at different levels of the system. These provide the opportunity to recognise and investigate levers than can be used for long run transitions. Weak signals combined with uncertain developments can produce the appropriate climate for structural change. Anticipation of weak signals is essential if the development of scenarios beyond the scope of current developments is to be reached.

===Multi-pattern criteria===
Multi-pattern criteria describe the interaction between actors and structure of the system being analysed. This includes action derived from bottom-up initiatives which are built up from actor groups which are involved in niche-based innovation activities which infiltrate and eventually change the dominant regimes. Equally important are actors across and between levels which can support and further accelerate change. This ensures that practices and habits in the system are transformed through the replacement of the old dominant regime with the new desired future state.

===Multi-phase criteria===
Multi-phase criteria refer to the different timings of the alternating stages involved in transition management: predevelopment phase, take-off phase, acceleration phase and the stabilisation phase. The nature and speeds of these phases inform the character of the transition highlighting the importance of the barriers and drivers identified. In the take-off phase the point of no return is reached followed by the acceleration phase where cultural, structural and practice changes occur most visibly.

==Process==
Transition scenarios are also process orientated focusing on the ability of different stakeholders and participants to communicate and imagine their desired future within the discussion groups. Through this participatory process participants are encouraged to change mind set and attitude to think from a long-term perspective. Specific focus on various feasible topics will increase participants' knowledge of the topic area and the alternatives available in its context. These lessons may eventually be internalised within participants resulting in a social learning process (Social Learning Group, 2001,&lt;ref&gt;Social Learning Group (2001). Learning to manage global environmental risks. Edited by S.L.Group, Vol 1&amp;2, Cambridge Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Sustainable low-carbon futures==
{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2012}}
Europe, along with the rest of the world, is facing the challenge of climate change and its impacts on the environment, economy and society. In order to address these concerns and to adopt a proactive approach in finding solutions, the European Commission launched its Europe 2020 Strategy in 2010 followed by its Roadmap for 2050. The 2020 strategy puts forward a vision of a Europe which has increased employment, invests in research and development, ensures more young people finish school and obtain university degrees, has fewer people threatened by poverty, has a reduced greenhouse gas level of 20% compared with 1990 level, has an increased contribution of renewable energy to reach 20% of total energy consumption and has increased efficiency by 20%. The 2050 Roadmap sets forward possibilities to reaching the more stringent 80% reduction target of greenhouse gases in 2050 by considering various scenarios and setting milestones for a 40% reduction by 2030 and 60% by 2040.

It is clear from this strategy and roadmap that Europe needs to transition to a future which is quite different from the one which follows a "business as usual" trajectory. This need formed the basis from which the [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development#Framework Programme 7|EU Seventh Framework Programme]] (FP7) under its call "Foresight to enhance behavioural and societal changes enabling the transition towards sustainable paths in Europe" was created. Three projects focusing on transition scenarios and management were selected to provide range in application and context. These projects are as follows:

* CRISP (CReating Innovative Sustainability Pathways) aims to identify sustainable low carbon futures and pathways. This intent will allow the project to recommend new policy mixes and innovative cooperation mechanisms that will support and promote transitions. In order to achieve these objectives, it employs transition scenarios and participatory approaches to ensure people of all ages and backgrounds are actively involved in the discourse on sustainable development.
* INCONTEXT (Individuals in Context: Supportive Environments for Sustainable Living) studies both the internal and external contexts in which change occurs. Through the use of multi-disciplinary approaches insights into the role played by social norms, policies and infrastructure (external context) and needs, values and priorities (internal context) can be gauged within the agency-structure debate. The project’s main output is to help inform policies that can support internal changes required for sustainable action.
* LOCAW (Low Carbon at Work: Modelling agents and organisations to achieve transition to a low carbon Europe) aims to gain insight into the drivers and barriers of sustainability practices within the work place across different organizations within the EU. The multi-disciplinary approach is used to create the desirable low-carbon futures, map the alternative pathways and gain insight into how cooperative interaction needs to be supported to encourage sustainable development. This latter point is predominantly investigated through the use of agent based modelling.

The '''type–token distinction''' is used in disciplines such as [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[metalogic]], [[typography]], and [[computer programming]] to clarify what words mean.

==Overview==
The sentence "''they drive the same car''" is ambiguous. Do they drive the same ''type'' of car (the same model) or the same instance of a car type (a single vehicle)? Clarity requires us to distinguish words that represent abstract types from words that represent objects that embody or exemplify types. The type–token distinction separates types (abstract descriptive concepts) from tokens (objects that instantiate concepts).

For example: "bicycle" represents a type: the concept of a bicycle; whereas "my bicycle" represents a token of that type: an object that instantiates that type. In the sentence "the bicycle is becoming more popular" the word "bicycle" represents a type that is a concept; whereas in the sentence "the bicycle is in the garage" the word "bicycle" represents a token: a particular object.

(The distinction in [[computer programming]] between [[class (software)|classes]] and [[object (computer science)|objects]] is related, though in this context, "class" sometimes refers to a set of objects (with class-level attribute or operations) rather than a description of an object in the set, as "type" would.)

The words type, concept, property, quality, feature and attribute (all used in describing things) tend to be used with different verbs. E.g. Suppose a rose bush is defined as a plant that is "thorny", "flowering" and "bushy". You might say a rose bush ''instantiates'' these three types, or ''embodies'' these three concepts, or ''exhibits'' these three properties, or ''possesses'' these three qualities, features or attributes.

Property types (e.g "height in metres" or "thorny") are often understood [[ontology|ontologically]] as concepts. Property instances (e.g. height = 1.74) are sometimes understood as measured values, and sometimes understood as sensations or observations of reality.

Some say types exist in descriptions of objects, but not as tangible [[physical object]]s. They say one can show someone a particular bicycle, but cannot show someone the type "bicycle", as in "''the bicycle'' is popular.". However types do exist in the sense that they appear in mental and documented models.

Some say tokens are objects that are tangible, exist in space and time as physical matter and/or energy. However, tokens can be intangible objects of types such as "thought", "tennis match", "government" and "act of kindness".

== Occurrences ==
There is a related distinction very closely connected with the type-token distinction. This distinction is the distinction between an object, or type of object, and an '''''occurrence''''' of it. In this sense, an occurrence is not necessarily a token. Considering the sentence: "[[A rose is a rose is a rose]]". We may equally correctly state that there are eight or three words in the sentence. There are, in fact, three word types in the sentence: "rose", "is" and "a". There are eight word tokens in a token copy of the line. The line itself is a type. There are not eight word types in the line. It contains (as stated) only the three word types, 'a', 'is' and 'rose', each of which is unique. So what do we call what there are eight of? They are occurrences of words. There are three occurrences of the word type 'a', two of 'is' and three of 'rose'.

The need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types arises, not just in linguistics, but whenever types of things have other types of things occurring in them.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/types-tokens Types and Tokens]''&lt;/ref&gt; Reflection on the simple case of occurrences of [[numeral system|numerals]] is often helpful.{{citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=Claim made with no support or citation, term used without definition.}}

== Typography ==
In [[typography]], the type–token distinction is used to determine the presence of a text printed by [[movable type]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]]: ''Die Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift von 1119. Eine paläographisch-typographische Untersuchung'', Scriptorium Verlag für Kultur und Wissenschaft, Regensburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-937527-06-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The defining criteria which a typographic print has to fulfill is that of the type identity of the various [[letter form]]s which make up the printed text. In other words: each letter form which appears in the text has to be shown as a particular instance ("token") of one and the same type which contains a reverse image of the printed [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]].}}

== Charles Sanders Peirce ==
:''There are only 26 letters in the [[English alphabet]] and yet there are more than 26 letters in this [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letters have been created.''

The word 'letters' was used three times in the above paragraph, each time in a different meaning. The word 'letters' is one of many words having "type–token ambiguity". This section disambiguates 'letters' by separating the three senses using terminology standard in logic today. The key distinctions were first made by the American logician-philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in 1906 using terminology that he established.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sanders Peirce, Prolegomena to an apology for pragmaticism, Monist, vol.16 (1906), pp. 492–546.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters that are created by writing are physical objects that can be destroyed by various means: these are letter TOKENS or letter INSCRIPTIONS. The 26 letters of the alphabet are letter TYPES or letter FORMS.

'''Peirce's type–token distinction''', also applies to words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on: to anything in a universe of discourse of character-string theory, or [[concatenation theory]]. There is only one word type spelled el-ee-tee-tee-ee-ar,&lt;ref&gt;Using a variant of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s structural-descriptive naming found in [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]], [https://philarchive.org/archive/CORSTC Schemata: the Concept of Schema in the History of Logic], Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, vol. 12 (2006), pp. 219–40.&lt;/ref&gt; namely, 'letter'; but every time that word type is written, a new word token has been created.

Some logicians consider a word type to be the class of its tokens. Other logicians counter that the word type has a permanence and constancy not found in the class of its tokens. The type remains the same while the class of its tokens is continually gaining new members and losing old members.

The word type 'letter' uses only four letter types: el, ee, tee, and ar. Nevertheless, it uses ee twice and tee twice. In standard terminology, the word type 'letter' has six letter OCCURRENCES and the letter type ee OCCURS twice in the word type 'letter'. Whenever a word type is inscribed, the number of letter tokens created equals the number of letter occurrences in the word type.

Peirce's original words are the following.
"A common mode of estimating the amount of matter in a ... printed book is to count the number of words. There will ordinarily be about twenty 'thes' on a page, and, of course, they count as twenty words. In another sense of the word 'word,' however, there is but one word 'the' in the English language; and it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page, or be heard in any voice .... Such a ... Form, I propose to term a Type. A Single ... Object ... such as this or that word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book, I will venture to call a Token. .... In order that a Type may be used, it has to be embodied in a Token which shall be a sign of the Type, and thereby of the object the Type signifies." – Peirce 1906, Ogden-Richards, 1923, 280-1.

These distinctions are subtle but solid and easy to master. This section ends using the new terminology to disambiguate the first paragraph.

:''There are 26 letter types in the English alphabet and yet there are more than 26 letter occurrences in this sentence type. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letter tokens have been created.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7159">The '''Underhanded C Contest''' is a [[Computer programming|programming]] contest to turn out code that is malicious, but passes a rigorous inspection, and looks like an honest mistake even if discovered. The contest rules define a task, and a malicious component. Entries must perform the task in a malicious manner as defined by the contest, and hide the malice. Contestants are allowed to use [[C (programming language)|C]]-like compiled languages to make their programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.i-programmer.info/news/204/5727.html | title=Underhanded C Contest Revived | publisher=I Programmer | date=2013-04-06 | accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contest was organized by Dr. Scott Craver&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.binghamton.edu/watson/programs/academic-departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering/people/faculty-and-staff.html Faculty and Staff page of EE Dept. at Binghamton University] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529234243/http://www2.binghamton.edu/watson/programs/academic-departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering/people/faculty-and-staff.html |date=May 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Department of Electrical Engineering at [[Binghamton University]] ([[New York State]]). The contest was initially inspired by Daniel Horn’s Obfuscated V contest in the fall of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.underhanded-c.org/_page_id_7.html | title=Underhanded C Contest FAQ | publisher=Underhanded C contest | accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For the 2005 to 2008 contests, the prize was a $100 gift certificate to [[ThinkGeek]]. The 2009 contest had its prize increased to $200 due to the very late announcement of winners, and the prize for the 2013 contest is also a $200 gift certificate.

The domain for the website has expired as of 2018-10-17.

==2005 Contest==
The 2005 contest had the task of basic image processing, such as resampling or smoothing, but covertly inserting unique and useful "fingerprinting" data into the image. Winning entries from 2005 used uninitialized data structures, reuse of pointers, and an embedding of [[machine code]] in constants.

==2006 Contest==
The 2006 contest required entries to count word occurrences, but have vastly different runtimes on different platforms. To accomplish the task, entries used fork implementation errors, optimization problems, [[endianness|endian]] differences and various API implementation differences. The winner called strlen() in a loop, leading to quadratic complexity which was optimised out by a Linux compiler but not by Windows.

==2007 Contest==
The 2007 contest required entries to encrypt and decrypt files with a strong, readily available encryption algorithm such that a low percentage (1% - 0.01%) of the encrypted files may be cracked in a reasonably short time. The contest commenced on April 16 and ended on July 4.  Entries used misimplementations of RC4, misused API calls, and incorrect function prototypes.

==2008 Contest==
The 2008 contest required entries to redact a rectangular portion of a [[Netpbm format|PPM]] image in a way that the portion may be reconstructed. Any method of "blocking out" the rectangle was allowed, as long as the original pixels were removed, and the pixel reconstruction didn't have to be perfect&lt;ref&gt;[http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=8 2008 contest rules] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322223931/http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=8 |date=March 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (although the reconstruction's fidelity to the original file would be a factor in judging).  The contest began on June 12, and ended on September 30.  Entries tended to either xor the region with a retrievable pseudo-random mask or append the masked data to the end of the file format.  The two placing programs both used improperly defined macros while the winner, choosing to work with an uncommon text based format, zeroed out pixel values while keeping the number of digits intact.

==2009 Contest==
The 2009 contest required participants to write a program that sifts through routing directives but redirects a piece of luggage based on some innocuous-looking comment in the space-delimited input data file. The contest began December 29, 2009, and was due to end on March 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718125443/http://xcott.com/ The Underhanded C Contest »&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], [http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=18 xcott.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085335/http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=18 |date=October 6, 2014 }} (archived from [http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=18 the original]  on 2011-07-18)&lt;/ref&gt; However, no activity occurred for three years. The winners were only announced on April 1, 2013, with one overall winner and six runners-up.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100108082655/http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=19 The Underhanded C Contest » Also, we’re looking for good PhD students&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130409231352/http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~scraver/underhanded/ The Underhanded C Contest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 Contest==
The 2013 contest was announced on April 1, 2013, and was due July 4, 2013; results were announced on September 29, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underhanded-c.org/_p_23.html|title=2013 Winners|author=Scott Craver|date=2014-09-29|accessdate=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was about a fictional social website called "ObsessBook". The challenge was to write a function to compute the DERPCON (Degrees of Edge-Reachable Personal CONnection) between two users that "accidentally" computes a too low distance for a special user.

==2014 Contest==
The 2014 contest was announced on November 2, 2014, and was due January 1, 2015.  The results were announced on June 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underhanded-c.org/_p_26.html|title=The 7th Underhanded C Contest is now Open|author=Scott Craver|date=2014-11-02|accessdate=2014-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object was to write surveillance code for a Twitter-like social networking service, to comply with a secret government surveillance request; but for non-obvious reasons, the code must subtly leak the act of surveillance to a user.

==2015 Contest==
The 2015 contest was announced on August 15, 2015, and was due November 15, 2015.  The results were announced on January 15, 2016. The scenario was a nuclear disarmament process between the Peoples Glorious Democratic Republic of Alice and the Glorious Democratic Peoples Republic of Bob, and the mission was to write a test function for comparing potentially fissile material against a reference sample, which under certain circumstances would label a warhead as containing fissile material when it doesn't.

'''''United States v. Enmons''''', {{Ussc|410|396|1973|el=no}}, was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that the federal Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, known as the [[Hobbs Act]],  does not cover [[union violence]] in furtherance of the union's objectives.

The case involved a labor strike in which members of the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers]] (IBEW) fired rifles at three utility company transformers, drained the oil from another, and blew up a company substation. The labor union in question was seeking a higher-pay contract and other benefits from their employer, the [[Gulf States Utilities|Gulf States Utilities Company]] which is now part of [[Entergy]]. The federal government tried the defendants under the Hobbs Act.  

The Court ruled that "The Hobbs Act, which makes it a federal crime to obstruct interstate commerce by robbery or extortion, does not reach the use of violence (which is readily punishable under state law) to achieve legitimate union objectives, such as higher wages in return for genuine services that the employer seeks."&lt;ref name="United States v. Enmons"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNITED STATES, Appellant, v. Travis Paul ENMONS et al.|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/396|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=May 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the case==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2018}}
The indictment against the alleged conspirators charged them with being in violation of the [[Hobbs Act]], which states that anyone attempting to affect or obstruct commerce through violence or the threat of violence against any person or property "''shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both''." The indictment argued that the union members obstructed commerce with their actions against the Utilities Company, and attempted to "''obtain the property of [their employer] in the form of wages and other things of value''" by using the wrongful use of force and the fear of economic loss.

The court acknowledged that using threats and force to obtain property is wrongful. However, the court reasoned that it is considered "wrongful" only when the perpetrator has no "legitimate claim" to it. Since federal law empowers unions with the right to [[Strike action|strike]], the use of violence to secure higher pay and benefits was not [[extortion]]. The case was dismissed. Such violent acts can, however, be punishable under normal state or federal laws. 

In understanding Enmons, it is important to keep in mind that what the Hobbs Act outlaws is extortion, not just any bad act. Federal law, in particular the [[National Labor Relations Act]], says that collective bargaining and strikes in support of collective bargaining goals are legal and protected. Therefore, since collective bargaining has a purpose that is not extortion, one of the key elements of a Hobbs Act violation is not met.

==Controversy==
While labor unions as a whole are exempt from prosecution, individual members can still be held accountable and prosecuted according to local laws. However, evidence suggests that this rarely is the case. According to a 1998 policy analysis by the [[Cato Institute]],&lt;ref name="Kendrick"&gt;[https://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=1175 Freedom from Union Violence, Cato Institute Policy Analysis no. 316, September 9, 1998 by David Kendrick]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The result has been an epidemic of union-related violence. The National Institute for Labor Relations Research (NILRR) has recorded 8,799 incidents of violence from news reports since [the Enmons ruling]. Those reports show only 258 convictions, suggesting a conviction rate of less than 3 percent. Moreover, local law enforcement authorities often get many more reports of strike violence than journalists can possibly cover.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some critics argue that the Enmons decision has been a major factor in increasing corruption among union and government officials alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrtw.org/en/d/big_labor_special_privileges.htm] - National Right to Work Committee: "Top Ten Special Privelages of Organized Labor"&lt;/ref&gt; Economist and former professor Morgan Reynolds wrote:&lt;ref name="Kendrick"/&gt;{{rp|30}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is difficult to tell racketeer-controlled unions from other unions, because both types depend on violence and the threat of violence…The plain truth is that our labor laws have arranged incentives so that honest, noncoercive union officials find it difficult to survive in competition with the muscleman types.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, others argue the FUVA has greatly exaggerated the existence of union violence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In a law review article, Julius G. Getman and F. Ray Marshall, The Continuing Assault on the Right to Strike, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 703, 712-13 (2001), law professor Julius Getman and former Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall, analyzed the evidence of union violence.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The claim that strike violence is "escalating" has no empirical basis. Even the study conducted by the National Institute for Labor Relations Research - cited regularly as authority for this proposition by FUVA's proponents - draws no such conclusion. And the study itself is a scholarly monstrosity that seeks to study union violence by compiling media reports, mainly newspaper articles concerning strike violence. The Institute admits that it did not actually investigate any of the incidents reported and does not know if the reports are accurate. It concludes: "Because it relies on news accounts the Institute cannot guarantee the accuracy of the file itself." In fact, articles about employer-instigated violence are included in the study's effort to determine union violence. n59 It seems obvious that the methodology employed confuses those strikes most written about with those most violent. Further, the Institute includes incidents of "psychological violence; i.e., intimidation, coercion and verbal threats" - terms which it does not bother to define. It seems clear, however, that this definition would include nonviolent civil disobedience of the type used by the civil rights movement and increasingly by the labor movement. But whatever the definition, it is almost certain that strike-related violence has decreased since the Enmons decision because the number of strikes has declined significantly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 1973, a number of bills have been proposed to overturn US v. Enmons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The [[Freedom from Union Violence Act]] (FUVA) was first introduced as H.R. 1796 on June 8, 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h104-1796 H.R. 1796: Freedom from Union Violence Act], govtrack.us; accessed July 31, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been reintroduced in every Congress since.&lt;ref name=OtherLegislation&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s105-230&amp;tab=related Other Legislation with the Same Title]&lt;/ref&gt; None of these bills have made it out of committee.&lt;ref name=OtherLegislation/&gt;

== History ==	
The history of laws and cultural [[Taboo|taboos]] have a current effect on how new sexual assault [[Law|laws]] are drafted, how the laws are applied by [[law enforcement]] and how [[police]] decide whether to [[arrest]] a suspected perpetrator. The history of sexual assault [[Prosecutor|prosecutions]] influences whether or not current cases are taken to [[court]]. Judges and [[Jury|juries]] make decisions to [[Conviction|convict]] based upon their past knowledge on the topic of sexual assault.&lt;ref name = Tracy&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tracy|first=Carol Lee|last2=Fromson|first2=Terry L.|last3=Long|first3=Jennifer Gentile|last4=AEquitas|first4=Charlene Whitman|date=June 5, 2012|title=Rape and Sexual Assault in the Legal System, Presented to the National Research Council of the National Academies Panel on Measuring Rape and Sexual Assault in the Bureau of Justice Statistics Household Surveys Committee on National Statistics|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=National Academies Workshop on Measuring Rape and Sexual Assault in Bureau of Justice Statistics Surveys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
The imagery of women being sexually victimized in advertisements, pornography, films and music videos has been shown to increase support for violence toward women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In a study published in 2008, it was found that in nearly 2,000 print advertisements of 58 magazines popular in the United States, 50% of ads depicted women as [[Sexual objectification|sex objects]], appearing as a victim in about 10% of advertisements. The main magazines featuring sexual objectification of women were of the fashion and adolescent topics. These advertisements often portrayed women in various positions and expressions that were derived from pornography. The study also stated that women in the United States feel that rape is "trivialized in American culture" and concluded that "media imagery that presents women as both sex object and as victims" has possibly contributed to this trivialization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2016 study regarding the objectification of women in the media found that men's magazines, [[reality television]] and pornography brought upon more thoughts of objectification, which in turn led to more support of violence toward women. In the study's results, it is stated "the relationship between objectifying media exposure and attitudes supportive of violence against women was fully mediated by notions of women as sex objects".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Effects of Violence Against Women ==
Violence against women can lead to immediate physical injuries and longer-term mental and physical health conditions. In addition to negatively impacting mental and physical health, violence against women can interfere with life at work, home, and school. In some cases, violence results in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/effects-violence-against-women|title=Health effects of violence|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children exposed to violence are also at risk for developing mental and physical health problems. Depending on their age, children may react differently to exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/domestic-violence/effects-domestic-violence-children|title=Domestic violence and children|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of violence==

=== Domestic violence ===
{{Main|Domestic violence in the United States}}
According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[National Institute of Justice]], about 1 in every 4 women suffer from at least one physical assault experience from a partner during adulthood.&lt;ref name="VAWA2005"&gt;[http://nnedv.org/docs/Policy/VAWA2005FactSheet.pdf ''The Violence Against Women Act of 2005, Summary of Provisions.''] National Network to End Domestic Violence. Retrieved 2011-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 report found that in about 64% of female homicides were perpetrated by a partner or family member.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.amnestyusa.org/us/violence-against-women-is-a-u-s-problem-too/|title=Violence Against Women Is A U.S. Problem, Too|last=|first=|date=2011-06-11|work=[[Amnesty International]]|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intimate partner abuse may also include other types behavior considered abusive. These are instances in which one partner seeks to control finances, force isolation from friends and family and dominate the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://statusofwomendata.org/explore-the-data/violence-safety/violence-and-safety-full-section/|title=Violence and Safety Full Section - Women in the States|work=Women in the States|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who have been identified as being at a higher risk for domestic and sexual abuse are older women, those living in rural communities, disabled women and immigrants. Addressing and preventing such violence may be difficult because some women do not have nearby access to victim services. A women may also have language barriers, economic and psychological dependence on the perpetrator.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In some instances of violence, a woman and her children may not be able to procure housing apart from the perpetrator. Between 22-57%  and of these women become [[Homelessness|homeless]]. Due to housing regulations that practice a 'no tolerance' policy requiring eviction of all household members when even one person is convicted of any crime, battered women can then be homeless as a result. This practice essentially creates a disincentive for reporting violence in the home. Some women who have experienced violence in the home risk the loss of their jobs related to their need for medical treatment, counselling, finding new housing and legal protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Rape ===
{{Main|Rape in the United States}}
The percentage of women who have been raped in the United States is between 15% and 20%, with various studies disagreeing with each other. (''National Violence Against Women'' survey in 1995, 17.6% rate;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/172837.pdf Prevalence, Incidence, and Consequences of Violence Against Women: Findings From the National Violence Against Women Survey].

About 500 women were raped per day in the United States in 2008.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; About 21.8% of rapes of female victims in the United States are [[Gang rape|gang rapes]].&lt;ref name="Horvath, Miranda 2013, page 15"&gt;Horvath, Miranda et al. ''Handbook on the Study of Multiple Perpetrator Rape''. Routledge 2013, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A March 2013 report from the [[United States Department of Justice]]’s [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], from 1995 to 2010, the estimated annual rate of female rape or [[sexual assault]] had declined by 58%, from 5.0 victimizations per 1,000 females age 12 or older to 2.1 per 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/female-victims-sexual-violence-1994-2010|title=Female Victims of Sexual Violence, 1994-2010}} JournalistsResource.org, retrieved March 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berzofsky|first1=Marcus|last2=Krebs|first2=Christopher|last3=Langton|first3=Lynn|last4=Planty|first4=Michael|last5=Smiley-McDonald|first5=Hope|date=March 7, 2013|title=Female Victims of Sexual Violence, 1994-2010|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=4594|journal=Bureau of Justice Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study in 2013 regarding rape in the United States found that cases remain underreported.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2013"&gt;National Research Council. ''Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault.'' Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement in the United States also manipulates rape statistics to "create the illusion of success in fighting violent crime" according to a 2014 study.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Yung, C. R. (2014). How to Lie with Rape Statistics: America's Hidden Rape Crisis. Iowa Law Review, 99(1197).&lt;/ref&gt; When investigated, defendants are rarely convicted.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Sexual assault ===
[[File:A country comparison of rape and sexual assault rate trends, per 100000 people, 2003 - 2011, United Nations.png|thumb|250x250px|Annual rape and all forms of [[Sexual assault|sexual assaults]] per 100,000 people]]
Sexual assault differs significantly from other crimes of [[assault]]. For [[sexual assault]], the severity of the crime has been determined by establishing the victim's [[moral character]], [[behavior]], signs of resistance and verbal expressions of non-consensual participation. The crime of battery, another type of assault, is determined by the perpetrators actions and intent. The victim's response to this type of assault does not determine whether a crime has taken place or not. The victim does not have to demonstrate that they resisted, gave consent or have a history of being punched.&lt;ref name="Tracy" /&gt; In addition, the question of assault occurring after consent is given complicates the understanding of violence and injury - even if sex is consensual. Changes in the laws regarding some sexual acts may "lead to the glorification of sexual violence".&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, C. (2000) ‘Sex is Not a Sport: Consent and Violence in Criminal Law’, ''Boston College Law Review'', 42, 239–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Objectification ====
A 2015 study by the [[University of Nebraska]] found that college women in the United States who were victims of sexual violence or partner violence began to [[Self-objectification|self-objectificate]] themselves and felt body shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=26 March 2015|title=Violence Against Women; Studies from University of Nebraska Yield New Information about Violence Against Women (Violence Against Women through the Lens of Objectification Theory)|url=|journal=Women's Health Weekly|volume=|pages=274|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[European colonization of the Americas|days of European colonization]], Europeans who arrived sought to control Native American populations in order to acquire more capital and resources from the newly discovered land. This resulted in policies of genocide and removal targeting Native American women and girls in order to procure land for settlements.&lt;ref name="Volscho, Thomas W 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World|last=Stannard|first=David E.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records have shown that Native American girls as young as eleven years-old had [[Hysterectomy|hysterectomies]] operations performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vincenti Carpio|first=Myla|date=2004|title=The Lost Generation: American Indian Women and Sterilization Abuse|url=|journal=[[Social Justice (journal)|Social Justice]]|volume=31|issue=4|pages=40-53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding African Americans, the origin of their population control was from the [[slavery in the United States]].&lt;ref name="Volscho, Thomas W 2010" /&gt; During the period of slave trade in the United States, African slaves were used as a [[mode of production]], with slave women being forced into pregnancy to increase the slave labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Racism: From Slavery to Advanced Capitalism|last=Wilson|first=Carter A.|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|year=1996|isbn=|location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]]|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This history of controlling African American populations motivated the future sterilization of African American women.&lt;ref name="Volscho, Thomas W 2010" /&gt;

In 1927, [[Supreme Court of the United States]] endorsed eugenics programs in the country. The ruling pushed the eugenics movement further and resulted in more forced sterilizations of women.&lt;ref name="Kuhl2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UGYfRv3DWuQC&amp;pg=PA70|title=The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism|author=Kühl, Stefan|date=14 February 2002|isbn=978-0-19-534878-1|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Involuntary euthanasia]] was also supported by American eugenists and practiced in rare instances, with the most promoted method of euthanasia being [[Gas chamber|gas chambers]], though it never gained footing in the United States and sterilization became preference.&lt;ref name="Kuhl2" /&gt;

[[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] penned:&lt;ref name="Kuhl2" /&gt;

== Demographics ==
=== Native Americans ===

Native American and Alaska Native women experience high rates of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ihs.gov/womenshealth/violenceprevention/|title=Intimate Partner Violence|last=|first=|date=|work=Indian Health Service, The Federal Health Program for American Indians and Alaska Natives|access-date=2018-05-14|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These acts of violence include sexual assault, domestic violence, and [[sex trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/ovw/blog/recognizing-national-day-awareness-missing-and-murdered-native-women-and-girls|title=Recognizing the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of Justice found that 84% of Native American and Alaskan Native women have suffered some form of violence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nij.gov/journals/277/Pages/violence-against-american-indians-alaska-natives.aspx|title=Violence Against American Indian and Alaska Native Women and Men|website=National Institute of Justice|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 56%  have experienced sexual violence. Out of these, more than 90% were assaulted by a non-tribal member. These women report not being safe, and being pushed, shoved, or beaten. Many describe 'psychological aggression' and control. These counts may be underestimated. Native tribal courts are not able to prosecute non-tribal members for sexual assault and rape. Non-Native American men are responsible for most of the assaults against Native American women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hcn.org/articles/tribal-affairs-why-native-american-women-still-have-the-highest-rates-of-rape-and-assault|title=Why Native American women still have the highest rates of rape and assault|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological aggression has been experienced by 66.4% by their partner. In the US, greater than 1.5 million American Indian and Alaska Native women have suffered violence during their life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Over 39% of American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in the past year. Of these, 14% percent were sexually abused,  9% were assaulted by their intimate partner, 12% were stalked and 25% experienced psychological aggression by their intimate partner. In the past year, over 730,000 American Indian and Alaska Native women experienced violence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Intimate partner violence accounts for 47% of those murdered. Current intimate partners commit 81% of the murders and 12% are committed by a past intimate partner. Jealousy, arguments and preceding violent acts occur before the murder 66% of the time. Human trafficking of Native American Women and Alaska Native women is thought to also occur, but studies and statistics are lacking.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indianz.com/News/2017/07/24/report-confirms-native-women-suffer-from.asp|title=Report confirms Native women suffer from high rate of homicide in United States|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2017|website=|publisher=Indianz.com, by Ho-Chunk Inc. and the Winnebago Tribe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When compared to other ethnicities, Native American women experience sexual assault and rape rates that are 2.5 higher. Though the Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized in 2013, most tribes struggle to fund jails, courts, jails, law enforcement, judges, and prevention programs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Statistics are lacking for violence against Native American women who reside on reservations. Data is unknown because no agency collects such  information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/userfiles/file/Violence%20Against%20AI%20AN%20Women%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|title=The Facts on Violence Against American Indian/Alaskan Native Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Futures Without Violence|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigrants ===
Immigrants to the US have great difficulties when they try to leave violent relationships. If a perpetrator controls the immigration status, they can then use the threat of deportation to prevent the battered woman from contacting authorities and assistance agencies. Some legislation passed by the US Congress allowed immigrant victims to leave situations of domestic violence. Other proposed policies not yet in effect are designed to stop deportation of immigrants who have experienced domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[File:Vice President Biden Speaks on Reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.webm|thumb|Then-[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]], who originally drafted VAWA, speaking about the Act]]
On September 13, 1994, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which was drafted by [[U.S. Senator|Senator]] [[Joe Biden]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Delaware|DE]]) and co-written by Democrat [[Louise Slaughter]]. The Act granted $1.6 billion of funding for investigating and prosecuting violent crimes directed towards women, making compensation from those convicted automatic and mandatory. VAWA was accepted by [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] with bipartisan support, though House [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] attempted to cut down on funding in 1995.&lt;ref name="wp-funding"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/18605326.html?dids=18605326:18605326&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+15%2C+1995&amp;author=Kenneth+J.+Cooper&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=House+GOP+Budget+Cutters+Try+to+Limit+Domestic+Violence+Programs|title=House GOP Budget Cutters Try to Limit Domestic Violence Programs|last=Cooper|first=Kenneth|date=July 15, 1995|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=April 19, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724235532/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/18605326.html?dids=18605326:18605326&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+15%2C+1995&amp;author=Kenneth+J.+Cooper&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=House+GOP+Budget+Cutters+Try+to+Limit+Domestic+Violence+Programs|archivedate=July 24, 2012|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; VAWA created the [[Office on Violence Against Women]], part of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

In 2005, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] expressed that "VAWA is one of the most effective pieces of legislation enacted to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It has dramatically improved the law enforcement response to violence against women and has provided critical services necessary to support women in their struggle to overcome abusive situations".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|title=ACLU Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Regarding the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. 1197|date=July 27, 2005|publisher=ACLU|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222130005/https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|archivedate=December 22, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
In 2011, the [[United Nations]] [[Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women|Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women]], [[Rashida Manjoo]], reported progress in regards to violence towards women in the United States, though she also made recommendations regarding African and Native Americans, immigrants, military personnel and those who are imprisoned.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11621">'''Wall Street Reform''' or '''Financial Reform''' refers to reform of the financial industry and the [[Bank regulation in the United States|regulation]] of the financial industry in the [[United States]]. [[Wall Street]] is the home of the country's two largest [[stock exchange]]s, and "Wall Street" is a [[metonym]] for the American financial sector. Major Wall Street reform bills include the [[Federal Reserve Act]] of 1913, the [[Glass-Steagall Act]] of 1933, the [[Truth in Lending Act]] of 1968, the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977, the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999, and the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]]. The most recent Wall Street reform bill, the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], was signed by [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] on July 22, 2010, following a [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]].

== The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 ==
The [[Glass-Steagall Act]] of 1933 placed a "wall of separation" between banks and brokerages, which was largely repealed by the [[Financial Services Modernization Act]] of 1999.  The bill was enacted during the [[Great Depression]], which began with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].  The [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999 repealed the "wall of separation," allowing companies to simultaneously act as [[commercial bank]]s, [[investment bank]]s, and [[insurance company|insurance companies]].  Though some commentators regard the restoration of the 1933 bill as crucial, even calling it "the most vital element of Wall Street reform",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/martens03262010.html|title=The Most Vital Ingredient in Wall Street Reform Goes Missing|author=Pam Martens|date=2010-03-26|publisher=CounterPunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; House Democratic leaders refused to allow an amendment by Rep. [[Maurice Hinchey]] (D-NY) to restore Glass-Steagall as part of the 2009 Frank bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20100111/scheer2|title=McCain Gets It, Obama Doesn't|author=Robert Scheer|publisher=The Nation|date=2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hinchey introduced his proposal as a separate bill, the Glass-Steagall Restoration Act of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.4375:|title=[Text of H.R. 4375]|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the "Volcker rule" proposed by the Obama administration has been described as a "new Glass-Steagall Act for the 21st century", as it establishes stringent rules against banks using their own money to make risky investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/21/obama-banks-wall-street-reform|title=Obama announces dramatic crackdown on Wall Street banks: Obama's 'new Glass-Steagall Act' will prevent banks with customer deposits taking risky investment bets|author=Jill Treanor|publisher=The Guardian|date=2010-01-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ==
The [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], by Sen. [[Paul S. Sarbanes]] ([[Democratic Party of the United States|D]]-[[Maryland|MD]]) and Rep. [[Michael G. Oxley]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Ohio|OH]]), was signed into law by [[George W. Bush]] in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/july02/b_ethics.html |title=Wall Street reform |date=August 2002 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617084215/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/july02/b_ethics.html |archivedate=June 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c107:H.R.3763:|title=[Text of H.R. 3763 (6 versions)]|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was enacted as a reaction to a number of major [[accounting scandals|corporate and accounting scandals]] including those affecting [[Enron]] and [[WorldCom]].

== Dodd-Frank (2010)==
{{Main|Obama financial regulatory reform plan of 2009}}

As of May 2010, both the House and Senate bills had been passed, but the differences between the bills were to be worked out in [[United States congressional conference committee]]. Differences which must be resolved include:&lt;ref&gt;Indiviglio D. (2010). [https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/05/the-conference-challenges-congress-faces-for-financial-reform/57241/ The Conference Challenges Congress Faces for Financial Reform]. ''The Atlantic''.&lt;/ref&gt;  whether the new consumer protection agency would be independent (Senate) or part of the [[Federal Reserve]];  whether to require banks to issue [[credit derivative]]s in separately capitalized [[subsidiary|affiliate]]s (Senate); how exactly the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) will wind down or bail out large institutions which fail; the circumstances under which large institutions could be broken up; a 15 to 1 leverage limit in the House bill; the terms of a Fed audit (continuous as in the House bill or one-time as in the Senate bill); both bills include the Volcker rule which prohibits [[proprietary trading]] by bank holding companies, but both have a caveat which allow for regulators to overrule the rule; both bills propose to regulate [[credit rating agencies]], but the Senate's bill is much stronger.

=== House bill ===
H.R. 4173, the [[Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2009 by Rep. [[Barney Frank]] ([[Democratic Party of the United States|D]]-[[Massachusetts|MA]]), passed by the House of Representatives in December 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.4173:|title=[Text of H.R. 4173 (3 versions)]|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and awaiting action by the Senate as of April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/show|title=H.R.4173 - Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009|publisher=OpenCongress.org|accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/18/barney-frank-vs-the-credi_n_397404.html|title=Barney Frank Vs.

=== Senate bill ===
{{Further|Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010}}
[[S.3217]] was introduced by [[Senate Banking Committee]] chairman [[Chris Dodd]] ([[Democratic Party of the United States|D]]-[[Connecticut|CT]]) on April 15, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.3217:|title=[Text of S.3217]|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dodd's bill included a $50 billion liquidation fund which drew criticism as a continuing bailout, which he was pressured to remove by Republicans and the Obama administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/17/white-house-signals-shift-on-wall-street-reform/|title=White House signals shift on Wall Street reform|date=2010-04-17|author=CNN Senior White House Correspondent [[Ed Henry]]|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Senate bill passed on May 20, 2010.

=== Volcker Rule ===
{{Further|Volcker Rule}}
The "Volcker Rule" was proposed by President [[Barack Obama]] based on advice by [[Paul Volcker]], and a draft of the proposed legislation was prepared by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]].  It limited any one bank from holding more than 10% of FDIC-insured deposits, and prohibited any bank with a division holding such deposits from using its own capital to make speculative investments.  The Volcker rule faced heavy resistance in the Senate and was introduced as part of the subsequent Dodd bill only in a limited form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703503804575083823511212204|title='Volcker Rule' Stalls in Senate|publisher=Wall Street Journal|author=Damian Palmetta|date=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6224B920100303|title=Obama reasserts Volcker rule|author1=Kevin Drawbaugh  |author2=Karey Wutkowski |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2010-03-03|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62E5IZ20100315|title=Factbox: Key elements of Dodd's financial reform bill|publisher=Reuters|date=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial Stability Oversight Council ===

Chaired by the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], a new multi-authority oversight body called the Financial Stability Oversight Council of regulators will be established. The council will consist of nine members including regulators from the [[Federal Reserve System]], [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]], and many other agencies.  The main purpose of the council is to identify risk in the [[Financial system]]. Also, the council will look at the interconnectivity of the highly leveraged financial firms and can ask companies to divest holdings if their structure poses a great threat to the Financial system. The council will have a solid control on the operations of the leveraged firms and also help in increasing the transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-15/congressional-overhaul-maps-the-future-of-financial-regulation.html|title='Congressional Overhaul Maps the Future of Financial Regulation'|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|author1=David Scheer |author2=Gregory Mott |author3=Lawrence Roberts |date=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wall Street Reform Plan (2016) for a new 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act ==

In 2016, 170 Economists, Financial Experts, and Academics Back Bernie Sanders' Wall Street Reform Plan. In the letter supporting Bernie Sander's Financial Reform Plan &lt;ref&gt;[https://berniesanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wall-St-Letter-1.pdf], Economists and Financial Experts in Favor of Sen. Sanders' Wall St. Reforms&lt;/ref&gt;

''"In our view, Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan for comprehensive financial reform is critical for avoiding another "too-big-to-fail" financial crisis. The Senator is correct that the biggest banks must be broken up and that a new 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, separating investment from commercial banking, must be enacted.
Wall Street's largest banks are now far bigger than they were before the crisis, and they still have every incentive to take excessive risks. No major Wall Street executive has been indicted for the fraudulent behavior that led up to the 2008 crash, and fines imposed on the banks have been only a fraction of the banks' potential gains. In addition, the banks and their lobbyists have succeeded in watering down the Dodd-Frank reform legislation, and the financial institutions that pose the greatest risk to our economy have still not devised sufficient "living wills" for winding down their operations in the event of another crisis.
Secretary Hillary Clinton's more modest proposals do not go far enough. They call for a bit more oversight and a few new charges on shadow banking activity, but they leave intact the titanic financial conglomerates that practice most shadow banking. As a result, her plan does not adequately reduce the serious risks our financial system poses to the American economy and to individual Americans. Given the size and political power of Wall Street, her proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain Wall Street's excesses is with reforms sufficiently bold and public they can't be watered down. That's why we support Senator Sanders' plans for busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting a modernized version of Glass Steagall."''

[[File:Public Garbage Bin in Nacka.jpg|thumb|Public waste container in Sweden]]
A '''waste container''' is a [[container]] for temporarily storing waste, and is usually made out of [[metal]] or [[plastic]]. Some common terms are '''dustbin'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.csb.gov.hk/hkgcsb/glossary/glossary_search_en.php?search_name1=dustbin&lt;/ref&gt;, '''garbage can''', and '''trash can'''. The words "rubbish", "basket" and "bin" are more common in British English usage; "trash" and "can" are more common in American English usage.  "Garbage" may refer to [[food waste]] specifically (when distinguished from "trash") or to [[municipal solid waste]] in general. In 1875, the first household rubbish bins were introduced in Britain to create a regulated system of collection.

== Public waste collection ==
In many cities and towns, there is a public waste collection service which regularly collects household waste from outside buildings etc. This will be loaded into a [[garbage truck]] and driven to a [[landfill]], [[incinerator]] or crush facility to be disposed of. Household waste containers are usually either: 
* trash cans, receptacles made of metal or plastic
* wheelie bins, light, mobile plastic bins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smyth|first1=Sara|title=Councils to reduce size of wheelie bins by almost half for 6 million households in bid to cut expenses and meet recycling targets|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2539639/Councils-reduce-size-wheelie-bins-50-6million-households-bid-cut-expenses-meet-recycling-targets.html|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=Mail Online [[Daily Mail]]|publisher=Associated Newspapers|date=15 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922002050/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2539639/Councils-reduce-size-wheelie-bins-50-6million-households-bid-cut-expenses-meet-recycling-targets.html|archivedate=22 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, each household has multiple bins for different categories of rubbish (usually represented by colours) depending on its suitability for [[recycling]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling/ "Rubbish and recycling"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612123209/http://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling |date=2016-06-12 }}, ccc.govt.nz&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial roadside waste containers are often larger [[Dumpster|dumpsters]] or [[skip (container)|skip]]s.

== Public litter bins ==

[[File:Taiwan 2009 Taipei Waste Containers throughout Liberty Plaza with National Theater in background FRD 7440.jpg|thumb|170px|Waste containers at the [[National Theater and Concert Hall, Republic of China|National Theater]] in [[Taipei City|Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]]]

Public areas, such as [[parks]], often have [[litter]] bins placed to improve the [[social environment]] by encouraging people not to [[littering|litter]]. Such bins in outdoor locations or other busy [[public]] areas are usually mounted to the ground or wall to discourage [[theft]], and reduce [[vandalism]], and to [[beautification|improve their appearance]] are sometimes deliberately artistic or cute. In dense urban areas, trash is stored underground below the receptacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shendruk |first1=Amanada |title=Could NYC solve its trash problem with underground trash cans? |url=https://qz.com/1329108/sensor-enabled-trash-bins-could-help-nyc-solve-its-waste-problem/ |accessdate=5 September 2018 |work=[[Quartz (publication)]] |date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some trash cans have plastic bags to help contain liquids.

== Metaphors ==
[[File:International tidyman.svg|thumb|upright|International symbol "Tidyman" used on packaging to remind people to dispose of it in a bin instead of [[littering]]]]
The term "garbage can" is also used for a model of decision making, the "[[Garbage Can Model]]" of decision making. It is concerned with cases of decision making in great aggregate uncertainty which can cause decisions to arise that from a distant point of view might seem irrational. 

A "[[Recycle bin (computing)|trash can]]" metaphor is often used in computer operating system desktop environments as a place files can be moved for deletion. 

In a workplace setting, a bin may be euphemistically called "the [[circular file]]", "the [[File 13|round file]]" or "the janitor's file".  Whereas useful documents are filed in a [[filing cabinet]], which is rectangular, junk mail and other worthless items are "filed" in the bin, which is often round.
